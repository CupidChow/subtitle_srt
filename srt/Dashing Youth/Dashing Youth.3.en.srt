00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,500
I'm going to return the favor.

191
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,100
As soon as I draw my spear,

192
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,820
run as fast as you can!

193
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,580
Run!

194
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,340
I won't.

195
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,020
Liuli!

196
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,100
Idiots.

197
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,500
You got it wrong.

198
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,020
Bai!

199
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,340
- Well...
- Look at that!

200
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,060
Run!

♪The spring wind blows past
the tavern's rickety windows♪

202
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,220

206
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,580
After hiding for so many days,

207
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,460
it's time for you

208
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,620
to show what you've got.

209
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,180
I knew it.

210
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,260
It's really him.

211
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,900
A horned white serpent

212
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,660
that is ten zhang long.

213
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
This serpent

214
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,220
is Bai Liuli kept

215
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,820
by the master of the Wen Family,
Wen Lin.

216
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,420
Your surname is not Bai.

217
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,820
You're from the Wen Family.

218
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,860
Your surname is Wen.

219
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,500
You're Wen Dongjun!

220
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,460
That's an awful name.

221
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,700
Liuli grew up with me.

222
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,140
My grandfather gave it to me

223
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,260
when I was born.

224
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,100
Also,

225
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,260
my surname is not Wen.

226
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,420
It's Baili.

227
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,980
My name is Baili Dongjun.

228
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,940
[Baili Dongjun,]
He's from the Baili Family?

229
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,940
[Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion]
He looks so fearless.

230
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,700
So of course,

231
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,020
it must be Marquis of Zhenxi,

232
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,940
Baili Luochen's family.

233
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,060
His grandfather

234
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,780
fought in war
alongside His Majesty himself.

235
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,300
That would be Marquis of Zhenxi,
Baili Luochen,

236
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,900
who had killed thousands of enemies.

237
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,780
And his father, Baili Chengfeng,

238
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,300
is known for
his exceptional sword skills.

239
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,300
His mother is the most favored daughter
of the Wen Family's master,

240
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,820
Wen Lin, who is a renowned
poison physician.

241
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,100
Her name is Wen Luoyu.

242
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,500
As for his uncle, Wen Hujiu, he is
also known for his knowledge of poisons.

243
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,020
That is

244
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,300
the one and only Baili Family

245
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,820
and there's none other quite like them.

246
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,780
So, am I qualified

247
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,900
to be your guest?

248
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,060
See?

249
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,020
I knew this was going

250
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,780
to be more interesting than we expected.

251
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,100
Perhaps the Dark River

252
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,500
won't get to join this round.

253
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,620
I guess it's a good thing, though.

254
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,620
Isn't that Bai Liuli,

255
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,220
the Wen Family's serpent?

256
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,180
Why is Bai Dongjun standing on its head?

257
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,740
I thought Poison Deity Wen

258
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,900
gave it to his most favored grandson

259
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,460
a long time ago?

260
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,260
That means

261
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,500
Bai Dongjun isn't who he truly is.

262
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,180
He's actually the young master
of Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion,

263
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,900
Baili Dongjun.

264
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,580
Luo Xuan,

265
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,980
what should we do?

266
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,700
If Marquis of Zhenxi learns about this,

267
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
would be send his troops

268
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,820
and crush the Lei Fortress

269
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,540
into smithereens?

270
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,180
I'm doomed!

271
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,100
They're here.

272
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,900
Who?

273
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,380
That's awesome.

274
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:16,980
Luo Xuan.

275
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,060
Later on, you and Liu Yue

276
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,260
can deal with the things here

277
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,220
while Xiaohei and I

278
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,500
move the coffin inside.

279
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,780
Why the plan, though?

280
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,660
Because the both of you

281
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,900
are too dashing.

282
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,980
If you go inside,

283
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,700
you'll steal my spotlight.

284
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,500
Young Lady.

285
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
That kid.

286
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,860
Why has he come to Chaisang?

287
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,700
Sir, what should we do?

288
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,700
There's only one thing we have to do.

289
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,300
What?

290
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,140
Retreat.

291
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,900
Got it.

292
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,380
- Run!
- Run!

293
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,860
It turns out you're the young master
from the Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion.

294
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,780
Welcome to my humble abode.
Sorry for the poor hospitality.

295
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,300
Please forgive me.

296
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,300
I'm here to kidnap the bride.

297
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,700
If you're actually welcoming me,

298
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,140
how am I going to do that?

299
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,700
So,

300
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,660
are you guys going to kill me?

301
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,860
Today is my sister's wedding day.

302
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,820
I have a few questions

303
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,940
for you, Young Master Baili.

304
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,940
May I?

305
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,660
Go ahead.

306
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,020
You said that you wanted
to kidnap the bride.

307
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,900
May I ask

308
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,980
if you know my sister?

309
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,900
Not really.

310
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,580
Does that mean you're
her secret admirer?

311
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,740
I have someone else in my heart

312
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,980
that your sister can't even
hold a candle to.

313
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,820
Come on.

314
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,180
Is this the right time

315
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,300
to show your dream girl off?

316
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,620
You have a point.

317
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,300
Young Master, you come
from a renowned family.

318
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,060
Marquis of Zhenxi is a hero of Beili

319
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,100
for his achievements

320
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,340
in the battlefield.

321
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,340
We have immense respect

322
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,060
for people from the Marquis's Mansion.

323
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,100
If you're here

324
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,300
to attend the wedding,

325
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,340
I would gladly welcome you
as our noble guest.

326
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,700
However,

327
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,180
you don't know my sister.

328
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,860
And you're not her secret admirer.

329
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,500
Yet you're saying
that you're here to kidnap the bride.

330
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,180
Don't you think you've gone too far?

331
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,340
Looks like

332
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,900
you are not in the right.

333
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,500
I'm here to kidnap the bride,

334
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,540
but not for myself.

335
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,780
What do you mean?

336
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,860
I mean,

337
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,380
the person who wants the bride...

338
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,100
is here.

339
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,860
It's a coffin!

340
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,660
A coffin?

341
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,220
No one can do this!

342
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,420
Exactly.

343
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,060
Gu Luoli?

344
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,180
That's right.

345
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,940
He's the one
who's here to kidnap the bride.

346
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,580
Gu Luoli, the former master
of the Gu Family,

347
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,660
was Miss Yan's

348
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,420
childhood friend.

349
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,940
He had always doted on her.

350
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,300
And Miss Yan

351
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,580
has always been in love with him.

352
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,100
Isn't it right for him

353
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,140
to come for the bride,

354
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,420
since you mentioned rightness?

355
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,900
Presumptuous!

356
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,860
He's dead!

357
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,980
But if not for you,

358
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,900
how would he have died?

359
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,780
Why don't you ask
for my opinion first, Bietian?

360
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,820
I, Yan Liuli,

361
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,660
am willing to marry Gu Luoli!

362
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,380
You heard her?

363
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,340
In the eyes of a lover,

364
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,140
he's still the same nonetheless.

365
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,420
No matter what becomes of him,

366
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,940
as long as it's him,

367
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,820
his existence is unique

368
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,780
and valuable to her.

369
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,300
Baili Dongjun.

370
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,420
Will you celebrate my wedding...

371
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,420
with him today?

372
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,140
Of course.

373
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,260
Why not?

374
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,580
Cheers.

375
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,340
This liquor isn't good enough, though.

376
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,220
You should have ordered
from me in advance.

377
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,740
I could have given you a discount.

378
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,820
Kill him!

379
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,740
He's trying to kill

380
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,140
Young Master Baili

381
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,580
and pin the blame on the Gu Family!

382
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,660
Mr. Yan.

383
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,220
You know nothing

384
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,020
about Marquis of Zhenxi's Family's
patterns.

385
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,780
And you don't know

386
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,180
my patterns.

387
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,260
You must be mad.

388
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,300
According to the law,

389
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,420
you'd have to be beheaded.

390
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,540

402
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,260
The Yan Family who runs the jade shop

403
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,380
and the Gu Family who owns the bank,

404
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,380
Are you sure you want to kill

405
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,740
the young master
from Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion?

406
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,140
I now ask the crowd
from Xinan Circuit here,

407
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,060
are you their accomplices?

408
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,260
There isn't a crowd here anymore.

409
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:34,860
There's only a few left.

410
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,820
They've all run away.

411
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,540
Shut up.

412
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,100
I've been observing the fight
at Longshou Street.

413
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,620
This kid

414
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,780
is an innate martial artist.

415
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,580
Did you know about this, Young Lady?

416
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,100
Indeed.

417
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,420
I have met him before.

418
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,060
An innate martial artist.

419
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,180
Then, why did you...

420
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,900
I have my considerations.

421
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,900
Elder Chen,

422
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,180
are you doubting me?

423
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,460
I wouldn't dare.

424
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,380
But, Young Lady,

425
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,100
we'd better not miss

426
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,860
this good opportunity.

427
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,700
As the Yan and Gu Families fight,

428
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,220
both of them are bound to suffer losses.

429
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,380
Even with the Eight Young Masters
of Beili around,

430
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,860
after this fight,

431
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,900
all of them

432
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,340
won't have much energy left.

433
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,500
Why don't we sneak in

434
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,140
when the battle is about to end

435
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,980
and take away

436
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,260
that innate martial artist there?

437
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,980
What about our agreement
with the Yan Family?

438
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,380
Only the strong

439
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,420
get to set the rules

440
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
and the weak

441
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,180
should have the awareness
to be given up.

442
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,380
Moreover,

443
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,180
we lost the coffin

444
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,020
together with the power

445
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,380
to make the Yan Family do our bidding.

446
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,340
Under such circumstances,

447
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,460
I cannot fathom

448
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,820
how the Yan Family

449
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,020
can be more important
than the innate martial artist.

450
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,460
You're right, Elder Chen.

451
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,100
We'll do as he says.

452
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,700
Yes.

453
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,220
Why does it seem that we suddenly

454
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,420
have nothing to do with this anymore?

455
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,540
It has never

456
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,900
had anything to do with us.

457
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,340
Fifth Uncle.

458
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,380
Before today,

459
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,140
I've been telling myself

460
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,940
that you're my father's brother,

461
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,860
as well as my brother's uncle and mine.

462
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,140
What are you saying?

463
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,540
I am

464
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,780
your uncle.

465
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,980
That's why I was afraid
that the family would fall

466
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,380
after your brother's death.

467
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,980
So I carefully selected

468
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,340
the perfect lady for you.

469
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,220
Fine.

470
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,300
Let me ask you this.

471
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,180
Didn't you say that my brother

472
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,060
died of an illness?

473
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,100
You said he was seriously ill and died
in a place that is far away from home.

474
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,900
You said he was buried on the spot

475
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,460
to prevent the disease from spreading.

476
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,420
Then, what do you have to say

477
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,340
about my brother's corpse here?

478
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,820
What do you have to say

479
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,140
about the sword cuts on his body?

480
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,140
You

481
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,660
call this

482
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,340
an illness?

483
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,740
His death sounds suspicious.

484
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,420
Exactly.

485
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,340
Li Suli!

486
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,980
Gu Jianmen, stop this madness!

487
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,780
This is our Gu Family's mansion.

488
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,340
I am Gu Jianmen of the Gu Family.

489
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,780
Why should I stop?

490
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,100
The Gu Family

491
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,060
was born in a perilous situation and
then has thrived for three generations.

492
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,500
We have always been
number one in Xinan Circuit,

493
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,580
second to none!

494
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,980
Why did my brother

495
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,740
became the master of the family

496
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,100
at the age of sixteen?

497
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,100
He overcame countless challenges

498
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,220
and worked his fingers to the bone.

499
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,100
As for me,

500
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,780
why did I leave for Tianqi
at a young age

501
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,300
to learn skills?

502
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,700
Why did our Gu Family

503
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,700
rise to fame
for our merchanting businesses,

504
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,340
but still use the martial skills
to save our reputation?

505
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,340
For we

506
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,940
do not want to compromise.

507
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,380
We don't compromise with anyone.

508
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,460
We don't compromise on anything.

509
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,100
Fifth Uncle.

510
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,820
You are not fit to be
part of the Gu Family.

511
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,780
How dare you!

512
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,820
Do you think

513
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,420
you're still
under your brother's protection?

514
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,260
You're wrong.

515
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,460
It's been a long time

516
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,500
since I needed his protection.

517
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,060
Someone, take him down!

518
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,420
Why are you all standing there?

519
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,740
Take him down!

520
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,260
Do you think the Gu Family

521
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,580
really obeys you?

522
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,860
Some people

523
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,460
are born to be the master of the family

524
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,420
because they are born

525
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,540
with the aura
that compels people to follow them.

526
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,940
That's how my brother was.

527
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,300
As for me,

528
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,700
I will now inherit

529
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,020
my brother's will.

530
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,740
Fellow members
of the Gu Family, listen up!

531
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,420
The current master of the family,
Gu Luoli, had been murdered.

532
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,900
We shall avenge his death

533
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,300
until the very end!

534
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,820
- Avenge his death till the end!
- Avenge his death till the end!

535
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,540
You traitors.

536
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,860
You traitors!

537
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,140
The traitor has been disposed of.

538
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,260
Time to get rid of our enemies!

539
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,740
You think the few of you

540
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,900
can kill me?

541
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,260
I was sure

542
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,580
I was in the spotlight earlier.

543
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,220
Why is he

544
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,420
getting all the limelight now?

545
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,180
All you have

546
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,260
is your family's reputation.

547
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,140
And as for him,

548
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,060
look.

549
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,100
He relies on his sword.

550
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,380
I'm almost losing.

551
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,340
Aren't you going to show yourself?

552
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,540
It's the Gu Family's
Military Aura Sword.

553
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,140
Gu Jianmen.

554
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,580
Since this is the case,

555
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,260
we'll fight until one of us dies!

556
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,580
No need for any thanks.

557
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,220
We're friends.

558
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,620
Thank you, Young Master Baili,

559
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,460
and thank you, the spear-wielder.

560
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,700
Don't mention it.

561
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,580
It's you again.

562
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,900
Yes, it's me again.

563
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,180
Why is there another batch of people?

564
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,020
He really has the innate gift
of cultivating martial arts.

565
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,180
Get him!

566
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,860
Sikong Changfeng!

567
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,660
No one can save you today.

568
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,620
Who dares touch my nephew?

569
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,060
Who's there?

570
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:52,100
[I'll poison you to death]

571
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,380
It turns out it's Wen Hujiu
from the Wen Family.

572
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,140
You're right,

573
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,500
but you don't get a reward.

574
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,020
[Wen Hujiu,]
Instead,

575
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,540
[The Bodhisattva of Poison,]
you might just

576
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,260
[Wen Family]
die.

577
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,860
You despicable scoundrel.

578
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,860
You actually poison me?

579
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,140
That was

580
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,140
a hilarious statement.

581
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,340
Stopping someone from the Wen Family
from using poison

582
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,540
is the same as stopping a swordsman
from using a sword.

583
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,980
That would be plain foul play.

584
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,140
Who's next?

585
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,260
Retreat!

586
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,220
They're leaving just like that?

587
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,180
Uncle.

588
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,500
Baili, are you hurt?

589
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,420
I'm fine, Uncle.

590
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,300
What brings you here?

591
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,340
What do you think?

592
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,420
Your family knew
that you'd only listen to me,

593
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,780
so they sent me to bring you back home.

594
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,540
Fortunately, I came here,

595
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,940
or else you'd have been abducted.

596
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,140
What kind of weird friends

597
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,580
have you got here?

598
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,980
How would I know?

599
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,460
Maybe my liquor

600
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,380
is awesome.

601
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,540
Had enough fun today?

602
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,820
It feels like I've just tasted

603
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,060
the first note
of an exquisite bottle of liquor.

604
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,100
What do you think?

605
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,180
Naughty boy.

606
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,780
Baili,

607
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,500
let me see.

608
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,260
Come on.

609
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,060
Everyone,

610
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,620
you're as amazing as the rumors go.

611
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,020
- Mr. Wen.
- Mr. Wen.

612
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,820
My nephew has caused you much trouble.

613
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,580
Uncle, you were late.
You didn't see what happened.

614
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,580
I did them

615
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,140
a huge favor.

616
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,340
Indeed.

617
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,900
Young Master Baili
is both brave and resourceful.

618
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,500
He's like a celestial soldier
from the skies...

619
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,460
Mr. Zhuomo.

620
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,020
We're in a rush.

621
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,620
Please don't speak now.

622
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,260
So, Mr. Gu,

623
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,300
how are you going
to deal with this today?

624
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,100
We have avenged my brother's death.

625
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,540
As for the rest...

626
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,580
That depends on
how the Yan Family will do.

627
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,940
Yan Bietian had no regard for justice

628
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,020
and had sowed discord
between our families.

629
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,940
He deserved to die.

630
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,620
From now on,

631
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,300
I, Yan Liuli, will become

632
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,980
the master of the the Yan Family!

633
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,180
Fellow members of the Yan Family,
do you have any objections?

634
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,780
If that's the case,

635
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,020
that's all for today's wedding.

636
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,100
The wedding will go on.

637
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,420
It's just

638
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,740
that I won't be marrying you.

639
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,460
I will marry...

640
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,100
him.

641
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,180
Interesting.

642
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,820
Now that our business here is done,

643
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,340
we'd like to take our leave.

644
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,380
Uncle.

645
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,420
Hey, Spear Deity.

646
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,220
Aren't you coming with us?

647
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,380
Young Lady.

648
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,940
The mission failed?

649
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,420
- We're sorry, Young Lady.
- We're sorry, Young Lady.

650
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,900
Where's Elder Chen?

651
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,460
We encountered Wen Hujiu
from the Wen Family.

652
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,100
And Elder Chen...

653
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,100
I understand.

654
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,580
Xin.

655
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,380
Let's go.

656
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,260
I thought

657
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,700
this was a dead city.

658
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,220
Of course not.

659
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,700
The Yan Family had been controlling

660
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,900
the areas near Gu's Mansion.

661
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,620
After everyone heard
about what happened earlier,

662
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,340
they finally feel safe enough

663
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,500
to come out and stroll around.

664
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,620
Uncle.

665
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,820
Bai

666
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,820
is following me on this trip.

667
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,100
It exerted a lot of strength earlier

668
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:38,940
and it's hurt.

669
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,620
It's resting at the tavern now.

670
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,540
Don't worry.

671
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,780
Someone will take it

672
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,780
back to the Wen Family

673
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,140
to recuperate.

674
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,140
I envy the close relationship

675
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,300
that the Eight Young Masters
of Beili share.

676
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,300
Don't you have a friend
like that yourself?

677
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,260
I had one.

678
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,820
Yun, you're so smart

679
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,780
and good at studying.

680
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,180
I'm sure you'll inherit
your family's legacy

681
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,460
and become a great general.

682
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,420
Why would I want to become a general?

683
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,220
When I grow up, I want to travel

684
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,500
around the martial arts world

685
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,100
and become a free swordsman

686
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,020
who brings justice to the people.

687
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,380
Take me with you!

688
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,740
Sure.

689
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,860
Let's make a promise.

690
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,820
What promise?

691
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,100
When I'm 20

692
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,260
and you're 18,

693
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,620
we'll leave Tianqi together.

694
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,540
One of us will head north
and the other will head south.

695
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,300
We'll travel
the martial arts world alone.

696
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,100
By the time we become deities,

697
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,820
that's when we'll meet again.

698
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,780
What say you?

699
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,500
Sure!

700
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,660
He's dead, though.

701
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,300
Dead?

702
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,700
We grew up together

703
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,620
in Tianqi.

704
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,420
He was the only son
from the General's Mansion

705
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,940
and I'm the sole grandson
from the Marquis's Mansion.

706
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,940
He could technically be my uncle,

707
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,700
but we're around the same age.

708
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,380
We were best friends.

709
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,060
I have one now, though.

710
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,660
Uncle.

711
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,980
There's something else

712
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,060
that I need your help.

713
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,740
[Qingsong Inn]

714
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,100
You probably want to ask me

715
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,980
why I didn't

716
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,980
take Baili Dongjun with me back then.

717
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,660
You speak my mind, Young Lady.

718
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,460
Back when Beique,

719
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,740
Western Chu

720
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,660
and Nanjue

721
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,740
attacked Beili together,

722
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,460
Nanjue suffered a resounding loss,

723
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,380
while Western Chu
and our Beique perished.

724
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,620
My father

725
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,300
brought us to Sky's Beyond to retreat

726
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,660
to cultivate and master the Xunian Art

727
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,900
so that we could rebuild our country.

728
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,900
Only by bringing
the innate martial artist back

729
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,980
to complete my father's cultivation

730
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,580
can we obtain the chance

731
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,100
to rebuild our country.

732
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,540
You probably saw today

733
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,740
that Baili Dongjun
may be an innate martial artist,

734
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,020
but he has no foundation
in martial arts.

735
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,420
That's why...

736
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,620
Indeed.

737
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,780
Xunian Art is a powerful skill.

738
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,780
Given that he has

739
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,820
no internal strength at all,

740
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,220
he might not be able to bear

741
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,700
the power of Xunian Art.

742
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,900
If he dies as a result,

743
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,060
Beique will lose

744
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,780
the only innate martial artist

745
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,780
that can save us.

746
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,020
Uncle, are you craving liquor?

747
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,620
But, I don't think we can finish

748
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,220
so many jars of liquor.

749
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,460
Well.

750
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,180
All you know is drinking.

751
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,180
This is not for drinking.

752
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,180
Then...

753
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,700
It's to save his life.

754
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,780
Kid,

755
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,540
you saved my nephew's life.

756
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,660
That's why

757
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,300
I will save yours.

758
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,780
Really?

759
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,700
It's been so many years.

760
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,140
I approached a bunch of people

761
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,780
and traveled near and far

762
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,820
to find a way to save my life.

763
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,020
Still...

764
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,340
I don't have a solution

765
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,220
that can fully cure you,

766
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,660
but I do have

767
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,660
temporary solutions.

768
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,860
Still, I do have a question.

769
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,300
How are you

770
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,180
still standing right now?

771
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,180
Almost there.

772
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,740
Sikong Changfeng?

773
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,660
Sikong Changfeng?

774
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,300
That fast?

775
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,660
He passed out right away.

776
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:18,740
Uncle.

777
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,860
What do you have

778
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,500
in here?

779
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,100
Floral clams, blood spiders,
three-tailed scorpions,

780
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:26,660
and centipedes...

781
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,300
Wait.

782
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,660
Why do you have

783
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,380
so many disgusting things with you?

784
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,580
You're the disgusting one here.

785
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,900
Your mother used
to take a bunch of them with her, too.

786
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,260
Just leave the room

787
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,260
and guard the door.

788
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,860
Don't let anyone come in.

789
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,580
Rest assured.

790
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,820
Two days later,

791
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,780
I will give you

792
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,620
a healthy and active Sikong Changfeng.

793
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,140
Go now.

794
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,700
Kid.

795
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:37,740
Why are you drinking

796
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,820
all alone outside your room?

797
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,540
My friend is receiving treatment inside.

798
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,580
He needs some peace.

799
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:44,940
You are...

800
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,020
That ghost?

801
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:50,700
Ghost?

802
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,700
That's the first time

803
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,820
I heard someone call him that.

804
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,700
Where we're from,

805
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,900
he's the coolest guy around.

806
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,620
I don't think he's
as good as me, though.

807
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,100
Sorry,

808
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,180
but thank you

809
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,380
for releasing us that day.

810
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,140
No worries.

811
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:20,940
Well, kid.

812
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,140
Let's meet some other day.

813
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,140
Farewell.

814
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,780
What a bunch of weirdos.
