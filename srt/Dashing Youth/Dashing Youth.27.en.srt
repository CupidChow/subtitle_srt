This is nice, right?

Ye,

00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,060

Elder Wangyou,

35
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,500
you have been living in Mount Muyun

36
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,060
and observing Tianqi City.

37
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,060
I have something

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,540
to ask you.

39
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,060
Are you trying to ask

40
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,620
the whereabouts of your companions?

41
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:32,900
Right.

42
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,140
I wanted to ask Prince Langya

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,180
but I couldn't swallow my pride,

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,380
so I didn't.

45
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,180
Afterward, I tried to ask around
during the journey,

46
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,220
but then I realized

47
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,980
no one knew

48
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,860
about the bride snatching

49
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,780
as if it had never happened.

50
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,740
As for your friends,

51
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,220
Luo Qingyang was taken away
by the Shadow Sect

52
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,100
and locked up.

53
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Nevertheless, he's the sect leader's

54
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,500
proudest disciple

55
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,060
as well as a future imperial guard

56
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,780

58
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,820
Mr. Yi

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,460
probably would release him.

60
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,620
It's just that maybe

61
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,940
he might be given
some agreements to comply with.

62
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,420
As for Baili Dongjun,

63
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,660
his father, Baili Chengfeng,

64
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,700
brought him back to Qiandong City
and grounded him,

65
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,100

66
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,500

67
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,020
However, as of now,

68
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,660
Sikong Changfeng

69
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,540
has already left Qiandong City

70
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,340
and is roaming around for training.

71
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,180
I thought you would only know

72
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,940
what happened to them in Tianqi City.

73
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,140
To my surprise,

74
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,380
you are even well aware

75
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,700
of their whereabouts afterward.

76
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,180
It's birds on the trees told me.

77
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,860
That's true.

78
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,100
Master speaks to birds.

79
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,860
No.

80
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,300
Not just birds,

81
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,900
but also fowls, beasts,

82
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,420
insects, fish, flowers, and weeds.

83
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,980
Master can sit down

84
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,700
and converse with them
the whole afternoon.

85
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
He lies to you.

86
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,180
Nonsense.

87
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,740
Master never lies.

88
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,060
Except

89
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,100
when he says

90
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,140
he will buy me candied hawthorns,

91
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,740
everything he says is true.

92
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,660
If the big commotion we caused

93
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,820
in Tianqi City

94
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,980
could be completely suppressed,

95
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,300
does that mean Wenjun

96
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,340
wouldn't know what happened,

97
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,100
that I came,

98
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,980
and even

99
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,740
that I had already charged into

100
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,580
Prince Jingyu's Mansion?

101
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,140
I'm telling the truth.

102
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,020
Master can

103
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,060
speak to birds.

104
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,620
Quiet!

105
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,100
Master, Here he comes again.

106
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,220
Why is he always

107
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,100
suddenly lashing out at me?

108
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,700
It's because
what he will do in the future

109
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,860
might bring tremendous trouble,

110
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,820
and he doesn't want to
get people around him involved,

111
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,300
so he pushes everyone away.

112
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,580
I still don't get it.

113
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,500
What exactly does Ye

114
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,820
want to do?

115
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,940
A mere thought could foment evil.

116
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,220
Here you come again.

117
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,420

118
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,380
will it take?

119
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,500
I'm exhausted.

120
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,340
We might arrive in three days.

121
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,340
But why are you exhausted?

122
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,900
You took naps

123
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,220
after every few hours of walking.

124
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,220

125
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,780

129
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,460
Not me.

130
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,900

Ye is a big softy at heart!

139
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,980
Why is he smiling so happily?

140
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,660
It's because he is not attached.

141

To me,

174
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
every word you say

175
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,580
is an order I cannot defy,

176
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,740
so you don't have to ask.

177
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,340
Qixuan,

178
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,380
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,820
You thought you were careful enough
to conceal your trace.

180
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,820
However,
concerning our years of friendship,

181
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,100
do you think

182
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,460
you can deceive me?

183
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,860
You want to stop me?

184
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,740
Lord Wuxiang ordered

185
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,500
to lock Young Lady up for three years

186
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,300
to reflect on herself.

187
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,900
If you go back now,

188
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,380
I will pretend

189
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,660
nothing has happened.

190
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,660

00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,780
Mr. Ye, your inner evil is persistent.

382
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,340
Why don't you give up on practicing
Demon Deity Sword Techniques?

383
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,420
Elder Wangyou,

384
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,740
does Demon Deity Sword Techniques

385
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,780
trigger my inner evil?

386
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,300
Ye,

387
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,740
I didn't allow you to watch it

388
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,660
because this is

389
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,500
a sword move
one wields at the last moment.

390
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,740
This devastating move

391
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,820
is used during the final moment

392
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,980
to destroy everything.

393
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,580
Master...

394
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,380
Master!

395
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,620
If I can't leave

396
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,020
with her,

397
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,180
can I trade this lethal move

398
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,380
for her freedom?

399
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,300
Mr. Ye.

400
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,700
Elder Wangyou,

401
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,540
thank you again.

402
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,580
Don't worry.

403
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,460
I won't launch

404
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,260
this lethal sword move.

405
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,180
Because

406
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,340
one will only be enlightened

407
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,980
at the moment

408
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,860
they need it.

409
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,180
Since there is a path of living,

410
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,180
why walk the desperate one?

411
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,500
What is a path of living?

412
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,020
Let go.

413
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,740
No.

414
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,660
Elder Wangyou,

415
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,100
get rest early.

416
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,340
Who's there?

417
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,340
It has been a while, Ye Dingzhi.

418
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,180
You were stalking me again.

419
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,060
What are you doing here?

420
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,860
Of course, I'm here to mock you

421
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,820
for overplaying your hand.

422
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,940
That being said,
I'm also here to congratulate you

423
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,060
on returning from Tianqi

424
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,980
alive.

425
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,500
I just didn't think

426
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,060
that after this failure,

427
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,540
you would come and crouch

428
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,380
in this place.

429
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,340
What a wimp.

430
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,540
Why are you

431
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,860
still holding up so stubbornly?

432
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,580
I can't believe

433
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,620
that old geezer advises you to let go.

434
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,300
In the end,

435
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,380
even if he's not Prince Jingyu's man,

436
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,500
he's loyal to the Tianqi royals.

437
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,780
Not only do I not advise you to let go,

438
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,060
but I will also help you reclaim

439
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,020
what you want.

440
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,980
I will reclaim what I want

441
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,140
by myself.

442
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,900
You should leave.

443
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,620
After all, we are not the same kind.

444
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,020
Who is your kind, then?

445
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,700
In the far west,

446
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,180
there was once a person who was my kind.

447
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,620
Unfortunately,

448
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,460
I landed him into trouble.

449
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,380
I wonder

450
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,740
how Yun is doing now.

451
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,340
Hopefully,

452
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,660
Ruofeng can keep him safe.

453
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,180
A guqin score?

454
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,340
Did Master leave this?

455
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,340
Young Lady,
after waiting here for days,

456
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,260
he's finally playing the guqin.

457
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,580
Right.

458
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,260
It's just that he stinks.

459
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,260
It seems he has discovered

460
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,740
the score you secretly left.

461
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,660
Greetings, Young Master.

462
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,620
I knew you came here.

463
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,340
Master has already died,

464
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,460
and you are free,

465
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,980
so you don't have to
call me Young Master.

466
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,100
Master saved

467
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,820
our lives before.

468
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,660
We swore

469
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,300
we would serve
both Master and you for life.

470
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,380
However, you never summon us,

471
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,980
so we daren't show up.

472
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,220
That's why we could
only follow you in secret.

473
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,900
We may not be skilled in martial arts,

474
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,300
as long as you need us,

475
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,460
we will risk our lives

476
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,460
without hesitation.

477
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,500
We will risk our lives
without hesitation.

478
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,180
Fine. Get up.

479
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,900
I summoned you

480
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,700
for a favor.

481
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,300
Please command us, Young Master.

482
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,420
I'm worried about someone.

483
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,700
Can you

484
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,820
sneak into Tianqi

485
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,660
and ask around

486
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,300
if she is doing well.

487
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,340
[Nanjue]

488
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,580
Why are you

489
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,940
here?

490
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,740
After this ambush,

491
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,620
we repaid the kindness

492
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,700
of Sky's Beyond

493
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,340
for raising us.

494
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:06,380
[Prince Jingyu's Mansion]

495
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,300
Butler!

496
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,500
Prince Langya has arrived.

497
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,740
Your Highness,

498
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,420
Prince Jingyu left for Yindu.

499
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,260
He's not at home.

500
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,900
We didn't expect that to happen.

501
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,500
Your Highness,

502
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,580
only you can help me now.

503
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,540
Tell me on the way.

504
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,060
What happens now?

505
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,900
The Princess Consort

506
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,820
is so skilled

507
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
that we can't enter the room.

508
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,700
Hence, we can't know
what's happening inside.

509
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,140
I told Ruojin about it earlier.

510
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,220
Wenjun, be careful.

511
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,900
Who are you to call me that?

512
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,940
Why didn't you dodge?

513
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,020
Couldn't Mr. Li's best disciple

514
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,860
dodge my palm attack?

515
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,900
If I take this attack,

516
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,260
will you be happier?

517
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,420
Besides, now...

518
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,580
Did you come here

519
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,420
to ask for a beating?

520
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,940
I was told you are pregnant,

521
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,820
so I came to pay a visit.

522
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,820
I'm not the only pregnant woman,

523
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,980
yet you especially visit me,
Prince Langya.

524
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,300
You are worried
I would go out of my mind

525
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,060
and kill

526
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,660
the child in my tummy

527
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,940
out of anger, aren't you?

528
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,060
Wenjun,

529
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,260
marriage

530
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,620
and having a child

531
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,220
are different.

532
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,340
Knowing that you haven't gotten over it,

533
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,300
I must pay more attention to you.

534
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,140
You may leave.

535
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,540
I'm not

536
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,940
as stubborn

537
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,740
and weak as you thought.

538
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,100
Will you give birth

539
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,940
to this child?

540
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,820
At least,

541
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,780
I won't kill it myself.

542
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,900
However,

543
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,740
if he has to leave

544
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,100
by fate,

545
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,220
I hope no one will stop it.

546
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,780
Scram.

547
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:01,940
Now!

548
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,900
Thank you, Wenjun.

549
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,980
What a nice brother he has.

550
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,700
Sorry about that.

551
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,740
Come in.

552
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,300
Second Young Lady.

553
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,980
Any urgent news?

554
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,780
Lord Wuxiang sent one over.

555
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,660
[Yi Wenjun is pregnant]

556
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,220
Yi Wenjun is pregnant?

557
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,980
Look how loyal she is!

558
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,420
You care about her so much,

559
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,660
yet she is bearing a child

560
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,580
for her beloved husband.

561
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,940
What a steamy night
they must've enjoyed.

562
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,860
This is hilarious.

563
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:07,900
Hilarious, indeed.

564
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,860
This score left by Master
is something else.

565
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,380
It hides martial techniques
within the notes.

566
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,580
As expected of him.

567
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,340
Clouds tumble in a westward gale.

568
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,900
Mighty protection spans the seven seas,
returning home in triumph.

569
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,700
By just reading the scores
for a few days,

570
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,820
I'm so well-enlightened.

571
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,140
Why am I

572
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,780
so intelligent?

573
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,340
You are shameless.

574
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,380
As long as I could make you smile,

575
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,500
why not?

576
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,460
What brings you here?

577
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,100
I came here...

578
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,740
Did you miss me?

579
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,700
I came here
to teach you martial arts skills.

580
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,700
So you left the score here?

581
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,900
That's right.

582
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,820
However,

583
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,220
I'm having some regrets now.

584
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:34,940
How so?

585
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,740
On my first day in Ruochuan Inn,

586
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,540
it was full of guests.

587
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,220
Only one room was left.

588
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,460
But today

589
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,780
when I left the inn,

590
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,060
it was empty.

591
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,300
Do you know why?

592
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,900
Someone died in the inn?

593
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:51,660
No.

594
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,580
It's because you stink

595
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,260
at playing.

596
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,500
Everyone couldn't bear it and fled.

597
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,940
The innkeeper

598
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,180
wanted to complain at the yamen.

599
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,540
By the time he and his men arrived,

600
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,460
the yamen was heavily guarded.

601
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,420
The guards

602
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,860
all looked

603
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,100
as if they were suffering
something unbearable.

604
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,940
Hence, the innkeeper gave up.

605
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,620
Do I stink that much?

606
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,140
This is one of the four best guqin
in the world,

607
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,020
Empyrean Guqin.

608
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,780
Wind gusts and thunder strikes
in the empyrean domain,

609
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,820
where a dragon lies
in a millennial vernal slumber.

610
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,020
As the Scholarly Deity of Western Chu
roamed the martial arts world

611
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,780
in a white robe
with a guqin and a sword,

612
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,380
countless pretty ladies

613
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,340
were enamored by him.

614
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,820
I have never seen him,

615
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,620
but I would love to.

616
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,980
Was Master really that charming
back then?

617
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,900
Out of 64 unparalleled courtesans

618
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,220
from 32 music parlors in Tianqi City,

619
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,100
40 of them were madly in love with him.

620
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,980
What do you think?

621
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,140
So girls

622
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,700
like this type of man?

623
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,780
A guqin

624
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,780
with a sword concealed inside.

625
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,140
The sword unsheathes
as the guqin sounds.

626
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,020
No lady

627
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,700
would not be fascinated

628
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,180
by such a gentleman.

629
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:24,980
All right.

630
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,660
For what you said,

631
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,980
I'm going to learn to play the guqin.

632
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,700
What did I say?

633
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,260
To make all ladies fall for you?

634
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,860
That's not necessary.

635
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,860
Only you are enough.

636
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,300
But...

637
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,300
But?

638
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,900
A young man playing less skillfully
with his eyes closed

639
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,060
can be charming too.

640
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:05,940
Strike gently.

641
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,900
Stupid sword skills.

642
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,580
Stupid man.

643
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,540
Today, I heard

644
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,260
an interesting story
happened in the imperial city of Beili.

645
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,140
I wonder

646
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,420
if you are interested, Mr. Ye.

647
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,620
I'm not interested.

648
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,740
You said you were not interested

649
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,740
even before listening to it.

650
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,620
What a heartless man.

651
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,300
Have you already forgotten
your past beloved

652
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,740
in just a few days?

653
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,580
I thought

654
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,300
you would be very interested in this.

655
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,300
What are you getting at?

656
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,420
Instead of describing it as interesting,

657
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,140
I would say it's good news.

658
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,580
Beili is truly blessed.

659
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,260
The Emperor begets a prince,

660
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,620
while the prince
begets an imperial grandson.

661
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,740
Generations upon generations,
the monarchy flourishes.

662
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,300
What does that mean?

663
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,100
That means

664
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,700
the daughter of the Shadow Sect's leader

665
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,540
whom you hold so dearly

666
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,300
and the new secondary consort
of Prince Jingyu,

667
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,860
Yi Wenjun,

668
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,780
is pregnant.

669
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,780
Are you insane?

670
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,100
I know it.

671
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,140
You went insane

672
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,580
because you were so loyal to her,

673
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,780
while she couldn't endure
the lonely nights

674
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,860
and enjoy a great time

675
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,220
with her real husband
to bear his child!

676
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:12,740
Shut up!

677
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,500
I won't!

678
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,740
She seduced another man
when she was already married.

679
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,060
And you know she's married,

680
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,020
but you are still hung up on her.

681
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,660
A couple of cheats and harlots!

682
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,020
Drop.

683
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,320

during the filming of this drama.]
