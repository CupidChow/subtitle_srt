189
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,300
let's have dinner together.

190
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,020
I'll prepare dinner right now.

191
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,740
Just save the trouble.

192
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,180
The Kunlun Summit is around the corner.

193
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,100
I've been invited to attend it.

194
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,780
So I'll be leaving soon.

195
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,460
Me, too.

196
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,140
I've been out for a long time.

197
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,060
My master

198
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,740
requires me to return immediately.

199
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,780
I can't stay for dinner.

200
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,220
Anshi.

201
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,140
Look.

202
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,900
I'm leaving.

203
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,540
Be a good boy, you hear me?

204
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,780
When I'm free,

205
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,780
I'll come back to visit you, okay?

206
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,780
You must keep your word.

207
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,980
I'll keep my word.

208
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,500
Let's make a pinky swear.

209
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,940
- Make a pinky swear.
- Pinky swear.

210
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,900
You must keep your word.

211
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,540
Good boy.

212
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,820
Whose letter is that?

213
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,980
My buddy, Dongjun,

214
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,100
I have settled in a hut
under Hanshui Temple

215
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,860
in Gusu City,

216
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,980
and have a son with Wenjun.

217
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,860
Back then, I was young and all alone.

218
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,340
But now, I have my family back,

219
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,420
and I'm living in peace and happiness.

220
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,700
I've put my hatred behind me for now.

221
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,740
I heard that you're in Xueyue City,

222
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,500
and I'd like to invite you
to come and meet me.

223
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,300
Your buddy, Ye Yun.

224
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:16,980
What's the matter?

225
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,140
It's Yun.

226
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,140
Second Young Lady.

227
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,980
Ye Dingzhi has left the mountain.

228
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,900
Wangyou isn't on the mountain either.

229
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,140
I've poisoned Yi Wenjun

230
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,260
with the Soul-Dispersing Incense.

231
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,980
Now,

232
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,260
she should be remembering

233
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,420
a lot of things

234
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,060
that she doesn't want
to remember or face.

235
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,460
Lord Wuxiang sent this incense

236
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,780
at the right time.

237
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,580
Anshi.

238
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,340
Mother.

239
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,420
I'm not your mother.

240
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,100
No, you are.

241
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,020
Qing... Qingyang.

242
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,540
He is Xiao Yu.

243
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,660
No, he isn't.

244
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,820
He is Xiao Yu.

245
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,700
He isn't.

246
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,260
Mother.

247
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,340
Yu.

248
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,020
Now is the right time.

249
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,300
Soul Official.

250
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,540
You once rescued Yi Wenjun

251
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,540
with the Four Slaves of Rain Demon.

252
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,300
It would be best if you go.

253
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,100
Wait for my news.

254
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,980
Second Young Lady, do you think

255
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,260
my little brother can handle it?

256
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,540
After all,

257
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,660
the game you
and Lord Wuxiang are playing

258
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,700
is intricate and layered,

259
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,260
with each move building on the last.

260
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,220
If a mistake is made in one step,

261
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,380
everything will be irreversible.

262
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,860
If I don't trust him,

263
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,980
can I trust you?

264
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,980
Feizhan may be a man of few words,

265
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,820
but when he strikes,

266
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,260
he never fails.

267
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,060
Well,

268
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,660
an honest-looking man

269
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,060
who talks less

270
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,620
is more trustworthy, huh?

271
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,540
Yun, are you home?

272
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,220
Miss Yi, it's me.

273
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,340
Who are you?

274
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,020
We've only met once,

275
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,700
but we haven't had a chance
to get to know each other's names.

276
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,700
When was it?

277
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,100
The day when you left Tianqi City.

278
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,460
Before you left,

279
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,940
we'd met.

280
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,820
But it was a brief encounter,

281
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,420
only for about half a day.

282
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,940
Are you

283
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,820
one of Master Rain Demon's slaves?

284
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,100
No.

285
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,220
Deputy Commander Luo

286
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,820
asked me to come and help you.

287
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,700
My name is Li Feizhan.

288
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,380
Luckily, your looks
are very recognizable.

289
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,100
Or I wouldn't have remembered you

290
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,620
after just one meeting.

291
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,940
Come in and talk.

292
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,300
What brings you here?

293
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
So you've got

294
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,420
a new child, Miss Yi.

295
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,620
What do you mean by that?

296
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,140
To be frank,

297
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,940
this time, Deputy Commander Luo

298
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,140
asked me to pass on a message to you.

299
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,340
He said

300
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,860
Prince Xiao Yu was seriously ill.

301
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,980
Mother.

302
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,740
He may not be able
to hold out much longer.

303
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,340
What?

304
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,740
No wonder...

305
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,820
No wonder I suddenly dreamed of him.

306
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,580
Deputy Commander Luo asked me to ask you

307
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,940
if you want to go back

308
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,500
to see the child one last time.

309
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,580
He'll arrange

310
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,300
for you to enter

311
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,740
and leave the city quietly.

312
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,300
I knew Mr. Ye

313
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,820
mustn't know about this

314
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,060
so I came

315
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,260
after he left.

316
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,500
Whether you go or not is up to you.

317
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,500
Deputy Commander Luo

318
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,260
doesn't want you
to miss out on the opportunity

319
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,580
and regret it for the rest of your life.

320
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,500
If you don't want Mr. Ye to worry,

321
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,260
just leave him a letter.

322
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,900
[Wenjun]

323
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,260
Do you have any other concerns?

324
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,460
I'm a little worried

325
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,700
about Anshi being all alone here.

326
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,100
When will Ye Dingzhi be back?

327
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,100
Judging from the color of the sky,

328
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,020
he should be back soon.

329
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,020
Must we

330
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,180
leave

331
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,060
before he returns?

332
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,460
If he knew

333
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,500
what you were going to do,

334
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,260
would he let you go so easily?

335
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,580
Fine.

336
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,220
I already know your decision.

337
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,700
That's it, then.

338
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,940
Wait.

339
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Let me think about it.

340
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,540
Miss Yi,

341
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,060
it's not that I don't want to wait,

342
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,900
but I'm afraid Prince Xiao Yu

343
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,500
won't be able to wait for you

344
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,180
much longer.

345
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,020
If things go badly,

346
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,940
I'll have to return soon

347
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,740
and help Deputy Commander Luo

348
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,660
with Prince Xiao Yu's funeral.

349
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,180
Anshi,

350
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,540
I'm going away for a while,

351
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,940
but I'll be back soon.

352
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,100
By then,

353
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,660
I will bring you

354
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,900
an elder brother.

355
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,740
I hear some movement in the distance.

356
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,260
I think he's back.

357
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,500
Don't worry.

358
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,780
It's just for a little while.

359
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,020
Anshi will be fine.

360
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,500
Let's go.

361
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,700
I'm back, dear.

362
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,540
I've been wanting to come back.

363
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,460
But Mr. Zhang, the butcher, said

364
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,020
that the pig he killed today
had no hair on it,

365
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,900
so he insisted on me staying
for a drink.

366
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,260
I thought

367
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,500
it was fine to have a drink.

368
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,900
As he drank, he talked about

369
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,060
his late wife who died of illness.

370
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,420
Dear,

371
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,580
I've bought you

372
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,580
your favourite Glutinous Rice Balls

373
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,660
and Osmanthus Liquor.

374
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,740
It's strange.

375
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,220
Wenjun wouldn't go out

376
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,220
at this hour.

377
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,180
Anshi, you're awake.

378
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,900
Where is your mother?

379
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,740
I don't know.

380
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,180
My dear, Ye Yun,

381
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,300
I've been having nightmares

382
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,340
about Xiao Yu,

383
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,300
who is my son with Xiao Ruojin.

384
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,900
In my dreams, Xiao Ruojin
was torturing him

385
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,170
because of his anger

386
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,820
at me.

387
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,460
I can't bear it.

388
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,900
Qingyang sent someone

389
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,060
to help me

390
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,900
take him away from Tianqi City.

391
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,980
I was afraid you wouldn't let me.

392
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,500
So I left secretly.

393
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,980
Please don't blame me.

394
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,500
I'll be back soon.

395
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,500
Don't worry.

396
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,100
What do you think Ye Dingzhi will do

397
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,980
after reading the letter?

398
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,500
The hut will collapse again, right?

399
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,140
Because whatever the reason is,

400
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,860
Ye Dingzhi knows

401
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,420
she won't be able to come back

402
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,220
after she returns to Tianqi.

403
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,020
Ye Dingzhi will

404
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,300
rush to Tianqi City

405
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,860
like a madman.

406
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,580
That's why we have

407
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,460
to stop him here.

408
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,500
It's been a long time.

409
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,860
Go away.

410
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,540
What a great resentment.

411
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,260
I've traveled a long way

412
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,180
to get here.

413
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,540
Anshi,

414
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,140
get behind a tree and wait for me.

415
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,860
Don't come forward.

416
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:26,420
Go.

417
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,780
Okay.

418
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,460
As I said,

419
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,540
go away!

420
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,660
Are you mad?

421
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,460
Fine.

422
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,460
Then do your best

423
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,180
to kill me.

424
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,500
Providing you can kill me.

425
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,500
Soul Official, are you crazy?

426
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,340
I'm not.

427
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,980
I'm just eager

428
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,060
to feel

429
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,500
the power of Xunian Art.

430
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,460
The third level of Xunian Art.

431
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,420
Release!

432
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,780
I'm not

433
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,580
an innate martial artist like you.

434
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,620
I've been practicing Xunian Art hard

435
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,300
for so many years,

436
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,500
but I've only reached the third level.

437
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,820
But this third level

438
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,220
is enough to defeat you today.

439
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,320
Life, death, seal.

440
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,980
Do you think you're a judge

441
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,900
who can decide my fate?

442
00:27:59,380 --> 00:27:59,900
Out!

443
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,500
Everyone advised me
not to become a demon,

444
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,940
but the way of the world

445
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,820
is forcing me to become one.

446
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,620
Father.

447
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,020
You've become a demon, Ye Dingzhi.

448
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,060
Die!

449
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,860
Go die!

450
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,980
Yue Qing.

451
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,140
Feili.

452
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:19,820
Luckily,

453
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,940
it's just a few broken meridians.

454
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,700
That was too bold of you.

455
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,940
With your body,

456
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,060
you'll die of broken meridians

457
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,780
if you attempt

458
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,900
to use Xunian Art hastily.

459
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,860
It's hard to practice it secretly,

460
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,700
so I need to use and feel it once.

461
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,340
Father!

462
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,540
You killed my father!

463
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,860
You're wrong, boy.

464
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,300
Your father has become a demon.

465
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,780
Father.

466
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,300
We're the only ones

467
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,340
who can save him now.

468
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,660
Father!

469
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,500
Yun,

470
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,580
your buddy,

471
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,500
Baili Dongjun is here.

472
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,340
Come out and welcome me.

473
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,740
We're late.

474
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,460
Dongjun, this is bad.

475
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,060
Ye Dingzhi

476
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,300
has been taken away by those
from Sky's Beyond.

477
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,540
I've already passed on

478
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,540
all three levels of Xunian Art
in my body

479
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,820
to him.

480
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,340
When will he wake up?

481
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,300
It's not easy

482
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,540
to digest all three levels of Xunian Art

483
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,580
in a short period.

484
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:46,940
What about you?

485
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,580
If I want to return

486
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,700
to my previous state,

487
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,940
it would take a year or so.

488
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,470
[Xuan City]

489
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,580
Darn Li Changsheng.

490
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,980
What did he

491
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,260
secretly do to me that day?

492
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,220
Why haven't I recovered

493
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,980
from my injuries?

494
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,300
What's the matter?

495
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,780
Lord Wuzuo,

496
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,780
some people from Sky's Beyond

497
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,220
are about to enter Xuan City.

498
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,300
Who are they?

499
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,860
They are the Soul Officer, Feili,

500
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,940
and Second Young Lady.

501
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,580
But by the looks of them,

502
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,820
they seem to be being pursued.

503
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,540
Who are chasing after them?

504
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,620
Young Lady

505
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,740
and Baili Dongjun.

506
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,060
Is it that Baili Dongjun

507
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,780
from the Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion?

508
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,580
Yes.

509
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,020
Good.

510
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,060
Very good.

511
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,580
I was just about to go find him.

512
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,620
I couldn't kill him

513
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,020
in Tianqi City that day,

514
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,860
so that darn Li Changsheng

515
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,380
caused me a great deal of pain.

516
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,500
Yao,

517
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,020
there's a city up ahead.

518
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,940
I think they're heading

519
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,780
for the city.

520
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,620
Xuan City.

521
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,740
What has happened?

522
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:34,860
He's breathing.

523
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,620
He's still alive.

524
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,140
Are you all right?

525
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,380
Young man, what's wrong?

526
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,100
It hurts so much.

527
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,580
[Junyu, Mr. Wuming
of Eight Young Masters of Beili]

528
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,300
How rude.

529
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,620
Get out of the way.

530
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,940
Do you have a death wish?

531
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,540
Mister,

532
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,260
are you traveling north?

533
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,460
It's none of your business.

534
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,140
Who are you?

535
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,540
Why are you blocking our way?

536
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,300
I'm a scholar,

537
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,220
and I want to visit

538
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,820
the northernmost part of the country,
where there are miles of ice mountains

539
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,340
and wilderness.

540
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,460
I wonder

541
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,220
if I could hitch a ride
in your carriage.

542
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,380
Mister

543
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,380
and the lady in there,

544
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,180
would you mind?

545
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,060
Yes.

546
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,660
Who's cursing me?

547
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,660
Fine.

548
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,620
I must have made a mistake.

549
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,620
His looks

550
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,100
are just like what Master described.

551
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,220
But his temper is completely different.

552
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,060
Did Master

553
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,180
lie to me again?

554
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,220
Forget it.

555
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,100
I must have made a mistake.

556
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,380
I'm not coming with you.

557
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,860
You guys go first.

558
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:46,940
Let's go.

559
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,180
She has a bad temper.

560
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,460
Watch where you're going.

561
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,900
No manners.

562
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,380
You've soiled my clothes.

563
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,660
How rude.

564
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,110
You scoundrel,

565
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,660
so do you have manners?

566
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,340
You owe me a month's worth of liquor

567
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,140
[Third Lady]
on credit.

568
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,020
You've never cleared your credit.

569
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,260
How dare you!

570
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:18,820
Third Lady,

571
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,940
no.

572
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,620
It's not that I don't have the money
to pay for the liquor.

573
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,260
Think about it.

574
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,820
If I drink and pay up right away,

575
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,460
our relationship will be over.

576
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,940
My heart aches

577
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,220
just thinking about it.

578
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,940
It won't ache if you pay up.

579
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,980
Guys, beat him up!

580
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,660
Third Lady,

581
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,660
I'm a scholar.

582
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,780
Beat him to death!

583
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,140
Let's talk this out.

584
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:44,620
Let's talk...

585
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,380
Wait!

586
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,100
All the love in this world

587
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,980
comes from the heart.

588
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,620
Third Lady,

589
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,700
why can't you

590
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,460
feel my heart for you?

591
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,300
Feel your heart, my foot!

592
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,180
Mate, have you practiced martial arts?

593
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,820
Is he dead?

594
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,340
He's dead.

595
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,420
Madam, what do we do now?

596
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,340
He's not dead, is he?

597
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,380
I'm fine.

598
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,500
Third Lady,

599
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,580
you still care about me, don't you?

600
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,060
Look at you and your shameless face.

601
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,620
It hurts.

602
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,940
I don't have three in my name,

603
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,340
and I'm not the third in my family.

604
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,540
So, why do you

605
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,460
always call me Third Lady?

606
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,020
Two graceful brows

607
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,020
outshine a fair face threefold.

608
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,540
That's why I call you Third Lady.

609
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,260
Well,

610
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,860
you always speak so poetically.

611
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,220
I don't know what you're talking about.

612
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,100
Because I'm a scholar.

613
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,660
I've never seen

614
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,980
such a slovenly scholar like you.

615
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:09,980
I can do it myself.

616
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,780
I think that's the right one now,
isn't it?

617
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,660
Mister, can you get out of the way?

618
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,700
We're in a rush.

619
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,580
Mister,

620
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,740
are you traveling north?

621
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,780
Yes.

622
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,580
I'm a scholar.

623
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,020
My greatest wish in life is

624
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,220
to visit the northernmost part
of the country,

625
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,980
where there are miles
of icy mountains and wilderness.

626
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,860
It's a pity I don't have
any money with me.

627
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,180
I wonder

628
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,540
if you could give me a lift.

629
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,420
We're not going to the north

630
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,220
for fun.

631
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,740
We could be in danger of dying.

632
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,460
It would be inappropriate

633
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,580
for you to travel with us.

634
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,460
It's appropriate.

635
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,540
I'm looking for people like you.

636
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,620
Third Lady, I'm leaving.

637
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,260
Remember to pay for the liquor

638
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,220
when you're back.

639
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,780
If I drink and don't pay up,

640
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,540
our relationship won't be over.

641
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,100
Bye.

642
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,700
Since then, another woman is

643
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,060
waiting for me.

644
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,980
Who are you?

645
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,340
You're Baili Dongjun, right?

646
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,060
How do you know my name?

647
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,820
Of course I know

648
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,020
because my name is Junyu.

649
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,620
"Jun" means modest gentleman.

650
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,180
"Yu" means gentle as jade.

651
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,700
This silver ingot

652
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,540
is enough to get you
from here to the far north.

653
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:15,620
Get down.

654
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,260
You can't ride in this carriage.

655
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,980
A gentleman only takes
what is rightfully his.

656
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,580
Thank you.

657
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,100
But I feel

658
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,620
more comfortable

659
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,540
in your carriage.

660
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,220
Listen,

661
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,060
I'm running out of patience right now.

662
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,260
Dongjun,

663
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,100
I don't think this man

664
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,180
is a bad person.

665
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,900
That's true.

666
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,700
How could

667
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,060
a gentleman like me

668
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,700
look like a bad guy?

669
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,420
Miss, you're the sensible one here.

670
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,460
Are you done talking?

671
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,540
Young man.

672
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,820
You have a strong aura
of hostility, don't you?

673
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,740
A man of the Academy

674
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,220
should be a gentleman.

675
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,140
A gentleman should have
the aura of joy, anger,

676
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,540
dominance, elegance,

677
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,220
and even murder,

678
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,700
but not hostility.

679
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,260
Hostility is evil.

680
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,180
One wrong step,
and you'll be in deep trouble.

681
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,540
Mister, from what you've said,

682
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,340
you must be a member of the Academy.

683
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,860
I've been taught by the Academy,

684
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,660
but I've never entered the Academy.

685
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,220
What a pity.

686
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,380
If not, there would be

687
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,460
another woman

688
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,580
in Tianqi City waiting for you, mister.

689
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,020
Don't call me mister.

690
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,340
I'm a modest gentleman,
as gentle as jade.

691
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,060
Look at your attire.

692
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,580
How are you a modest gentleman?

693
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,180
How are you as gentle as jade?

694
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,820
A gentleman has a form
but forgets the form,

695
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,060
with a delicate heart as jade.

696
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,620
This man

697
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,500
deserves
to be called a gentleman.

698
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,580
But as for being like jade...

699
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,860
What's wrong?
It scared the hell out of me.

700
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,860
This inner strength...

701
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,380
It's Lord Wuzuo.

702
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,420
He's Zhuge Yun

703
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,980
whom we met at the examination

704
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,180
in the Academy.

705
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,140
Zhuge Yun?

706
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,940
But why does he look

707
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,700
so haggard,

708
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,460
like a different man?

709
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,180
Master once said

710
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,460
there were two Zhuge Yuns.

711
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,380
One is hostile and the other is gentle.

712
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,940
He killed the hostile one

713
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,460
and spared the life of the gentle one.

714
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,020
But this man before us...

715
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,540
Did Master kill the wrong one?

716
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,220
It's not a killing mistake.

717
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,260
It's that he's put his brother

718
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,980
inside his heart.

719
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,700
The hearts of twins like them

720
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,260
are always connected.

721
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,260
When one dies,

722
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,460
a seed is planted

723
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,660
in the other's heart.

724
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,660
A dark flower then grows.

725
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,180
That's what I meant

726
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,180
by hostility.

727
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,060
Hostility is evil.

728
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,660
One wrong step,
and you'll be in deep trouble.

729
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,060
Eventually,

730
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,580
he became a monster.

731
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,180
That's why we have to be gentlemen.

732
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,700
Monsters like this

733
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,980
are not easy to fight.

734
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,740
You're wrong.

735
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,660
Such monsters

736
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,460
created by hostility

737
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,220
only look scary,

738
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,820
but they are nothing.

739
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:07,900
They can be crushed
with a snap of the fingers.

740
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,980
If it's that easy,

741
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:12,740
you do it.

742
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,500
Why else do you think

743
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,660
I've waited for you here

744
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,540
for so long?

745
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,180
It's because I've been waiting
for this moment.

746
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,900
But it's a pity

747
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,060
that Third Lady won't be able to see

748
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,060
what I'm going to do next.

749
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,420
Otherwise, she'd be crying

750
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,260
and asking to come with me.

751
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,060
I'm Junyu of the Academy.

752
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,540
Please give me your guidance.

753
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,460
