You do look as dashing as always.

188
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,540
It's just

189
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,940
that Tianqi City felt a little lonely

190
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,060
without you.

191
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,100
Is that so?

192
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,420
For example?

193
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,700
For example, this.

194
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,300
No one can stop this.

195
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,380
It's just a petty trick.

196
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,300
With me around,

197
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,740
Master doesn't need to lift a finger.

198
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,660
Eunuch Zhuoqing,

199
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,460
if you're looking
for a sparring partner,

200
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,340
why don't you let me spar with you?

201
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,900
Let's leave.

202
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,660
Farewell, Your Majesty.

203
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,100
How did it go?

204
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,300
Your Majesty,

205
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,540
no one has seen

206
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,740
Li Changsheng again

207
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,660
after he left Tianqi City.

208
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,940
Just now,

209
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,220
when I was testing him,

210
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,020
I observed him closely.

211
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,380
whether it's his voice, form,

212
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,340
or even his tone,

213
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,420
he really resembles Li Changsheng.

214
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,780
It's a shame

215
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,260
that he resembles him too much.

216
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,180
It's as if he's trying too hard
to be him.

217
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,420
I dare confirm

218
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,660
that this person

219
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,820
isn't the real Li Changsheng.

220
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,900
His face

221
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,660
is just a mask.

222
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,460
And,

223
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,540
Baili Dongjun intervened.

224
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,780
Although

225
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,500
what he said made sense,

226
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,940
his excuse

227
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,140
sounded fake to me.

228
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,900
That's great.

229
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,260
If Li Changsheng was back,

230
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,060
it would be troublesome.

231
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,020
Baili Luochen

232
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,100
is much more meek than before.

233
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,540
He dared

234
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,620
scare me with a fake Li Changsheng.

235
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,620
What about
Baili Luochen's grandson, then?

236
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,940
I think you were

237
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,780
testing his skills just now.

238
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,140
What do you think?

239
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,700
He is fearless.

240
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,260
With time, he'll surely
achieve great feats.

241
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,850
He does live up to his reputation

242
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,740
as Li Changsheng's last disciple.

243
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,580
Ancient texts say

244
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,220
that the benefits of a virtuous man
last for three generations.

245
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,500
The Baili Family

246
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
has given birth to talents

247
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,700
that are more talented than the last.

248
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,420
Three generations of prosperity

249
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,420
seem to be too long for a family.

250
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:49,980
How did it go?

251
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,420
What did the Imperial Censorate
say about this?

252
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,220
They only told us four words.

253
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,660
Why are you keeping me in suspense?

254
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,500
Hurry and cut to the chase!

255
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,980
Yes, Your Highness. Please pardon me.

256
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,420
The Imperial Censorate said,

257
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,220
"This is near impossible."

258
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,060
"This is near impossible?"

259
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,900
Could it be...

260
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,220
Could it be that Father

261
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,340
no longer intends to kill Baili Luochen?

262
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,740
That's... That's impossible!

263
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,700
When I sought an audience

264
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,220
with Father in the palace

265
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:25,660
and told him

266
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,020
that Baili Luochen
was staging a rebellion,

267
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,820
he supported me.

268
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,660
How could he

269
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,980
change his mind

270
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,380
just like that?

271
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,460
This is impossible.

272
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,740
Why is that the case?

273
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,020
That person wasn't willing
to tell me the reason.

274
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,180
He wasn't willing to tell you?

275
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,700
Prince Qing's Mansion

276
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,820
hasn't fallen,

277
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,620
yet he's in a rush

278
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,660
to cut his ties with us, huh?

279
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,140
If so, why didn't he refuse

280
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,500
to take our money, then?

281
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,300
You may leave for now.

282
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,180
Yes, Miss Ying.

283
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,020
Your Highness.

284
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,740
This shouldn't be possible.

285
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,540
Why are you coming back?

286
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,780
Your Highness.

287
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,540
Miss Ying.

288
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,780
We have a guest arriving.

289
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,620
I'm not seeing anyone.

290
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,100
Scram!

291
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,540
Yes, Your Highness.

292
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,740
Your Highness,
looks like you're quite angry.

293
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,540
The court and its affairs

294
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,340
are unpredictable.

295
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,060
One should not focus
on temporary gains and losses

296
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,780
when striving for lasting success.

297
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,420
At last, you've come.

298
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,060
Greetings, Your Highness.

299
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,220
You've finally arrived.

300
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,980
It's because the Grand Eunuch

301
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,540
thinks that the time is ripe.

302
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,460
That's why he sent me here.

303
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,940
So you finally thought of
visiting the Academy, huh?

304
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,180
Mr. Chen.

305
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,820
Not bad at all.

306
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,340
Although it's only been two years,

307
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
you're completely different now.

308
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,100
Mr. Chen, you can tell the difference

309
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,260
with just one glance?

310
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,100
Everyone has an aura around them.

311
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,220
Those who understand that concept
don't need to judge people

312
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,220
by their appearance.

313
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,500
They just need to observe their aura.

314
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,140
I suppose you came to Tianqi City

315
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,780
because someone reported
to the Imperial Censorate

316
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,380
that the Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion
intended to rebel, right?

317
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,540
Indeed.

318
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,100
Though It seems that way,

319
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,460
in reality,

320
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,660
Emperor Tai'an was

321
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,780
just trying
to pass the throne to Ruofeng.

322
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,260
Seems like you've figured it out.

323
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,140
If Emperor Tai'an

324
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,580
truly wanted to hold
my grandfather accountable,

325
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,140
it could be seen

326
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,540
as a way for him to take back
his military authority by force.

327
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,940
But he didn't intend

328
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,020
to do that.

329
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,100
Why do you think that's the case?

330
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,780
The prince who reported him
to the Imperial Censorate

331
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,420
will become

332
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,620
the thorn in
the Marquis of Zhenxi's flesh.

333
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,380
On the contrary,

334
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,180
Ruofeng, who escorted
my grandfather here,

335
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,260
will be

336
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,780
the favored candidate
for the Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion.

337
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,980
If Ruofeng

338
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,700
wins the support
of the Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion,

339
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,980
it's better than

340
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,420
the support
of any other marquises in the world.

341
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,780
The emperor

342
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,260
is paving a path for his son.

343
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,620
What path?

344
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,740
One path leads to success,

345
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
the other to execution.

346
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,940
Have you never considered

347
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,500
that the emperor might
support the factional struggles?

348
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,620
Will he use

349
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,700
his son that way?

350
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,180
He did the same thing

351
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,220
to obtain the throne back then.

352
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,100
Maybe, to the people,

353
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,860
he's a good ruler.

354
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,010
If not, my grandfather and General Ye

355
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,100
wouldn't have
devoted themselves to his cause

356
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,420
and served him.

357
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,740
But once a person

358
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,900
reaches the peak,

359
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,380
they won't have the freedom
to make their calls.

360
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,100
It may seem like he's in control
of the imperial court.

361
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,780
But in reality,
the imperial court is controlling him.

362
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,460
My father once told me

363
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,100
that although political affairs are
merciless,

364
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,660
we must remain compassionate.

365
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,300
Instead of

366
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,620
being a slave to power,

367
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,900
it's better

368
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,220
to be compassionate martial artists
like us

369
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,540
who lead carefree lives.

370
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,860
I'm glad

371
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,180
to see you have such insights.

372
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,180
But the Academy

373
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,540
seems somewhat quiet now.

374
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,940
All my seniors are no longer here.

375
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,060
The situation in Tianqi City
has changed.

376
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,660
Those who remain here

377
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,340
will get tainted somehow.

378
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,500
Where's Senior Lei?

379
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,660
I suppose he's still around.

380
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,660
Indeed. Lei Mengsha is still here.

381
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,300
But he was sent out

382
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,940
to locate the whereabouts

383
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,420
of Yi Wenjun, Prince Jingyu's consort.

384
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,180
Yi Wenjun?

385
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,460
Has she left Tianqi City?

386
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,900
How did she leave?

387
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,020
She was abducted.

388
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,900
The person who abducted her
was highly skilled.

389
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,020
He was very swift as well.

390
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:27,980
They left

391
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,260
Tianqi City

392
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,180
before anyone could react.

393
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,420
Could it be Yun?

394
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,500
He was extremely powerful.

395
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,340
Even the Shadow Sect's sect leader

396
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,340
couldn't keep her.

397
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,540
I don't think it was him.

398
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,460
But I'm sure it's related to him.

399
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,420
I'm even sure that you'll find Yi Wenjun

400
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,300
where

401
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,580
Ye Dingzhi is.

402
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,700
What do you think about this?

403
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,060
I have an uneasy feeling about this.

404
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,740
Even since

405
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,340
I parted ways

406
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,580
with Yun in Tianqi City over a year ago,

407
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,940
I stopped receiving any news from him.

408
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,020
I, Jinxian, disciple
of Grand Eunuch Zhuoqing, have returned.

409
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,740
I, Jinwei, disciple
of Grand Eunuch Zhuoqing, have returned.

410
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,580
I, Jinyu, disciple
of Grand Eunuch Zhuoqing, have returned.

411
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,460
Zhuoqing suddenly

412
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,740
summoned all of his principal disciples,
who'd been wandering the martial world,

413
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,460
back to the palace.

414
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,020
I'm sure he's up to something.

415
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,740
Master.

416
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,500
Jinxian? You've returned, huh?

417
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,700
Forgive me, Master.

418
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,220
I permitted you

419
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,500
to wander the martial world
for three years.

420
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,460
You've done nothing wrong.

421
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,460
How was it?

422
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,020
Were there any obstacles
on your way back?

423
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,260
I'm Ye Dingzhi, an ordinary swordsman.

424
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,740
No.

425
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,420
Chancellor Chen Ru, long time no see.

426
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,100
Something's off.

427
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,020
You're not Mr. Li.

428
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,260
Mr. Li told me to come here

429
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,780
it's because his Chun Art

430
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,060
has reversed time.

431
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,500
Now,

432
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,660
he should look like a young man.

433
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,660
Lower your volume.

434
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,740
If not, all of them will hear us.

435
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,060
Eunuch Zhuoqing.

436
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,700
Long time no see.

437
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,940
Grand Eunuch, this is a sudden visit.

438
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,500
What brings you here?

439
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,260
I'm here to visit the Academy

440
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,700
as I have several questions
for you, Mr. Chen Ru.

441
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,980
Since this is a visit,

442
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,460
why didn't you enter
through the main entrance?

443
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,020
It's because they've sent their men

444
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,100
to kill Dongjun.

445
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,020
There aren't
many skilled martial artists

446
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,340
in Tianqi City

447
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:32,980
who can help them out.

448
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,940
He stands the highest chance
by visiting our academy.

449
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,780
That's why he's here to visit you.

450
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,340
I see.

451
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,260
However,

452
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,100
he made the wrong move.

453
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,780
It's because I'm here as well.

454
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,780
Show yourself.

455
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,140
You all have been
tailing me all the way.

456
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,340
I picked this spot

457
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,260
because there's no one else around.

458
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,900
I hope you all

459
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,700
won't disappoint me.

460
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,860
Tell me your names

461
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,940
so that I can know who I'm dealing with.

462
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,500
I'm Xiao Shao.

463
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,340
I'm Jiucheng.

464
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,380
I'm Fenghuang.

465
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,260
I'm Laiyi.

466
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,950
Do you all know who I am, then?

467
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,180
Cut your nonsense!

468
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,740
Brothers, attack!

469
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,700
Once,

470
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,140
I thought that title

471
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,900
was distant from me.

472
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,820
But when I left Tianqi last time,

473
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,060
I ascended the stairs
with a vat of liquor in hand.

474
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,980
Now that I've returned to Tianqi,

475
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,980
I excel in both sword and blade.

476
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,100
I still remember

477
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,100
the aspiration I had when I was young.

478
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,420
I was looking forward

479
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,340
to announcing this title of mine.

480
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,540
Hello, everyone.

481
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,860
I'm Baili Dongjun, the Liquor Deity.

482
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,420
After this battle,

483
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,860
the Liquor Deity
shall be known throughout the world.

484
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,780
Mister, please stop!

485
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:16,860
Fenghuang and I

486
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,060
have depended on each other
for over 20 years.

487
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,300
Mister,

488
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,300
as long as you're willing to spare her,

489
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,620
all four of us

490
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,860
will be willing
to serve you as your slaves!

491
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,660
I don't need any slaves.

492
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:27,900
Since you all

493
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,940
don't want to die,

494
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,660
why are you

495
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,700
trying to take other people's lives?

496
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,260
Everyone has who they wish to protect.

497
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,060
In the martial world,
our circumstances dictate our actions.

498
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,540
My foot!

499
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,130
All the martial artists I know

500
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,540
only act on their own will.

501
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,060
Your circumstances dictate your actions?

502
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:43,980
That's just an excuse you use

503
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,380
to justify your greed.

504
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,260
The martial world is vast.

505
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,900
I'm sure there's a place for you all.

506
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,420
Mr. Baili.

507
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,180
What are you...

508
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,020
They only wish to kill me.

509
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,620
They won't care about you all.

510
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,980
You should use this chance to escape.

511
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,500
Mr. Baili, we will
never forget your kindness.

512
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
The martial world is vast.

513
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,180
If there's no place for you there,

514
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
go somewhere else.

515
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,580
I'll remember that.

516
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:13,820
That was my first time

517
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,180
speaking like a martial arts expert.

518
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,820
That was quite nerve-wracking.

519
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:17,780
Let's go.

520
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,300
No, you won't!

521
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,580
Are you all the so-called top hitmen

522
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,900
from
the Top Martial Artists Hitmen List?

523
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,100
You are useless fools.

524
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,220
I thought

525
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,740
I only needed to observe the battle.

526
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,980
I never expected that I have to fight.

527
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,700
Didn't you say

528
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,740
you would let us off?

529
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,380
Eunuch,

530
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,780
you killed them in your official attire.

531
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,740
Aren't you too arrogant?

532
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,220
So what?

533
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,420
Those who see me

534
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,180
will not survive anyway.

535
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,460
Mr. Li and I

536
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,460
served in the court
for over a decade.

537
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,780
Although I don't see him often,

538
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,380
whenever I see him,

539
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,260
he leaves a deep impression.

540
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,620
You resemble him a lot.

541
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,300
However, you're not the real deal.

542
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,100
Why does that

543
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,700
touch my heart?

544
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,140
Zhuoqing, do you think

545
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,060
that Chen Ru

546
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,300
and an impostor like me

547
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,980
cannot defeat you two?

548
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,140
Why don't we give it a try?

549
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,020
Seems like you're sure

550
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,220
that I'm not Li Changsheng.

551
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,940
But I have to give you credit
where credit is due.

552
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,620
You're right.

553
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,140
I'm not him indeed.

554
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,940
It's because I'm wearing

555
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,460
a human mask.

556
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,540
Indeed.

557
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,580
You're not him.

558
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,820
That's right. I'm not him.

559
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,220
My name is Nangong Chunshui.

560
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,130
I'm a young scholar.

561
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,500
Has it never occurred to you

562
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,380
that an impostor of Li Changsheng

563
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,780
might be stronger than Li Changsheng?

564
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,820
Wait.

565
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,620
The Academy is a place for one to study.

566
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,900
No fighting allowed.

567
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,660
Fine, I'll heed your will.

568
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,020
After all,

569
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,060
you're the chancellor here.

570
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,860
Those

571
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,340
are the top four hitmen
of the Top Martial Artists Hitmen List?

572
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,380
I spent so much money

573
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:23,980
on you.

574
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,980
What a bunch of useless fools.

575
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,540
Useless!

576
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,140
Your Highness.

577
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,580
Your Highness, please be appeased.

578
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,660
If they were good,

579
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,860
the Grand Eunuch

580
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,930
wouldn't have sent us here.

581
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,620
Baili Dongjun,

582
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
your swordsmanship

583
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,740
has exceeded my expectations.

584
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,500
I do hate killing people.

585
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,620
But today,

586
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,060
I want you dead.

587
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,100
What an arrogant statement.

588
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,940
Within the palace,

589
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,140
I'm one

590
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,380
of the top ten swordsmen.

591
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,780
So you're just a small fry.

592
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,220
What did you say?

593
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,580
So what if you're one
of the top ten swordsmen?

594
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,740
Moreover, only the palace is included.

595
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,420
Do you know how vast Tianqi City is?

596
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,300
Do you know how vast Beili is?

597
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,660
Do you know how vast the world is?

598
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,580
When you face true martial arts experts,

599
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,940
they could kill you with one hand.

600
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,700
I only have eyes for the world.

601
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,740
Therefore, to me,

602
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,420
you're just a small fry.

603
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,820
If so,

604
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,380
what do you think your ranking is
in the world?

605
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,300
One of the top 100 swordsmen.

606
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,180
You must be kidding me.

607
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,620
Very soon,

608
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,740
everyone will know

609
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,540
about the name of Baili Dongjun,
the Liquor Deity.

610
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,460
It all depends on

611
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,060
whether or not you can survive this.

612
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,100
Your Excellencies,

613
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,740
seems like you two are in a rush.

614
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,380
Where are you heading?

615
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,780
Excellent swordsmanship.

616
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,060
Eunuch,

617
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,020
your skills did make me

618
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,140
see you in a new light.

619
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,100
Your father, Baili Chengfeng,

620
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,220
has a nickname called Ten Fatal Strokes.

621
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,820
Do you know why?

622
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,500
You know my father as well?

623
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,620
The swift Chengfeng
and his Ten Fatal Strokes.

624
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,740
His swordsmanship

625
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,180
relies on his speed.

626
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,060
If he doesn't win the match
after ten blows,

627
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,260
his opponent

628
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,980
will no longer fear him.

629
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,260
It's because

630
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,490
his opponent will see through his moves

631
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,140
after that.

632
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,260
His so-called Instant Kill Sword Arts

633
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,060
will no longer work by then.

634
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,700
You sparred with me
using Instant Kill Sword Arts.

635
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,100
Have you counted

636
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,700
the number of blows
we exchanged just now?

637
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,700
It's around

638
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,300
11.

639
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,020
Eunuch, are you saying
that I've lost, then?

640
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,900
I'm sorry, then.

641
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,820
You won't get to

642
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,740
deliver the 13th blow.

643
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,180
I practiced a technique by myself.

644
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,420
Even my master has no idea about it.

645
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,500
You should feel honored

646
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,940
that you'll be able to witness
its strength before dying.

647
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,780
What is this?

648
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,820
This is a technique imparted to me
by Mr. Li, the top martial artist.

649
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,540
It's the
Double-Handed Blade-Sword Technique.

650
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,060
19 Embroidery Sword Techniques

651
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,180
and the Five Tigers
Mountain-Splitting Blade.

652
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,620
So what if you're combining

653
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,580
these two

654
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,620
useless techniques?

655
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,620
Do you think you can kill me

656
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,540
with the 19 Embroidery
Sword Techniques alone?

657
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,060
It's raining.

658
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,660
Have you accepted your fate?

659
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,900
You're wrong.

660
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,740
This isn't
the 19 Embroidery Sword Techniques.

661
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,620
The left blade

662
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,060
is called Flawless.

663
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,060
Drunken Dream is utilized.

664
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:01,940
The right sword

665
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,700
is called Dustless.

666
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,580
Western Chu's Sword Song is utilized.

667
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,860
Look.

668
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,860
Even the heavens are
trying to help me here.

669
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,420
Do you understand

670
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,900
why I only have eyes for the world now?

671
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,700
I'm Baili Dongjun,

672
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,660
the Liquor Deity.

673
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,880
[No animals were harmed
during the filming of this drama.]

674
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,300
