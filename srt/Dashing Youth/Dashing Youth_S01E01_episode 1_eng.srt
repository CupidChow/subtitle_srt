00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,600
♫  I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,280
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,760
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,700

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,020

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,227

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,010

24
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,580

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,600
 Fifteen years ago,

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,120
 Beique and Xichu were successively annihilated by Beili,

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,580
 their territories brought under Beili's rule.

28
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,640
 Some remnants of Beique moved north and rebuilt their forces beyond the ice fields,

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,300
 intending to restore their country

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,420
 while former citizens of Xichu fully assimilated themselves into Beili.

31
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,120
 Among them, the prestigious Yan family of the former Xichu,

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,420
 after many years in Beili's Xinan Circuit,

33
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,100
 has become one of the two most powerful forces,

34
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:36,180
 rivaling the Gu family, a noble family from Beili.

35
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,000
 In the fifteenth year of the Taihe Era,

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,420
 Master of the Gu family, Gu Luoli, suddenly died in Babie City,

37
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,560
 which marks the beginning of the leadership struggle for the Xinan Circuit.

38
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,400
 Head of the Yan family, Yan Bietian, seized this opportunity,

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,900
 and forcibly sought a marriage alliance with Gu Jianmen,

40
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,580
 the Gu family's second young master.

41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:07,060
 As troubles lay ahead, various forces are already stirring.

42
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,300

43
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,120

44
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,020

45
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,520
Second Young Master.

46
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,800
Fifth Master just sent word. He said to avoid displeasing the Yan family,

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,820
we should replace the white with red silk banners in our mansion!

48
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,060
This is truly an insult!

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,880
Are we going to let them trample over us like this?

50
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,980
When I was young, my elder brother had someone read my fate.

51
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,500
It was said I would have lofty ambitions, but they would all be in vain,

52
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,820
and I would die a meaningless death.

53
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,560
Young Master.

54
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,040
Young Master!

55
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,020
Do you remember this sword?

56
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,580
This is the sword my brother gave me the year I went to Tianqi.

57
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,180
He told me to carry this sword, pass the final examination of the academy,

58
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,200
and not fail in my lofty ambitions.

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,480
Since then, this has been my only sword.

60
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,060
You asked me if we'll allow ourselves to be trampled on?

61
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,720
I, Gu Jianmen, entered Tianqi at 16!

62
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,420
I rode freely on horseback and overcame challenges.

63
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,860
I got drunk on half a cup of Qiulubai and soared in the sky.

64
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,260
The thing I fear least in this life is drawing my sword!

65
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,860
The thing I believe in the least is fate.

66
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,140
The Yan family wants a marriage alliance to swallow my family?

67
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,300
Ridiculous!

68
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,140
Since they think white banners are inauspicious and want red silk,

69
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,120
I'll dye these white banners red with their blood!

70
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,580
I am but a lunatic!

71
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,840

72
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,020

73
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,790

74
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,270

75
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,980

76
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,460
How could this be?

77
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,580
Isn't Chaisang City supposed to be bustling?

78
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,780
It's been thirteen days and not a single customer has come yet.

79
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,320
I'm a big shot in Qiandong City after all. Why am I suffering in this unlucky place?

80
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,700
Mister, come in for a drink?

81
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,400
It's free.

82
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,300
Let's be friends.

83
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,900
It's fine if you don't want to.

84
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,980
You have such a bad temper. Give me ten jin  (~13 lbs)  of meat.

85
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,050

86
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,960

87
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,160
Move aside!

88
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,580
Don't block my view of the little beauty.

89
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,820
Have you ever heard of the saying, "Liquor gives courage to cowards"?

90
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,540
You can only watch her from here,

91
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,900
but if you drink my liquor, you'll have the courage to go over there.

92
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,740
Get lost.

93
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,500
Fine.

94
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,020
If this were Qiandong City, I would burn down your oil shop.

95
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,000
Young man.

96
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,260
Why don't you come over and talk to me?

97
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,280
No. No. No need.

98
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,640

99
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,460
Wake up, Sikong Changfeng.

100
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,140
Sikong Changfeng.

101
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,220
What a lazy bum.

102
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,480
Since when does the server wake up later than the owner?

103
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,020
It's strange, isn't it?

104
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,900
Isn't Chaisang City the largest city in the Xinan Circuit?

105
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,820
Why hasn't a single person been on the street since I arrived?

106
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,140
And the people I've met are all quite peculiar.

107
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,540
Don't you think so?

108
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,900
Here come customers.

109
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,460

110
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,780

111
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,980
Donggui? 
  (TN: Means return to the east)

112
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,420
That's right.

113
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,200
Donggui.

114
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,740
Looks like you've come a long way.

115
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,060
Donggui Tavern is a great name. It fits you well.

116
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,800
Come in for a drink.

117
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,740
- You're the waiter? 
 - What do you mean waiter?

118
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,640
- I'm the owner. 
 - Owner?

119
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,440
You look quite young. But you run quite a big business.

120
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,220
It doesn't matter whether it's a big business or not.

121
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,220
What matters is whether the liquor is good or not.

122
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,860
You sound quite confident.

123
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,220
Of course.

124
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,220
We can't lie about the taste. You'll know as soon as you take a sip.

125
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,260
However, if you find it's not to your taste, then...

126
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,340
There must be something wrong with your palette.

127
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,100
How dare you!

128
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,100
Looks like it might rain again.

129
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,060
Since we're already here, why not go in, drink, and rest a bit?

130
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,560
Let's go.

131
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,020
My liquor isn't just for resting.

132
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,540
We'd like to taste it carefully.

133
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,340
Then please come in.

134
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,660
I don't have many customers here. You're my first group today.

135
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,320
Please come in.

136
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,660
Isn't someone already here?

137
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,080
He's not a customer. He's our waiter.

138
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,140
Waiter?

139
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,980
Sangluo. Xinfeng.

140
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,700
Zhuyu. Songlao.

141
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,160
Chang'an. Tusu. Yuanzheng.

142
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,660
Guihua. Dukang. Xuyu.

143
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,860
Shengwen.

144
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,640
Bore.

145
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,980
12 jars in total. 20 liang each.

146
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,140
Do you know the price of Yueluobai at Lanyu Pavilion, the top tavern in Xinan Circuit?

147
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,460
18 liang per jar.

148
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,500
My liquor tastes better.

149
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,580
- So I'm selling it for 20 liang. 
 - You—

150
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,980
I'll take them all.

151
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,120
Excellent. Please enjoy.

152
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,180
Young Master. Since you have nothing else to do, let's have a drink together.

153
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,460
In that case... I won't refuse.

154
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,880
What should I call you?

155
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,720
My last name is Bai, Bai Dongjun.

156
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,880
The Lord of the East wears a jade pendant that sounds like coral.

157
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,580
When the time comes, he brushes against the tips of willow trees.

158
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
It's a good name.

159
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,420
Someone else has said the same thing.

160
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,920
Come, let's drink.

161
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,960
Chang'an has a long-lasting flavor and is best enjoyed on rainy days.

162
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,740
It's a shame if you don't drink it today.

163
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,780
Have this one.

164
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,000
Yuanzheng is clear and sweet, perfect for travelers returning from afar.

165
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,440
You've come all this way. A cup of this is just right.

166
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,820
This one won't do. And it's a shame to have that one.

167
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,200
May I ask what you'd like to drink?

168
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,240
Then...

169
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,260
Xuyu it is then.

170
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,660
A moment's thought. 
  (TN: Xuyu means 'a moment']

171
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,320
Sometimes fate changes...

172
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,480
within a moment.

173
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,940
Mister, I'll drink this.

174
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,120
So, what do you think? Can I make a name with this liquor?

175
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,260
It's indeed good liquor.

176
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,460
Out of all the liquor I've ever had, it ranks in the top five.

177
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,080
Fifth?

178
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,280
Then tell me, what's number one?

179
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,540
Tianqi. Diaolou Tavern's Qiulubai.

180
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,520
Qiulubai...

181
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,440
I thought good liquor could only have one flavor.

182
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,840
Diaolou Tavern's Qiulubai offers three flavors.

183
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,590
If I can brew a pot of liquor better than Qiulubai,

184
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,340
then I can make a name for myself.

185
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,180
If you have a chance to go to Tianqi, you should give it a try.

186
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,500
I'm afraid I won't have that chance.

187
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,640
My family won't allow me to return to Tianqi.

188
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,960
Return?

189
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,660
It's truly a fine liquor.

190
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,900
I am a genius at brewing liquor.

191
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,100
Everyone, won't you have a drink?

192
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,240
This Yuanzheng is indeed sweet and refreshing.

193
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,660
Hey, waiter over there.

194
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,980
Please have a cup of liquor.

195
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,880
Looking for trouble.

196
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,280
You wake up when there's liquor?

197
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,500
It's Yuanzheng. Such fine liquor.

198
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,600

199
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,280
I want more!

200
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,600
Wastrel, don't spill my liquor.

201
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,440
My liquor...

202
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,100
Sure enough, they're here to cause trouble.

203
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,440
 So powerful.

204
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,980
 Chasing Ruins Spear?

205
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,660
You rascal. I told you not to fight, but you still did.

206
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,960
You wastrel.

207
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,420
Everyone, my waiter is just a wandering swordsman.

208
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,540
He doesn't have any manners. Please don't mind him.

209
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,380
It looks like this rain won't stop for awhile.

210
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,320
But some things cannot be delayed.

211
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,820
Young Master, let's end today's drinking here.

212
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,540
Farewell.

213
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,000
Xuezheng, stop staring into space. Let's go.

214
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,860
There's someone else inside.

215
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,900
- I can smell it. 
 - Smell?

216
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,360
The scent of a woman.

217
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,180
 A woman?

218
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,840
Are you feeling better?

219
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,140
Brother.

220
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,900
I'm all right.

221
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,160
What's that tavern's background?

222
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,160
It's run by a man. He's pretty young.

223
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,340
He's probably not skilled in martial arts. But the waiter next to him knows some.

224
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,520
But he's not that powerful.

225
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,100
But these things aren't important right now.

226
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:28,600
To avoid unexpected new problems, I'll send Kuizheng and Xuezheng to get rid of them.

227
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,380
How unexpected of you, Sir.

228
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,940
You may be young, but you're lecherous.

229
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,560

230
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,380
I haven't done anything. Don't ruin my reputation by slandering me.

231
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,720
It's just that my mother used that incense.

232
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,820
A month ago, I sent people to control Longshou Street.

233
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,820
But I just couldn't uncover the background of this tavern.

234
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,020
I originally thought it was an unowned property.

235
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,160
I didn't expect someone to appear at a critical moment

236
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,720
and open a tavern there.

237
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,020
Try it.

238
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,540
It's good liquor.

239
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,820
He's... quite interesting.

240
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,380
He even asked if this liquor could make a name for him.

241
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,680
Sangluo.

242
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,600

243
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,980
The fall of Chaisang.

244
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,660
It's a good name.

245
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,020
It truly is...

246
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,320
fine liquor.

247
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,120
It's a pity that he won't live...

248
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,520
to see it make him famous.

249
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,180
Xinan Circuit has had a major event recently. And it's a happy event.

250
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,400
According to my plan, with my brewing skills,

251
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,980
I could become the top brewmaster in Chaisang City

252
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,860
and be invited to prepare drinks for Xinan Circuit's grand celebration.

253
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,980
Then, all the heroes who come for the celebration can drink my liquor.

254
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,760
- With this— 
 - Wait.

255
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,340
What celebration?

256
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,360
Didn't you know? It's a celebration for the Gu family, the Xinan Circuit leader,

257
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,220
with the second-best Yan family in a marriage alliance.

258
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,660
- Bai Dongjun. 
 - Don't be disrespectful. Call me Sir.

259
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,480
I felt something peculiar about this street since the beginning.

260
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,440
I only stayed because I coveted your fine liquor.

261
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,100
But now I regret it a bit. I should have left sooner.

262
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,240
What do you mean?

263
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,060
We've accidentally gotten involved in the struggle between the Gu and Yan families.

264
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,660
Not just them. The group of people just now as well.

265
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,220
After wandering the world for so many years, I've a sense for these things.

266
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,420
So, can you sense what they're after?

267
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,540
Earlier you mentioned the Gu family and the Yan family marriage alliance.

268
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,180
But the first young master of the Gu family suddenly died not long ago.

269
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,340
If this celebration is real, it's very suspicious.

270
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,780
If he's already dead, how can they get married?

271
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,180
The Gu family has another son.

272
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,820
Have you heard of the poem, "Fenghua is unpredictable and Qingge is elegant"?

273
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,860
'Zhuomo is eloquent and Lingyun is crazy. Liuyue is peerless and Mochen is ugly.'

274
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,980
"Qingxiang is talented and Wuming is nowhere."

275
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,780
That doesn't rhyme at all.

276
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,760
This is the list of young masters published by Bai Xiao Sect.

277
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,940
It's not about rhyming but about relevance.

278
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,580
It talks about Beili's eight exceptional talents.

279
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,100
The cunning Young Master Fenghua, the refined and elegant Young Master Qingge,

280
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,740
the eloquent Young Master Zhuomo, the arrogant and unbridled Young Master Lingyun,

281
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,860
the peerlessly handsome Young Master Liuyue, the ugly Young Master Mochen,

282
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,460
the exceptionally talented Young Master Qingxiang, and...

283
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,660
the currently vacant Young Master Wuming.

284
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,860
So, what does this have to do with Chaisang City and the Gu family?

285
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,080
Young Master Lingyun's last name is...

286
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,260
Gu.

287
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:45,360
Therefore, the groom of the Gu family in this marriage alliance is Young Master Lingyun, Gu Jianmen.

288
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,660
Young Master Lingyun. The name sounds quite marvelous.

289
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,540
Let's go.

290
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,200
- Where are we going? 
 - The Gu's Mansion.

291
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,620
Let's invite Gu Jianmen here for a drink.

292
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,300
"With soaring ambition, he rises to the skies."

293
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,900
That sounds like he's someone amazing.

294
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,720
Once he drinks my liquor and spreads the word,

295
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,320
my fame will soon follow.

296
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,420
All right!

297
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,480
Walk against the wall.

298
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,180
Aren't you taking me to the Gu's Mansion?

299
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,540
- Why does it feel like we're sneaking in like thieves? 
 - Shush.

300
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,280
If we're out in the open, we won't make it off Longshou Street.

301
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,540
I didn't expect a wastrel like you to know so much.

302
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,740
Of course.

303
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,400
Having wandered the martial world for years, I'd be dead long ago without my instincts.

304
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,200
Come on.

305
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,280
- What's the matter? 
 - Someone's here!

306
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,280
Sikong Changfeng, look.

307
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,280
- Why did the sky suddenly turn dark? 
 - Shush.

308
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,660

309
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,920
Young Master, the sky...

310
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,340
It's a ghost!

311
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,460
Young Master.

312
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,680
Stop right there!

313
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,500
You must be a guest from Dark River.

314
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,300

315
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,300
Su Li, don't be rude.

316
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,880
A respected guest has arrived.

317
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,370
Would you like to have a drink with me?

318
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,240
Thank you for offering. But no.

319
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,440
Is it because you don't trust me, Gu Jianmen?

320
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,760
If there's anyone in Beili that Dark River can trust, it would be you.

321
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,320
Everyone knows Dark River is a feared presence in the Martial World.

322
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,040
Wherever someone from Dark River appears, there will be slaughter and death.

323
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,520
Do evil assassins like you even need friends?

324
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,340
That's a bit too harsh.

325
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,380
Even assassins need friends.

326
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:56,680
Just like Dark River has chosen you, we believe you can help us with certain things.

327
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,820
And we can also help you with some matters.

328
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,000
Some important matters.

329
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,300
So, in Dark River terms, friends are merely those who share mutual benefits?

330
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,420
Isn't that more reliable?

331
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,580
You're supposed to have many friends.

332
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,640
But where are they now?

333
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,520
It doesn't matter where they are.

334
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,060
Your brother never aspired to power.

335
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:33,100
Yet, he still died in Babie City, 300 li from his home.

336
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:38,460
Young Master Lingyun... your enemies won't tolerate you, let alone your brother.

337
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,720
The enemies have already made their move.

338
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,280
Dark River will send our best assassins here to help you

339
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,060
and we'll ensure the Yan family doesn't have a chance to return alive.

340
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,460
My brother was like a father to me.

341
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,180
I swore to avenge his death.

342
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,220
But I don't need Dark River to help me with it.

343
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,820
The famed sword Yuexue.

344
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,880
It's said that this sword's edge is so sharp that it can cut a snowflake in midair.

345
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,700
Do you intend to kill me?

346
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,780
If Dark River wants a foothold in Xinan Circuit, shouldn't you show some sincerity?!

347
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,480
Come on! Let me see your sincerity!

348
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,540
Sure.

349
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,040
Good!

350
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,080

351
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,600
Young Master!

352
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,340

353
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,860
Fine blades rain down mercilessly in a killing blow, like evening rain.

354
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,320
You are clearly a ferocious assassin from Dark River.

355
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,440
But your sword carries a spirit unique only to swordsmen.

356
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,740
From the beginning, you had no intention of cooperating with us.

357
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,900
Why did you force me to use my most dreadful move?

358
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,180
If I tell you...

359
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:19,710
it's because my elder brother died, and I'm trapped here unable to leave,

360
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,320
so I really wanted to have a good fight with someone,

361
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,560
will you pierce me with your sword?

362
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,360
After you've thought it through, you can find me at Qingsong Inn.

363
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,820
I'll wait seven days for you there.

364
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,060
What's your name?

365
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,300
I'm not supposed to have a name.

366
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,860
But I'm willing to tell you my name.

367
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,940
My name is Su Muyu.

368
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,120
Farewell, Young Master.

369
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,220
Young Master, he...

370
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:17,840
Among the three prominent families of Dark River, the Mu family is renowned for their secretive art mastery.

371
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,940
Su Muyu definitely didn't come to Chaisang City alone.

372
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,820
Beyond these walls, members of the Mu family were certainly stationed to protect him.

373
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,400
Even the sudden dark sky is their doing.

374
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,230
As for these mysterious methods, it's best not to dwell on them if you can't figure them out.

375
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,820
Then, about what he just mentioned...

376
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,120
Dark River's uninvited presence looms ﻿with sinister intentions that send chills down one's spine.

377
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,380
Our enemies are merely criminals in the mortal world.

378
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,120
But the ones who come to make a deal are ghosts from hell.

379
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,300
That ghost should be gone, right?

380
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,520
How odd. The sky has brightened again.

381
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,640
I have an ominous feeling. Let's leave here at once.

382
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,920
Run!

383
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,200
What did you two see?

384
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,740
Umbrella Ghost, they've been waiting here for quite some time.

385
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,020
We didn't see anything.

386
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,900
Go on.

387
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,420
Leave this place.

388
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,360
- Better yet, leave this city. 
 - Umbrella Ghost—

389
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,380
Leave now.

390
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,140
 Thank you.

391
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,700

392
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,120
That was terrifying. I only snuck out to open a tavern, and sell my liquor.

393
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,600
It nearly cost me my life. That doesn't make sense at all.

394
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,340
Sir.

395
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,340
You've got to be kidding me.

396
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,540
- It's like trouble is brewing everywhere. 
 - What?

397
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,170
We just got out of trouble and here comes more.

398
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,960
Mister, what took you so long?

399
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,640
Where did you go?

400
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,860
I need to buy liquor from you.

401
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,080
Unfortunately, all the liquor is sold out. Come back another day.

402
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,700
Another day? There might not be another chance.

403
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,950

404
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,800
The one who won't have a chance is you.

405
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,080
We managed to avoid the first fight, but not the second one.

406
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,520
So there will be a fight today.

407
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,860
Sir, find a place to hide.

408
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,480
Sikong Changfeng. Be careful.

409
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,780
With your spear techniques, you're no ordinary person!

410
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,840
Who are you?

411
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,480
Coincidentally, I truly am an ordinary person.

412
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,480
I never knew my parents, grew up fed by others,

413
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,380
lived in rundown temples, never had a surname, and no one ever gave me a name.

414
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,400
But living life empty-handed isn't bad either!

415
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,120
I gave myself the surname Sikong.

416
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,580
I also wish to become the wind, moving forward, never turning back.

417
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,340
So my name is...

418
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,140
Sikong Changfeng. 
  (TN: Changfeng means 'a gale')

419
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,660
So this is the real boss?

420
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,840
So you two are in this together.

421
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,800
We've never met before nor had any grudges.

422
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,880
I even offered you a jar of my fine liquor. Why do you want to kill me?

423
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,440
Surely it's not because my liquor is too expensive, right?

424
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,620
Blame yourself, for opening your tavern at the wrong location.

425
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,120
You must be joking.

426
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,600
Life is so precious. Everyone only has one life.

427
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,940
We have no right to take away someone else's life randomly.

428
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,420
- Idiot. 
 - What did you call me?

429
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,380
Sir, haven't you figured it out yet?

430
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,340
Gu Mansion has been surrounded by these people.

431
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,040
We're in their way. Calling you an idiot isn't wrong.

432
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,880
Do you actually think you can reason with people like him?

433
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,620
Butcher, let me ask you a question.

434
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,760
- Go ahead. 
 - If we leave now, will you let us go?

435
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,780
- No. 
 - Enough talking, then. Let's fight!

436
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,460
You haven't learned the spear techniques completely. You stole them.

437
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,320
- I know who you are. 
 - "Face justice in life and meet the King of Hell in death."

438
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,680
You're Yan Qiansui, the Golden-Mouthed King Yan.

439
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,100
Sir, leave now.

440
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,480
I came all this way here to open a tavern.

441
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,040
I didn't come unprepared.

442
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,020
I said, leave.

443
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:19,486
Young man, where are you going?

444
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,840
Why are you avoiding me? Am I not beautiful enough?

445
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,580
Of course.

446
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,380
Where do you think you're going?

447
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,040
Over there.

448
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,920
Why are you still here?

449
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,800
Look up there.

450
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,900
I underestimated you, Sir.

451
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,000
I didn't expect your lightness skill to be so good when your martial arts skills are mediocre.

452
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,540
But if you want to defeat me, these skills are not enough.

453
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:13,540
How about this? The both of you are handsome, so I can't bear to kill you both.

454
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,460
- How about... 
 - How about letting us go?

455
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,760
Are you kidding me?

456
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,420
How about I spare one of you?

457
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
And the other one will die.

458
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,420
What do you think?

459
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:33,420
You can discuss who gets to die and who lives.

460
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,200
- Bai Dongjun, I— 
 - I know.

461
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,460
We're just strangers who happened to meet.

462
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,480
Our friendship, in the battle just now, has run its course.

463
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,840
- I understand. 
 - What?

464
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,220
I didn't even finish my sentence. You understand nothing.

465
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,620
I still have one last skill to show.

466
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,600
With this skill, the one in front of me will surely die.

467
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,640
But I might not survive either.

468
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,120
Do your best to protect yourself.

469
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,560
If I survive, I'll get you out of here.

470
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,800
- How confident are you? 
 - One in 10.

471
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,520
One in 10? With only a one in 10 certainty, you dare say it so confidently.

472
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,980
It's just a dying man's gamble.

473
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,220
Sikong Changfeng.

474
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:24,800
If we both survive today, I'll tell you about it.

475
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,480
You're not dying. You'll survive.

476
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,100
Xuezheng?

477
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,960
It's really a terrible name.

478
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,260
How about a new introduction?

479
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,120
- My last name is Lei. 
 - Lei? Which Lei?

480
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,080
Lei of the Lei family from the Lei Fortress?

481
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,440
You could say that.

482
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,740
Although the Lei Fortress may not like a disobedient descendant like me,

483
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,420
I still acknowledge this family.

484
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,660
You're the Eloquent Young Master Zhuomo, Lei Mengsha?

485
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:21,760

486
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,536

487
00:42:25,536 --> 00:42:27,580

488
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:40,130

489
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:50,778
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

490
00:42:50,778 --> 00:42:58,558
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

491
00:42:58,558 --> 00:43:08,306
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

492
00:43:09,118 --> 00:43:16,340
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

493
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,472
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure.  ♫

494
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,932
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

495
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:26,072
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

496
00:43:26,072 --> 00:43:30,732
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

497
00:43:30,732 --> 00:43:34,212
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

498
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:37,172
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

499
00:43:37,172 --> 00:43:39,792
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

500
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:44,212
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

501
00:43:44,212 --> 00:43:48,572
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

502
00:43:48,572 --> 00:43:51,872
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

503
00:43:51,872 --> 00:43:57,152
♫  I met you  ♫

504
00:44:32,912 --> 00:44:41,812
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

505
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:49,672
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

506
00:44:49,672 --> 00:44:59,332
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

507
00:45:00,112 --> 00:45:07,352
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

508
00:45:07,352 --> 00:45:10,612
♫  As if destined by fate,   ♫

509
00:45:10,612 --> 00:45:13,012
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

510
00:45:13,012 --> 00:45:17,272
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

511
00:45:17,272 --> 00:45:21,872
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

512
00:45:21,872 --> 00:45:25,212
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

513
00:45:25,212 --> 00:45:28,412
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

514
00:45:28,412 --> 00:45:30,792
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

515
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:35,152
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

516
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:39,572
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

517
00:45:39,572 --> 00:45:42,952
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

518
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:48,352
♫  I met you  ♫
