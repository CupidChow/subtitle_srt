00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,500
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,680
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,300
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,340
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12

♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13

♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,520
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,600

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,720

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,227

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,420
It's another draw?

25
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,020
Again.

26
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,820
No more.

27
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,260
No matter how strong I am, I'm nothing compared to the long-lost sword dance.

28
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,440
Swordsmen of our generation are fortunate to witness the complete Xichu's Sword Song.

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,500
It's more precious than obtaining a valuable sword.

30
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,020
Dustless should be yours.

31
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,000
Catch!

32
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,060
Uncle?

33
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,000
Time to go!

34
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,580
Elder, this...

35
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,800
We've already lost the sword. Why bother staying?

36
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,620
Uncle, I was just getting into the mood. Why did we leave?

37
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,620
I thought Ye Dingzhi was an interesting fellow.

38
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,260
- I wanted to make friends with him. 
 - Look at the situation.

39
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,820
You want to make friends with him?

40
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,540
I don't know where you picked up your sword techniques.

41
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,660
I just know that those swordsmen would skin us alive if we remained there.

42
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,420
Let's go!

43
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,900
 That silly kid has picked up something amazing.

44
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,800
After him! Capture him! That's Xichu's Sword Song!

45
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,020
What are you doing? Get out of the way!

46
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,140
Everyone. The banquet isn't over yet. Why are you in a hurry to leave?

47
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,300
You want to stop us?

48
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,260
If you take another step forward, I'll kill you.

49
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,480
Count me in.

50
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,571
Nephew, since there's some distance before we reach Qiandong City,

51
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:42,420
you'd better tell me where you learned those techniques!

52
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:49,340
But I have the feeling... just leaving like that...

53
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,300
means... we're missing out on something...

54
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,600
Don't try to change the topic. What would we miss?

55
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:05,960
Missing out... on a reunion.

56
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,140
 Brother Yun! Brother Yun!

57
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,820
 Ye Yun, I'm coming!

58
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,260

59
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,560
 Ye Yun, I'm here!

60
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,620
 You skipped the martial arts class at the Marquis's Mansion again.

61
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,800
 I was excited. He's telling the story of the White Feather Sword Deity today.

62
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,180
 And it's the chapter about how White Feather Sword Deity wielded his sword

63
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,060
 and headed west to save his disciple.

64
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,180
 I heard that it was exciting.

65
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,940

66
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,140
 Over here! Brother Yun, over here!

67
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,860
 The world's turmoil arises from our generation.

68
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,660
 Tonight we sing and dance, and all lies in words.

69
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,140
 - Speaking of the White Feather Sword Deity... 
 - Brother Yun, try this.

70
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,500
 He wore a helmet shaped like a lion, adorned with a tiger's head.

71
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,100
 He wore a sheath of Ruyi chain mail with a bright red robe underneath.

72
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
 His boots were in the shape of the tiger heads.

73
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,980
 Riding a white steed, wielding a pair of dual blades.

74
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,380
 He was awe-inspiring. He fought from dawn to dusk.

75
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:38,140
 Defeating the Eight Hammers fearlessly.

76
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,100
 The story of the White Feather Sword Deity was incredible.

77
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,057
 Next time I pass by the city plaque, I'll make sure to check

78
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:51,300
 and see if White Feather Sword Deity's sword is still there.

79
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,900
 "Who in the world can block my blow?"

80
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:01,500
 When he said that, both of your eyes were glowing.

81
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,140
 Young Lady, it's time to go.

82
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,360
 Dongjun, Brother Yun, I'll take my leave. Good night.

83
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,820
 Good night.

84
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,260
 Make sure to sleep when you get back.

85
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,220
 Don't light candles and read story books in secret. It'll hurt your vision.

86
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,840
 I never did that. Brother Yun, that's not true!

87
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,500
 The next chapter should be about the White Feather Sword Deity meeting

88
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,020
 the Liquor Deity, and traveling the Martial World together.

89
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,280
 It's sure to be more exciting.

90
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,580
 I want to be like the White Feather Sword Deity.

91
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,480
 A deity like that and do whatever I want.

92
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,020
 Me too.

93
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,980
 I heard from Grandfather, Brother Yun, you're smart and good at studying.

94
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,140
 I'm sure you'll inherit your family's legacy and become a great general.

95
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,660
 Why would I want to become a general?

96
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,620
 When I grow up, I want to travel the Martial World

97
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,340
 and become a free-spirited swordsman who brings justice to the people.

98
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,620
 Then take me with you!

99
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,940
 If I bring you with me, the Marquis will hunt me down with a sword in hand.

100
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,380
 No way. Your grandfather is famous for instilling fear with his killing abilities.

101
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,900
 Nonsense! My grandfather is obviously the gentlest person in the world.

102
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,540
 Anyway, I'm following you for sure!

103
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,580
 Brother Yun, aren't you my older brother?

104
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,020
 A good older brother should bring along his younger brother.

105
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,560
 Sure. Let's make a promise.

106
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,260
 What promise?

107
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,620
 When I'm 20 and you're 18, we'll leave Tianqi together.

108
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,540
 One of us will head north and the other will head south.

109
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,420
 We'll travel the Martial World alone.

110
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,940
 By the time we become deities, that's when we'll meet again.

111
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,620
 What do you think?

112
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,420
 Sure!

113
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,980
 If you want to be the Sword Deity, I won't compete with you.

114
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,260
 The White Feather Sword Deity's best friend is the Liquor Deity.

115
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,780
 Then, I'll be the Liquor Deity!

116
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,800
 Great. We'll travel the Martial World as the Sword and Liquor Deity!

117
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,400
 Travel the Martial World with a sword and liquor!

118
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,980
 Ye Yu, the Great General, is arrogant due to his achievements.

119
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,460
 He abuses his power for personal gain and disrespects the saints.

120
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,180
 Someone has filed a complaint, suspecting him of treason and conspiring with our enemies.

121
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:24,460
 However, on account of his contributions to the state,

122
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,260
 His family will be executed while his clansmen are exiled.

123
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,380
 Ye Yu shall be taken away and sent to see His Majesty.

124
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,220
 End of decree.

125
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,160
Brother Ye, why are you drinking alone?

126
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,480
The night breeze rustles gently.

127
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,300
While the moon shines brightly.

128
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,920
Drinking alone...

129
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,360
makes it more beautiful.

130
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,500
I apologize then.

131
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,080
Now, you have another companion.

132
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,520
Brother Ye, do you know that young man?

133
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:05,200
I noticed that you looked shocked when you heard his name.

134
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,180
It wasn't the kind of shocked look after hearing the name of someone famous

135
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,740
or encountering a talent for the first time.

136
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,920
It seemed like the shocked expression one puts on

137
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,680
after an unexpected reunion with an old acquaintance.

138
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,780
Brother Wang, not only are you a skillful swordsman,

139
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,100
but you're also pretty good at observing people.

140
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,860
But I've also heard that there was a prodigy on Mount Wangcheng.

141
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,520
He exhibited extraordinary talent at the age of 10.

142
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,580
Brother Wang, I assume you're here to retrieve the sword for him.

143
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,160
But why didn't your junior come with you?

144
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,960
We're fortunate today. We have excellent liquor and a bright moon.

145
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,600
How nice, how nice.

146
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,540
Brother Ye, why don't we chat about something else?

147
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,300
Forget talking.

148
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,440
I'm off.

149
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,240
You're leaving already?

150
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,200
I have something important to do. I'm afraid I won't make it if I remain here.

151
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,700

152
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,600
Xiao Baili, wake up. Hey.

153
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,500
Wake up.

154
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,840
Uncle. Where are we?

155
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,180
Qiandong City.

156
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,800
The people picking you up are already here.

157
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,640
I'll ask you one last time.

158
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,000
Where did you learn Xichu's Sword Song?

159
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,660
I...

160
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,940
Mister Wen.

161
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,620
Vice General Chen, what are you doing here?

162
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,880
Did Grandfather tell you to pick me up?

163
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,080
Tie Baili Dongjun up.

164
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,680
Let me go!

165
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,180
How dare you, Chen Sheng?

166
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,340
It's only been a few months. How dare you do this to me!

167
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,940
I'll report you to my grandfather!

168
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,220
- Escort him back to the mansion. 
  - Yes, Sir!

169
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,460
- Let go of me! 
 - Move!

170
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,080
Mister Wen.

171
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,120
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

172
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,700
Mister Wen, will you spend a few days in the city?

173
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,900
Or will you return to the Wen Family immediately?

174
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,280
Since I'm already here, I'll visit my sister.

175
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,820
I'll also see how Baili ends up.

176
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,640

177
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,880

178
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,860
 Grandfather! Where are you?

179
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,580
 Grandfather!

180
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,660
 Grandfather, come and save me!

181
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,420
Grandfather!

182
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,220
Grandfather... come and save me!

183
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,800
Someone is bullying your favorite grandson.

184
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,880
You've been full of valor your whole life.

185
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,820
But now, you allow someone to humiliate your grandson.

186
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,860
Hey, do you know where my grandfather is?

187
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,380
Why are you pretending to be mute?

188
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,380
I have a question.

189
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,520
Did my father tell you to do this?

190
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,540
Speak up.

191
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,180
Meat.

192
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,180
Grandfather.

193
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,040
Grandfather, come and save me.

194
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,040
Grandfather!

195
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,980

196
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,260
Don't bother. I can't live up to that.

197
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,300
 Sir!

198
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,880
- What are you doing here? 
 - Who am I?

199
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,220
I'm your father. Of course, I'm here.

200
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,260
You little brat!

201
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,140
Dodging me?

202
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,300
- You're quite daring, aren't you? 
 - How dare you say that?

203
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,180
Say that again!

204
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,160
- Is this how you talk to your father? 
 - Does your father know you're doing this?

205
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,380
- Don't try to intimidate me with him. 
 - Don't try to intimidate me, then.

206
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,100
Rebelling? I...

207
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,960
Listen. Your grandfather went to Tianqi to attend the grand court assembly a month ago.

208
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,480
He won't be back anytime soon.

209
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,680
Right now, I'm in charge of our mansion.

210
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,200
I'm the one who's in charge when Grandfather isn't here. It'll never be your turn.

211
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,440
- Did you damage your brain? 
 - You're the one whose brain is damaged!

212
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,580
You brat!

213
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,660
Stop right there! How dare you run!

214
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,810
Grandfather! Grandfather!

215
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,100
- Grandfather! 
 - Stop right there!

216
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,620
You brat...

217
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,140
- Our mansion is finally lively again now that Young Master is back. 
  - Stop running!

218
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,000
It's because you people spoil him too much.

219
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,780
 How dare you still run!

220
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,860
Look at you right now.

221
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,560
More and more like the wife of a rich man.

222
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,820
No resemblance of your former self at all.

223
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,860
Brother, what are you saying?

224
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,140
Aren't I the wife of a rich man now?

225
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,220
Didn't you always avoid staying in my mansion because you disliked my current demeanor?

226
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,800
Why did you have a change of heart and come to visit me today?

227
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,040
All of you may leave.

228
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,780
What is it?

229
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,320
You're being so secretive.

230
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,640
A sword?

231
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,180
What an excellent sword.

232
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,460
I've seen all kinds of famous swords in my life.

233
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,080
But none of them are as good as this.

234
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,380
Brother, which of the world's top 10 famous swords is this?

235
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,220
It's none of them.

236
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,990
This is a newly forged sword by the young master of Famous Swords Manor, Wei Changfeng.

237
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,020
A Celestial Level Sword called Dustless.

238
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,340
This is a Celestial Level Sword from Famous Swords Manor?

239
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,080
It's been many years since I've seen a sword of this level.

240
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,000
So... when the Forest of Swords opened, you went to compete?

241
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,700
If you used poison to compete for the sword,

242
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,260
all the swordsmen in the world will have become your enemy.

243
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,820
All the swordsmen in the world have become someone else's enemy.

244
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,660
I did go to the Forest of Swords.

245
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,000
But I didn't win the sword.

246
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,400
Your son did it himself.

247
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,760
Brother, stop lying to me.

248
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,740
My son barely knows any sword techniques.

249
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,040
How could he compete for such a sword in the Forest of Swords?

250
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,060
I told you to stop spoiling him.

251
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,800
You retrieved it for him, right?

252
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,540
You're afraid my husband might be mad, so you're saying he took it, right?

253
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,820
- I'm being serious. 
 - Fine. Tell me, then.

254
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,240
What kind of sword technique did my son use?

255
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,860
It's Xi...

256
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,140
Xichu's Sword Song, Heaven's Path.

257
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,160
Say that again?

258
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,980
Xichu's Sword Song, Heaven's Path!

259
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,040
Now, I know you're lying.

260
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,940
Famous Swords Manor, Wushuang City,

261
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,260
and all the swordsmen in the world witnessed it themselves.

262
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,500
Perhaps more than just the swordsmen in the world.

263
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,260

264
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,420

265
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,540

266
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,540

267
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,480

268
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,460
Your Majesty.

269
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,020
Zhuoqing.

270
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,640
Your Majesty.

271
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,220
What's the matter?

272
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,020
This is the news we received from the Shadow Sect today.

273
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,540

274
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,880

275
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,020
Years ago, Baili Luochen was ordered on a military expedition.

276
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,780
He captured the last city of Xichu.

277
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,760
The Xichu's Scholarly Deity and Sword Deity died in battle.

278
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,060
Now you're saying that Xichu's Sword Song has resurfaced?

279
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,220
Could it be that both of the deities are still alive?

280
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,420
Where's Baili Luochen?

281
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,920
 He's already left Tianqi after the grand court assembly.

282
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,900
 He's on his way back to Qiandong City.

283
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,980

284
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,160
Who used that sword technique?

285
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,620
Baili Dongjun.

286
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,060
Baili Luochen's only grandson?

287
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,180
That's right.

288
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:53,330
Back then, the Marquis Zhenxi attacked Xichu under the late Emperor's orders.

289
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,540
The Marquis Zhenxi was great friends with Xichu's Sword Deity and Scholarly Deity.

290
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,900
The late Emperor issued that order to test his loyalty.

291
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,860
His vice general was the late Emperor's trusted aide.

292
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,520
He carried a secret order.

293
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,080
If the Marquis Zhenxi hesitated even the slightest bit,

294
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,020
he could have been replaced at any time.

295
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:18,360
However, everyone in the world knew the result from that war.

296
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,660
Xichu was defeated.

297
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,660
Both the Sword Deity and Scholarly Deity were killed.

298
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,440
Back then, I saw the body of the Sword Deity myself.

299
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,820
May I make a bold assumption?

300
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,140
If the Scholarly Deity survived the battle,

301
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,480
that means Baili Luochen has failed the late Emperor.

302
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,220
Although Xichu's Sword Deity had impeccable swordsmanship,

303
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,120
he was just a normal martial artist.

304
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,920
However, the Scholarly Deity mastered the Art of Drugs.

305
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,800
He could make an ordinary soldier fight against 100 soldiers.

306
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,500
He was even capable of reviving the dying to make them fight again.

307
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,690
That sorcery was the reason why a small border country like Xichu

308
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,400
could stand up against Beili.

309
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,960
If the Scholarly Deity is still alive,

310
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,100
he'd be more fearsome than the Sword Deity.

311
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,220
During that battle, even if Xichu's Scholarly Deity did survive,

312
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,300
I'm sure he was seriously wounded.

313
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,540
Otherwise, he wouldn't have hidden himself in Qiandong City for so many years.

314
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,040
I'll send someone to Qiandong City immediately,

315
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,580
and bring back that remnant of Xichu.

316
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,820
Summon Ruofeng.

317
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,760
Entrust this task to Ruofeng.

318
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

319
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,580
When I first reached Chaisang City,

320
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,660
I smelled the stench of blood.

321
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,100
But I had no choice. Old Gu was in trouble.

322
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,480
My surname is Lei. I'm a member of Lei Fortress. I had to rescue him.

323
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,160
Back then, I gave him a punch, you know?

324
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,740
Because a handsome and charming person like myself can't leave weak people in a lurch.

325
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,340
That's why I rescued them.

326
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,140
So...

327
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,700
you guys were able to resolve the crisis of Chaisang...

328
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,820
all because of Young Master Baili's help.

329
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,623
If I didn't risk exposing my identity and protect him,

330
00:25:31,623 --> 00:25:36,260
that brat would've had his throat slit by Yan Bietian.

331
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,700
But speaking of him, I do like his temperament.

332
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,020
Therefore, in my heart, I've already taken him as my sidekick.

333
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,460
Old Seven, judging from your expression, you're cooking up something.

334
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,500
The main academy exam will begin soon.

335
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,100
Are you saying that...

336
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,860
Perhaps, he'll be Master's last disciple

337
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,340
and our junior.

338
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,940
But no matter what, he's the young master of Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion.

339
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,260
Will the Marquis Zhenxi let him come to Tianqi?

340
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,000
Impossible.

341
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,500
Besides, he's terrible at martial arts.

342
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,260
Only his Qinggong is dependable.

343
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,740
I was just saying.

344
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,400
What's wrong?

345
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,580
Xichu's Sword Song has resurfaced.

346
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,340
And the person who used this sword technique is the one we were talking about.

347
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,880
What did you say?

348
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,700
The Marquis Zhenxi has mastered Xichu's Sword Song?

349
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,580
Did I mention the Marquis Zhenxi just now?

350
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,620
Xiao Baili...

351
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,940
What did you say? That kid can wield a sword?

352
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,660
He couldn't even defeat Yan Bietian's guards!

353
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,440
Not only does he know how to wield a sword, but he also practices

354
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,300
the most famous sword technique in the world.

355
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,180
Your Highness, someone from the palace is here.

356
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,780
 Who are you? How did you get in here?

357
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,740
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude upon this place.

358
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,300
 I'm trying to hide from my family.

359
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,780
 For some reason, they hired another teacher to teach me.

360
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,500
 I kept running until I came here, Grandfather.

361
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,980
 You came inside just like that?

362
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,780
 That's right. I scaled the wall.

363
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,040
 But I slipped and fell into this place.

364
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,720
 Over there...

365
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,140
 This...

366
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,720
 This...

367
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,380
 But I fell into a courtyard.

368
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,900
 I set up a formation outside the courtyard.

369
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,020
 Ordinary people cannot reach this place.

370
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,860
 Since you could break through my formation, that means we're destined to meet.

371
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,300
 Are you willing to be my student?

372
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,980
 Grandfather, what will you teach me?

373
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,240
 What will I teach you?

374
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,020
 Is it martial arts again? I'm not interested.

375
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,180
 Then our destiny together ends here.

376
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,060
 Go on now.

377
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,900
 You know liquor?

378
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,180
 In the future, I want to become the Liquor Deity!

379
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,460
 Then, Little Liquor Deity, come and have a sniff.

380
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,020
 It has such a rich and fragrant smell. Where did you buy this?

381
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,980
 I want to buy some too.

382
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,140
 You can't get this liquor anywhere else.

383
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,320
 I brewed it myself.

384
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,540
 Sir, please be my master. Teach me how to brew liquor.

385
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,180
Master.

386
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:48,600
Have I... got you in huge trouble this time?

387
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,240
Donglai!

388
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,540
 Young Master, I'm not Donglai.

389
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,880
Where's Donglai?

390
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,980
Since when did I have a female servant?

391
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,740
 Young Master, Donglai is your trusted servant.

392
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,460
 But your father transferred him to the western courtyard.

393
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,340
I'm Rui'er. I was transferred from another courtyard.

394
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,420
When will my grandfather be back?

395
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,860
Today, I heard from the messenger that it'd take him at least three to four days.

396
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,260
 I can't afford to wait any longer. I have to see Master immediately.

397
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,060
Rui'er, head to Luocheng Alley immediately. Find a herbal medicine shop called Huairen.

398
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,300
Notify the people inside to head in the direction of Tianqi immediately

399
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,240
to they meet up with Grandfather's army. Did you hear me?

400
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,340
Young Master, are you trying to get the Marquis back sooner to stand up for you?

401
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,980
 But I'm your mother's servant.

402
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,660
Stop pretending.

403
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,540
I'm sure my mother staged an act and lied to my father so that you could serve me.

404
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,040
- We're on the same side. 
 - Oh my.

405
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,740
Young Master, who gave you such confidence?

406
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:02,640
Of course, it's the tacit understanding between my mother and me.

407
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,000

408
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,380
That brat. I'll deal with him.

409
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,460
Yesterday, my brother told me that they went to the Forest of Swords on their way back.

410
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,620
I think your brother did the right thing.

411
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,980
It's time for Dongjun to learn how the world works.

412
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,000
If not, he'll really turn into a good-for-nothing.

413
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:48,260
They went to the Forest of Swords and retrieved a Celestial Level Sword.

414
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,980
Dongjun retrieved it himself.

415
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,200
My brother did nothing.

416
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,560
He used... Xichu's Sword Song, Heaven's Path.

417
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,500
 Baili Dongjun, you're something else, aren't you?

418
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,180
Greetings Heir Apparent, long time no see.

419
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,100
Where are you going in such a hurry?

420
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,900
Brat, how dare you come outside?

421
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,220
Who released you? Who was it?

422
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,140
Me.

423
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,200
Father.

424
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,740
Tie Baili Chengfeng up!

425
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,360
 Yes, Sir!

426
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,880
Heir Apparent? What are you doing here?

427
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,420
Is it fun being tied up?

428
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,100
Why don't you take a break in the woodshed?

429
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,160
Dongjun.

430
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,040
Mother.

431
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,460
Father. Chengfeng is your heir, after all.

432
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,620
I know you dote on Dongjun,

433
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:48,020
but you've already embarrassed and punished him.

434
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,100
How about untying him?

435
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,860
- That's right, Father. I— 
 - Hey...

436
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,160
Did I tell you to stand up?

437
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,360
Dongjun. What do you think?

438
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,920
Then... Then, untie him.

439
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,580
Dongjun.

440
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,860
You went on a long journey. Have you learned anything new?

441
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,200
I learned plenty of things from my trip. Grandfather, have you ever heard of this poem?

442
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,340
"Fenghua is unpredictable and Qingge is elegant."

443
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,540
"Zhuomo is eloquent and Lingyun is crazy."

444
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,060
"Liuyue is peerless and Mochen is ugly."

445
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,640
"Qingxiang is talented and Wuming is nowhere."

446
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,880
The Eight Young Masters of Beili.

447
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,200
They're major figures that are renowned in the world.

448
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:52,460
That's right. During my trip, I encountered Qingge, Zhuomo, Lingyun, Liuyue, and Mochen.

449
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,700
Not only that, but I also did them a favor.

450
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,220
Come here, Dongjun.

451
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,980
According to what I know, they usually stay in Tianqi City.

452
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,060
They came because of Gu Jianmen.

453
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,320
They traveled far to Chaisang for the sake of their friend.

454
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,160
With their loyalty alone, I think they're worthy of becoming friends.

455
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:23,580
Dongjun, I heard from your uncle that you retrieved a sword from the Forest of Swords.

456
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:28,160
Why don't you tell us about your experience in the Forest of Swords?

457
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,300
The Forest of Swords... i-is a grand and magnificent place.

458
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,140
I just happened to obtain an excellent sword by accident.

459
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,000
What's wrong?

460
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,500
Last night in the woodshed, I couldn't sleep well because the mosquitoes bothered me.

461
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,560
And Grandfather, you had a long trip. I'm sure you're tired.

462
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,200
Why don't we end the gathering now? Let's return to our rooms and rest.

463
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,400
Dongjun. You've grown up.

464
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,060
You even know how to care for me.

465
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,860
All right. Go back and rest.

466
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,600
All right. You should head back and rest too.

467
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,240
Yes, Father.

468
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,540
Father, when Dongjun was in the Forest of Swords...

469
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,620
I've known for a long time.

470
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,520
A storm is coming.

471
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,720
The Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion can erect an iron wall to defend itself.

472
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:12,320
Father, once you give us the order, the Pofeng Army will rush to Tianqi immediately.

473
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,380
I will surely lead the charge and ride ahead.

474
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,180
What do you mean by that?

475
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,720
Do you think I intend to rebel?

476
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,280
We aren't trying to rebel here. We're on a campaign to conquer the world.

477
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,220
If that's the case, you have to raise your voice,

478
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,640
so the entire world will know that the Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion intends to rebel.

479
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,380
This way, someone can offer their loyalty to His Majesty

480
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,540
by stabbing you in the throat while you're asleep.

481
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,820
Father!

482
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,040
Back then, Great General Ye Yu was loyal to His Majesty

483
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,460
but he was falsely accused of treason.

484
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,380
In the end his entire family was executed.

485
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,340
Right now, we...

486
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,180
Right now, we have to make a preemptive strike, right?

487
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:04,920
Chengfeng, those who have truly experienced war

488
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,880
will never want to go back to the battlefield again.

489
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:16,320
One who knows the true nature of war will never start a war easily.

490
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,320
There's no end to one's greed.

491
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:25,260
But the soldiers who have to bleed for us are innocent.

492
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,440
Then Xichu's Scholarly Deity...

493
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,480
Are you trying to say that I spared him?

494
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,400
You're wrong.

495
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,720
I didn't spare him in that battle.

496
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,540
I don't know how he managed to survive until now either.

497
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,340
Then why did you let Dongjun go?

498
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,860
It's obvious he's going to tip the Scholarly Deity off.

499
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,000
We were the ones who captured Xichu. Aren't you afraid that he'll...

500
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
If that person were truly Xichu's Scholarly Deity,

501
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,400
he would never blame Dongjun for this.

502
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,060
But Father...

503
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,940
Head back and rest.

504
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,720
Father! One last question.

505
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,200
You're trying to ask me if you're my biological son, right?

506
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,180
Isn't it obvious?

507
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:22,200
I might not be your biological son, but Dongjun is surely your biological grandson.

508
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,260
Enough.

509
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,780
I know what you're trying to say.

510
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:34,960
You're trying to say that even if we don't intend to rebel,

511
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,700
the people of Tianqi might not think so.

512
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,940
That's right.

513
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,780
What if they come here?

514
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,700
What do we do then?

515
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,740
Then... wait for them to come.

516
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:05,660

517
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,640

518
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,640
That cunning boy.

519
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,180
Master!

520
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,180
Dongjun, you're back.

521
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,820
Have you accomplished your goals during your trip?

522
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,060
Master, this isn't the time to talk about me.

523
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,240
I think... I got you into huge trouble.

524
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,300
How do you define huge trouble?

525
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,580
Master.

526
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,480
At the Forest of Swords Assembly, I used the sword technique you taught me.

527
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,180
But all of the swordsmen there seemed shocked.

528
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,860
They said it was a long-lost sword technique.

529
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,980
Master.

530
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,060
Although you've never told me about your background,

531
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,340
my instinct tells me you're no ordinary person.

532
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,040
Your sword technique is unique too.

533
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,720
I'm sure they'll come looking for you eventually.

534
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,160
Since when did I teach you sword techniques?

535
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,940
Master!

536
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,500
I only remember that you once did the sword dance when I was drunk.

537
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,600
Before, I thought it was just a dream.

538
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:36,620
But this time, after I got drunk, I somehow used the sword technique.

539
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,400
As if...

540
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,120
As if it had been imprinted in my brain.

541
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,940
I don't need to recall or even think about it.

542
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,780
It felt as if I wasn't wielding the sword.

543
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,500
Instead...

544
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,920
Instead, it felt like the sword was wielding me.

545
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,760
Take this.

546
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,260
Close your eyes.

547
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,580
Feel it.

548
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,940
It takes people ten years to master the technique.

549
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,780
But it only took you one glance.

550
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,800
Do you know why?

551
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,560
Could it be that I was born to wield a sword?

552
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,220
Fine. I don't know.

553
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,720
It's not because you were born to wield a sword.

554
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,380
It's because you're Baili Dongjun.

555
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,880
And, Baili Dongjun is...

556
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,060
It's because I'm Baili Dongjun?

557
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,140
Master, I don't understand.

558
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,040
Many people said the same thing.

559
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,720
Who am I?

560
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,260
I'm Baili Dongjun.

561
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,180
But why is it because I'm Baili Dongjun?

562
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,740
You'll understand in the future.

563
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,740
Dongjun, the innocent have no faults to bear, yet they bear the faults of others.

564
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,840
Do you wish to learn swordsmanship?

565
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,940
I do.

566
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:12,960
Master. I wish to learn swordsmanship.

567
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,080
After Brother Yun's death, I became erratic and excessive.

568
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,980
Grandfather has always spoiled me.

569
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,380
I know that we have the same thoughts.

570
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,000
As the young master of the Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion,

571
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,600
the more flamboyant I am, the more the ruler in Tianqi City can rest at ease.

572
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,880
Grandfather doesn't want me to follow Brother Yun's old path.

573
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,840
But this time, I have encountered true martial artists.

574
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,280
I've encountered many powerful ones.

575
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,800
Maybe right now, I'm not strong enough to make a name for myself.

576
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,740
I'm not strong enough to protect the people I wish to protect.

577
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,360
Master, I also wish to travel the Martial World with a sword in hand.

578
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,740
I don't care what the Emperor will think.

579
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,060
I, Baili Dongjun, will never be a golden canary in a cage!

580
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm relieved to hear that.

581
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,400
Since you wish to learn swordsmanship, I shall teach you swordsmanship.

582
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,320
In this world, apart from Mister Li from the Academy,

583
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,060
no one has sword skills as formidable as your master's.

584
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,580
Dongjun, you should head back for now.

585
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:18,020
When we meet again, I shall impart the true Xichu's Sword Song to you.

586
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:23,000
But Master, I'm afraid you'll be in danger if you remain here.

587
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,660
Don't worry.

588
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,560
Since the die has been cast, there's no point in avoiding them.

589
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,200
I shall wait here for their arrival.

590
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,256

591
00:46:42,256 --> 00:46:43,900

592
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:55,080

593
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:07,721
