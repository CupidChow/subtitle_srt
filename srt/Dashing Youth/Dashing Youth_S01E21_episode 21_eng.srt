2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,840
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8

♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,600
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,440
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,820
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,220
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,600

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,520

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,240

23
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,007

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,860
Everyone, Master asked me to run an errand in Jin City.

25
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,420
I'm afraid I can't go to the Tang Sect.

26
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,100
I'll wait outside.

27
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,660
Given your master's past grievances with them, it's best that you stay outside.

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,700
Senior Liu Yue had a feud with the Tang Sect?

29
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,580
Tell us about it.

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,220
Why?

31
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,660
Are you eager to find out?

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,420
It's basically the bygone days of romance.

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,980
Forget it. I wouldn't want Senior Liu Yue's wrath.

34
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,000
- Junior Niece, see you around. 
 - Take care.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,680
Why do you get all nervous when you find it's something romantic?

36
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,300
Shut it.

37
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,460
Stay safe!

38
00:02:56,725 --> 00:03:01,050

39
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,820
The Tang Sect.

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,860
This mansion is bigger than Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion.

41
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,600
This is where we part ways.

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,080
Take care.

43
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,780
You're leaving already?

44
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,340
Fine.

45
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,280
Brother Yun, take care.

46
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,120
Take care.

47
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,620
Sir.

48
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,600
Take care.

49
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,910

50
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,360
 Master!

51
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,280
 - Oh no!  
 - Xiao Baili.

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,340
In a hurry to go somewhere?

53
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,520
Uncle. My friend was abducted into the Tang Sect.

54
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,600
I must rescue him.

55
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,300
Who are you? Tell me your names.

56
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,520
Wen Hujiu of the Wen Family.

57
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,260
Baili Dongjun.

58
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,600
- Invitation? 
 - I don't have one.

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,120
It's with my friend. He was dragged into your mansion.

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,640
- Absurd. 
 - That's the truth. Stop wasting my time.

61
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,000
- I must find him. 
 - Trespassers must be killed!

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,200
 Trespassers must be killed!

63
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,640
You have two options.

64
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,680
One, let me in.

65
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,500
Two, meet my blade and let me in.

66
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,360
What a fool.

67
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,100
 His fist is actually as hard as the sword.

68
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,960
I don't want to fight a nobody.

69
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,640
Tell me your name.

70
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,640
I am Tang Lianyue of the Tang Sect.

71
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,260
I am Baili Dongjun of the Jixia Academy.

72
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,640
There's no need for a fight.

73
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,640
And you! That was uncalled for.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,840
Mr. Wen. Trespassers must be killed.

75
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,520
That's the rule here.

76
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,980
I have the invitation.

77
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,600
He is my nephew. How is he a trespasser?

78
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,680
In that case, follow me and rest at the side chamber.

79
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,420
Wait.

80
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,080
Whoever abducted my friend could be from your sect.

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,780
You want me to rest?

82
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,580
I wonder why.

83
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,620
A member of our sect would never stoop that low.

84
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,400
Your friend was trespassing.

85
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,640
I will find him and kill him.

86
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,520
I dare you.

87
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,040
Lianyue is Grandmaster Tang's last disciple in the Tang Sect.

88
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,620
You are the last disciple of Mister Li from the Academy.

89
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,800
Mister Li and Grandmaster Tang have the same seniority.

90
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,760
You might as well be friends.

91
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,340
Shake hands and put all of this behind us.

92
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,500
- If he's a member of the Tang Sect... 
 - Even if it's Mister Li, so what?

93
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,700
- there's no need for me to do that. 
 - Not interested.

94
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,400
Forget it. Young people like you know nothing.

95
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,320
Lianyue, I'll need you to arrange accommodation for us.

96
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,260
You...

97
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,680
Uncle. What about my friend?

98
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,840
The Poison Convention is tomorrow.

99
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,130
Given the timing of his abduction, it must be linked to the convention.

100
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,110
Let's head inside.

101
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,270

102
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,840
The Poison Convention will be held tomorrow at noon.

103
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,480
If we find your friend, I'll send someone to inform you.

104
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,900
Remember, do not wander around.

105
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,820
This is a nice room.

106
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,200
Uncle. We have to rescue my friend.

107
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,000
I was going to ask you. Weren't you with Mister Li?

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,890
Where did he go?

109
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,060
And who is the one who got abducted?

110
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,830
The person who got abducted was my master's friend.

111
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,960
I was going to meet up with my master after the Poison Convention.

112
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,120
What about his prowess?

113
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:52,520
As of now, it's about my level.

114
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,580
That means whoever abducted your friend was not ordinary.

115
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,000
Don't worry.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,780
No one would dare kill anyone so blatantly in the Tang Sect.

117
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,080
Your friend must have been hidden.

118
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Perhaps we'll learn the truth tomorrow during the Poison Convention.

119
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,780
But this friend of mine means a lot to me.

120
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,800
Uncle...

121
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,440
 I handed over my master's token to Riverside Manor's base in Jin City.

122
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,680
 I wonder how Martial Uncle Baili and the rest are doing right now.

123
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,560
 There's not much else to do.

124
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,300
 I should go and meet her.

125
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,760

126
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,800
Come on!

127
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,040
Follow my bet!

128
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,540
You'll win for sure! Follow me, you'll win!

129
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,720
Don't you have faith in me? How can you not trust me?

130
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,720
- Just do as I do. 
 - Everybody!

131
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,140
Have you placed your bet?

132
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,780
Miss, if I'm not mistaken,

133
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,880
I own this gambling parlor.

134
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,920
How are you calling the shots now?

135
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,040
My apologies, Boss Mu.

136
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,520
I'm used to it.

137
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,000
Have you placed your bet?

138
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,760
Miss, we'll see if you can still win.

139
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,140
Boss Mu, haven't you heard?

140
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,240
We're the masters of our destiny.

141
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,140
- Certainly. What about it? 
 - Nothing.

142
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,540
I just want you to know that the saying is nothing but a lie.

143
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,900
Destiny is destiny.

144
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,320
When it comes crashing down, we are all doomed.

145
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,400
What's the tile?

146
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,300
Double Heaven!

147
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,260
Thank you!

148
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,400
She said that because you were going to lose your entire gambling parlor to her.

149
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,200
Sister Yue Yao?

150
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,900
Sister Luoxia.

151
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,200
Boss Mu. That's all for today.

152
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,100
Record all this carefully.

153
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,600
We'll have a rematch another day.

154
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,000
Have fun everyone.

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,500
- Let's go. 
 - I'm done with this.

156
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,800
- Forget it. 
 - Let's go.

157
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,300
Time to go home.

158
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,700

159
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,300
I'm here to run some errands for my master.

160
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,700
As soon as I arrived, I heard rumors of a mysterious woman winning big in the gambling parlor.

161
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,800
I knew it was you. So I came right away.

162
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,600
Master?

163
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,300
The most gorgeous man alive you mentioned in the letter?

164
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,600
Correct.

165
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,500
I took on your identity to become his disciple.

166
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,200
If it's possible, I hope you can become his disciple too.

167
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,300
The peerlessly handsome Young Master Liu Yue.

168
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,700
Interesting. I should meet him.

169
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,400
We'll see if he is more charming than you.

170
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,200
Sister.

171
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,600
I'm done teasing you. Come on.

172
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,700
I want to hear all about the interesting things you encountered in Tianqi City.

173
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,500

174
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,700
- The invitation? 
 - Here you are.

175
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,900
- Fine. Come in. 
 - Come in.

176
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,300
Senior, let's go.

177
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,700
- Invitation? 
 - Let's go.

178
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,000
- This way. 
 - Sure.

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,490
Invitation?

180
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,200
Let's sit together.

181
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,900
Had I not come here, you'd run out of medicine.

182
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,000
You'd die here. Aren't you worried?

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,500
Does it matter?

184
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,600
Dying in the Martial World is better than dying in Medicine Valley.

185
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,500
Your trip to Tianqi City didn't break your spirit.

186
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,260
Stop standing there. Let's go.

187
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,440
You've been through a lot.

188
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,060
However, I have a question.

189
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,620
What is it you want to know?

190
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:18,060
Your identity, your goal, and the cold power struggle aside,

191
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,100
are you in love with Baili Dongjun?

192
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,980
I...

193
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,600

194
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,700
If we can't find your friend today, I'll talk to Grandmaster Tang for you.

195
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,520
Thank you, Uncle.

196
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,620
- What's over there? 
 - The Poison Convention.

197
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,400
That's the Poison Convention?

198
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,100
Won't you go there?

199
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,000
The Convention over here is meant for the normal poison sects.

200
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It seems lively, but it has very little content in it.

201
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,800
The real Poison Convention is always held in Grandmaster Tang's Wutong Yard.

202
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,900
Only the five major poison sects are participating.

203
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,400
That's a small circle.

204
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,800
That's only a Poison Gathering.

205
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Yes. It's only a gathering.

206
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,700
This way please.

207
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,300
Let's go.

208
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,990

209
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,300
The man in black on the stage is Tang Linghuang.

210
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
He is the Tang Sect's spokesperson.

211
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,400
It's said he has the best poison.

212
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
and hidden weapon user in the sect.

213
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,800
This time I came here to test my skills against his.

214
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,800
As for the rest, they are the elites of the five poison sects.

215
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,600
This is the Poison God Sect.

216
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,300
That is the Withered Cloud Sect.

217
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,500
And the Undying Sect...

218
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,200
What is Xiao Liu's sister doing here?

219
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
- I miscalculated. 
 - Who are the others?

220
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,600
The Five-Poison Clan.

221
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,000
The poison using sects are truly menacing.

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,200
Their names carry either death or poison.

223
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,200
- It seems they want the world to know they are nasty. 
 - Certainly.

224
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,500
We're the nice people here. We are friendly.

225
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,300
The Wen Family is all about grace and elegance.

226
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,300
All right, enough about them. In any case they aren't as amazing as me.

227
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,980
- Xiao Baili! 
 - Uncle Buping.

228
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,620
What timing!

229
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,020
Just in time.

230
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,600
You're not a poison user. What are you doing here?

231
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,000
Medicine and poison are related.

232
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,600
I don't use poisons, but I know about them.

233
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,800
If you can't stand that, stop wasting your time here.

234
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,000
- I'm done talking to you. 
 - You lost the argument.

235
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,700
King of Medicine, wait for me.

236
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,300
Changfeng?

237
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,200
Dongjun? What are you doing here?

238
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
It's a long story.

239
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,000
Everyone.

240
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
As we all know, in the Martial World,

241
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,800
the art of toxin is looked down upon as a form of Sly Path.

242
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,300
It's not acknowledged by the world.

243
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,800
The Tang Sect were shunned by the world for many years

244
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,200
due to our expertise in poisons and hidden weapons.

245
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,740
Today, when we mention the Tang Sect,

246
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,300
is there anyone out there who would dare shun us?

247
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,260
- Indeed. 
 - Indeed.

248
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,100
- He is right. 
 - Yes.

249
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,700
Sly Path or Right Path, it's nothing but prejudice.

250
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,900
Poisons can take lives and save lives.

251
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,200
Today, we shall attend this Poison Convention together.

252
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,000
I hope that all of us can exchange knowledge to our heart's content

253
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,800
and make the use of poison great again!

254
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,800
It sounds like a sham we run into on the roads that is recruiting.

255
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,800
- Right? Right? 
 - I didn't know that side of you, Mr. Wen.

256
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,200
Uncle, I have a feeling you are jealous of him.

257
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,280
The Wen Family never likes to show off.

258
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,400
But your uncle wasn't born with that sense.

259
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,300
He's always looking for a fight.

260
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,700
The Tang Sect is hosting the Poison Convention

261
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,000
that welcomes the major poison sects for a display of authority.

262
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,700
Of course your uncle is being defiant.

263
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,200
Hush.

264
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,600
Send in the drug tester.

265
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
This is the drug tester of the Tang Sect.

266
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,600
Originally a bandit of great malice, this man was captured by us.

267
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:12,200
After years of refinement and training, he is already immune to poisons.

268
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,700
This is the Tang Sect's test for all of you.

269
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,300
Anyone capable of taking him down with poison shall overthrow the Tang Sect,

270
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,800
and rise as the head of all poison sects.

271
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,400
- You're talking big. I... 
 - Wait here.

272
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,900
Don't get too eager.

273
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,600
The Wen Family is the best at using poisons.

274
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,200
We can't go in first.

275
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,800
- You're right. 
 - The Wen Family is keeping up appearances.

276
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,500
Our Five-Poison Clan isn't this picky.

277
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Since no one is coming forth, I shall go first.

278
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,980
She is mean with her words, but she has a good figure.

279
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:00,913
An alluring beauty.

280
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,340
This poison blade is infused with a powerful poison.

281
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,600
It's called Elegant Jessamine.

282
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,800
No one can detoxify it.

283
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,600
Even the Five-Poison Clan is incapable of curing it.

284
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,300
You...

285
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,200
Uncle, she is looking at me.

286
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,000
Her eyes watch all of us.

287
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,800
Truly alluring.

288
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,200
- What is that? 
 - That is the Buddhist Vajra Barrier.

289
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,400
I once poisoned a monk at White Horse Temple.

290
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,100
The monk used the same technique.

291
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:56,000
I didn't expect the bandit captured by the Tang Sect to know a Buddhist technique.

292
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,540
Do not touch her!

293
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,560
Don't touch her!

294
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
- Xiao Baili! Don't you know she is... 
 - What is it?

295
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,200
- Yes. 
 - He's bold.

296
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,900
Are you saying I must marry her because I touched her? Like what's written in novels?

297
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,400
You wish.

298
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,900
Xiu'er, come back.

299
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,180
Wait.

300
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,400
Why did you look so terrified of the possibility of marrying me?

301
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,400
- Don't you like me? 
 - Isn't that obvious?

302
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,700
You...

303
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,900
I'll show you my face. We'll see if you like me, then.

304
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,900
That's not necessary.

305
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,800
- Uncle. What now? 
 - If you see her face, you must marry her.

306
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,700
- Fall back. 
 - Yes.

307
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,300
Xiu'er.

308
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,600
If you ever got involved with a girl from the Five-Poison Clan, it'd be a life worth living.

309
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,000
But your life would be cut short.

310
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,200
Why is that?

311
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,000
You should ask Younger Uncle.

312
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,900
Shut it.

313
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,600
I am Wen Hujiu. I'll take the challenge.

314
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,780
This fool. He's still an attention seeker.

315
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,740
First, a dose of Drunken Dream Death to disable his inner strength.

316
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,540
Then, a dose of Ephemeral Youth to strengthen the efficacy.

317
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,660
Lastly, a strike of Venomous Palm.

318
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:44,540
If he could still be alive, he'd be the Great Golden Immortal.

319
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,100
Do all poisons nowadays come with poetic and artistic names?

320
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,600
Back then, among the three of us, one produced poisons,

321
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,020
one used poisons, and another one was responsible for naming them.

322
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,700
We made a good team. The Wen Family is unstoppable.

323
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,900
Uncle. You mentioned three.

324
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,420
- Who was the last one? 
 - Your mother.

325
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,660
Uncle Buping. Why are you insulting me?

326
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,840
Baili Dongjun!

327
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,720
Sorry about that.

328
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,200
That's highly toxic.

329
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,440
What?

330
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,700
The Wen Family's poison is indeed highly toxic.

331
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,620
 That voice...

332
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:43,860
Tang Linghuang, how dare you claim the drug tester was a bandit!

333
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:49,120
How insolent you are to have brought in a speaking Golden Immortal!

334
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,520
Baili Dongjun, what's the matter?

335
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,450
That drug tester wasn't a bandit.

336
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,540
You are not our drug tester!

337
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,580
Who are you?

338
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,340
I am Nangong Chunshui.

339
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,780
I am a gentle scholar.

340
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,300
- Who is that? 
 - This bad old man.

341
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,820
I was worried about you.

342
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:15,360
A scholar? We have an internal affair to resolve here.

343
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,980
Those who are not from the Tang Sect should leave now.

344
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,620
What is going on now?

345
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,820
- Let's go. 
 - What is this about?

346
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,180
Why aren't you leaving?

347
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,260
Uncle. This is the friend who got abducted outside the gate.

348
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,000
He's one of us.

349
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,280
So he is with you.

350
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,515
If anyone could abduct your friend,

351
00:23:44,515 --> 00:23:48,540
the abductor would be the most powerful being in the world.

352
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,980
Enough. Spare me the chitchat.

353
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,340
You have only one chance.

354
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,820
Watch closely.

355
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,500
Tang Linghuang. What's the deal with Grandmaster Tang?

356
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,380
With all the commotion, how can he be still asleep?

357
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,660
He should be awake by now!

358
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,000
Silence! Show some respect!

359
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,420
Unrestrained and invincible.

360
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,220
The mortal realm cannot match Heaven's delight.

361
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,000
Two phases in a row?

362
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,260
He entered the Carefree Phase of Heaven from the Hard Phase of Mortals.

363
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,260
- He is truly formidable. 
 - He is more than that.

364
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,660
It seems Elder Wen and this spokesperson of the Tang Sect are both being heavily suppressed.

365
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,700
But why we don't feel anything at all?

366
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,454
Because his control over his inner strength is highly precise,

367
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:02,220
which means he can suppress anyone within his reach.

368
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,240
Who exactly is he?

369
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,420
Old geezer, what do you think?

370
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,000
Is this enough of a show for you?

371
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,220
Very well.

372
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,020
Now, try killing me with your strongest poisons.

373
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,020
Do not go easy on me.

374
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,380
Otherwise, I'll kill you all.

375
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,460
 Master, what are you up to?

376
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,940
Dongjun. Young Spear Deity. Lianyue of the Tang Sect.

377
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,720
Watch closely.

378
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,040
Ten years of training can't even hope to show you the knowledge within this epic battle between sages.

379
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,660
- Fatal Flying Blossoms. 
 - Is this...

380
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,180
It's said that when the Fatal Flying Blossoms is unleashed,

381
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,740
there is no way to escape it or hide from it.

382
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,940
One's fate is sealed.

383
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,440
Unbreakable Vajra Shield.

384
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,900
He is a Buddhist after all.

385
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,660
Spirit Stride, the ultimate Taoist technique.

386
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,178
Who exactly is this man?

387
00:26:57,178 --> 00:27:01,300
He is a master of both Buddhist and Taoist techniques.

388
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,620
Cinderless, Dustless.

389
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:20,373
♫  The moon falls into my thoughts, who will be there to greet me?  ♫

390
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:23,733
♫  The moon falls into my thoughts, who will be there to greet me?  ♫

391
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:27,093
♫  Drop these elegant clothes, ascend like an immortal  ♫

392
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:30,493
♫  Drop these elegant clothes, ascend like an immortal  ♫

393
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:33,493
♫  After drinking this heavenly liquor, swallow all the love and hate  ♫

394
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:37,173
♫  After drinking this heavenly liquor, swallow all the love and hate  ♫

395
00:27:37,173 --> 00:27:40,613
♫  The youth set off on a journey, drunk on the spring breeze, unaware of autumn coming  ♫

396
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:46,333
♫  The youth set off on a journey, drunk on the spring breeze, unaware of autumn coming  ♫

397
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,900
The Unbreakable Vajra Shield is known to be invincible.

398
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,700
However, every technique has a vulnerability.

399
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,660
The Tang Sect has a hidden weapon that can break any vulnerability.

400
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,540
Does it matter if we do that?

401
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,620
Given the phase he's in, it will take more than a few needles to take him out.

402
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,540
I have my Three Character Mantra.

403
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,760
Fine. I trust you.

404
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,180
Pear Blossom Needle Thunderstorm.

405
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,600
Blood must be shed. It's a bad omen to deal no harm.

406
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,240
It's the last resort, the greatest of all hidden weapons.

407
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:41,540

408
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,220
I'll poison you to death!

409
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,460
Getting what one wishes for is the way to having no regrets.

410
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,880
Old man. You're the only one left.

411
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:52,400
No poison in this world can outmatch this.

412
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,800
All 27 Pear Blossom Needle Thunderstorm

413
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,660
and the Wen Family's Three Character Mantra are running wild in your veins.

414
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:07,180
And together with the poisons you swallowed,
their effects kicked in together.

415
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:15,440
If I top it off with my Sage's Touch, only death awaits you.

416
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,480
Well, do the honor.

417
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,100
Are you going back on your words?

418
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,320
Are you going to kill me?

419
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:35,780
They say the Reaching Carefree Phase allows one to reach Heaven. Are you giving up now?

420
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,860
If you've changed your mind, kill me and only me. Leave the Tang Sect out of this.

421
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,660
Enough of this.

422
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,340
Master!

423
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:56,900
Xiao Baili! Have you lost your mind? If you go in now, his inner strength will shatter your body.

424
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:06,000
Reaching Carefree Phase to reach Heaven, not a living soul or creation in sight.

425
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,360
Most people only remember the first half.

426
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,740
They forget people like this will lose sight of everything but themselves.

427
00:31:35,587 --> 00:31:39,600

428
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,020
Penglai shrouded in Jade Pool mist, no immortal peaks in sight.

429
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,060
Xiao Mo Yi, long time no see.

430
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,580
Where is your master, Taoist Qingfeng?

431
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:57,786
He passed away. What is your purpose for this sudden visit?

432
00:31:57,786 --> 00:32:04,040
I missed my old friends and wanted to see him. But he already left.

433
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,920
What do you mean by "left"?

434
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,320
I came to bid farewell.

435
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:15,440
However, I'm not meeting my demise. My destination is far away.

436
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,093
The furthest land in the world is Penglai.

437
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:23,180
Where are you heading? Why come here to bid farewell?

438
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:30,160
I am going into a woman's heart.

439
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,000
I took in a lot of disciples. I like them a lot.

440
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,140
If they ever get the chance to visit this place,

441
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:43,780
I'd like for you to offer them a drink. Put it on my tab.

442
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,740
But, Sir, you bade farewell just now.

443
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,640
Isn't this supposed to be the last time we meet?

444
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,280
In other words, I can never pay you back.

445
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,600
Given all the unpaid debts in the world, mine shouldn't make a difference.

446
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,960
The perfect beauty doesn't exist. Only the loved one can catch those eyes.

447
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,660
Long time no see.

448
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,100
- Who are you? 
 - I am Nangong Chunshui.

449
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,420
I am your husband.

450
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,360
Scram.

451
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,520
The mortal realm is covered in frost, but the spring breeze rises here.

452
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,920
You're... You're him.

453
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,620
Why do you think of him when I mention I'm your husband?

454
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,380
You...

455
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,820
Does that mean deep down in your heart, he is your husband?

456
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,420
You...

457
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,860
Still as ill-tempered as always.

458
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:15,460
We shall meet again, my wife.

459
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,960
The mortal realm is boring.

460
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,240
The heavens is too lonely.

461
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,500
Only I walk between worlds.

462
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,280
This is a place of the greatest delight.

463
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,060
Immortal...

464
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,660
Please take away my immortality.

465
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,240
Master, wake up.

466
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,560
Don't worry. He's alive.

467
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,820
What did you do to him?

468
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,020
You fool. Don't you get it?

469
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:44,320
Grandmaster Tang and Mister Li came up with this plan.

470
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,500
- Their plan? 
 - Indeed.

471
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,630
He came and asked me to host this elaborate act for him.

472
00:35:54,220 --> 00:36:00,440
 It's been over 300 years since the founding of the Tang Sect.

473
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,740
 It's one of the greatest sects in the Martial World.

474
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,680
 If I help you with this plan...

475
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,820
 Old man. Stop saying this.

476
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,360
 I might as well go to the Lei Fortress.

477
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,860
 A disciple of mine has Lei as his family name. I am quite fond of him.

478
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:25,620
 Given my bond with him, I could help Lei Fortress.

479
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:31,420
 I might help them become the leader of the Martial World. What do you think?

480
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,100
 Where were we just now? Take a seat.

481
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,840
 After centuries, the Tang Sect hasn't changed.

482
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,900
 You don't realize the magnitude of this matter until I bring up the Lei Family.

483
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,200
 An epic love-hate relationship.

484
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,540
 Come on, have some tea.

485
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:18,740
Then again, why does Mister Li look like a young man?

486
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,640
Well, this is interesting.

487
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,260
King of Medicine, do you know something?

488
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,580
The ancient tree, Chun, respectively goes through 8000 years of spring and autumn.

489
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,120
I know a technique known as the Art of Chun.

490
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,240
It's the ultimate art of the Unbound Wind-Rider Sect, which is now nowhere to be found.

491
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,880
To master this technique, one would need the medicine stone and the effort of the entire sect.

492
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,220
Whoever masters it must be the prodigy of the century.

493
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,280
Once the technique is mastered, that person can be young again once every 30 years.

494
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,040
However, I've never seen it. I've only heard rumors.

495
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,420
- But today... 
 - Such a miraculous technique does exist.

496
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,440
It gives immortality.

497
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,980
So, what exactly is Mister Li's goal of doing all this?

498
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,320
If my guess is right, he wants to disable this art.

499
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,560
- To disable the art? 
 - To disable the art?

500
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:19,920
Li Changsheng came to me for my help in disabling the effect of the Art of Chun.

501
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,880
However, I alone did not have the power to accomplish this.

502
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,720
Therefore, I made use of the Poison Convention to cripple the effect of the medicine stone

503
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,420
of the Unbound Wind-Rider Sect using powerful poisons.

504
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,540
Then, he would have to disable the art himself.

505
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,160
He even orchestrated this showdown.

506
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,580
Those who watched or joined the showdown

507
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,740
would have substantial growth in their mastery of martial arts.

508
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,060
Consider it his compensation for you.

509
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,240
But why did he want to become mortal again?

510
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:02,420
Lianyue, you are too young to understand it.

511
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,720
With mortality, life is short.

512
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,220
But if you were given 8000 years to live,

513
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,880
would you be able to withstand the endless loneliness?

514
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,320
You'd have to watch all of your loved ones pass away until there's no one left but you.

515
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,280
Nonsense.

516
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,700
Master.

517
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,800
That felt nice.

518
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:43,240
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Nangong Chunshui. I am a gentle scholar.

519
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,100
Everyone.

520
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,440
This is where I bid you farewell.

521
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,100
I stirred up quite the commotion because of my personal goal.

522
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,760
I hope you don't hold it against me,
Grandmaster Tang.

523
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,340
My fellow disciples will be known across the world.

524
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,940
As for you, you shall be their powerful rival.

525
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,500
With you around, the Tang Sect shall stand strong.

526
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,140
What? Are you a fortune-teller?

527
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:30,420
Since you brought that up, I did work as one for a couple of years.

528
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,840
You two brats, time to go.

529
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,700
Two?

530
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,900
Does that mean...

531
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,660
Sikong Changfeng.

532
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,640
- What is it? 
 - Nothing serious.

533
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:55,020
I wonder if you're willing to be my disciple.

534
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,020
What are you waiting for? Say yes.

535
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,080
Rascal. Say yes.

536
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,740
It's good to be his disciple.

537
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,140
Our contract ends today.

538
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,900
From now on I'm only half a master to you.

539
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,100
Thank you, Master.

540
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,540
Very well. I accept the offer.

541
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,380
Kneel.

542
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,740
Master, please accept my bow.

543
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,820
Very well.

544
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:14,360
From now on, you are a disciple of me, Nangong Chunshui.

545
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,220
Get up, my junior.

546
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,100
Baili Dongjun, strictly speaking, you are Mister Li's disciple.

547
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,780
Don't take advantage of me.

548
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,140
I don't care. You're my junior.

549
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,020
Enough.

550
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,260
You two, it's time to move on.

551
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,580
Sure. I'll get the horses.

552
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,360
I've waited for too long. I'm tired of it.

553
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,640
We'll fly there.

554
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,720
Grandmaster Tang, you know where we're heading.

555
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,840
Please send the carriage there.

556
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,760
I have a few jars of fine liquor in it.

557
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,820
I wouldn't mind having a few jars of the Tang Sect's Drunken World.

558
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,940
That settles it.

559
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,140
Let's go.

560
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,180
Wait, Master.

561
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,540
My uncles, I'll take my leave.

562
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,060
Send my regards to my family.

563
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,360
I'm leaving. Take good care of yourself.

564
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,620
- Don't worry about me. 
 - Enough chitchat. Let's go!

565
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,220
Master! Don't forget Martial Niece!

566
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,900
I have a hunch you have a perilous future ahead.

567
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,380
Mind your own business.

568
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,480

569
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,100
My disciples, why do I feel nervous?

570
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,540
This is it?

571
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,860
Master, aren't we going to Xueyue City?

572
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,900
But the sign says "Lower District".

573
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,520
This city was once called Great Changhe.

574
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,420
The first character of the name means "big", but it's a very small city.

575
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,880
The place is remote with picturesque scenery. It's peaceful.

576
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,760
Then, four peerless elites came to live in seclusion.

577
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,500
And that somehow attracted more people to settle down here.

578
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,040
So the city expanded.

579
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:24,180
Later on, it was divided into two districts, named Upper District and Lower District.

580
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,380
Wind for Lower District, blossoms for Upper District.

581
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,700
Snow for the Cangshan mountain. Moon for the Erhai Lake.

582
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,000
People then combined the names of both districts into Xueyue City.

583
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,120
Out of the four elites I mentioned just now, only the Sword Deity had descendants.

584
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,720
The people elected this descendant to become the city lord of Xueyue City.

585
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,660
The current city lord is a woman.

586
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,220
She loves dressing in red.

587
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,760
There is a cinnabar mark between her brows.

588
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,360
Her beauty is peerless.

589
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,100
Her swordplay is invincible.

590
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,960
She is the woman I love.

591
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,080
I dream of her every day.

592
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,200
I love her so much.

593
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,620
Master, you must be truly nervous.

594
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,820
- What? 
 - People get chatty when they are nervous.

595
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:37,260
Master. You're almost 200 years old.

596
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,480
- You're still bound by human emotions. 
 - Go away.

597
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,260
Someone is coming this way.

598
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,840
Calm down. She is one of us.

599
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,120
Who are you?

600
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,460
Long time no see, Miss Luo.

601
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,440
Pardon the intrusion.

602
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,780
I am Nangong Chunshui.

603
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,760
I don't remember anyone by the name of Nangong Chunshui.

604
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,790
That's because I had a different name

605
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,260
when we first met.

606
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,820
You...

607
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,660
It really is you.

608
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,660
Why are you here again?

609
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,580
Master.

610
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,700
She's the woman you're in love with?

611
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,740
She doesn't seem to like you at all.

612
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,780
Nonsense.

613
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,300
Miss Luo and I are meant for each other.

614
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,980
We made a vow of life when we first met.

615
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,440
You're just a playboy and a heart breaker.

616
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,220
Miss Luo, after so many years, you're still as ill-tempered.

617
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,700
You're the greatest martial artist. I can't slay you.

618
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,460
But I don't want to see you again. Scram.

619
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,580

620
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,780

621
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:44,050

622
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:56,020
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

623

00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,280
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

643
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:22,529
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

644
00:50:22,529 --> 00:50:27,040
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

645
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,480
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

646
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,512
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

647
00:50:33,512 --> 00:50:35,960
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

648
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,320
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

649
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,840
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

650
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,120
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

651
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:53,920
♫  I met you  ♫
