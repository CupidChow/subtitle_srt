Why are you here?

I said we'd meet tonight, didn't I?

I heard the liquor you brew
is excellent.

103
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,820
It's just a drop of liquor.

104

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,500
Do you know him?

111
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,300

112
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,420
that you know him?

113
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,380
Why didn't you tell me?

114
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,820
Who is he?

115
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,300
I brought Baili Dongjun here.

116
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,220
Why are you more anxious than I am?

117
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,700
I was...

118
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,380
He is

119
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,940
the Chief of Baixiao Hall, Ji Ruofeng.

120
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,860
He's the Scholarly Deity's
old acquaintance.

121
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,380
He's willing to teach Baili Dongjun

122
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,820
the Scholarly Deity's
Autumn Water Technique.

123
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,780
Otherwise, do you think

124
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,900
I'll ask Dongjun
to learn your Lei Clan's

125
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,620
clumsy internal strength technique?

126
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,300
I...

127
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,980
Then he wouldn't pass the Academy's exam
even in ten years.

128
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,900
Am I...

129
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,780
Am I clumsy?

130
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,020
From now on,
you'll give me five jars of liquor

131
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,380
for every visit.

132
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,420
How about that?

133
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,620
You've gone too much.

134
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,020
You can brew more
when the liquor runs out.

135
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,620
But if you fail the Academy's exam,

136
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,500
there won't be another chance.

137
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,100
It seems

138
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,460
the liquor I brew is really too good.

139
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,860
Come on.

140
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,620
Although there isn't much time left,

141
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,100
it shouldn't be a big problem

142
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,620
for you.

143
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,660
Mr. Liuyue,

144
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,180
there are only three days left
until the preliminary examination.

145
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,500
Do you finish

146
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,500
writing questions for the exam?

147
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,180
Didn't you already say

148
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,340
the preliminary examination is
in three days?

149
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,540
Why are you in such a hurry?

150
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,740
I'm not in a hurry.

151
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,740
Why would I be in a hurry?

152
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,860
I just think that maybe we...

153
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,460
Why?

154
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,180
Everyone is too afraid
to ask me directly,

155
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,140
so they pressure you instead?

156
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,180
Am I right?

157
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,900
It is really exhausting even for anyone

158
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,420
when they ask three or four times a day.

159
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,100
In previous years,

160
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,540
there would be some hints

161
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,940
seven days
before the preliminary examination.

162
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,340
Are you really going to wait

163
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,300
until the last day

164
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,340
to announce it this time?

165
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,140
Isn't it the normal procedure

166
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,820
to announce it on the last day?

167
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,780
Why?

168
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,900
Has the Academy become

169
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,140
so shameless now?

170
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,380
Is leaking exam questions in advance

171
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,500
an unspoken rule now?

172
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,300
Liuyue,

173
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,700
the preliminary examination

174
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,660
doesn't determine the final result.

175
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,580
There's still a final examination

176
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,700
after the preliminary examination.

177
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,940
The finals have remained unchanged
for decades,

178
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,940
which involves teams competing
against each other.

179
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,580
That is

180
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,900
where the candidates'
true strengths are tested.

181
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,220
The preliminary examination is just

182
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,020
for the young men

183
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,300
to bring home some good omens.

184
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,300
Don't take it so seriously, Liuyue.

185
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,380
Mr. Zhuomo is right.

186
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,780
Moreover,

187
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,580
with Mr. Liuyue's talent,

190
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,460
it would still be pointless

191
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,460
if the candidates have no abilities.

192
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,700
That's right.

193
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,300
Why talk so much?

194
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,740
Do you still want to play?

195
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,300
No.

196
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
I can't win you anyway.

197
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,860
I was just wondering...

199
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,420
why you suddenly came

200

to play weiqi with me today

201
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,540
and humiliate yourself.

202
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,580
It turns out you also came
for the exam questions.

203
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,860
Well, I brought a friend here

204
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,900
who is preparing for the exam.

205
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,780
Besides,

206
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,420
I could find out the questions
ten days in advance

207
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,780
in the past years.

208
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,820
Who knew

209
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,940
you would be
the chief examiner this time?

210
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,700
Excellent, really excellent.

211
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,020
That's

212
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,260
why I'm visiting you personally.

213
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,140
What if I insist on announcing

214
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,620
the questions on the last day?

215
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,580
Fine.

216
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,900
It seems

217
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,420
you'll be the chief examiner

218
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,140
every year from now on.

219
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,340
Are you threatening me?

220
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,940
Yes, I'm threatening you.

221
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,860
So what?

222
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,900
You do know

223
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,580
I'm very talkative.

224
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,140
I'll go

225
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,860
to Master every day

226
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,620
and sway him.

227
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,340
I'll tell him

228
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,700
you are an excellent chief examiner.

229
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,300
I'll keep persuading him

230
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,020
until he gets annoyed

231
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,820
and agrees

232
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,900
to make you the chief examiner

233
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,340
year after year.

234
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,700
Fine.

235
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,540
Year after year.

236
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,500
I surrender.

237
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,660
Beyond civil and military.

238
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,260
That's right.

239
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,980
It's beyond civil and military.

240
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,020
Major exams in the world are divided
into civil and military categories.

241
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,100
But there are so many interesting things

242
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,140
beyond these two categories.

243
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,260
So

244
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,500
I won't test civil

245
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,540
or military subjects.

246
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,660
So long as this topic has something

247
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,380
that impresses me,

248
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,380
I'll let them pass

249
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,540
the preliminary examination.

250
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,780
This is worse than saying nothing.

251
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,860
But what exactly is tested

252
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,260
if it has nothing to do
with civil and military subjects.

253
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,860
You need to know

254
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
that our academy not only seeks people

255
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,740
who excel

256
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,780
in both civil and military skills

257
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,860
but also those who are interesting.

258
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,140
My topic is to test

259
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,380
the candidates themselves.

260
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,500

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,260
You're giving me

262
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,620
special treatment here.

263
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,780
Don't pin that on me.

264
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,740
What I said was
from the bottom of my heart

265

with the friend you brought.

267
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,740

268
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,140

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,260
how is

270
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,740
that young man doing recently?

271
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,340
I have no idea, either.

272
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,500
Speaking of which,

273
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,900
I haven't seen him in days.

274
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,660
That is comfortable.

275
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,340
Having internal strength sure makes
a big difference.

276
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,140
My whole body feels warm.

277
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,140
Is Lei Mengsha at the Academy today?

278
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,660
How would I know

279
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,620
Mr. Zhuomo's whereabouts?

280
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,860

Do you need something from me today?

283
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,140
I have good news for you.

284
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,380
What a coincidence.

285
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,100
I also have good news

286
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,540
to tell you.

287
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,020

the preliminary examination topic.

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,220

Wait.

302
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,540
With your mediocre civil
and military skills,

303
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,420
Beyond Civil and Military
is quite a good topic.

Beyond Civil and Military?

305
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,820
I've been practicing martial arts
for so many days

306
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,060
and now you're telling me the topic
is Beyond Civil and Military?

307
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,940
This is so irritating!

308
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,340
This is ridiculous.

309
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,460
Beyond Civil and Military is not testing

310
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,140
civil or military skills.

311
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,460

00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,540
what do you think is being tested?

314
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,380
Maybe

315
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,620
it's whoever looks the best
who gets into the final examination?

316
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,380
You make a good point.

to be extraordinarily handsome.

319
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,620
Maybe it really
is that whoever looks the best

320
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,020
meets the requirements.

is very handsome.

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,220
If he takes the exam,

324
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,500
he will surely pass it.

Mr. Liuyue, you always do things
in your own way.

343

This is the first time I've heard

of holding the academy's examination

The so-called examination

347
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,820
is actually no different from gambling.

568
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,780
These little games they're playing

569
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,300
aren't worth

570
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,500
my concern.

571
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,570
[Beyond Civil and Military]

572
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,220
Sir, I wish to present my talent.

573
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,100
So soon?

574
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,700
What's your name?

575
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,100
What are you submitting?

576
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,100
I'm Duan Baiyi from Baiyi Sect.

577
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,700
I've studied weiqi since childhood.

578
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,420
What I intend to present
for Beyond Civil and Military

579
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,380
is my skill in weiqi.

580
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,580
Very well.

581
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,660
Please enlighten me, Mr. Liuyue.

582
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,220
You?

583
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,500
You want to play with me?

584
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,860
How long have you studied weiqi?

585
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,020
How long have you studied?

586
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,700
Since I was seven.

587
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,300
That makes it seventeen years.

588
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,220
I started learning at three.

589
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,500
That makes it seven years.

590
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,420
That's not a big gap.

591
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,220
Let's begin.

592
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,420
I'm undefeated
when I play with black pieces.

593
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,100
You start first.

594
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,620
Sure.

595
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,340
He said he was good at playing weiqi?

596
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,540
He can't even win against a maidservant.

597
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,740
Being able to persist
for so long against Lingsu

598
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,740
while Lingsu is the one playing
with the black pieces

599
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,420
shows more than

600
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,060
just proficiency.

601
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,100
After more than ten years
of hard practice...

602
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:00,820
I have actually lost...

603
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,500
to...

604
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,020
a maidservant.

605
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,100
It appears to be a game of weiqi.

606
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,940
But in reality,

607
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,380
it reveals the heart.

608
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,580
Being overly aggressive,

609
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,860
the long blade easily breaks.

610
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,540
Your weiqi skills are excellent.

611
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,660
But you lost to Lingsu

612
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,580
perhaps because you haven't lost
in a long time.

613
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,140
I, on the other hand, lose every day.

614
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,620
Losing today might not be

615
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,220
a bad thing.

616
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,260
I, Duan Baiyi,

617
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,900
will remember your teaching.

618
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,460
Whose exam assistant is this?

619
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,060
Whose exam assistant is this?

620
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,420
Is he planning to sleep

621
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,620
during the preliminary examination?

622
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,460
Thank you.

623
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,660
So it's him.

624
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,660
If he doesn't know anything,

625
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,300
sleeping is the best option.

626
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,900
Why?

627
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,180
Are you really planning to sleep here

628
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,380
as they said?

629
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,260
Yes.

630
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,620
But

631
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,300
why are you as ignorant

632
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,420
as they are?

633
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,420
Do you really believe that?

634
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,300
I was just joking.

635
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,860
What did you prepare?

636
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,140
It's arriving right now.

637
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,380
What... What's that?

638
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,020
Freshly slaughtered lamb leg
from Beiman.

639
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,340
It's still fresh.

640
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,220
This is what I prepared.

641
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,100
Interesting.

642
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,780
Can you tell me

643
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,780
what you're planning to do now?

644
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,300
Brew liquor.

645
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,500
Brew liquor?

646
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,340
I have

647
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,700
no special skills,

648
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,060
except for brewing liquor,

649
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,380
which I have learned since childhood.

650
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,340
Since this is Beyond Civil and Military,

651
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,740
naturally, I have to bring
out my best skill.

652
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,180
But isn't

653
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,900
aged liquor better?

654
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,860
Can you brew good liquor

655
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,180
within 12 hours?

656
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,100
That's what you don't know.

657
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,420
Aged liquor has its brewing method.

658
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,380
Freshly brewed liquor also has

659
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,420
its brewing method.

660
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,780
There are thousands
of kinds of liquor in this world.

661
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,860
Each has its own flavor

662
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,980
and it's not necessarily true
that the more it aged, the better.

663
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,100
It's

664
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,660
about whether you can drink

665
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,620
the one you like.

666
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,700
Don't just look at me.

667
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,980
The lamb leg you prepared is still

668
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,140
on the table.

669
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,220
I'm on it.

670
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,300
This person is good.

671
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,620
This knife skill looks

672
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,500
ordinary,

673
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,940
but the subtleties reveal true mastery.

674
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,420
He can be called

675
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,460
a real master.

676
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,060
Send him an invitation after the exam.

677
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,020
Well,

678
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,180
what about the young man chosen
by the Ninth Prince?

679
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,620
You mean

680
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,780
the one brought back by Xiao Ruofeng?

681
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,420
Father sent him

682
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,860
to Qiandong City

683
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,940
and he brought back such a person.

684
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,820
What do you think
this person's background is?

685
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,500
Who in the entire court can sway

686
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,540
those from the Marquis
of Zhenxi's Mansion?

687
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
Moreover,

688
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,020
Marquis of Zhenxi

689
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,580
is the biggest obstacle

690
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,140
to my ascension to the throne.

691
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,700
Not bad.

692
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,740
Are you done with yours?

693
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:17,900
Yes.

694
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,780
After this, every half an hour,

695
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,460
I only need to change
the hot water bottle.

696
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,660
This is my secret technique.

697
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,020
When my lamb is roasted,

698
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,020
we don't have to worry
about dinner anymore.

699
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,100
Lamb paired with wine.

700
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,340
Just imagine how wonderful it will be.

701
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,220
That will depend on

702
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:33,940
how good your lamb tastes.

703
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,220
But you're right about something.

704
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,980
I think

705
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,580
we might rank last.

706
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,180
What difference does it make

707
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
to rank first or last?

708
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,500
It's fine as long as we get in.

709
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,660
Who says it doesn't matter?

710
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,140
Winning first place
means you're the best.

711
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,780
Sir, I want to present my talent.

712
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,540
Who are you?

713
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,700
What do you want to be tested on?

714
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,980
I'm a wanderer
of the martial arts world.

715
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,140
I don't belong to any sect.

716
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,540
I'm Yan Feifei.

717
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,420
As for the topic,

718
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,340
come down and I'll show you.

719
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,700
What do you want to be tested on?

720
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,700
[Jixia]
This.

721
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,540
You stole my token.

722
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,700
Her qinggong is quite impressive.

723
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,660
Your qinggong is also amazing.

724
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,900
Stealing sounds so bad.

725
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,140
I call this

726
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,660
Sleight of Hand.

727
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,860
In my gambling house,

728
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,860
there's even someone

729
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,100
who's this flexible.

730
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,700
Judging by her skill,

731
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,020
she must be the disciple

732
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,900
of the Godly Thief, Kong Ling'er.

733
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,460
Give it back to me.

734
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,540
May I ask

735
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,220
if this qualifies me
to pass the preliminary examination?

736
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,500
Since what you want to showcase

737
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,540
is the art of Sleight of Hand,

738
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,900
I won't be the one to test you.

739
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,340
Sanqin.

740
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,420
I'm Sanqin.

741
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,940
You have three chances

742
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,380
to steal one thing from me.

743
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,420
How do I know

744
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,620
if you even have anything on you?

745
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,660
You'll have to figure that out
with your skills.

746
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,140
Is this qinggong?

747
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,260
Three Steps Cicada Pursuit.

748
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,340
If that's the case,

749
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,460
does this still count
as Beyond Civil and Military?

750
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,380
Does qinggong count as martial arts?

751
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,300
I remember reading

752
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,460
a huaben titled "The Moon".

753
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,420
In it, a swordsman said

754
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,860
to a qinggong expert

755
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,660
that

756
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,660
qinggong is not

757
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,500
the same as martial arts.

758
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,540
Coincidentally, I read that too.

759
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,140
But later,

760
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,260
the qinggong expert replied

761
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,180
to him...

762
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,700
But speed defines

763
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,260
the distance between you and me.

764
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,260
Three Flying Swallow Moves?

765
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,300
Be more careful.

766
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,620
My apologies.

767
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:05,940
How did I do?

768
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,020
Candidate Yan Feifei has passed
the preliminary examination.

769
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,460
Thank you.

770
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,900
Also...

771
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,700
Sir.

772
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,980
I want to display my skills too.

773
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,060
Who are you
and what do you want to show?

774
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,100
I'm Yin Luoxia.

775
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,060
What I want to test is...

776
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:15,860
Thank you for the compliments.

777
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,820
You're welcome.

778
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,100
Interesting.

779
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,580
This person has changed her identity.

780
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:47,580
Why?

781
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,900
Is she that beautiful?

782
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,420
You look mesmerized.

783
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:51,860
It's not that.

784
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,060
Why do her eyes look

785
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,220
so familiar?

786
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,260
Why does everyone look familiar to you?

787
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,100
Back in Swords Forest,

788
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,700
didn't you find me familiar-looking too?

789
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,140
You've used this trick many times
to get close to people, huh?

790
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:13,820
Don't speak nonsense.

791
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,260
It's impossible.

792
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,460
She feels completely different

793
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,100
from Miss Fairy.

794
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:37,980
Gambling.

795
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,250
[No animals were harmed
during the filming of this drama.]

796
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,700

using bionic props and 3D effects.]
