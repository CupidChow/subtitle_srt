So?

25
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,340
Baili Dongjun did not take that path.

26
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,020
What?

27
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,740
No way.

28
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,860
I told Young Lady...

29
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,740
Young Lady

30
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,180
told him to not take that path, then.

31
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,940
Shut up!

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,940
Young Lady...

33
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,900
Young Lady is Young Lady.

34
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,060
She will not betray Sky's Beyond.

Maybe

36
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,620
she did not betray Sky's Beyond.

37
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,100
But one thing's for sure now.

38
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,380
She is not

39
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,460
who she used to be.

40
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,780
I don't understand.

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,740
I don't know
what Young Lady is thinking.

42
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,460
She's in Tianqi.

43
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,580
You can head there
and ask her personally.

44
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,540
However,

45
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,940

47
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,540
I found...

48
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,300
another innate martial artist.

49
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,180
Another innate martial artist?

50
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,380
What is happening?

51
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,860
I did not see Baili Dongjun,

52
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,540
but I saw two other people.

53
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,780
One of them

54
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,540
overexerted his inner strength
within a short period of time.

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,780
He might have used
the Immovable Lord technique.

56
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,660
Immovable Lord technique?

57
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,580
Exactly.

58
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,740
When we fought,

59
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,940
he forced himself
to use his inner strength.

60
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,900
How brave of him.

61
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,220
Those who wish to practice

62
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,620
the Immovable Lord technique

63
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,700
must have a robust meridian system.

64
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,380
If one's inner strength
is depleted while using it,

65
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,460
one's meridian system will be damaged.

66
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,820
To force himself

67
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,340
to generate inner strength
within a short period of time...

68
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,420
Does he want

69
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,500
to be a cripple forever?

70
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,340
Here comes the interesting part.

71
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,340
I noticed his meridian system

72
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,580
is not damaged at all.

73
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,580
An innate martial artist.

74
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,740
I thought the same way.

75
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,340
Only an innate martial artist

76
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,020
has

77
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,980
such a robust meridian system.

78
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,460
Bringing him back

79
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,780
will achieve our goal too.

80
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,100
Where is he?

81
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,500
Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

82
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,340
Prince Jingyu's Mansion?

83
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,420
Send a message to our sect

84
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,420
and investigate the origin
of this person.

85
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,300
Immovable Lord technique

86
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,940
is the signature technique

87
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,740
of Nanjue's best martial artist,
Rain Demon.

88
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,900
This innate martial artist

89
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,100
must have an interesting background.

90
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,660
By the way, Yuji,

91
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,740
since last night,

92
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,380
Twin Lords Wuzuo have been missing.

93
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,180
Did you find any sect's mark?

94
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,540
By right,

95
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,180
if they leave Tianqi in advance,

96
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,060
they will inform us by letter

97
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,820
or leave marks as they leave.

98
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,740
This

99
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,020
seems to suggest

100
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,780
that the situation is dire.

101
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,020
He looks just like Yun

102
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,140
when he was little.

103
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,340
I wonder

104
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,820
how Yun is doing now.

105
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,700
Wenjun.

106
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,380

107
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,860
Thank you for saving me.

108
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,860
Spare the formalities

109
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,420
when you're still injured.

110
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,860
As to my friend...

111
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,980
Don't worry.

112
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,740
He'll be fine as long as I'm here.

113
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,980
Thank you, miss.

114
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,420
Miss,

115
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,260

116
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,580

117
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,620

Prince Jingyu's Mansion?

119
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,340
Then you're...

120
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,700
Of course, I'm the future

121
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,100

122
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,660
So His Highness saved us?

123
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,020
No, I did.

124
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,860
Prince Jingyu has nothing
to do with this.

125
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,020
It just so happened

126
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,180
that you fell into my yard.

127
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,860

Ye Dingzhi.

129
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,220
Ye Dingzhi.

130
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,180
It sounds like a heroic name.

131
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,980
Ye Dingzhi

132
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,100
caught my eye,

133
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,220
so I saved you two.

134
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,220
That's all?

135
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,260
Yes.

136
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,620
Master.

137
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,380
Master?

138
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,140
He's here already?

139
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,300
I guess not.

140
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Dongjun, I don't think

141
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,180

142
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,180
Impossible.

143
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,860

144
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,100

145
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,100

Dongjun.

149
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,100
Taking someone as your master is not

150
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,220

151
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,300

to take only one disciple today.

156
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,380
No.

157
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,460
I have to go to see him.

158
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,420

to be really careless.

159

want to mess with.

169
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,340
I know what I'm doing.

170
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,820
Being good-looking sure comes

171
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,260
with its own perks.

172
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,180
What do you mean?

173
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,700
If you were in his place,

174
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,620
you might not have been given
this Frostpeak Water.

175
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,620
I look charming,

176
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,580
don't I?

177
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,660
Far worse than him.

178
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,940

It's okay.

183
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,500
Ye, you're awake?

184
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,900
You...

185
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,140
Watch out.

186
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,900
Qingyang, Wang.

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,700
Did we

193
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,500
meet before?

194
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,700
He is Luo Qingyang.

195
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,500
Then she is...

196
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,140
Yun, over here!

197
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,780
She is...

198
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,660
Wenjun.

199
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,660
Why are you gawking?

200
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,220
Oh, right.

201
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,740
This one here is our savior,

202
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,940
Princess Consort Jingyu.

203
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,780
Don't call me Princess Consort.

204
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,700
Prince Jingyu and I

205
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,820
haven't got married yet.

206
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,300
Wang,

207
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,580
how is your injury?

208
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,980
Thanks to your and Luo's
timely rescue,

209
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,220
there were no injuries
to my internal organs.

210
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,820
I am all healed now.

211
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,820
Well,

212
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,620
you're no longer being pursued
by those fighters, are you?

213
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,540
No way.

214
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,900
His Majesty

215
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,620
once gave Mount Wangcheng

216
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,660
the Plaque of Integrity.

217
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,500
It proves that we have high integrity

218
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,780
and we are to be treated
as esteemed guests everywhere we go.

219
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,540
That night was nothing but an accident.

220
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,540
If so, why are you

221
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,540
still here?

222
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,540
Sure.

223
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,780
Well, Ye, are you...

224
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,380
I...

225
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,260
[Li Hanyi, Daughter of Lei Mengsha]
You're awake.

226
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,020
Little girl,

227
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,340
where am I?

228
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,700
You're at my home.

229
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,620
My father brought you back.

230
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,180
I know this is your home.

231
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,860
So, who are you?

232
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,060
I am Li Hanyi.

233
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,500
Li Hanyi?

234
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,300
I see.

235
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,180
You're Mr. Li's daughter.

236
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,220
How old is he, then?

237
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,540
His daughter is actually so young.

238
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,040
[Li Xinyue, Lei Mengsha's Wife,]
Hanyi,

239
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,820
[Heiress of Heart Sword]
our guest is awake?

240
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,460
Mother.

241
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,860
Oh my.

242
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,500
Oh my.

243
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,100
Mother, that mister is very odd.

244
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,140
Is something wrong with his head?

245
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,300
He's as annoying as Father.

246
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
Mind your words.
You can't call him that.

247
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,620
Greetings, Madam.

248
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,220
I am Baili Dongjun.

249
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,580
Nice to meet you.

250
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,100
How come I do not know

251
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,900
that I have a disciple now?

252
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
This is my wife.

253
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,620
This is my daughter.

254
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,460
This is my house,

255
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,340
you fool.

256
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,980
Did you just call her Madam?

257
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,580
I know

258
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,660
that even though

259
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,020
by right, I am your senior.

260
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,700
But I don't mind you

261
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,180
treating me as your master.

262
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,020
How about this?

263
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,620
Don't call me master.

264
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,940
Call me Father instead.

265
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,460
Go away!

266
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,940
I only had the wrong idea
because your daughter's surname

267
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,980
is Li.

268
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,620
She took my surname.

269
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,580
May I know your name?

270
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,980
I am Li Xinyue of Swordheart Grave.

271
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,940
My uncle told me

272
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,900
that it's a sword-forging family

273
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,100
far superior to Famous Swords Manor.

274
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,220
Not bad, Lei.

275
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,020
You are formidable outside,

276
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,100
but when you're home,

277
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,740
you are a matrilocal husband.

278
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,740
Of course.

279
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,220
The Lei Family of Thunderbolt Sect

280
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,460
is just as famous

281
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,900
in the martial arts world.

282
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,740
Don't call me matrilocal husband.

283
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,340
I... I'll kill you.

284
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,460
Tell me

285
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,980
why your daughter
didn't take your surname, then?

286
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,420
I... She...

287
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,580
I...

288
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,340
Because Father was expelled

289
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,420
from Lei Fortress.

290
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,220
His children cannot take Lei
as their surname.

291
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,460
I don't want Lei as my surname either.

292
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,500
It sounds fierce.

293
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,860
Hanyi, let's go back inside.

294
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,700
Let your father talk

295
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,740
to this mister here.

296
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,860
Let's go.

297
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,180
Fine. Now that you're awake,

298
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,980
I'll bring you to see Master now.

299
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,780
Wait.

300
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Where is Ye Dingzhi?

301
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,660
Did he come back?

302
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,100
No.

303
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,700
I have to find him.

304
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,700
You don't need to.

305
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,380
Don't go.

306
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,620
Wang, you're back.

307
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,620
Where is Ye Dingzhi?

308
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,860
Did he enter the Academy already?

309
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,940
Well,

310
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,700
he is recuperating at the safest place

311
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,500
in Tianqi City,

312
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,140
accompanied by

313
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,460
a ravishing beauty.

314
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,860
You don't need to worry about him.

315
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,420
What do you mean?

316
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,380
If so,

317
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,860
why are you still here?

318
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,780
Fine.

319
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,740
Well, Ye, are you...

320
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,020
I...

321
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,180
I'll stay for the moment.

322
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,100
Wang.

323
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,660
Please tell Dongjun

324
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,340
to put effort
into learning from Mr. Li.

325
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,660
I'll wait for the day
when he becomes famous.

326
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,740
That's all?

327
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,260
He only said that?

328
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:29,820
Yes.

329
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,540
Wang.

330
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,580
Who else other than you knows

331
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,940
that the lady

332
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,900
saved you?

333
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,860
Other than us,

334
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,860
our mysterious pursuer

335
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,020
knows about it too.

336
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,300
Don't tell anyone else,

337
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,380
then.

338
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,020
The affairs of the court can be

339
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,420
quite complicated.

340
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,820
Since that lady said

341
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,820
that her help was something personal,

342
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,140
Prince Jingyu might not be aware of it.

343
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,500
Don't worry.

344
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,740
I know what to do.

345
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,100
Oh, right.

346
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
I heard the purple-robed man say

347
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,660
that Ye Dingzhi was

348
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,460
an innate martial artist as well.

349
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,580
He wanted to take him somewhere.

350
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,940
In that case,

351
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,140
staying with Princess Consort Jingyu

352
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,340
is indeed

353
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,540
his safest bet.

354
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,660
What exactly
is an innate martial artist?

355
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,820
Well,

356
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,300
Master should have the answer to that.

357
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,900
[Jixia Academy]

358
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,060
I'll see you off here, then.

359
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,700
I have completed my task

360
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,060
and should return to Mount Wangcheng.

361
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,380
Thank you for your assistance, Wang.

362
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,540
The world is vast.

363
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,820
May we meet again.

364
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,260

Curse it!

404
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,980
I managed

405
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,300
to prank all his seniors with that,

406
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,580
but he dodged it

407
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,180
like I did when I was young.

408
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,740
That's not good.

409
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
So boring.

410
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,060
You're really boring.

411
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,900
It's a solemn ritual,

412
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,540
but you're pulling a trick
I used to play.

413
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,460
I am the punk of Qiandong City.

414
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,020
Try something new next time.

415
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,580
All right.

416
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,940
While

417
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,860
the opening act
leaves much to be desired,

418
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,180
let's get back to business

419
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,860
and begin the Academy's
apprenticeship ritual.

420
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,580
Baili Dongjun.

421
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,060
Yin Luoxia.

422
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,140
I am Xiao Ruofeng.

423
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,380
I know that already.

424
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,580
I am Mr. Li's

425
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,300
seventh disciple.

426
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,420
From now on,

427
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,780
you may call me Seventh Senior

428
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,420
or Seventh Martial Uncle.

429
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,580
Of course,

430
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,740
you can call me Ruofeng too.

431
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,860
Ruofeng.

432
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,740
Seventh Martial Uncle.

433
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,220
I'm Mr. Li's sixth disciple,

434
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,020
Luo Xuan.

435
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,380
Sixth Senior.

436
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,900
Sixth Martial Uncle.

437
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,780
I'm Mr. Li's fourth disciple.

438
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,460
Mo...

439
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,380
Liu Yue.

440
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,940
Xiaohei.

441
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,820
Fifth Martial Uncle.

442
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,620
Master.

443
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,300
It sure is different
when one has a disciple already.

444
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,340
Don't you think so?

445
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,300
Get up.

446
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,620
Senior Mochen.

447
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,020
Senior Liu Yue.

448
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,060
Isn't this Mr. Lingyun,

449
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,100
Gu Jianmen?

450
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,820
Gu Jianmen

451
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,300
is your Third Senior.

452
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,300
And I am

453
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,420
Mr. Li's

454
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,220
second disciple,

455
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,340
also known as Mr. Zhuomo

456
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,620
and your Second Senior.

457
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,620
Second Senior?

458
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,340
Lei'er sounds better to my ears.

459
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,860
How rude of you.

460
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,140
Address me properly.

461
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,740
Quickly.

462
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,220
Fine. Just to make you look good.

463
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,700
Second Senior.

464
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,620
Second Martial Uncle.

465
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,900
Hi, Dongjun.

466
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,380
Hi, Luoxia.

467
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,380
Where is First Senior?

468
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,820
He never exists.

469
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,900
When I started here,

470
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,820
I am already the second disciple.

471
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,020
I have never seen him.

472
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,180
None of them has seen him either.

473
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,500
Master never explained.

474
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,420
How odd.

475
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,020
Exactly.

476
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,300
Master said

477
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,100
that the odder

478
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,140
one person was,

479
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,460
the more likely he'd become

480
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,380
a martial genius.

481
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,820
Look at me. I am odd.

482
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,180
Liu Yue is also odd.

483
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,100
They are odd.

484
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,940
And you...

485
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,620
Are you complimenting me?

486
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,340
Yes.

487
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,980
Master is the oddest of them all.

488
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,860
Lei'er, you speak too much.

489
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,820
Okay.

490
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,140
Dongjun.

491
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,540
Go.

492
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,460
Must you do this?

493
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,780
You don't need to do this to me.

494
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,620
You're becoming my disciple
not getting married.

495
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,620
Master.

496
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,660
Dongba,

497
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,820
from now on,

498
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,460
you are my youngest disciple.

499
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,300
Master,

500
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,580
please accept my bow.

501
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,700
Wonderful.

502
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,460
Did you just call me Dongba?

503
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,500
Lei'er, Jiansan, Liusi,

504
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,780
Heiwu, Xuanliu, and Fengqi.

505
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,500
You

506
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,940
will naturally be Dongba.

507
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,980
Master.

508
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,620
You're really so boring.

509
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,060
Yes.

510
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,420
I've lived so long

511
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,140
that many things become boring.

512
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,500
Therefore,

513
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,220
I must do something to entertain myself.

514
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,260
How long have you lived for?

515
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,780
Back then, my slash shook the Heaven.

516
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,780
Immortals descended and told me

517
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,980
that I did not belong
to the mortal realm,

518
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,740
and that I should live in Heaven.

519
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,180
They wanted to bring me with them,

520
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,220
but I said no.

521
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,140
The Immortals then touched my head

522
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,980
and said that they would
give me immortality

523
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,100
so that I could experience
mortal life fully.

524
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,620
This scene was witnessed

525
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,100
by the Poetry Deity

526
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,700
and the great poem was born.

527
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,300
A divine touch on my head,

528
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,020
and thus I was given a long life.

529
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,020
Guess how long I have lived?

530
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,060
Is this true?

531
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,180
Of course...

532
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,140
it's fake.

533
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,300
You're an idiot.

534
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:53,780
This old geezer.

535
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,300
People from the martial arts world
are cunning.

536
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,180
You know what?

537
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,300
I'll take you out one month later.

538
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,620
I'll show you

539
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,180
the worst of the martial arts world.

540
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,780
Why one month later?

541
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,380
Don't you want to drink

542
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,100
Qiulubai from Diaolou Tavern?

543
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,180
Qiulubai

544
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,740
is only available once per month.

545
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,700
Oh, no.

546
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,460
It's all gone for this month.

547
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,420
Worry not.

548
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,780
Just wait till next month.

549
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,020
You can drink to your heart's content

550
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,380
and we'll depart.

551
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,500
Oh, right, Master.

552
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,460
Someone once hinted at me

553
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,660
that I was an innate martial artist.

554
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,180
Wang also told me just now

555
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,820
that Ye Dingzhi too was
an innate martial artist.

556
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,460
What does that mean?

557
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,740
Being an innate martial artist

558
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,860
is both a blessing

559
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,180
and a curse.

560
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,380
All right.

561
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,420
That's all

562
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,820
for today's questions.

563
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,380
I'm sleepy.

564
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,100
Wait.

565
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,700
What a weird and stubborn old man.

566
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,660
Come on.

567
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,300
Tell me.

568
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,700
What nickname did Master

569
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,580
give you?

570
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,380
I wonder

571
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,300
what he called you.

572
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,940
Maybe Bailiba?

573
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,460
But Mo Xiaohei said Master was lazy,

574
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,980
and that he'd only use
a two-syllable nickname.

575
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,340
He thinks your nickname is Liba.

576
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,700
So, what is your nickname?

577
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,860
Dongba.

578
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,500
Oh, fellow seniors.

579
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,620
Master told me
that he had lived a long life.

580
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,300
How old is he?

581
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,820
We have no idea either.

582
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,260
Last year,

583
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,060
he celebrated his 80th birthday.

584
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,540
This year, he celebrated
his 70th birthday.

585
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,980
I guess next year,

586
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,620
it'll be his 100th birthday.

587
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,020
That's the way he is.

588
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,260
He made up things

589
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:56,780
on the spot.

590
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,380
Just ignore him.

591
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,220
Dongba.

592
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,300
Lei'er.

593
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,020
Dongba.

594
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,540
Lei'er.

595
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,300
Dongba.

596
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:05,860
Er.

597
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,260
I...

598
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,980
You look like

599
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,060
you're having

600
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,100
the world's best delicacy.

601
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,340
I took a bite,

602
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,980
but it was just

603
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,580
a plate of pickled vegetables
so salty that it could kill a cow.

604
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,980
And the cheapest liquor

605
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,020
sold in the down ahead.

606
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,060
Yet you actually enjoyed them a lot.

607
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,300
If you were

608
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,060
nearly starved to death once,

609
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,620
you'd be forever grateful

610
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,820
of every kind of food in this world.

611
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,540
You were nearly killed
by your illness once,

612
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,300
how come you are not grateful

613
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,540
of these herbs?

614
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,620
How could you just sit and watch

615
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,780
as your master grinds the herbs?

616
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,060
Anyway,

617
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,340
I have learned

618
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,300
all you have to teach me.

619
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,740
Based on our agreement,

620
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,460
tomorrow...

621
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,620
As soon as the sun rises tomorrow,

622
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,380
you will have nothing
to do with herbs anymore.

623
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,860
I remember that.

624
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,300
I do.

625
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,780
I might just be

626
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,980
the most pathetic master in this world.

627
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,780
You

628
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,580
have the talent for medicine.

629
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,140
In a few months,

630
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,300
you've mastered what would take
an ordinary person

631
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,180
years or decades to learn.

632
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,100
Why aren't you interested in it?

633
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,980
How long have you
been staying in the valley?

634
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,100
I came to Medicine King Valley
when I was 12.

635
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,820
I suppose

636
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,180
it has been 26 years.

637
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,900
That's so long.

638
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,100
Do you feel lonely?

639
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,020
The valley is secluded.

640
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,140
No one comes here.

641
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,500
Even if there is,

642
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,020
you only see people
on the brink of death like me.

643
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,140
I think,

644
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,620
since you're great at medicine,

645
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,020
you should go out.

646
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,380
Some want to make a name for themselves

647
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,980
and make big achievements.

648
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,900
Some

649
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,780
just want to enjoy peace alone.

650
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,860
How many lives cross over today

651
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,420
and how many lives are born?

652
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,300
It's all destiny.

653
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,900
Even if I go out,

654
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,260
how many lives can I save?

655
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,100
If like you, they stumble

656
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,340
upon Medicine King Valley,

657
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,860
they are fated to see me.

658
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,100
Regardless of their background

659
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,340
or motive,

660
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,860
I will save them.

661
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,620
So you're happy
to live like this forever?

662
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,060
A life without any change?

663
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,420
In your eyes,

664
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,300
I'm doing the same thing everyday.

665
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,980
But in my eyes,

666
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,100
every day is different.

667
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,780
In spring, Zhuwang Grass

668
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,820
will grow on the cliff.

669
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,740
During the solar term, Jingzhe,

670
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,100
night dews can compliment Baiqing Pills.

671
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,100
Horseweeds in Qingming
can be made into herb bricks.

672
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,980
How is this doing the same thing?

673
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,420
What's in your mind?

674
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,420
Your friend?

675
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,900
Yes.

676
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,020
I wonder how he's doing

677
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,900
in Tianqi City.

678
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,580
Is he as cocky as usual?

679
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,580
I came all the way

680
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,980
to run a tavern here.

681
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,420
Of course, I have some tricks
up my sleeves.

682
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,540
Run!

683
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,820
Is he being hunted down by somebody?

684
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,500
Is he accompanied

685
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,820
by trusty friends?

686
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,100
In fact,

687
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,620
one day,

688
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,100
I'll leave this valley too.

689
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,260
To admire the world outside

690
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,740
and to travel the world.

691
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,780
When?

692
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,900
When I find a real heir,

693
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,260
your junior.

694
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,940
Sorry, then.

695
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
I will not stay by your side.

696
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,980
I will pulverize the medicine
into pills

697
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,540
and put them in your luggage.

698
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,740
Take one

699
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,700
after lunch every day.

700
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,100
There are 100 pills in total.

701
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,300
I also asked
for a specific herbal powder

702
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,340
from the Mu Family of Qingzhou.

703
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,140
I don't want them to know

704
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,700
where I live,

705
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,140
so please

706
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,940
help me retrieve it.

707
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,900
But Qingzhou

708
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,540
is too far.

709
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,700
What Qingzhou?

710
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,980
The Mu Family's best apothecary
is Qiulu Apothecary

711
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,260
and it is in Tianqi City.

712
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,220
And you're heading to Tianqi City.

713
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,620
Don't you want

714
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,580
to go there?

715
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,780
Go, then.

716
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,660
100 pills are enough

717
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,060
to keep you alive till next year.

718
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,260
Enjoy your stay

719
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,220
in Tianqi City.

720
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,820
But do come back to brush up on

721
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,980
your knowledge.

722
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,540
The pills are not ready yet.

723
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,340
No need to be this eager.

724
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,900
Tianqi City, here I come!

725
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,900
This dish is called Caged Bird.

726
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,380
And this one is called Distant World.

727
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,020
Please dig in, Mr. Ye.

728
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,420
Luo is not eating?

729
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,740
Qingyang trains diligently

730
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,060
and he is used to an ascetic diet.

731
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,220
No need to worry about him.

732
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,500
Princess Consort,

733
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,060
what are you trying to convey

734
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,580
by making these two dishes for me?

735
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,620
I told you not
to call me Princess Consort.

736
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,820
I don't want to be a princess consort.

737
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,260
Okay.

738
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,540
If so,

739
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,100
miss, what do you want to talk about?

740
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,580
Tell me, Mr. Ye.

741
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,860
Why did you stay?

742
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,980
I must repay your favor.

743
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,660
As expected from someone I saved.

744
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,100
When I first saw you,

745
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,140
I knew you'd be a grateful

746
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,460
and loyal person.

747
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,100
It's not because

748
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,580
of my good looks?

749
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,180
In fact,

750
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,740
when I was unconscious,

751
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,100
I could hear

752
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,460
what you said.

753
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,940
Stop it.

754
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,900
All right, enough joking.

755
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,780
How do you want me
to repay your kindness?

756
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,620
I will do everything I can

757
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,900
for you.

758
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,900
It's not that serious.

759
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,620
Can you...

760
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,860
Can you

761
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,940
tell me about the world outside?

762
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,620
Once you're done, I'll let you go.

763
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,140
I have been staying here
for a long time.

764
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,100
While Qingyang is here,

765
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,940
he doesn't talk a lot.

766
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,060
So I hardly

767
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,020
talk to anyone.

768
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,460
Like this dish, Caged Bird,

769
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,260
I am caged

770
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,660
but I long

771
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,620
for the world outside.

772
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,500
She is actually leading an unhappy life.

773
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,100
You...

774
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,380
A leaf fell on your hair.

775
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,660
Oh, a leaf.

776
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,540
My martial prowess

777
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,420
isn't the best yet.

778
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,940
My elocution

779
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,220
is not so good.

780
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,140
But when it comes to my travel exposure,

781
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,860
you might not be able
to find someone as well-traveled as me

782
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,380
in Tianqi City.

783
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,900
Where have you been, then?

784
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,580
I went

785
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,940
to the 32 Buddhist States
in the Western Regions.

786
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,620
There's

787
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,980
a very interesting city.

788
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,100
It's unoccupied,

789
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,060
called Muliang.

790
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,180
When I was 13,

791
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,620
I followed my master to Nanjue.

792
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,020
I traveled as I practiced martial arts.

793
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,460
The southernmost place
I've been to is Mufeng Sea.

794
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:43,660
And then,

795
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,660
I traveled north

796
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,580
to the northernmost city in Beiman

797
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,580
called Suiye.

798
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,220
I was told

799
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,580
that the Beiman people were ruthless.

800
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,260
In a fight, the winner

801
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,940
can take away the loser's tent

802
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,180
and wife.

803
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,100
Until a new challenger emerges.

804
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,180
You're wrong.

805
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,620
The Beiman people
are actually very kind.

806
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,380
When I was there, I stayed

807
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,300
with a family.

808
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,580
They are just like us.

809
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,660
They only marry one person
in their lives.

810
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,460
The husband

811
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,100
will leave in the morning to hunt.

812
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,580
The grassland there is huge,

813
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,620
almost borderless.

814
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,060
Wenjun.

815
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,380
Qingyang.

816
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,180
You want Ye Dingzhi to help you escape.

817
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,220
Qingyang.

818
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,780
We grew up together.

819
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,500
But now...

820
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,300
I am the caged bird.

821
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,260
And you

822
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,540
are the cage warden.

823
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,580
You know

824
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,940
I don't want to marry Prince Jingyu.

825
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,900
But I can't defeat you in a fight.

826
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,540
But Ye Dingzhi

827
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,060
might be able to do that.

828
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,220
If he defeats me,

829
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,380
he earns the chance

830
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,020
to leave this mansion.

831
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,780
But if he finds out

832
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,100
that you're just using him...

833
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,380
Using him?

834
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,740
When I listened

835
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,420
to his stories,

836
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,060
I felt happy.

837
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,100
And he feels

838
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,620
so familiar to me.

839
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,140
His surname is also Ye.
