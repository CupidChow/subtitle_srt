00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

20
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,500

21
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,270

22
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:49,171

23
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,820

24
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,260
Drop.

25
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,510
Since you it's his demonic thought,

26
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,280
why did you provoke him?

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,990
Young Hero Ye.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,680
Your demonic thought is bringing repercussions again.

29
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,280
No.

30
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,100

31
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,000
Drink your medicine.

32
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,940
Ye Dingzhi, you're just trying to get back at me.

33
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,040
You let me see the medicine in front of me

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,340
and being unable to get it I end up dying with regret.

35
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,820
That's a good plan.

36
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,900
You're more ruthless than I am.

37
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,190
If I didn't know you were Yin Luoxia's sister,

38
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,660
I'd mistake you for Eloquent Zhuomo's.

39
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,880
What are you talking about?

40
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,300
You talk a lot of rubbish.

41
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,900
You're already like this. Would it kill you to keep your mouth shut?

42
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,700
Who did this to me?

43
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,960
If you hadn't provoked me this wouldn't have happened.

44
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,440
You're afraid to take responsibility for your actions.

45
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,980
Stop it.

46
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,620
I can't promise I won't hurt you again.

47
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,680
Drink your medicine.

48
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,820
 You're the one who said you'd stay to repay the favor, and finish the story for me.

49
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,260
 Brother Yun, I've missed you so much.

50
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,820
 I've missed you so much.

51
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,630
 I thought...

52
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,300
 I thought I'd never see you again.

53
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,180
 If you want to eat beef from the steppe, let's go to the steppe and eat it.

54
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,100
 If you want to worship the Buddha in the Buddhist States, let's go to the Buddhist States and worship it.

55
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,660
 If you want to drink herbal tea from Nanjue, let's go to Nanjue and drink it.

56
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,040
 If you want to take a boat trip to the east, let's go to the largest harbor in the east

57
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,580
 to board the boat and set sail.

58
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,860
 Let's be free and not be confined to Tianqi.

59
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,260
Wenjun.

60
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,900
 In the late winter of the following year,

61
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,980
 Prince Jingyu's first wife, Hu Cuoyang,

62
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,360
 gave birth to his sixth son.

63
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,280
 When the baby was born he wailed like thunder.

64
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,080
 Everyone in the mansion was shocked.

65
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,000
 Prince Langya himself named him Xiao Chuhe.

66
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,760
 Two months later Prince Jingyu's secondary consort, Yi Wenjun,

67
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,600
 gave birth to his seventh son.

68
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,300
 Yi Wenjun rejected the names chosen by Prince Jingyu and Prince Langya

69
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,680
 and asked her senior, Luo Qingyang, to name her child,

70
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,625
 Xiao Yu.

71
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:48,100

72
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,550
Mister Li has left.

73
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,540
He's giving the position of chancellor to someone from Shanqian Academy

74
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,240
who doesn't care about worldly affairs.

75
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,880
Do you know what this means?

76
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,560
This means that

77
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,800
Mister Li has decided to leave Tianqi City,

78
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,720
and never come back.

79
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,200
Among those who helped His Majesty build the empire,

80
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,780
only Marquis Zhenxi is left.

81
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,240
He controls a powerful army and defends the country's gates.

82
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,180
But now there are no tough enemies outside the gates,

83
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,680
so who's he going to stop?

84
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,400
In His Majesty's eyes,

85
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,760
he's the tough enemy.

86
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,000
Kill him

87
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,890
and I'll make sure that on the mandate of the heir apparent,

88
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,320
is your name.

89
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,080
Eunuch Jin Xuan, there's something I didn't dare to ask Grand Eunuch.

90
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,880
Now I'd like to ask you about it.

91
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,620
Your Highness, please go ahead.

92
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,360
Why did Grand Eunuch ask me to do this?

93
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,180
According to ancestral tradition, when the new emperor ascends to the throne,

94
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,700
where should the Grand Eunuch go?

95
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,820
He must guard the imperial tomb for the rest of his life.

96
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,610
However...

97
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,520
Master doesn't want to.

98
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,220
If one day, I can...

99
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,520
Some things can only be said halfway.

100
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,230
Your Highness... please.

101
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,960
He's easily fooled by a few words,

102
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,040
but he's still got a lot of guts and ruthlessness.

103
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,840
Therefore, he's not too bad.

104
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,920
It's his ruthlessness that I value.

105
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,790
Anyway... compared to Baili Luochen,

106
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,140
it's like comparing...

107
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,260
the ferocity of children fighting over a spinning top

108
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,050
to the ferocity of a sword

109
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:07,240
that cuts down countless heads along the way.

110
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,980
That day, we had a chance to kill Baili Luochen.

111
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,220
Trying to kill Baili Luochen in Qiandong City?

112
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,800
You're all too naive, aren't you?

113
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,100
That's why you were injured by Gu Chen and didn't dare return to Tian Wai Tian.

114
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,020
Am I right?

115
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,780
Yes. It's all thanks to you, Grand Eunuch Zhuoqing.

116
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:47,260
But don't worry. We've recovered most of our strength.

117
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:53,900
If we can't kill him in Qiandong City,

118
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,260
we'll kill him in Tianqi City.

119
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,260
Very good.

120
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,660
I hope you two can keep your promises.

121
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,020
The young master of Marquis Zhenxi's mansion, called Baili Dongjun,

122
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,020
used his Seven Starry Nights to outshine Diaolou Tavern

123
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:25,748
and the world's best man brought him around Tianqi City by his horse's whip,

124
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:30,820
and then made a racket and went away.

125
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,160
It's all very gratifying.

126
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:54,900
If there were neither Marquis Zhenxi's mansion nor the Academy behind him,

127
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,600
would he still be so unrestrained?

128
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:05,500
A young man who thinks he's outstanding in the Academy.

129
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:15,760
This time, get rid of them along with Baili Luochen.

130
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,460
Your Highness.

131
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,500
Your Highness.

132
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,300
I'm fine. I'm fine.

133
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
I'll help you into the carriage.

134
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,140
Yingxian.

135
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If it works this time,

136
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,400
I'll really be the emperor.

137
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,240
What's wrong?

138
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,800
These days I can't help but think of Brother Yun.

139
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,700
We didn't get to say goodbye to each other during the bride-snatching.

140
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,700
My father told me that he didn't die and was taken away.

141
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,900
When I get out I'll find him and snatch Wenjun back with him.

142
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,100
But Wenjun is already married.

143
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,600
So what?

144
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,000
She's become someone's wife and maybe the mother of children.

145
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
She's got her husband, her own family.

146
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,400
It's inappropriate to snatch her back in this situation.

147
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,180
Well...

148
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,400
That's up to Wenjun.

149
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,700
If she wants to, I'll go with Brother Yun to save her.

150
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,700
If she doesn't, I'll drink with Brother Yun to help drown his sorrows.

151
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,800

152
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,340
It's time.

153
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,180
Feizhan.

154
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,640
My Lord.

155
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,319
As I recall,

156
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:42,900
You and Feili have a relative in Tianqi City, Beili.

157
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,380
Yes.

158
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:49,280
That's why I stayed with my brother in Tianqi City for awhile when I was young.

159
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,360
I'm quite familiar with it.

160
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,510
Their surname is Zang and they're barely a noble family,

161
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,520
but they're in decline now.

162
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,680
Go to Tianqi then.

163
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,440
Use my secret code to contact Wufa and Wutian.

164
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,940
They've been gone long enough.

165
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,420
It's time for them to do something serious.

166
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,560
What do you need me to do?

167
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:20,100
Take Yi Wenjun out of Tianqi City and send her to the outskirts of Gusu City

168
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,900
so she can meet the man she's been thinking about.

169
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,940
Lovers are reunited and past destiny is resumed.

170
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,600
What a beautiful story.

171
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,060
It's a lovely day.

172
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,660
It's a shame the good times are coming to an end.

173
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,300
I don't want to take orders from him anymore.

174
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,280
 Grand Eunuch Zhuoqing.

175
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,000
Where are you two going?

176
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,580
To be honest, Grand Eunuch, we've been approached by Tian Wai Tian.

177
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,300
That's why we must leave the palace.

178
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,140
It's not easy to leave the palace.

179
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,180
In this huge palace of Beili there are many martial experts besides me.

180
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,600
I'll escort you out.

181
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,020
You'll be discovered if you go out like this.

182
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,100
Grand Eunuch, if you're up for it, why don't we go together?

183
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:08,800
But we don't know who is coming today.

184
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Maybe I know.

185
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Lord Wufa, Lord Wutian, why are you bringing a guest along?

186
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,400
He's a very important ally.

187
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,900
But at the moment he is waiting in a carriage outside the door.

188
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,500
He won't come in until we've finished our business.

189
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,700
Did you come here on the orders of Honorable Envoy Wuxiang?

190
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,000
Lord Wufa, Lord Wutian, since you're in Tianqi,

191
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,900
you must have heard of someone, Ye Dingzhi.

192
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,000
He's also a natural martial artist.

193
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,900
A descendant of Ye Yu.

194
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,400
Honorable Envoy Wuxiang has a good eye for talent.

195
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,500
I wonder what he'll do next.

196
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,800
Ye Dingzhi was once engaged to Yi Wenjun, the daughter of the Shadow Sect's leader,

197
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,100
and now Prince Jingyu's secondary consort.

198
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,000
They were reunited when he took the examination at the Academy.

199
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,700
Unfortunately the person who came this time is most annoying.

200
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,860
You don't need to see such a person.

201
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,920
It's all right.

202
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,260
I'll go see him alone.

203
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,300
It's said that the Soul Officials, Feili and Feizhan,

204
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,500
are the most important right-hand men of Honorable Envoy Wuxiang of Tian Wai Tian.

205
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,080
I'm happy to see you today.

206
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,680
The one you want to see is Honorable Envoy Wuxiang.

207
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,260
I don't have that honor.

208
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,000
Of course I'd like to meet Honorable Envoy Wuxiang,

209
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,600
but he's not worth all the effort.

210
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:45,440
The one I want to see... is your Emperor.

211
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,730
When I saw him at the city gate that year,

212
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,760
I remembered how impressive he was.

213
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,520
I wonder how His Majesty is doing now.

214
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,260
It seems that Lord Wufa and Lord Wutian have told you quite a lot.

215
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,700
Don't worry.

216
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,000
Perhaps I can help you.

217
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,880
I'll be sure to relay your words when I get back.

218
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,740
Since Tian Wai Tian is so sincere, I can't be too stingy.

219
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,580
This is my gift to Tian Wai Tian.

220
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,500
Four men are hiding in Tianqi City.

221
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,820
Go to them and tell them your plan.

222
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,080
Tell them you're friends of Ye Dingzhi.

223
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,500
They will do their best to help you.

224
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,120
They're good fighters.

225
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,880
Their identities may be more important than their martial arts.

226
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,300
Their master is the late Rain Demon, the Sword Deity.

227
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,080
Their bringing Yi Wenjun to Ye Dingzhi's side

228
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:26,540
is very different from you bringing Yi Wenjun to Ye Dingzhi's side.

229
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,520
Thank you, Grand Eunuch.

230
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,440
But when I get back to Tian Wai Tian, Honorable Envoy will ask me a question.

231
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,820
I have to ask you about it now.

232
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,260
Go ahead.

233
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,600
Why do you help us?

234
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,540
Because...

235
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,100
I want the world to be in chaos.

236
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,680
Some things can only be achieved through chaos.

237
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,640
He's just an eunuch.

238
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,220
He...

239
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,500
Grand Eunuch, how did the conversation go?

240
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,120
We had a good chat.

241
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,525

242
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,800
These four slaves know how to pick a place.

243
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,580
I don't agree!

244
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,860
I will never agree!

245
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,020
Second Young Lady, this is Honorable Envoy's order.

246
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,200
Besides, this is the best way to control Ye Dingzhi.

247
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,680
Second Young Lady, please don't let your emotions get the best of you.

248
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,880
How long does the entire plan take?

249
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,040
Three years at a minimum, five years at the most.

250
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,300
By then we'll return to Tian Wai Tian with Ye Dingzhi.

251
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,380
Grand Eunuch.

252
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,140
Commander Luo, are you leaving the palace today?

253
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,600
His Majesty has been kind enough to grant me a day's leave to visit my junior.

254
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,540
Commander Luo, you have a great affection for your junior.

255
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,980
If Prince Jingyu hadn't met your junior back then...

256
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,000
Grand Eunuch, you must be joking.

257
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,400
I apologize for speaking out of turn.

258
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,420
Well, I won't keep you any longer.

259
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,580
Goodbye.

260
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,220
Grand Eunuch, I'm just the Vice Commander.

261
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,260
How interesting.

262
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:48,540
In less than ten years, he'll be the best martial expert in the palace.

263
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,200
Commander Luo.

264
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,360
Why are there so few people?

265
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,760
His Highness sent some men but Her Highness drove them away.

266
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,920
Has she been happier since the baby was born?

267
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,077
Commander Luo, to be honest, Her Highness still doesn't talk much.

268
00:27:31,077 --> 00:27:34,300
She talks to me a little every day.

269
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,260
She hasn't been happier.

270
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,020
Instead, she frowns more than ever.

271
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,440
Senior Luo, you're here.

272
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,400
Commander Luo, please be mindful of etiquette.

273
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,540
I'm going to check on Yu'er.

274
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,540
He likes you very much.

275
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,260
Grand Eunuch, I've just received a message from Feizhan.

276
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,340
He met the four slaves at Baihua Hall

277
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,780
and convinced them to join the plan.

278
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,980
We'll take action today.

279
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,220
There's one person to watch out for.

280
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,620
The Vice Commander of the Imperial Guard, Luo Qingyang,

281
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,180
is also at Prince Jingyu's mansion today.

282
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,920
Luo Qingyang is the best disciple of the Shadow Sect's leader.

283
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,780
He's a great swordsman.

284
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,980
He's also one of the best of his generation in Beili.

285
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,220
Yes.

286
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,700
That means we have another obstacle.

287
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,900
No.... It's not an obstacle.

288
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,620
Instead, it's a great help.

289
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,860
When is the next time you're coming?

290
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,280
That's hard to say. His Majesty has granted me a rare day off.

291
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,820
I'm afraid it'll be a long time before the next one.

292
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,800
I see.

293
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,860
Your Highness, someone from the palace has sent you some pastries.

294
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,620
The palace?

295
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,340
You're not from the palace.

296
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,640
Who are you?

297
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,260
I'm Qin Yuehan.

298
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,080
We've been ordered by our young master, Ye Dingzhi, to save Miss Yi.

299
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,160
Where is Brother Yun now?

300
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,780
Young Master is in a safe place far away from Tianqi City.

301
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,420
Commander Luo, you fought alongside Young Master that day.

302
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,020
You won't give us a hard time today, right?

303
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,620
How can I trust you?

304
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,815
Young Master said if we ever got a chance to see Miss Yi,

305
00:30:41,815 --> 00:30:44,380
we should give her a message.

306
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,660
He said he'd take you to see the mountains.

307
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,040
 I'd take you to see the mountains,

308
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,531
 the rivers,

309
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,806
 to eat the beef in the north,

310
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,566
 and to travel around the 12 Buddhist States in the west.

311
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,899
 It will all come true one day.

312
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,860
 Wenjun, wait for me for two more years.

313
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:30,820
♫  Love and resentment are entangled and I'm still frozen in the past  ♫

314
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,220
That's really what he would say.

315
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,580
But now we've found a chance.

316
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,000
Young Master and you won't have to wait for two years.

317
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,880
A chance?

318
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,920
You need to ask the sword in my hand first.

319
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,840
Junior Wenjun...would you like to go?

320
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,860
Yes, Senior Luo, I'd like to go.

321
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,120
All right.

322
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,920
Just go.

323
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:37,120
I'll take care of the guards in the mansion for you.

324
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,600
Sect Master.

325
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,380
Kill.

326
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,020
Who are you?

327
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,480
Who are they to stop the two of us?

328
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,670

329
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,640
Who are these two men?

330
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,760
Yi Wenjun, come back.

331
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Go back.

332
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,580
 It's Father.

333
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,240
Go back!

334
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,380
 No, I'll never go back.

335
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,960

336
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:17,260
Sect Master Yi, it's been a long time.

337
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,820
It's you.

338
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,440
So you're still alive.

339
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:36,260

340
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,120
That's roughly what happened.

341
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,560
Ruofeng, how is it?

342
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,000
Brother, calm down.

343
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,640
How can I calm down?

344
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:53,020
I've been away for a few days and this has happened.

345
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,820
That's outrageous.

346
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,240
What news do you have for me?

347
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,920
Did you catch anyone?

348
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,760
No. They must have come prepared.

349
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,440
People were stopping us along the way.

350
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,740
- My men couldn't catch up with them. 
 - Useless!

351
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,360
Where is Luo Qingyang?

352
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,440
Where is Luo Qingyang?

353
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,920
He helped them escape.

354
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,960
I'll report him to Imperial Father and have him punished.

355
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,460
No.

356
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,480
Prince Jingyu's secondary consort was abducted within the mansion.

357
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,920
If this matter spreads,

358
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,820
Prince Jingyu's mansion will become the joke of Tianqi City.

359
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,960
Not to mention letting Imperial Father know.

360
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,880
From today forward, announce to the public

361
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,040
that Princess Consort Yi has contracted a serious illness and is unable to see anyone.

362
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,440
No one in her rooms is allowed to leave the mansion.

363
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,660
What should we do?

364
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,960
Ye Dingzhi.

365
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Yes, as long as we find Ye Dingzhi everything will be all right.

366
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,000
Ruofeng, you took him away that day.

367
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,140
Where is he now?

368
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,480
I didn't send anyone to follow him after crossing Mount Muyun.

369
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,400
His whereabouts are unknown. We need to find where he is now.

370
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,920
You...

371
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,160
We should have killed him in the first place to avoid any more trouble.

372
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,300
You were too kind to think he was your junior's best friend

373
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,660
and General Ye's descendant, and insisted that I spare his life.

374
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,000
Fine. I spared his life.

375
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,360
But you took him away without sending anyone to follow him.

376
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,160
And now I'm in such a mess.

377
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,800
You're too soft-hearted. Soft-hearted!

378
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,360
Imperial Brother, calm down.

379
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,360
Ye Dingzhi is not that powerful.

380
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,640
There must be someone backing him.

381
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:46,120
Besides him, you should be more worried about the person who took Sister-in-law.

382
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,140
Are you saying that behind this force is more than just Rain Demon's men?

383
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,780
Of course, it's not that simple.

384
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,420
- Sect Master Yi. 
 - Father-in-law.

385
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:11,020
Yesterday, I chased Wenjun to the city gate and had a chance to intercept her,

386
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,160
but two men suddenly appeared and stopped me.

387
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,860
If they could stop you, they must be no ordinary men.

388
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:27,660
Yes. And I've seen these two before.

389
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,680
Who are they?

390
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:51,740
His Majesty was still a prince, and although Beique was small, they had great ambition.

391
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:58,340
They had been harassing our borders and colluding with Xichu.

392
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:02,420
His Majesty was ordered to go on an expedition and I joined the army.

393
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,300
In the end, Beique lost.

394
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:12,460
To avoid being leveled, they took a risky step and came up with a plan.

395
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,100
What's it?

396
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,140
Beique was a country of martial arts

397
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,320
and the Emperor was not only the head of the country but also the leader of the sect.

398
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,100
Under the Emperor, five guardians excelled in martial arts.

399
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:30,720
They sent five men to assassinate the leaders of the army,

400
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,880
that is, His Majesty and the Military Deity, Ye Yu.

401
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:41,320
Among the two of them, one is short and fat, the other is tall and thin.

402
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,240
They are the ones who stopped me yesterday.

403
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:53,900
That means they're the remnants of Beique.

404
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,980
How ironic.

405
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,660
The biggest contributor to Beique's demise was Ye Yu.

406
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,260
Now, they are helping Ye Dingzhi.

407
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,140
I've heard that General Ye led his troops with great restraint.

408
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,580
That's why the war lasted so long,

409
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:13,280
but there were fewer casualties than in the previous war against Xichu.

410
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,460
After Beique's territory was incorporated into Beili,

411
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,060
the rest of their people were submissive.

412
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,920
These were all General Ye's credits.

413
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:29,840
But this time, Beique's men helping Ye Dingzhi has nothing to do with this.

414
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,160
I'm afraid there's a bigger conspiracy behind this.

415
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,460
 What conspiracy?

416
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:49,180
Shouldn't the Shadow Sect be telling me this?

417
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,360
Go to Lei Mengsha. Let him make the trip.

418
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,940
Yes.

419
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,720
Not bad. I can see that you've already achieved something.

420
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,940
Now I can carry a zither and hurt people with its sound.

421
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,460
It's so elegant and impressive.

422
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,060
This technique you taught me is really awesome. What's its name?

423
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,900
It's Xunian Technique of Beique.

424
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,340
Xunian Technique?

425
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,420
Yes.

426
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:34,700
It's the most profound martial art in Beique and also the most difficult to master.

427
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,620
I've been practicing for years but only picked up the basics.

428
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,380
But you're a natural martial artist.

429
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,500
You can master it naturally.

430
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,900
Xunian, Xunian, illusory and real. 
  (TN: xunian - false thoughts)

431
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,460
Just as the sound of the zither turns into blades,

432
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,920
Why did you have me learn this technique?

433
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:07,720
I wanted to teach you this technique long ago so that you could save my father.

434
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,420
Then I changed my mind.

435
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:16,780
But Mister Li said there was no harm in teaching you.

436
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,100
It was for after you mastered the 19 Embroidery Sword Techniques

437
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,620
and became more mature.

438
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:30,480
I think this is the right time.

439
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:36,060
I see. So when are we going to save your father?

440
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,720
To Tian Wai Tian?

441
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,760
It's not the right time. It's too dangerous.

442
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,780
Besides, if my father was out,

443
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:53,720
it would be a catastrophe for Beili and the world.

444
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:03,760
Though I truly miss him a lot.

445
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,460
Yao'er, don't worry.

446
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,380
Just wait until we're ready to persuade him not to start a war.

447
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,460
I'll be with you.

448
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,900
Dongjun, thank you.

449
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,801

450
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:33,420

451
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:45,110
