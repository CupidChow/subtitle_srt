00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,200
I like it very much.

193
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,560
Even if I could predict
everything in the world,

194
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,960
I could not foresee our reunion.

195
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,200
I didn't expect it to be like this.

196
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,400
Tell me some stories

197
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
about the outside world.

198
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,320
I'll let you go when you're done.

199
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,960
I haven't left this place
in a long time.

200
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,960
Just like this dish called Caged Bird,

201
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,870
although I'm caged,

202
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,160
I yearn

203
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,110
for the outside world.

204
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,560
I wonder if she will be willing

205
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,920
if I suggest taking her out.

206
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,230
You're back.

207
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,630
I met Young Lady during the day.

208
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,510
What was her explanation?

209
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,350
I will explain

210
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,710
the details to you later.

211
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,350
However, there's one thing
that we can confirm.

212
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,560
She has not betrayed Sky's Beyond.

213
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,800
That's good.

214
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Are there any other instructions

215
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,110
from Lord Wuxiang?

216
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,320
He instructed us to give a great gift

217
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,800
to the imperial family of Beili.

218
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,040
What?

219
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,110
You're saying that Ye Dingzhi is Ye Yun?

220
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,110
The son of Ye Yu, Ye Yun?

221
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,990
No wonder he didn't want
the imperial jade seal.

222
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,160
No wonder he said
I can definitely provide him

223
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,870
with what he wants.

224
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,870

named Biluo City

to go to 32 Buddhist States
in the Western Regions.

On the way to Biluo City,

one will pass through

261
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,550
a small town called Sangu Town.

262
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,710
It is also known as
the town of belles.

by some merchants.

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,270
There are plenty of gambling houses,

275
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,790

Even a courtesan is brought up.

You haven't answered my question yet.

304

I still could not finish reading
all the books in this world.

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,310
For me,

306
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640

I can only seize the time

to read more books.

310
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,230
Some people became bookworms

311
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,840
from reading too much.

312
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,680
However, if one reads so many books

313
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,600
that even a hundred bookworms combined

314
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,470
couldn't surpass the amount,

315
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,680

00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,470
Qiulubai is only available once a month.

379
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,030
I'm afraid there won't be any today.

380
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,640
Such a pity.

381
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,640
If I had known,

382
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,840
I'd have asked Master
to keep some for me.

383
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,070
By the way,

384
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,600
aren't we going
to ask Master to join us?

385
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,230
Dongjun,

386
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,550
usually,

387
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,790
we can't call him
to join occasions like this.

388
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:23,920
What occasion?

389
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,120
Why?

390
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,160
The less you know, the better.

391
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Didn't I already tell you

392
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,680
not to come in unless I ask for you?

393
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,200
There is a guest outside

394
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,920
who has a question for you, sirs.

395
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,880
What is it? Shoot.

396
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,710
Should you start the feast

397
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,270
when Mr. Li isn't here yet?

398
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,360
Go, go, go.

399
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,600
Run!

400
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,470
Let's drink together.
What are you running away from?

401
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,840
Master.

402
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,710
Sit.

403
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,360
Xuan, you sit down, too.

404
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,440
Excuse me.

405
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,360
Xie Xuan.

406
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,960
It's been a while.

407
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,270
Lei'er, this is...

408
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,990
You're being rude.

409
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,640
Have a guess.

410
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,680
Do you really think I didn't know?

411
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,230
Since you all know him

412
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,640
and he is invited here by Master,

413
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,360
among the Eight Young Masters of Beili,

414
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,460
apart from the unnamed senior

415
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,200
whom I have never met

416
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,400
and Third Senior Gu

417
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,270
who is far away in Xinan Circuit,

418
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,600
only Mr. Qingxiang remains.

419
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,920
Dongba, you're pretty smart.

420
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,200
It has been a while

421
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,470
since I had a drink with you all.

422
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,470
This grand gesture

423
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,600
must have been arranged
by Ruofeng, right?

424
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,070
Your new junior,

425
00:23:59,230 --> 00:23:59,990
Dongba,

426
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,120
just joined us.

427
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,790
It should be celebrated indeed.

428
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,790
Feel free to decide

429
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,790
how you want to drink,

430
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,030
I'll up for it.

431
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,120
Well...

432
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,440
Mr. Li.

433
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,470
Dongjun just joined the Academy today,

434
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,440
I think we should just forget it.

435
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,750
How can we do that?

436
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,840
Here, let us toast for Master together.

437
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,640
Dongba, great.

438
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,440
Come, cheers.

439
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:36,920
Cheers.

440
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,710
Drink up.

441
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,880
This is good liquor.

442
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,160
Ruofeng, listen.

443
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,640
The most important thing for a man

444
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,230
is his status.

445
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,640
Whenever I went to Baihua Hall,

446
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,310
Li Xinyue would

447
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,790
help me pay the bill.

448
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,680
That is great.

449
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,710
Senior.

450
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,600
Dongjun,

451
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,030
you know now

452
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,160
why we

453
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,920
refrained from asking Mr. Li to join us.

454
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,400
Never forget the dreams
of the human world for hundreds of years,

455
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,530
drink thousands of cups
without getting drunk

456
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,160
to attain immortality.

457
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,160
Poetry Deity wrote this
for me exclusively

458
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,440
back in the day.

459
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,030
Why are you all drunk already?

460
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,160
This is no fun.

461
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,960
Dongba,

462
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,470
I knew you'd hold your liquor.

463
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,360
Here, have a drink with me.

464
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,400
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

465
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,360
I can't.

466
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,440
After leaving Jiulong Temple,

467
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,310
you'd arrive at the Buddhist States.

468
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,880
Speaking of the Buddhist States,

469
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,470
when I was there,

470
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,070
I took a monk as my Zen Master

471
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,360
and learned Buddhism
for one month.

472
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
After that,

473
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,310
I met my current master,

474
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,120
who is a sword master

475
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,360
from Nanjue.

476
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,710
Master?

477
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,640
Dongba,

478
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,440
since you just joined the Academy,

479
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,230
I have

480
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,360
prepared a gift for you.

481
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,600
Really? I'm getting a gift?

482
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,840
Of course.

483
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,070
I am

484
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,440
the Mr. Li who never lies.

485
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,550
Xuan.

486
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,710
Drink 30 cups of liquor in a row,

487
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,400
and your inner force and aura

488
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,310
will be greatly improved.

489
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,030
This is no ordinary book,

490
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,470
nor is it ordinary liquor.

491
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,120
Your former master, Gu Chen,

492
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,160
also read this book.

493
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,200
I'm giving it to you now.

494
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,270
Keep it well.

495
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,990
He's just lending it.

496
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,810
[Liquor Scripture]

497
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,680
Thank you, Master.

498
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,120
Thank you, Mr. Qingxiang.

499
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,960
Now that we're done drinking,

500
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,400
it's time for a fight.

501
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,030
What a strong sword qi.

502
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,710
Look.

503
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,440
Someone more pretentious than Xuanliu

504
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,640
has finally appeared.

505
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,270
He's making such a big fuss

506
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,440
like he's worried that others won't know

507
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,440
his identity.

508
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,710
Master,

509
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,360
who is he?

510
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,070
He is Rain Demon, the Sword Deity.

511
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,780
[Rain Demon, the Sword Deity of Nanjue]

512
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,360
Li Changsheng,

513
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,030
I haven't seen you in a long time.

514
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,790
I don't think
I'd like to see you much.

515
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,310
He... He's a man?

516
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,400
Indeed.

517
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,990
Why...

518
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,880
He practices
Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

519
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,640
Here's a rumor related to
Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

520
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,310
The sword manual
can only be passed down

521
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,510
by mortals who borrowed powers
from a demon god.

522
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,680
Those who practice it

523
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,960
are highly susceptible to backfire.

524
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
He is the example
of someone who went haywire

525
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,200
when suppressing the strong backfire of

526
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,960
Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

527
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,680
That is why

528
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,230
despite having a male body,

529
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,360
his face is becoming
more and more woman-like.

530
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,710
Rain Demon,

531
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,680
why did you come all the way

532
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,790
from Nanjue?

533
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,270
To find someone.

534
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,510
Could it be Ye Dingzhi?

535
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,640
You're aware?

536
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,600
Get out of the way!

537
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Why are you attacking?

538
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,880
Where is he?

539
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,640
What he?

540
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,550
Who are you talking about?

541
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,790
Don't play dumb.

542
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,840
Ye Dingzhi.

543
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,160
Where is he?

544
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,400
Who are you?

545
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Why should I tell you?

546
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,030
I am his master.

547
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,200
If you say so.

548
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,960
He came to take the Academy examination

549
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,440
to take Master as his master.

550
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,790
Ridiculous.

551
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,680
Sword Borrowing Technique.

552
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,640
What is happening?

553
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,440
This is a duel
between two Sword Deities.

554
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,710
It's not just a matter of moves
and techniques,

555
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,310
but an unparalleled display
of brilliance

556
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,310
that resonates
with the heavens and the earth.

557
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,160
Your Majesty,

558
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,680
it's Rain Demon's Mystic Wind Sword.

559
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,230
Father,

560
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,680
Rain Demon

561
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,400
must be...

562
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,510
He must be here to find Ye Yun.

563
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,990
The son of that treacherous minister

564
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,550
has been hiding in Nanjue
for many years,

565
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,360
he has since acquired
excellent swordsmanship.

566
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,960
He must...

567
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,200
He must be a disciple of Rain Demon.

568
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,600
Father,

569
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,030
you can't hesitate any longer.

570
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,790
He is here for revenge.

571
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,920
He wants my life.

572
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,640
Although I'm not afraid of death,

573
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,230
I am more worried

574
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,230
about your safety.

575
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,030
Father!

576
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,990
Issue a wanted order.

577
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,440
Conduct a citywide manhunt

578
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,640
for Ye Dingzhi.

579
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,550
As Your Majesty's command.

580
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,470
Stop.

581
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,710
Where are you going?

582
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,920
I'm going to find my master.

583
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,120
He came to see me.

584
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,400
I have to go see him.

585
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,550
You can't go.

586
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:49,990
Miss...

587
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,510
It was you who said you wanted to stay
and repay your kindness

588
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,790
by telling me all the stories.

589
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,440
I don't mean to leave,

590
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,200
it's just that if my master
can't find me,

591
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,790
he will certainly
disrupt Tianqi's peace.

592
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,030
Miss, I promise you

593
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,400
that I will definitely come back
to see you

594
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,510
after meeting my master.

595
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,550
I don't believe you.

596
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,470
Miss.

597
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,750
Miss, please don't cry.

598
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,310
I really...

599
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,510
What a rare opportunity.

600
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,880
So, are you a human or a demon?

601
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,470
Why do you keep appearing
out of nowhere?

602
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,230
Li Changsheng and Rain Demon

603
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,440
have had three battles in total.

604
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,160
During the first battle,

605
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,440
Li Changsheng was already

606
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,600
the world-famous swordsman

607
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,160
whereas Rain Demon had just
entered the martial arts world.

608
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,550
Rain Demon challenged Li Changsheng

609
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,030
and was defeated by his sword.

610
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,360
Due to the fact

611
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,510
that Rain Demon was not famous
at the time,

612
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,360
only a few people
know about this battle.

613
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,440
For the second battle,

614
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,360
Li Changsheng still defeated
Rain Demon with his sword.

615
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Rain Demon's sword failed him,

616
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,510
so he changed to practice
Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

617
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,990
There were no spectators
during the third battle.

618
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,880
Rain Demon has never set foot in Beili

619
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,960
in the next eight years.

620
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,960
So,

621
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,360
why are you here?

622
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,920
This is a match
of unparalleled magnitude,

623
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,440
I'm naturally here to record it.

624
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,280
Li Changsheng,

625
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,280
you will surely be defeated

626
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,030
in this battle.

627
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,070
You said the same thing
in our last battle.

628
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,360
The Academy has to pay a hefty sum

629
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,960
after this battle.

630
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:08,920
Break.

631
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,550
Who's there?

632
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,720
How noisy.

633
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,550
Wait,

634
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,400
that's it?

635
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,960
Not so soon.

636
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,800
His pupils are exhibiting
an unusual hue,

637
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,920
he must have fallen
into the demonic path.

638
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,440
I've read this statement

639
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,590
in a book before.

640
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,240
That is indeed true.

641
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,440
However, this is not the kind

642
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,030
of demonic path in practice
that ordinary people experience.

643
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,030
Rain Demon became a demon voluntarily

644
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,990
by trading his own flesh body

645
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,720
to acquire Divinity Sword Technique.

646
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,110
You're really

647
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,990
as dramatic as ever,
unchanged for decades.

648
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,630
You just can't act like an expert

649
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,190
without causing a big commotion.

650
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,590
Falling Swords.

651
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,720
Skyquake!

652
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,320
How audacious.

653
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,920
Is this what they mean by

654
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,630
struck by lightning?

655
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,800
That's a bad choice

656
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,110
of words.

657
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,550
Where are they?

658
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,760
Could it be

659
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,840
that they were struck by lightning
and vanished?

660
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,510
I just started my apprenticeship,

661
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,590
and I haven't learned anything yet.

662
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,720
It is only natural that they left
since the battle is over.

663
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,240
It's over?

664
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,510
Who won?

665
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,190
Didn't you see?

666
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,760
Did you?

667
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,670
I saw everything clearly, of course.

668
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,840
What?

669
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,920
I'm the weakest, and I couldn't tell.

670
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,880
He is just bluffing,

671
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:34,990
and he couldn't tell either.

672
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,320
How about you?

673
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,440
As expected, the best in the world.

674
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,280
I told you before.

675
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,510
Demon Deity Sword Techniques
devour its practitioner.

676
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,030
It has been so many years,

677
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,440
why can't you just let go?

678
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,990
Is it really that important
to win against me?

679
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,880
Actually,

680
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,030
you just need to go back, get some rest,

681
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,440
improve yourself,

682
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,240
and wait for me to die in a few years

683
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,990
before you return to fight
for the first place in the world.

684
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,030
Wouldn't that be easier?

685
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,630
No one knows how long
you have been around.

686
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:26,990
I'm afraid

687
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,880
I won't be able to wait until that day.

688
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,990
Don't worry.

689
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,400
It won't take too long,

690
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,630
I know

691
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,280
that I can't defeat you

692
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,960
but I heard rumors

693
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,990
that Ye Dingzhi came to Tianqi City.

694
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,920
I know his background,

695
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,550
but I'm afraid that he might be
put in a difficult spot by others

696
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,550
in Tianqi City.

697
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,840
I wasn't expecting

698
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,760
that the cold-hearted

699
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,320
Rain Demon

700
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,590
would deeply care

701
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,990
for his disciple.

702
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,070
Three days

703
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:21,990
after you leave,

704
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,280
I will certainly let your disciple

705
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,590
go back without a scratch.

706
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,110
Is my promise enough?

707
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,960
I can't see through you.

708
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,280
That's right.

709
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,470
I am the top in the world,

710
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,150
it shouldn't be easy for others
to see through me.

711
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:39,630
Do not worry.

712
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,720
Ye Dingzhi is a genius,

713
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,720
and he will survive Tianqi City.

714
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,240
I'll take my leave.

715
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,110
You can't defeat me in this life,

716
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,800
but if your disciple

717
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,110
defeats mine in the future,

718
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,760
I will consider that you win.

719
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,510
[Nectar Liquor]

720
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,240
Why is it so cold?

721
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,630
What's happening?

722
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:01,960
Why is there such a big hole

723
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,070
in the roof?

724
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,720
Why is the roof gone

725
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,070
after my nap?

726
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,110
Right.

727
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,840
You're about to turn into a popsicle

728
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,320
if you don't wake up now.

729
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,150
What happened?

730
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,960
I guess our master

731
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,030
got into a fight with someone

732
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,440
and caused this hole

733
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,590
even before the fight started.

734
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,880
This is just the inside,

735
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,030
you haven't seen the outside.

736
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,280
We can't even

737
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,360
see a single intact tile

738
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,070
up there.

739
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:50,760
This is the bill.

740
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,920
Didn't Mr. Li

741
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,110
just cause a hole?

742
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,070
Why do we have to pay compensation

743
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,190
for the whole store's losses?

744
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,190
Well...

745
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,550
Right.

746
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,630
Dongba,

747
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,590
who is bold enough

748
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,440
to challenge Master

749
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,590
and flee without paying
for compensation?

750
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,240
We have to ask him to pay up.

751
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,280
Yes.

752
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,670
I'm afraid it'll be a little difficult.

753
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,070
It's a Sword Deity, Rain Demon.

754
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,590
Rain Demon?

755
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,240
It seems that Ruofeng
has to spend a fortune.

756
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:41,760
Fine.

757
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,550
Hold this bill,

758
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,070
go to Prince Jingyu's Mansion

759
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:45,880
to get the money tomorrow.

760
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,440
Alright.

761
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,840
Senior, wake up.

762
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:53,880
Senior.

763
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,150
Wake up.

764
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,110
Everyone, wake up.

765
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:59,720
What will the outsiders think

766
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,550
when they see this?

767
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:02,280
You call yourselves
Eight Young Masters of Beili?

768
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,190
What's this?

769
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,030
Master caused it.

770
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,630
This way.

771
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:16,720
This way.

772
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,150
By the way, Xie Xuan,

773
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,150
I forgot to tell you

774
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,070
that Young Master Rankings for next year

775
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,920
will have Nine Young Masters of Beili.

776
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:29,720
The few of us

777
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:30,800
already thought out

778
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,550
his title.

779
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,590
You should hear about it.

780
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:34,470
Ninth Young Master,

781
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,320
the Drunkard.

782
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,360
It's a pun.

783
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:42,960
What do you think?

784
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:44,990
Fair enough.

785
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,960
You woke up long ago,

786
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,190
and you were just pretending
to be asleep.

787
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,470
Is it because you were worried
that the owner would pass you the bill?

788
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:55,320
Don't expose me.

789
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:00,920
I heard everything.

790
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,400
Have you seen this person?

791
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,110
Well...

792
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,030
Let me take a look, I've never seen him.

793
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:17,800
No.

794
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,470
I've never seen him.

795
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:19,400
Take a closer look.

796
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:20,030
I've never seen this person.

797
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:20,360
Go.

798
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,150
Someone has been put
on the wanted list again.

799
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,400
I wonder what crime was committed.

800
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:25,960
These days.

801
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:28,630
Xie Xuan.

802
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,110
The rebel is quite handsome.

803
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,030
He's the remnant of General's Mansion.

804
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,960
Maybe

805
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,510
he's actually a general in the past.

806
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,920
[No animals were harmed
during the filming of this drama.]

807
