00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,380
Do you get rusty

193
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,740
for not fighting in a while?

194
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,180
Just shut up

195
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,660
if you have nothing important to say.

196
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,580
How can you talk
to your senior brother like this,

197
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,300
Xuan?

198
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,060
Tell me.

199
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,340
Why are you here?

200
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,580
Not just me.

201
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,460
Changhe?

202
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,420
[Su Changhe, Undertaker, Dark River]

203
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,260
What brings you here?

204
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
I just swung by...

205
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,420
Changhe.

206
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,620
Your biggest problem

207
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,420
is that you are too boring.

208
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,620
I'm not here for you.

209
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,620
I'm here for a show.

210
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,620
A show?

211
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,380
Exactly.

212
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,220
I have a feeling

213
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,140
that there will be a great show

214
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,180
in Chaisang City.

215
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,620
Maybe I will have the chance

216
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,820
to meet those legendary

217
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,140
specially privileged boys.

218
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,300
Thanks.

219
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,540
So what's going on now?

220
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,900
What has happened to Gu Jianmen?

221
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
Isn't he going

222
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,780
to get married soon?

223
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,860
Why are you all

224
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,100
so gloomy?

225
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,860
In Xinan Circuit,

226
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,620
there are two powerful noble families,

227
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,260
the Gu Family
who runs the bank in Chaisang City,

228
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,820
and the Yan family, who owns
the jade shop in Kaiyang City.

229
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,500
Half a month ago,

230
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,380
Gu Luoli,
the young master of the Gu Family,

231
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,660
died suddenly in Babie City,

232
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,380
which is three hundred li
from Chaisang City.

233
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,780
Since then, there are only two people

234
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,620
who are capable of leading

235
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,780
the Gu Family.

236
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,580
That's Guo Luoli's youngest uncle,

237
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,460
Fifth Master Gu,

238
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,540
and

239
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,340
Gu Luoli's blood younger brother,

240
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,140
who's the third gentry among us,

241
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,980
Gu Jianmen.

242
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,380
But Sikong Changfeng

243
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,260
had told me about that.

244
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,980
He...

245
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,500
We are in the middle of nowhere.

246
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,940
Where did he get all those things?

247
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,820
No need to ask.

248
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,020
He's just being pretentious.

249
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,940
Less than three days
after Gu Luoli's passing,

250
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,100
Fifth Master Gu

251
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,460
used his identity as his uncle

252
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,060
to arrange a marriage for him.

253
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,460
And the bride

254
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,700
is the young lady of the Yan family,
Yan Liuli.

255
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,980
She is the one

256
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,300
who sat in the carriage earlier today.

257
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,820
Her elder brother

258
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,180
is the master of the Yan family.

259
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,300
It's the one

260
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,540
you drank with

261
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,500
in the tavern,

262
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,660
Yan Bietian.

263
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,420
So this is how the marriage

264
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,300
came to be.

265
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,460
In other words,

266
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,140
the young master of the Gu Family

267
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
didn't die naturally.

268
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,780
The Yan family and Fifth Master Gu
joined hands

269
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,940
to kill him

270
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,020
and intend to use this marriage

271
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,140
to completely control

272
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,020
the Gu Family who lost their master.

273
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,140
In that case,

274
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,260
the Gu Family

275
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,620
will fall under the thumb
of the Yan Family.

276
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,860
What does this

277
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,740
benefit Fifth Master Gu from doing that?

278
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,820
What a surprise.

279
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,220
You actually

280
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,340
have a profound understanding

281
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,380
about the filthiness

282
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,940
of human nature at such a young age.

283
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,860
That's right.

284
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,020
While Fifth Master Gu

285
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,460
is regarded as an uncle
in the Gu Family,

286
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,020
but he has no real power.

287
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,820
So he has been unsatisfied
all this time.

288
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,740
Once this plan succeeds

289
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,220
and he becomes the master
of the Gu Family,

290
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,020
it doesn't matter

291
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,540
if the Gu Family falls off the top place

292
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,140
in Xinan Circuit.

293
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,820
No wonder I find this city so weird.

294
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,420
That means the surroundings
of the Gu's Mansion,

295
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,260
no,

296
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,940
the entire Gu's Mansion

297
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,820
has already been controlled
by the Yan Family.

298
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,020
It's almost.

299
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,420
Almost all of it is controlled
by the Yan Family.

300
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,980
It wasn't until you appeared

301
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,820
in Longshou Street.

302
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,540
That's why

303
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,060
the Yan Family

304
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,580
finds you very suspicious.

305
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,940
Not at all.

306
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,060
I came here on a whim.

307
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,660
There's one more thing.

308
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,820
Go ahead.

309
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,540
Over there...

310
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,220
A female ghost is coming.

311
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,580
Someone saved them?

312
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,900
Yes. Pardon my incompetence.

313
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,060
You are not to blame.

314
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,740
Two out of the Eight Young Masters came.

315
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,460
Needless to say,
you are no match for them.

316
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,260
Did you learn sarcasm

317
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,020
from me?

318
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,820
Since you already know who she is,

319
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,780
why did you tease her?

320
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,620
Who's she?

321
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,580
Miss Yan.

322
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,580
Mr. Qingge, Mr. Zhuomo.

323
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,020
A pleasure to meet you
for the first time.

324
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,220
Actually, it's not the first time.

325
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,500
We met several times

326
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,540
while escorting you all the way.

327
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,260
You are the young lady

328
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,100
in the carriage earlier today?

329
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,340
You are the owner of the tavern?

330
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,340
You are still alive?

331
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,180
I have great generosity,

332
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,220
so I won't argue with you.

333
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,580
Ruofeng told me

334
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,980
he invited a key person over.

335
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,100
I didn't expect it to be you.

336
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,220
Please have a seat.

337
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,700
I wonder what your intention is,
Miss Yan?

338
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
You allowed your men

339
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,820
to attack us during the day.

340
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,180
And now you have come here

341
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,140
to meet us secretly?

342
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,940
That's a good question.

343
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,020
Because...

344
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,020
I love him.

345
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,660
Who do you love?

346
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,220
Oh my.

347
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,220
That's news.

348
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,020
You are indeed in love with Gu Jianmen.

349
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,340
So your family

350
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,900
killed Gu Luoli

351
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,900
to make your marriage

352
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,180
with Gu Jianmen happen.

353
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,220
Are you insane?

354
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,700
Or is the entire Yan Family insane?

355
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,180
I think you are insane.

356
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,100
Will you shut up?

357
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,100
The man you love

358
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,300
should be
the young master of the Gu Family,

359
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,300
who died a few days ago,

360
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,100
Gu Luoli.

361
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,260
I guess I'm right.

362
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,220
Yes.

363
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,900
I love Gu Luoli.

364
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,260
But no one knows.

365
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,420
My brother wants to use my marriage

366
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,100
to control the entire Gu Family.

367
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,540
He killed my beloved

368
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,100
and intends to use me as a pawn
in his scheme.

369
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,380
So

370
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,140
you entered this situation intentionally

371
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,940
to break it, right?

372
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,060
Yes.

373
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,580
On the wedding day,

374
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,420
I will not

375
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,740
marry Gu Jianmen.

376
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,820
The man I will marry...

377
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,940
can only be Gu Luoli.

378
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,620
No offense,

379
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,100
but he's dead.

380
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,620
So what?

00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,260
State your name.

573
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,460
Do you know

574
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,340
I'm from the Yan Family
of Xinan Circuit?

575
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,340
Have you thought

576
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,900
about how you will end up
if you offend us?

577
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,540
What a coincidence.

578
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,500
We are looking for the Yan Family.

579
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,820
Tell them

580
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,020
to leave the thing here

581
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,780
and I will spare their lives.

582
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,180
Did you hear that?

583
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,020
My young master said

584
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,460
the Yan Family of Xinan Circuit
was nothing to fear.

585
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,180
Leave what's in the carriage here

586
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,460
and you will be spared.

587
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,140
I didn't say the first half.

588
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,500
Young Master, I know

589
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,740
that's what you wanted to say.

590
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,140
Such audacity!

591
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,300
Who is he?

592
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,300
Young Master...

593
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,740
Don't waste your breath on them.

594
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,180
Go

595
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,260
and beat them up.

596
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,580
Let me finish, Young Master.

597
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,300
Did you hear that?

598
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,420
My young master asked me

599
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,940
not to waste my breath on you

600
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,220
and beat you all up.

601
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,940
How dare you!

602
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,180
Make way.

603
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,580
Young Master!

604
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,460
Accompanied by beauties,
with a maidservant lighting the lantern.

605
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,140
Murdering and burning
while always wearing a gold belt.

606
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,300
You are Liu Yue,
one of the Eight Young Masters.

607
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,300
Words have it
that you are peerlessly handsome.

608
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,740
And that's why

609
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,340
you don't like others
starring at your face

610
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,100
and must travel in a sedan chair

611
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,940
to avoid showing your countenance.

612
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,140
I see that's true.

613
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,260
Young Master, what now?

614
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,540
They recognized you.

615
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,420
I have told you

616
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,060
there is no need to use the sedan chair.

617
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,540
That's too obvious.

618
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,740
I didn't intend

619
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,980
for others to recognize me,

620
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,140
but they

621
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,780
figured it out right away.

622
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,220
It seems

623
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,900
I'm really famous.

624
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,540
True though.

625
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,340
That's right.

626
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,660
We are acclaimed

627
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,980
as the peerlessly handsome Mr. Liuyue
in the Gentry Ranking.

628
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
It's me,

629
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,140
not us.

630
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,940
[Liu Yue, Mr. Liuyue
of the Eight Young Masters of Beili]

631
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,140
Then let me see how capable you are,

632
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,340
one of the Eight Young Masters.

633
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,900
That's weak.

634
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,420
He's beaten with only a strike.

635
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,980
Still not coming up to help?

636
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,860
This is a beautiful sword.

637
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,620
Is it?

638
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,860
Can it match

639
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
the peerless Mr. Liuyue?

640
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,140
Human is not a weapon.

641
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,620
They shouldn't be confused
with each other.

642
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,620
May I ask the name of the sword's owner?

643
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,860
[Mo Qixuan, White-Haired Deity,]
White-Haired Deity.

644
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,420
[Sky's Beyond]

645
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,220
What an interesting name.

646
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,620
My sword is renowned for its beauty.

647
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,580
If this beautiful sword

648
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,580
can slay the famous Mr. Liuyue...

649
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,300
would that be interesting too?

650
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,380
Do you have the confidence to kill me?

651
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,780
It's tricky.

652
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,220
But I want to give it a try.

653
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,380
Many people wanted to try,

654
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,100
but I'm still sitting here.

655
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,980
Is that so?

656
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
Young Master,
there is a group of people coming.

657
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,660
I've sensed that.

658
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,580
I underestimated them.

659
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,780
Before killing you,

660
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,660
I wonder if I could make this request.

661
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,260
Say it.

662
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,380
I want to see your face.

663
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,380
Everyone regards fair and white
as beautiful,

664
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,180
yet he is in all black.

665
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,340
Everyone admires beautiful things,

666
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,380
but he prefers the opposite.

667
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,260
You are

668
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,500
Mr. Mochen,

669
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,780
Mo Xiaohei.

670
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,620
[Mo Xiaohe, Mr. Mochen
of the Eight Young Masters of Beili]

671
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,300
Let me ask you this.

672
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,500
Do you think the kidnapping mission
is dangerous?

673
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,340
Of course, it's dangerous.

674
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,620
If you ask me,

675
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,860
you shouldn't get involved in this.

676
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,740
So I'll take your answer as yes.

677
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,340
Anyway, I need to prepare

678
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,980
in case things turn out otherwise.

679
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,460
Miss Yan

680
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,740
is quite a beauty.

681
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,580
Can't she be compared

682
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,620
with Miss Fairy?

683
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,380
I'm a faithful man.

684
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,180
Do you know what true love is?

685
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,420
Do you have someone you like?

686
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,300
Me?

687
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,340
I'm not into romance.

688
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,540
Why are you making that sound?

689
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:21,980
Are you all right?

690
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:23,700
What are you trying to do?

691
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,820
What are you doing?

692
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,260
Don't run.

693
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,580
Something is wrong with you.

694
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,780
I'm just saying

695
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,140
that I don't like romance.

696
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,180
It reminds me of my master.

697
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,140
It's not free at all.

698
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,980
Your master?

699
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,580
Yes, my master.

700
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,060
He passed down this Silver-Moon Spear

701
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,180
to me.

702
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,020
Well,

703
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,060
in fact, he wasn't really my master.

704
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,900
When I met him,

705
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
he was almost dying,

706
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,220
with his body covered in sores,

707
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,180
lying hopelessly
in an abandoned Taoist temple.

708
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,020
He was Lin Jiu
who wielded the Zhuixu Spear,

709
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,700
yet he landed himself
in such a pathetic state.

710
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,340
Later, I saved him

711
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,940
and he taught me spear techniques
for five days.

712
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,300
What happened after that?

713
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,980
He passed away five days later.

714
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,260
Before he died,

715
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,980
he asked me to bring his ashes

716
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,060
back to his hometown.

717
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,340
He told me

718
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,740
that a woman he deeply loved

719
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,420
once lived there.

720
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,140
Every morning,

721
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,060
that woman

722
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,300
would brush her hair by the lakeside.

723
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,460
He was only a poor man at that time,

724
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,660
while she was

725
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,460
the prettiest woman in town.

726
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,780
Hence, he determined

727
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,820
to roam the martial arts world
with his spear.

728
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,660
However, it was thirty years

729
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,980
since his departure.

730
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,340
Thirty years?

731
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,540
She must have married someone else.

732
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,820
Three years after he left,

733
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,380
she married someone else.

734
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,300
She probably wouldn't remember

735
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,220
there was a young lad

736
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,900
who woke up early every day
to practice his spear

737
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,180
just to watch her

738
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,140
brushing her hair.

739
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,860
Your master

740
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,940
was a great man.

741
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,860
Was he?

742
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,100
Maybe.

743
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,780
You see,

744
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,380
this is what the martial arts world
is all about.

745
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,260
The so-called romance

746
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,300
is simply useless.

747
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,660
Life is tough yet short.

748
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,540
Why seek torture for ourselves?

749
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,420
Sikong Changfeng,

750
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,820
you claim to be a wanderer

751
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,900
who roams the martial arts world

752
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,140
with a spear and a pot of wine.

753
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,460
May I know

754
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,620
which world you are roaming, actually?

755
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,580
Rivers and lakes?
[*Literal meaning of Martial Arts World]

756
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,300
That can only be called swimming.

757
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,300
How can you call it

758
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,300
