♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,500

21
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,020

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,371

23
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,160
Baili Dongjun.

25
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,060
Let's talk.

26
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,700
We haven't met in over a year and you walk away when you see me.

27
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,260
Because you're not worth my time.

28
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,640
Because I stopped you and your best friend from snatching the bride.

29
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,940
Why are you silent?

30
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,840
Baili Dongjun, tell me. Am I right?

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Yes. Because I can't stand what you have done.

32
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,500
I rushed from Qiandong City to Tianqi not just for martial arts skills,

33
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,700
but also to learn about principles.

34
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,540
Jixia Academy is the best academy.

35
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,550
Among all the principles I have learned, none of them says power can trump a person's will.

36
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:21,310
However, my senior allowed that to happen.

37
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,300
I have to wake up early tomorrow morning.

38
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,620
Please excuse me, Senior.

39
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,720
If that's the case, why didn't you ask your senior if there is a principle

40
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,140
that teaches one to trump another's will with their power?

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,980
Your senior will tell you that kind of principle never existed.

42
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,980
Never in the past, present, or future.

43
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,170
Yes, I thought about that afterward.

44
00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:00,060
If you hadn't interfered, perhaps Brother Yun could have gone further.

45
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,500
But he also might have lost his life.

46
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:10,300
Nevertheless, to me, my senior will stop such unfairness from happening.

47
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
He definitely will.

48
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,460
Right.

49
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,490
About this, your senior is...

50
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,180
very disappointed in himself.

51
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:40,130
Dongjun, I know you may never believe in me anymore.

52
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,500
But there is something I must tell you now.

53
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,580
Your grandfather will not die this time.

54
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,520
Not on the journey or in Tianqi

55
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,800
unless I die first.

56
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,200
Dongjun.

57
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,020
Yao'er, you are here.

58
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,800
How is it?

59
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,255
Are you not coming with us?

60
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:38,200
My identity is sensitive.

61
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm afraid my appearance would strengthen the rumors of the Marquis's treason.

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,540
You have a point.

63
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,040
I will come to you once everything is over.

64
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,740
It's just that your trip might be dangerous.

65
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,260
Dongjun, are you ready?

66
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,943
Some Shadow Guards of profound phase, along with Ruofeng's guards,

67
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,620
will protect my grandfather.

68
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,860
I do blame Ruofeng for what happened to Brother Yun,

69
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,320
but I won't question any promise he makes to me.

70
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:22,475

71
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,260
Pofeng Army of the Baili Family bids farewell to Your Lordship!

72
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,980
 Farewell, Your Lordship!

73
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,360
 Farewell, Your Lordship!

74
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,320
Prince Langya, let's depart.

75
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,460
Is something wrong with that old man? He accepted this order.

76
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,740
Su Muyu.

77
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,580
Hey, Blockhead Su!

78
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,580
I'm doubting whether you have a heart or not.

79
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,270
We are going to kill Baili Luochen,

80
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,980
the well-known Marquis Zhenxi whom that old man admires.

81
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,980
And we are going to kill him. Don't you feel excited?

82
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,080
- You are wrong. 
 - Why?

83
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,940
On the list, aside from Baili Luochen...

84
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,660
there's also Xiao Ruofeng.

85
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,660
How boring.

86
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,970
You are my best friend, but working with you is simply no fun.

87
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,980
Have you decided on a plan of action?

88
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,140
Since you put it that way, it means you did.

89
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,820
Xiao Ruofeng is the key to our mission.

90
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,300
We will arrange for twenty killers from the Su Family

91
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,520
to break the horse formation and wipe out the vulnerable Jinwu Guards.

92
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,240
While I go ahead and tie down Xiao Ruofeng,

93
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,780
you will charge the carriage and kill Baili Luochen.

94
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,120
Lastly, both of us join hands to kill Xiao Ruofeng.

95
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,380
A simple and clean kill.

96
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,520
It can be done in an hour.

97
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,480
This is the biggest order Dark River has had in nearly 30 years,

98
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,960
but you make it sound so easy.

99
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,580
Killing has always been easy, no?

100
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,300

101
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,140
It's you.

102
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,600
Senior, who are they?

103
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,420
They are Dark River, the most mysterious assassin organization.

104
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,180
So you are Prince Langya?

105
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,080
I've heard a lot about you.

106
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,720
I'm Su Zhe.

107
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,780
Don't be nervous.

108
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,260
I didn't come here to kill.

109
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,540
Dark River is blocking our way but doesn't plan to kill us?

110
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,040
You must be Mu Nuan, right?

111
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,500
What a nice face.

112
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,080
What about yours? Why do you hide it?

113
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
I'm already old.

114
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:46,240
Unlike you. Many years have passed and you still look so lovely.

115
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,460
Have you been doing well all these years?

116
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,200
None of your business.

117
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,020
It seems you've had a great time.

118
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,140
Good to know that.

119
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,980
We were the only two survivors in the battle back then.

120
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,720
I didn't expect to meet you here today.

121
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,460
Since when did you start speaking so pompously?

122
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,380
I beg your pardon.

123
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:35,100
I would like you to see the countenance of the Marquis.

124
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,280
Forget about that.

125
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,820
Why don't you see the countenance of Mister Li?

126
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,920
Master, you...

127
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,800
Long time no see.

128
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,900
Old friend Su Zhe, we also haven't seen each other in quite some time, right?

129
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, it's Mister Li.

130
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,860
It has been a long time.

131
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,540
This man is the world's top martial artist, Li Changsheng?

132
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,940
If I kill him, I can take his place.

133
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,060
If so, you will be the world's top idiot.

134
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,280
Do you still want to see the countenance of the Marquis?

135
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,180
I don't think so.

136
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,740
I have seen what I should see.

137
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,380
Changhe, Muyu, let's go.

138
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,900
- Master, you— 
 - We will catch up after reaching Tianqi.

139
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,760
Let's go.

140
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,420
Send a message to the first client.

141
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,640
"Mission failed because of Li Changsheng."

142
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,100
Send a message to the second client.

143
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,540
"Mission accomplished because of Li Changsheng."

144
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,380
How was it?

145
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,020
How do you feel when meeting an old acquaintance after so many years?

146
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,660
What I went through still gives me the jitters.

147
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,420
That man named Su Zhe was once the top martial artist of the Su Family.

148
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,700
I know. He's the Conical Hat Ghost.

149
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,280
But don't worry. You are no longer part of Dark River

150
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,620
so even if it's the Conical Hat Ghost, they can't catch you.

151
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,280
Since he recognized you he probably figured out that we used a mask.

152
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,080
Fortunately Su Leng's imitation was convincing.

153
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,640
It was worth my effort to tell you about Master the whole night.

154
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:09,920
 I do blame Senior because of Brother Yun, but I won't question any promise he makes to me.

155
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,940
 The thing is...

156
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,260
 What is it?

157
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,000
 I have my plan. Come in.

158
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,100
 Greetings, Mr. Baili.

159
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,900
 This is Su Leng, one of Grandfather's bodyguards.

160
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,660
 His father went on an expedition with Grandfather.

161
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,020
 His father was the best spy in the army.

162
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,300
 - A spy? 
- They are good at impersonation.

163
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,640
 They can convincingly play a peasant or a merchant.

164
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,840
 This older sister is adept at the Art of Disguise.

165
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,340
 She creates face masks that are so flawless that they can pass as real.

166
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,820
 Sister, I would like to ask you to create a face mask for me.

167
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,000
 Who would you like to be disguised as?

168
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,420
 Him.

169
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,180
 Who is he?

170
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,100
 This is an exact duplicate of my drawing.

171
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,840
Dark River is prudent. They wouldn't dare take the risk.

172
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,260
Old Su.

173
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,820
What brings you here from the main hall?

174
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,580
Something urgent of course.

175
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,540
Something urgent?

176
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,320
What's it about?

177
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:40,700
After you two left, Soul Reaper Hall received its new orders.

178
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,300
New orders?

179
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:55,400
One order is to kill Baili Luochen, while the other one is to save him.

180
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:02,700
Old Su, Dark River never accepts orders with conflicting interests.

181
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,740
Once we accept a client, no matter how hefty the price the second client offers,

182
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,980
we won't renege.

183
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:14,580
What changed that old man's mind to engage in such unethical business?

184
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:20,500
First, killing Baili Luochen is no easy task.

185
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,340
Of course that's not the most important thing.

186
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:30,546
Most importantly, the second client has a more dignified identity.

187
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,620
Your Majesty.

188
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,860
How was it?

189
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,560
It succeeded.

190
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,420
Very well.

191
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,940
But something went wrong.

192
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,406
What went wrong?

193
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:46,086
Mister Li showed up again.

194
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,060
As long as the second client is determined enough,

195
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:59,840
the first client will wind up dead.

196
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,820
Li Changsheng?

197
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,600
Why is Li Changsheng back?

198
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,160
Even so, why is he with Baili Luochen?

199
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,980
Why are they all in my way?

200
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,000
Just why? Why?

201
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,020
Your Highness, please calm down.

202
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,580
Calm down? How can I stay calm?

203
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,540
Your Highness, I have an idea.

204
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,780
Then say it straight away.

205
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,500
His Majesty is wary of Li Changsheng.

206
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,820
This time he showed up together with Baili Luochen.

207
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,960
Isn't that a chance for us to take care of them in one fell swoop?

208
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,340
You are so clever.

209
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,980
I'm just easing your burden.

210
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,580
Ease my burden, my foot!

211
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,780
Your Highness.

212
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,500
Do you know who Li Changsheng is?

213
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,760
To take care of them in one fell swoop, you say?

214
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,300
Even if all the experts in the palace and the State Preceptor join forces, they are no match for him.

215
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,300
And you want me to kill him?

216
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,960
Do you want to get killed? Or do you want me to get killed?

217
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,680
- Get lost! 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

218
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:19,860
Top Leader thinks there's no harm in taking money from a dying person.

219
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,820
Li Changsheng?

220
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,580
Didn't he claim he wouldn't return to Tianqi City?

221
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,660
I don't believe it was him.

222
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,700
Look into this.

223
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,360
Yes.

224
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,860
Dongjun, I need to return to the palace and report for duty.

225
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,220
You check in at a relay station first.

226
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,380
I mustn't be seen with you, so I can't come this time.

227
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,940
All right.

228
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,250

229
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:53,290
Well, Censor Zhang... You keep pacing back and forth, I'm getting dizzy.

230
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,160
What's the point of wringing your hands?

231
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,520
Just take whatever comes at you.

232
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,060
Oh, my. You are actually in a mood to drink even now.

233
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,260
Censor Zhang, how could you say that?

234
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,820
This is Diaolou Tavern.

235
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,080
Since you're here, isn't it a waste if you don't taste the nice brew?

236
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,460
Come on and drink.

237
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
His Majesty ordered the Imperial Censorate to send someone to interrogate the Marquis Zhenxi.

238
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,400
How about you go?

239
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,740
This...

240
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,780
That won't do.

241
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,540
I can have a drink here. But I can't do the interrogation.

242
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,240
What good are you?

243
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,840
I thought you had gotten used to the fact that I'm an idler in the Imperial Censorate.

244
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,160
Censor Zhang, I have had enough liquor today.

245
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,680
I will leave you alone here with your troubles.

246
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,640
- Well, I... 
 - You!

247
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,640
I shall take my leave.

248
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,540
Goodbye.

249
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,460
This is a nice brew.

250
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Luckily, I didn't drink much today. Otherwise...

251
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,360
I would be done for if my dear found me reeking of liquor.

252
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:09,920

253
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:16,880
No sooner had I stepped out of Diaolou Tavern than I entered the Baihua Hall.

254
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,560
I sure have enjoyed both brew and beauties today.

255
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,880
However, I have an uninvited guest.

256
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,640
Censor Hu, cheers.

257
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,640
I have seen you before.

258
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,520
On the wanted list.

259
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,340
Censor Hu, you are funny.

260
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,580
Do you really think I'm being funny with you?

261
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,640
It doesn't matter.

262
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,600
What matters is...

263
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,080
my sword is faster.

264
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,640
Yes, it's funny.

265
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,160
General Ye was my father's acquaintance.

266
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,460
How could I arrest his son?

267
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,480
That's impossible. Not a chance.

268
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,920
My friend, how can I help you?

269
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,820
I have heard a lot about you, Censor Hu.

270
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,560
I came here with a favor to ask of you.

271
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,360
I'm afraid I can't help you with that.

272
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,040
You haven't even heard what it is.

273
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,600
The Marquis Zhenxi is now a sensitive matter.

274
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,940
I still want to slouch in the Imperial Censorate for some more years.

275
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,220
Censor Hu, are you really that kind of person?

276
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,420
Why not?

277
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,640
I am.

278
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,560
I have a good friend named Baili Dongjun.

279
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,860
He is the grandson of the Marquis Zhenxi, Baili Luochen.

280
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,940
I know.

281
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,030
I suppose you know his name

282
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,940
not because he is Baili Luochen's grandson.

283
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,300
Instead, it's because of his Seven Starry Nights

284
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,220
winning Qiulubai in Diaolou Tavern, right?

285
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,640
What are you getting at? Just speak.

286
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,160
He's here.

287
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,240
Don't you want to have a few drinks with him?

288
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,670
Well people, to hide their true intention to help,

289
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,580
always look for some indecent excuses.

290
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:13,650

291
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,900
Marquis, someone seeks an audience.

292
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,660
Bring him in.

293
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,860
Greetings, Marquis.

294
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,420
Did you steal this uniform?

295
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,700
Dongjun, don't be rude. This is Censor Hu Bufei.

296
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,220
Three generations in his family have been in service.

297
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,300
They are the pillars of the nation.

298
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,820
Marquis, that sounds rather ironic though.

299
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,820
Oh, it's the Censor.

300
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,086
Why? Are you going to interrogate us on our turf?

301
00:26:54,086 --> 00:26:56,640
Well, I... I wouldn't dare.

302
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,220
I heard that the genius brewmaster

303
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,898
who defeated Qiulubai with his Seven Starry Nights in Diaolou Tavern is here.

304
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:07,540
That's why I came to ask for a drink.

305
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,440
I have two cups of liquor here, a pleasant one and an unpleasant one.

306
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,920
Which one do you prefer?

307
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:20,030
Marquis, the young master is quite different from what I heard.

308
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,700
Seeing him today, he has some hard edges which resemble you back then.

309
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,176
He is my grandson.

310
00:27:27,176 --> 00:27:29,620
Shouldn't he resemble me?

311
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,160
Please have a seat.

312
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,907
This is the finest Biluochun tea.

313
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:45,200
Use the tea fragrance to cover your liquor smell.

314
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,640
Otherwise you will have a hard time when you get home.

315
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,440
Your wife can be quite fierce.

316
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,460
Marquis, you still remember her.

317
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,650
Well, since you are willing to have tea with me,

318
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,140
I shall obey you.

319
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,640
Grandfather, have you met him before?

320
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,520
You both seem quite familiar.

321
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,080
His father is the principal academician of Longyun Pavilion, Hu Cheng.

322
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,060
Back then he was my classmate.

323
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,280
Academician Hu once held you when you were little.

324
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,180
An academician?

325
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,920
How come he doesn't take after his father?

326
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,740
Are you not going to tell me the business of the Imperial Censorate?

327
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,160
What business?

328
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,640
Has the Imperial Censorate ever had any serious business?

329
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,160
Funny lad.

330
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,400
That sorry bunch in the Imperial Censorate dare not come to me.

331
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,053
They see me as a sensitive matter so you were sent here.

332
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:53,846
But you are a spoiled brat who lives off your father's reputation.

333
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:55,280
You came here to interrogate me.

334
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,460
Surely you won't find out anything, good or bad, from me.

335
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,340
Marquis, you are insightful.

336
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,340
However, the Imperial Censorate underestimated me.

337
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,820
You don't question me, but I want to tell.

338
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,800
I'm not listening. No, I'm not.

339
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,460
Do you want me to twist your ears open?

340
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,700
Yes, please, Marquis. I'm jotting it down.

341
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,720
The brush you are holding demands lives.

342
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,760
Marquis, I hope you won't talk too much.

343
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,660
I'm old and I talk a lot.

344
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,940
How about this? Dongjun, you will speak on my behalf.

345
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,700
The Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion has 100,000 soldiers guarding the west gate of the country.

346
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,380
We never intend to disrupt national safety.

347
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,000
This trip to Tianqi is led by the Heir, Baili Chengfeng, with the Pofeng Army.

348
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,500
The Heir is a martial artist and is impulsive.

349
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,480
However, he has been instructed to keep the army in check and not to act rashly

350
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,440
no matter what happened during this trip.

351
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,780
The Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion believes

352
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,640
that the Seven Imperial Censors inspects all officials judiciously

353
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,860
and that they will clear the name of the Marquis Zhenxi.

354
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:22,070
If necessary, the Marquis Zhenxi is willing to confront the accuser in court.

355
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,700
I hope you will relay this wish to His Majesty.

356
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,880
The Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion will be deeply grateful.

357
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,520
Is that too much?

358
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,720
No, not at all. Young Master Baili, your words carry much weight.

359
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,600
If you say anymore words, I won't be able to continue with my trembling hands.

360
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,360
Leave if you want. I'm not keeping you here.

361
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,160
Dongjun, see him off.

362
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,450

363
00:30:57,175 --> 00:31:00,600
Young Master, given what you said just now,

364
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,740
it conveys only a message: You don't intend to rebel.

365
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,740
But if someone wants to kill you, 100,000 Pofang soldiers

366
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,680
are ready to charge into Tianqi City.

367
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,320
I'm so impressed.

368
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,742
My friend said Seven Starry Nights

369
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:23,940
- defeated Qiulubai. 
 - That's right.

370
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,420
I want to drink it.

371
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,500
If you can prove my grandfather's innocence,

372
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,260
I will give you seven jars of it, not just seven cups.

373
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,300
Young Master, I will take your word for it.

374
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,560
I'm having this liquor for sure.

375
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,080
Have the Seven Imperial Censors reached a verdict?

376
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,860
There is no proof of the Marquis' guilt.

377
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,020
Who are the Seven Imperial Censors to accuse him?

378
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,700
Young Master, rest assured.

379
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,620
The marquis will be safe.  It's just that...

380
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,080
What is it?

381
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,660
Young Master, you ought to be careful.

382
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,800
Of course. I came here to keep my grandfather safe.

383
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,300
I won't allow anything to go wrong.

384
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:05,870
I mean you have to be cautious of the danger to yourself.

385
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,160
The danger to myself?

386
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,580
All right Young Master, the Imperial Censorate is two streets away.

387
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,000
I will head back myself.

388
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,960
Night roads are treacherous. Please be extra cautious.

389
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,660
I'm leaving.

390
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,460
Young Master.

391
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,820
Tell us what Baili Luochen told you and we won't kill you.

392
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,960
- Get lost. 
 - You!

393
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,520
You don't want to make this harder.

394
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,860
Why do you people always threaten me? So boring.

395
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,640
Let me tell you this. I don't give a fig for what you will do.

396
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,420
I only want to drink what I crave.

397
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,940
Don't waste your breath on him. Take him away!

398
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,640
Thank you, General Ye Jr.

399
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,640
You saw this coming didn't you?

400
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:27,300
Could you have handled this without me?

401
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,160
That's impossible. I... I'm nothing but a frail scholar.

402
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,730
Setting aside the older generation's matter, I saved your life today.

403
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,660
Thank you so much, General Ye Jr.

404
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,660
Tianqi City is a place of chaos.

405
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,620
You should leave soon.

406
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,460
All right. One last question.

407
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,260
Commander Luo from the palace seems to not be in Tianqi City.

408
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,950
I think Commander Luo has been sent out on a mission,

409
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,820
but I don't know the details.

410
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,980
- About my friend... 
 - They will be safe.

411
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,500
- I will take your word for it. 
 - I bet my life on it.

412
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:29,975

413
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,820
Speak.

414
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,320
First, when Li Changsheng and Baili Dongjun left Tianqi on a journey back then,

415
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,860
the former disappeared midway.

416
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,080
Therefore, that Li Changsheng should be a fake.

417
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,460
Second, I sent a message to Jin Xian and others.

418
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,660
Judging by the dates, they should arrive in Tianqi in no time.

419
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,850

420
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:27,800

421
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,160
May I?

422
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,060
Yes, please.

423
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,900
Mister, give me exactly what he's having.

424
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,660
All right.

425
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,940
 Nice sword.

426
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,600
Shen Jingzhou, Wind and Snow Sword.

427
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,340
Ye Dingzhi, an unnamed swordsman.

428
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,140
I heard about you.

429
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,360
You are the disciple of the Sword Deity, Rain Demon.

430
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,920
Back then the Sword Deity brought you to Nanjue to challenge a couple of experts.

431
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,120
It was awesome.

432
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,400
I was mesmerized when I heard that.

433
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,340
I heard about you too.

434
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,940
An immortal from beyond with a sword summoning wind and snow.

435
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,160
The merciful killer, Shen Jingzhou.

436
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,260
I didn't expect to run into the best young swordsman here.

437
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,240
My pleasure.

438
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,740
We should have had a drink over this fortunate encounter.

439
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,340
Sadly, there is no liquor here.

440
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,600
Why don't we replace it with tea?

441
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,800
I hope you don't mind.

442
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:34,480
Since you have heard about me, you should know my other identity.

443
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,720
I'm Ye Yu's son. The wanted criminal of Beili.

444
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,060
I also know the real identity of Shen Jingzhou who owns the Wind and Snow Sword.

445
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,540
You are the direct disciple of Grand Eunuch Zhuoqing in the palace.

446
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,020
We are outside Tianqi City.

447
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:56,460
Since I haven't entered Tianqi, I'm a martial artist.

448
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,200
So I'm only Shen Jingzhou.

449
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:09,180
And you are only a friend I met by chance, Ye Dingzhi.

450
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,200
Very well.

451
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,280
Brother Ye, until next time.

452
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,460
Brother Shen, you should roam the Martial World.

453
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,680
Why confine yourself to Tianqi?

454
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,940
Master summons me back urgently. I have no choice.

455
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,900
I see.

456
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,220
Until next time.

457
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,430

458
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,060
Your Majesty, this case is hard to judge.

459
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,440
Please enlighten me, Your Majesty.

460
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,300
The Xiao Family governs the country with national laws.

461
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,320
The Imperial Censorate supervises all officials according to the national law.

462
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,060
There is no case you can't judge and no one you can't investigate.

463
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,680
Yet, you are kneeling here and want me to clarify for you.

464
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,380
If I can decide who is guilty or innocent, why do we need the law then?

465
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,240
And what do I need the Imperial Censorate for?

466
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,180
Zhang Chengzhong, you have become a dotard.

467
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,320
Your Majesty, the Imperial Censorate is responsible for supervising all officials.

468
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,540
But the Marquis has 100,000 elite soldiers.

469
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:52,400
Any verdict made would probably cause a stir in Beili.

470
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,400
I dare not make a decision.

471
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,040
Zhang Chengzhong, can the case file in your hands convict him of treason?

472
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,940
It's difficult to say.

473
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,320
Hu Bufei, yesterday you went to interrogate him.

474
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,080
Answer me.

475
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:21,433
Your Majesty, I believe the Marquis Zhenxi didn't commit treason.

476
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,540
Look at him.

477
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,340
Your Majesty, uh...

478
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,560
Like I said, judge according to the law

479
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,440
if he isn't found guilty of treason.

480
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,940
As for those who harbor rebellious thoughts, you might go and ask my sons.

481
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,720
They all harbor such thoughts.

482
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,140
Your Majesty.

483
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,340
Zhang Chengzhong, you have served two emperors.

484
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,060
You are the pillar of the nation.

485
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,680
How come you are so useless?

486
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:56,960
Your Majesty, since this problem has been resolved, there is another one.

487
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,060

488
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,620
Your Majesty! This is too much, Your Majesty.

489
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,980
I'm saying that you are a disposed good.

490
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,960
You good-for-nothing!

491
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,420
You are right, Your Majesty.

492
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

493
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,980
Creating discord between the Prince and the first-ranked Marquis

494
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:37,020
is very detrimental to the long-term stability of the country.

495
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:41,580
It's best to downplay the issue and resolve it quietly.

496
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,520
Prince Qing's name mustn't be mentioned.

497
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,720
Just say the Emperor has punished the accuser.

498
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,440
As for the punishment,

499
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,320
a deduction of two years' salary in private will be enough.

500
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,960
You said you didn't know how to judge.

501
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,980
Haven't you just clearly explained everything in detail?

502
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:13,700
Since you have figured out how to judge and do, just go ahead.

503
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,980
Is it indeed possible?

504
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,660
Get lost already!

505
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

506
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,160
I shall take my leave, Your Majesty.

507
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,140
What a relief.

508
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,240
Zhuoqing.

509
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

510
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,660
You will leave the palace with me later.

511
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

512
00:42:49,124 --> 00:42:52,660
Aren't you curious about where I'm going?

513
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:58,780
There is no one in Tianqi City worth your personal visit.

514
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,820
You know me well.

515
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,000
Initially, I wanted you to approach the second prince

516
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,240
and persuade him to collect the evidence against Baili Luochen.

517
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:22,580
But in the end I pardoned Baili Luochen and put the second prince on the spot.

518
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,040
Do you know why?

519
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,020
That's not my business.

520
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,020
I only do what you say.

521
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:35,820
The second prince is ruthless and impatient.

522
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:42,300
He hasn't been behaving lately so I decided to teach him a lesson.

523
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,900
You are right, Your Majesty.

524
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,840
Zhuoqing.

525
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,480
Did you think I wanted to name Prince Qing as the heir?

526
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,820
It's windy today.

527
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:09,040
I will have the servants prepare a cloak for you.

528
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,801

529
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:27,020

530
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:39,010

531
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:50,318
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

532
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:58,060
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

533
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:06,980
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

534
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:15,240
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

535
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,960
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

536
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,420
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

537
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,660
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

538
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:30,220
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

539
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,800
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

540
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,660
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

541
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,180
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

542
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,600
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

543
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,060
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

544
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,360
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

545
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,540
♫  I met you  ♫

546
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:41,328
