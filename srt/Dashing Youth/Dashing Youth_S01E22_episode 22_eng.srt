00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:15,840

2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Holding onto life and death in the face of danger  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,564
♫  I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,840
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,600
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,440
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,220
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,820
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,540
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,120
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,600

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,020

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,410

23
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,420
 Master.

25
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,360
Why?

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,480
How could he return as if nothing had happened after he said those things to me?

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,300
Why?

28
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,240
Why did he wait until now to come back?

29
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:14,540
 - They dance so well. 
 - So pretty.

30
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,800
 - Look at her figure. 
 - Not bad. Amazing!

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,180
 - Beautiful. 
 - Amazing!

32
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,520
Junior Niece, take care of Cinderless for me.

33
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,420
Master, what terrible thing did you do to her back then?

34
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,600
Actually, it wasn't much.

35
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,340
I figured that since we were engaged we should be honest with each other,

36
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,220
so I told her that I practiced the Art of Chun.

37
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,380
Then she asked me a question.

38
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,720
What was the question?

39
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,330
She asked how many wives I have had.

40
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,620
And... what was your answer?

41
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,220
I said three of course.

42
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,540
A gentleman like me will have only one wife in each life. Definitely no more than that.

43
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,180
Then I know why Miss Luo called you a playboy.

44
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,140
One life, one wife.

45
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, it doesn't sound like a problem.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,040
- Right? 
 - Right.

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,297
So, Martial Uncle Baili, what you're saying is the longer you live, the more women you can love.

48
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:44,780
No, no, no. Wait... that's not what I meant.

49
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,580
What do you mean, then?

50
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,180
I mean...

51
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,400
Is...

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,660
Aren't we talking about Master?

53
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,860
- Why are you pointing at me all of a sudden? 
 - Right.

54
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,060
We're talking about me.

55
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,000
What are your real thoughts as a woman?

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,960
Well, from your point of view, every new identity means a new life.

57
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,580
She's the love of your life each time you get married.

58
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,100
But in my opinion, no matter how long you've lived,

59
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,820
if you're still the same person, there's only one life.

60
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,620
I'm the only person who is unique to you.

61
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,360
The moment you met me is the moment you knew what love was.

62
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,880
Master. What was her response after you said that?

63
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,630
After that there was a disapproving look,

64
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,220
but she didn't get mad right away.

65
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,010
She then asked me another question.

66
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,580
 What was it?

67
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,900
- She said...
- I know what she said.

68
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,290
She asked how many wives you would have after marrying her.

69
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,740
Exactly. Exactly.

70
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,920
Women all over the world indeed think alike.

71
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,360
Hey Grandniece, don't be mad at me because of her.

72
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,820
You can ask your marital uncles here.

73
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,740
If they were in that situation what would they say?

74
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,780
Martial Uncle Baili.

75
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,780
What do you think?

76
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,640
If it were me, I'd say...

77
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,460
I haven't thought about my next life,

78
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,820
but in this life, I'll love you with all my heart.

79
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,560
Martial Uncle Sikong, how about you?

80
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,080
Me?

81
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,320
I'd say, before I met you I thought a relationship was something temporary.

82
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,480
It ends when you pass away.

83
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,520
But after I met you I realized that love can cross the bounds of time.

84
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,820
After I met you, I will not love or marry anyone else.

85
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,550
Then, decades later, I'd say the same thing to another woman.

86
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,640
I've lived over 180 years for nothing.

87
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,060
- I should call you Master. 
 - No, no. That's not right.

88
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,600
Master, what did you say in the end?

89
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,040
I had a few drinks and I was tipsy that day.

90
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,180
And I told her...

91
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,080
I said...

92
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,600
There's too many to count.

93
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,800
Dengtian Tower.

94
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,100
What is that?

95
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,760
Dengtian Tower in Xueyue City consists of 16 floors.

96
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,700
Every floor is guarded by a martial master.

97
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,400
The higher the floor, the stronger the martial master.

98
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,280
Especially on the top floors.

99
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,600
They're all legends in the Martial World.

100
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,180
Their skills are mysterious and powerful.

101
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,240
Only when you pass the top floor will you get a glimpse of Xueyue.

102
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,920
That's impressive.

103
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Indeed.

104
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,080
But that's nothing

105
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,940
because I am the legend.

106
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,290

107
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,760
You again?

108
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,680
The old City Lord had you stop me, now the current one has too.

109
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,500
I also want to ask, why you again?

110
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,360
I haven't seen you in ten years.

111
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,400
Why have you gotten younger?

112
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,440
Because... I'm an Immortal.

113
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,600
Master's Iron Head Technique is so powerful.

114
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,120
It never fails.

115
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,920
Luo Shui!

116
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,840
I'm here.

117
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,080
You once said you preferred a scholar to a warrior.

118
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,720
So I took charge of the Academy.

119
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,440
Everyone in this world addresses me as Mister Li from the Academy.

120
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,080
But Mister Li is dead.

121
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,320
In this life, my name is Nangong Chunshui.

122
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,620
In this life, I want to be an elegant scholar.

123
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,010
You once asked me a question,

124
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,140
but I answered it incorrectly.

125
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,500
But now I'll answer it again.

126
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,310
I, Nangong Chunshui, for this life

127
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,220
and the next lives, have only you as my wife.

128
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,190
I used to think that love was temporary.

129
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,500
It ends when one person passes away.

130
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,940
But after I met you

131
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:03,040
I realized that love can cross the bounds of time.

132
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,430
Are you going to say the same thing to another girl after a few decades?

133
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,540
Sikong Changfeng.

134
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,790
You've done this before.

135
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,720
I... I was just saying.

136
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,180
I didn't expect to get it right.

137
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,390
Of course not!

138
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,510
Because... this is my last life.

139
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,820
And I'll spend this life with only you.

140
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,560
This life is forever.

141
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,780
♫  The cool breeze has died  ♫

142
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:58,020
♫  The sparrows soar through the forest singing  ♫

143
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,280
♫  The clouds obscure the view, as if still in a dream not yet awake  ♫

144
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,180
♫  The clouds obscure the view, as if still in a dream not yet awake  ♫

145
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,420
♫  Seems there are countless beautiful moments to enjoy  ♫

146
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,120
♫  Alone, gazing at the vast ocean fading into mulberry fields  ♫

147
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,438
What do you mean by that?

148
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,370
It means that I've given up on the Art of Chun.

149
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,440
From now on

150
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,850
I'll live and die, just like a mortal.

151
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,820
Forever and ever.

152
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,735
This isn't what it means by forever and ever.

153
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,140
As long as I can be with you,

154
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,820
I think... it can be used that way.

155
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,066
Such a fool.

156
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,180
You aren't... going to chase me away again, right?

157
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,328
Everyone yearns for immortality and you gave it up just like that?

158
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,620
♫  The countless knots stirring  ♫

159
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,213
Back then I was just mad at you.

160
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,384
I didn't mean for you to give up on the Art of Chun.

161
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,740
I know.

162
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,185
You'd better start practicing again.

163
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:29,940
Once the Art of Chun is gone, it's gone. There's no way to practice it again.

164
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:36,280
Moreover, my master and my sect are all gone.

165
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,900
No one can help me with it.

166
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,590
You did it on purpose.

167
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,460
You did it on purpose to make me feel guilty and get back at me!

168
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,589
I'm not.

169
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:54,900
♫  Yet a single gasp can cause the candlelight to disappear  ♫

170
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,740
♫  Wanting to ignite this fire  ♫

171
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,720
Then... Will you regret doing this?

172
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:10,400
No. Think about it, I've lived for more than 180 years.

173
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,500
I didn't realize that I was still the young man I used to be until I met you.

174
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,740
Young people always act recklessly.

175
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,325
Thus, in this life I have no regrets.

176
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,840
♫  Only looking back to realize  ♫

177
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,880
♫  I only need those beautiful eyes  ♫

178
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,140
♫  Lingering between dawn and dusk, the days pass in an instant  ♫

179
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,360
No regrets, then.

180
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,240
♫  the countless knots stirring  ♫

181
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:54,700
♫  I long for the half full moon, so that we may meet again  ♫

182
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,360
This is what they write in those novels,

183
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,540
the happily ever after that people want to see.

184
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,900
Giving up on immortality for a woman.

185
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,500
This could only happen in a novel.

186
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,440
But after they live happily ever after, they don't care about us anymore?

187
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,860
What are you laughing at?

188
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,100
- Laughing at you. 
 - Me?

189
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,160
Are you that happy that I agreed to be with you?

190
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:12,900
Of course. Because this is the most important thing in my life

191
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,960
and the only reason for me to be Nangong Chunshui.

192
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,500
Oh, right. Who are the three people who came with you?

193
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,780
The two young men are my disciples.

194
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,540
The young girl is Liu Yue's disciple, my grand disciple.

195
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,020
Aren't you going to invite them in?

196
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,800
What for? They're annoying.

197
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,620
If they want to enter the city, they can figure it out on their own.

198
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,580
It's good to let them adapt to life without me.

199
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,640
Why not ask those in Dengtian Tower to take good care of them?

200
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,080
Stop.

201
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,020

202
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,340
Do you have an invitation?

203
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,666
No.

204
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,280
If that's the case, go through Dengtian tower.

205
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,280
What if I refuse to go and insist on passing through here?

206
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,540
I'll need to fight 16 people if I go through the tower. Quite troublesome, plus it's getting late.

207
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,600
If I go through here, I only need to defeat you.

208
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,440
Makes sense. Let's do it.

209
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,460
It seems like you want to fight with me.

210
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,020
Fine. However, if you choose to go through Dengtian Tower,

211
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,200
you can enter as long as you win the battle. You can leave if you lose the battle.

212
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,600
With me, there's no such mercy.

213
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,200
Either you beat me to the ground,

214
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,500
or I beat you down and throw you out.

215
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,100
Guys.

216
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,260
This guy wants to beat us to the ground.

217
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,600
Let's make his dream come true.

218
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,060
Let's beat him up.

219
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,160
Interesting.

220
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,020
Order from the City Lord.

221
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,740
Order from the City Lord. Gentlemen, you need to go through all 16 floors to enter.

222
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,020
16 floors? Don't we usually let them in after the 10th floor?

223
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,340
I have no idea either.

224
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,740
The City Lord mentioned that this lady isn't interested in martial arts so she may enter directly.

225
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,360
Well... Then...

226
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,260
Martial Uncle Baili, Martial Uncle Sikong, good luck!

227
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:38,355

228
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,020
You two are the disciples of that man?

229
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,540
Why? You want to fight the tower?

230
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,220
Who goes first?

231
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,800
You first. Usually the best one goes last.

232
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,820
Oh, come on.

233
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,300
Don't be so arrogant!

234
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,200
That's fast.

235
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,520
What on earth?

236
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,468
I'll settle the second floor.

237
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:25,352

238
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:33,566

239
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:49,100
I, Ye Dingzhi, am here to see the Blade Deity, Yan Lingxia.

240
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,500
You've come to seek revenge.

241
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,020
No.

242
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,800
I'm here to ask for a move from you.

243
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,180
Greetings, Senior.

244
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,300
You want me to enlighten you?

245
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,580
Yes.

246
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,320
Why?

247
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,600
I want to learn the Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

248
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,980
There are only three ways to achieve success in sword training.

249
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,960
Challenge the swordsmen, hone the skill in a desperate situation, and learn from a master.

250
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,240
I don't have much time. The first two are time-consuming

251
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,760
so I'd like to ask you to teach me this move.

252
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,720
You're just like your master.

253
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,020
From the Nanjue's Martial World point of view, I don't support your decision to learn those techniques.

254
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,980
I know.

255
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,560
And I'm sure that you know

256
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:07,000
the reason why I came to you despite the many masters in Nanjue.

257
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,760
You're smart and understand people's minds.

258
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,040
True. I do feel sorry for your master.

259
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,780
- Although I— 
 - I admit

260
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,560
this is a despicable thing, but I have my reasons.

261
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,120
I'm Rain Demon's disciple, Ye Dingzhi.

262
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,860
Senior, please enlighten me.

263
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,780
Fine.

264
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,680
Draw your sword.

265
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,340
There are 16 floors in Dengtian Tower.

266
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,260
You can get up here in one try. Your disciples can do it too.

267
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:02,820
That's impossible. With their current ability, the highest they can reach is the 14th floor.

268
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,060
Any higher and they're going to get beaten up.

269
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,485

270
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:13,100
They're certainly skilled. They made it to the 15th floor in one try.

271
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:18,600
However, from the 15th floor onwards the Elders are the guards.

272
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,300
That's strange.

273
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,600
Could they be scared?

274
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,700
Don't take them lightly. Let's have a look.

275
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,020
Why are there two people on this floor?

276
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,160
If both of you can come together,

277
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,360
why can't the both of us guard the tower together?

278
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,460
Guardian of the 15th floor of Dengtian Tower,

279
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,540
Luo Fengzhong.

280
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,780
Guardian of the 16th floor of the Dengtian Tower,

281
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,360
Luo Nianse.

282
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,620
Since both of you joined forces, both of us will join forces too.

283
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,260
Control yourself. Control.

284
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,580
Control? They're going to humilate Xueyue City.

285
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,440
You're right. Forget about their master.

286
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,240
But his disciples are provoking us again and again.

287
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,560
We really shouldn't tolerate their behavior.

288
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,720
Both of you have been well-known for many years.

289
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,920
You won't bully us, will you?

290
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,600
Kid.

291
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,400
How long have you been in the Martial World?

292
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,160
Quite some time, Senior.

293
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,280
Since you said that my friend and I have been well-known for many years,

294
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,880
do you know who we are?

295
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,940
 Oh no. I was making it up.

296
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,600
 I've never heard of them in the Martial World.

297
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,320
Sikong Changfeng, what's wrong?

298
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,660
We're in trouble. Both of them have concealed their identities while living here.

299
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,900
They're using pseudonyms.

300
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,180
Oh no.

301
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,300
Now you've realized.

302
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,140
No matter what you say about us bullying you,

303
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,820
who knows who we are?

304
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,740
- How shameless of them. 
 - Hey.

305
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,440
Since you're here, let's battle. Cut the nonsense.

306
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,600
What's the hurry?

307
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,520
Give them a chance to talk.

308
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,260
The battle is inevitable.

309
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,540
But can you not hit my face?

310
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,240
Sure.

311
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,280
I thought we agreed to not hit my face.

312
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,360
You face danger without fear. Impressive.

313
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,460
Really?

314
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,420
- Are you scared? 
 - No.

315
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,640
Beat me to death if you dare!

316
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,440
Are you scared?

317
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,660
No.

318
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Sikong Changfeng!

319
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,280
I'm scared! I'm scared!

320
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,160
Will you end the battle if I admit that I'm scared?

321
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,260
No!

322
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,420
- Don't worry. I'm here. 
 - Don't ask.

323
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,260
I'm scared.

324
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,900
Can I take him for a break?

325
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,340
Fengzhong's skill is ruthless.

326
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,860
Don't worry, we're different.

327
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,460
- Really? 
 - Of course.

328
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,200
I'll only use one finger.

329
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,160
One finger?

330
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,100
Like I believe you.

331
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,180
Seems like neither of you are very good.

332
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,100
Why don't you ask your master for some help?

333
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,940
The one who went inside was our master.

334
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,580
Mister. Please deliver a message to him.

335
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,700
- His name is Nangong Chunshui. 
 - Stop it.

336
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,950
He won't come to help.

337
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,900
He's more likely to laugh at us.

338
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,620
No.

339
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,260
I want to tell him...

340
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,040
You just wait!

341
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,880
Fine.

342
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,900
The guy inside, called Nangong Chunshui, listen up!

343
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,400
Well, in the end, my disciples still...

344
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,680
 Just you wait!

345
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,600
Oh, Baili Dongjun.

346
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,280
Fine. Let them get beat to death.

347
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,040
They really could die from being tortured by those two.

348
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,940
Since both of them are acting so arrogantly, they're far from death.

349
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,840
Why don't I say something back?

350
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,140
I'll tell them...

351
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,808
You called yourself a scholar, didn't you?

352
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:03,160
Scholars fight verbally.

353
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,640
I can say something gentle.

354
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,940
How about...

355
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,860
We can part ways and I wish you a happy life.

356
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,140
I shouldn't have helped him last night.

357
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,680
That rotten old man!

358
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,780
I quit.

359
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,120
I'm going to get myself killed.

360
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:46,620
For the next seven days meet me at Moon Cave Lake at the Mao hour. 
  (TN: 5:00-7:00am)

361
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,292
Thank you, Senior.

362
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:52,340
Oh, right, Senior!

363
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,660
Are you hungry?

364
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,270
Your sword skills are much better doing this than what you were trying during the day.

365
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,700
Are you mocking me?

366
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,540
You're rather strange.

367
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,840
I killed your master. You should hate me.

368
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,860
Even if you want something from me, it'd be nothing more than a deal.

369
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,780
But you don't show any hostility towards me.

370
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,350
Do you know what Master wanted...

371
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,280
from the battle with you?

372
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,440
He wanted it to be delightful.

373
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,860
He wanted to fight the top martial artist.

374
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,360
Senior, you did your best.

375
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,020
That was what Master wanted.

376
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,560
Master also told me not to treat you as an enemy.

377
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:09,940
That's easy to say, but difficult to do.

378
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,424
You're a sensible man.

379
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,660
I'm not.

380
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,802
But I understand my master.

381
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,450
I understand...

382
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,820
what he truly wanted.

383
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,920
You should do the same thing for the next few days.

384
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,480
I'll train really hard every single day.

385
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,600
The same goes for roasting poultry.

386
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,950
Since we are at Moon Cave Lake,

387
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,460
why don't we grill fish tomorrow?

388
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,183
Your master just passed away and your loved one is getting married.

389
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,300
Aren't you resentful?

390
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,360
- Who are you? 
 - I know you want to be stronger.

391
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,480
And I have a technique that can make you stronger.

392
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,200
I asked, who are you?

393
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,100
Beyond the sky and the earth, I'm Yue Qing.

394
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,610
I don't know you.

395
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,440
And I'm not interested.

396
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,100
Why not?

397
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,120
Your master had been fighting Li Changsheng his whole life.

398
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,300
Don't you want to fulfill his dream by beating his disciple, Baili Dongjun?

399
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,300
You know Baili Dongjun?

400
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,620
You look like Yin Luoxia.

401
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,780
You two are sisters.

402
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:42,100
What? You couldn't take Baili Dongjun with you, so now you're plotting against me.

403
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,740
There's no need for that.

404
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,780
I won't come with you,

405
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,660
so stop following me.

406
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,420
Next time, I won't be so nice to you.

407
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,980
Ye Dingzhi!

408
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,680
Ye Dingzhi!

409
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,440
She's getting married! Don't you want to get her back?

410
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,860
Your friends are here to visit you.

411
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,240
Junior Niece, why are you here?

412
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,700
Luckily, you don't have to fight. Those old men are simply inhumane.

413
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,940
I brought you some medicine.

414
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,700
Oh, right.

415
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,060
Mister Li said that if you couldn't pass all 16 floors in the Dengtian Tower,

416
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,360
then you can get lost.

417
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,740
And also... don't call him Master anymore.

418
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,560
Well...

419
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,740
He just wants us to get killed.

420
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,540
What can we do?

421
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,220
What can we do? Fight.

422
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,650
It hurts.

423
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,500
Then...

424
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,680
I'll be more gentle.

425
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:02,930
 Your identity, your goal, and the cold power struggle aside,

426
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:08,260
 are you... in love with Baili Dongjun?

427
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,220
 I...

428
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,420
 I've never thought about it.

429
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,160
 Give it a thought then.

430
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,380
 Sister!

431
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,600
 He...

432
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,400
 You smiled.

433
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,500
 Why are you blushing?

434
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,600
 You like him?

435
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,820
 I think...

436
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,720
 I do a little.

437
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,460
Both of you are her martial uncles.

438
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,980
Why do you only deserve me to dress your wounds?

439
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,740
Jealous?

440
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,780
When I was injured while practicing spear techniques,

441
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,780
the prettiest woman in the Academy dressed my wound.

442
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,160
There is nothing to be jealous about.

443
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,460
Why are you laughing?

444
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,660
You don't believe me? I'm telling the truth.

445
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,340
Where are you going?

446
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,960
I'm really telling the truth! Hey!

447
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,740
Baili Dongjun, are you going to sleep?

448
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,640
I can't fall asleep.

449
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,460
Tell me, what's going on?

450
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,060
I can stay up and talk to you.

451
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,100
Sikong Changfeng, we've known each other for so long.

452
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,780
But we've never talked about our past.

453
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,340
Do you remember my introduction?

454
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,580
You come empty-handed and you leave empty-handed.

455
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,860
That's why you named yourself Sikong.

456
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,740
You also desire to be like the wind that blows by and never returns.

457
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,900
So your name is Sikong Changfeng.

458
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,320
Yes, this is how I imagined my life would be.

459
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,680
I'd carry a spear, ride a horse, wander through the world,

460
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,760
and in the end, die drunk in front of a temple.

461
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,180
I'd leave empty-handed.

462
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,820
That was the first half of my life.

463
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,760
I came empty-handed.

464
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,260
Do you remember what I told you?

465
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,340
I once told you that I lost my memory.

466
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,380
When I first became conscious, I woke up in a broken temple.

467
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,980
At the time I was starving.

468
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,420
So I crawled out onto the street.

469
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,700
But I didn't have any money. I could only watch other people eat.

470
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:26,980
I kept staring at them. And then a boy in rags gave me a pancake.

471
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,900
He asked for my name. I said I didn't know.

472
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,940
Then he told me to follow him.

473
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,980
I don't know how old I was.

474
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,180
But I remember that young man was as tall as me.

475
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,860
He said he was 13.

476
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,980
And so I think I was 13 too.

477
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,900
Since then, my name has been Sikong Changfeng.

478
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,380
Don't look at me like that.

479
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,100
It makes me look pathetic.

480
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,020
Listen. Actually, I don't think I'm miserable.

481
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,420
Live in the moment.

482
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,620
Isn't that fun?

483
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,840
All right, that's all. How about you?

484
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,740
Me?

485
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,540
Martial arts was never my thing. I enjoy making liquor.

486
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:19,120
I took Gu Chen, the best liquor brewer in the world, as my master.

487
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:24,800
When Master Gu Chen passed, he passed on Xichu's Sword Song to me.

488
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,920
Since then, I've been determined to learn martial arts.

489
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,140
And then, I took Mister Li, the best martial artist in the world, as my master.

490
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,440
- You're just bragging. 
 - I'm not.

491
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,700
- I'm just... 
 - Alright, I'm just joking.

492
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,260
You just happened to live a smooth life.

493
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,940
Yes.

494
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,900
It seems like my only unfulfilled dream is to marry Miss Fairy.

495
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,920
But...

496
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,900
Right now, I...

497
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,020
What's wrong?

498
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,660
Are you in love with your Junior Niece?

499
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,680
Sikong Changfeng, I'm not a playboy.

500
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,780
It's just... their eyes look so much alike.

501
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,820
I'm not making up excuses. They do look alike.

502
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:32,040
Sometimes when I look into Junior Niece's eyes,

503
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,460
I feel like I'm back to the night when I first met her.

504
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,774
If they're so much alike

505
00:41:38,774 --> 00:41:44,340
how do you know that the one you like is Junior Niece and not Miss Fairy's substitute?

506
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,620
Don't talk nonsense.

507
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,620
Substitute? She's not.

508
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,300
If someone overheard this they'd misunderstand.

509
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:58,960
If they look so much alike, and yet you don't treat her differently, then what is it?

510
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,020
People do look alike.

511
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,920
But the feelings are different.

512
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,180
 Ye Dingzhi!

513
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,940
 She is getting married! Don't you want to get her back?

514
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,940
 Of course, I do.

515
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,560
 I want to so badly I even dream about it.

516
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:52,340
 Soon she'll be in her wedding gown marrying someone else.

517
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,240
 Dongjun.

518
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,700
I'm going after...

519
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,960
your senior's future sister-in-law.

520
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,995
When the time comes...

521
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,695
will you turn your sword against me?

522
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,121

523
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:21,740

524
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:33,110

525
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:44,639
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

526
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:52,460
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

527
00:43:52,460 --> 00:44:01,700
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

528
00:44:02,913 --> 00:44:10,320
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

529
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,300
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

530
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,760
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

531
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,900

532
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,560

533
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,140
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

534
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,900
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,620
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

536
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:37,940
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

537
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:42,400
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

538
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,700
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

539
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:51,280
