38
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,180
what terrible thing did you

39
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,220
do to her then?

40
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,100
Actually, it's no big deal.

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,700
It's just that

42
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,420
I figured since we were engaged,

43
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,460
then we should be honest
with each other.

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,140
So I told her

45
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,420
that I practiced

46
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,220
the Dachun Art.

47
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,780
Then

48
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,740
she asked me a question.

49
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,100
What was the question?

50
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,620
She asked

51
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,420
how many wives

52
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,500
I have had.

53
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,660
And what was your answer?

54
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,820
Of course, I said three.

55
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,460
A gentleman like me

56
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,420
will only have one wife

57
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,660

58
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,540
There's no way
I have more than one wife.

59
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,220

60
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,060
called you a playboy.

61
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,580
One life, one wife.

62
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,980
Well, it doesn't

63
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,780
sound like a problem.

64
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,740
- Right?
- Yes.

65
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,740
Martial Uncle Baili,
so what you are saying is

66
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,740
the longer you live,

67
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,060
the more women you can love.

68
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:42,980
No.

69
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,340
Well...

70
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,540
That's not what I meant.

71
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,900
What do you mean, then?

72
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,340
I mean...

73
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,220
I...

74
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,060
Aren't we talking about Master?

75
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,980
Why are you pointing at me
all of a sudden?

76
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,860
Right.

77
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,860
We are talking about me.

78
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,620
What are your women's

79
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,460
real thoughts?

80
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,140
Well, from your point of view,

81
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,900
a new identity

82
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,780
means a new life.

83
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,260
Every time you get married,

84
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,340
it means she is the love of your life.

85
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,020
But, in my opinion,

86
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,020
no matter how long you have lived,

87
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,300
if you're still the same person,

88
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,530
there's only one life.

89
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,500
I am

90
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,300
the only person

91
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,460
who is unique to you.

92
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,740
The moment you met me

93
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,060
is the moment you knew what love is.

94
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:37,980
Master.

95
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,060
What was her response

96
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,140
after you said that?

97
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,340
After that,

98
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,620
there was a disapproving look,

99
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,180
but she didn't get mad right away.

100
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,820
She then asked me another question.

101
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,380
- What was it?
- What was it?

102
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,380
She said...

103
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,740
I know what she said.

104
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,700
She asked how many wives

105
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,020
you would have after marrying her.

106
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,220
Exactly.

107
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,380

113
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,140
because of her.

114
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,100
You can ask

115
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,140
your martial uncles here.

116
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,980

117
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,540
what would they say?

119
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,580
What do you think?

120
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,540
If it were me, I'd say...

121
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,580
I've never thought about the next life.

122
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,380
But in this life,

123
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,620
I'll love you with all my heart.

124

125
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,460
how about you?

126
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,540
Me?

127
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,820
I'd say,

128
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,060
before I met you,

129
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,460
I thought a relationship

130
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,900
was something temporary.

131
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,860
It ends when you pass away.

132
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,420
But after I met you,

133
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,140
I've realized a relationship

134
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,020
is not restricted by time.

135
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,140
After I've met you,

136
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,460
I will not love or marry

137
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,780
someone else.

138
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,620
Well, decades later,

139
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,100
I'd say the same thing

140
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,700
to another woman.

141
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,260
I've lived over 180 years

142
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,460
for nothing.

143
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,460
I should call you Master instead.

144
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,540
No, no. That's not right.

145
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,700
Master.

146
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,940
So,

147
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,420
what did you say in the end?

148
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,860
I had a few drinks

149
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,180
and I was tipsy.

150
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,100
And I told her...

151
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,900
I said...

152
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,420
Too many to count.

153
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,140
Dengtian Pavilion.

154
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,460
What is it?

155
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,460
Dengtian Pavilion in Xueyue City

156
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,540
consists of 16 floors.

157
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,340
Every floor

158
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,820
is guarded by a martial master.

159
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,300
The higher the floor is,

160
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,820
the stronger

161
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,900
the martial master is.

162
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,740
Especially on the top floors.

163
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,060
They are the legends

164
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,260
in the martial arts world.

165
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,940
Their skills
are mysterious and powerful.

166
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,660
Only when you pass the highest floor

167
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,820
will you get a glimpse of Xueyue City.

168
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,140
That's impressive.

169
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,620
Indeed.

170
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,060
But it's nothing.

171
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,660
Because I myself am the legend.

172
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,420
You again.

173
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,740
The former Lord
used to send you to stop me.

174
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,020
Now, the current Lord

175
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,220
sends you to stop me again.

176
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,780
Well, I wanted to ask too.

177
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,500
Why is it you again?

178
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,940
I haven't seen you in ten years.

179
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,740
Why have you gotten younger?

180
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,300
Because

181
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,660
I'm an Immortal.

182
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,180
Master's Headbutt Technique

183
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,220
is so powerful.

184
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,940
It never fails.

185
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,660
Luo Shui.

186
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,460
I'm here.

187
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,020
You once said

188
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,540
you preferred a scholar

189
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,460
to a warrior.

190
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,540
So I took charge of the Academy.

191
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,380

as Mr. Li from the Academy.

194
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,540
But Mr. Li is dead.

195
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,260
In this life,
my name is Nangong Chunshui.

196
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,220
In this life,

197
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,460
I wanted to be

198
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,420
an elegant scholar.

199
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,180
You once

200
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,380
asked me a question,

201
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,180
but I answered it wrongly.

202
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,820
And now,

203
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,100
I'll answer it again.

for this life and the next lives.

209
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,380
I used to think

210
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,020
that love

211
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,060
is temporary.

212
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,420
It ends when one of the parties
passes away.

213
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
Until I met you,

214
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,340
I've realized

215
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,460
that relationship

216
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,980
is not restricted by time.

217
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,460
Are you going

218
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,980

219
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,420

220
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,220

00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,500
Either

382
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,900
you beat me

383
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,780
and you get injured,

384
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:23,740
or

385
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,580
I beat you

386
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,820
and throw you out.

387
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:28,900
Guys.

388
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,580
This guy wants to beat us up.

389
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,420
Let's make his dream come true.

390
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,020
Beat him up.

391
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,260
Interesting.

392
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,820
Order from the City Lord.

393
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,420
Order from the City Lord.

394
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,060
Gentlemen, you need
to go through all 16 floors

395
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,780
to enter.

396
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,820
Sixteen floors?

397
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,820
Don't we usually let them in

398
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,700
after the 10th floor?

399
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,660
I have no idea either.

400
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,700
By the way, the City Lord mentioned

401
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,180
that this miss is not interested
in martial arts,

402
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,540
she may enter directly.

403
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,500
Well...

404
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,220
Then...

405
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,020
Martial Uncle Baili,
Martial Uncle Sikong,

406
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,060
good luck!

407
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,550
[All At Once]

408
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,820
You two

409
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,700
are the disciples of that man?

410
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,900
Why? Do you want to fight me?

411
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,740
Who goes first?

412
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,740
You first.

413
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Usually, the best one

414
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,500
goes last.

415
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,740
Oh, come on.

416
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,100
Don't be so arrogant!

417
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,100
That's fast.

418
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,420
What on earth?

419
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:19,980
I'll settle the second floor.

420
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,450
[Shangguan]

421
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,460
[Nanjue]

422
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,940
I, Ye Dingzhi,

423
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,020
am here to see
the Blade Deity, Yan Lingxia.

424
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,340
You've come to seek revenge on me.

425
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,380
No.

426
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,780
I'm here to ask for a move

427
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,500
from you.

428
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,380
Greetings.

429
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,540
You wanted me to enlighten you?

430
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:21,740
Yes.

431
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,100
Why?

432
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,420
I wanted to learn
the Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

433
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,620
There are only three ways
to achieve success

434
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,140
in sword training.

435
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,980
Challenge the swordsmen,

436
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,340
hone the skill in a desperate situation,

437
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,980
and learn from a master.

438
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,700
I don't have much time.

439
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,860
The first two ways are time-consuming,

440
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,460
so I'd like to ask you to teach me.

441
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,180
You are just like

442
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,700
your master.

443
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,620
From the point of view of
the Nanjue's Martial Arts World,

444
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,620
I don't support your decision to learn
the Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

445
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,580
I know.

446
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,820
And I am sure

447
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,820
that you know

448
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,300
the reason why I came to you

449
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,820
though there are so many masters
in Nanjue.

450
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,420
You are smart.

451
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,180
And you know people's minds.

452
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,220
True.

453
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,780
I do feel sorry

454
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,700
for your master.

455
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,820
Although I...

456
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,420
I admit.

457
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,820
This is a despicable thing.

458
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,260
But I

459
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,420
have my reason.

460
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,100
I'm Rain Demon's disciple, Ye Dingzhi.

461
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,660
Senior, please enlighten me.

462
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,780
Fine.

463
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,580
Draw your sword.

464
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,460
There are 16 floors
in Dengtian Pavilion.

465
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,100
You can come up here at one go.

466
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,860
Your disciples can do it too.

467
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,620
That's impossible.

468
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,860
With their current ability,

469
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,860
the highest they can reach
is the 14th floor.

470
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,620
Any floor higher

471
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,860
and they are going to get beaten up.

472
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,680
[Mortals Stop Here]

473
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,460
[Shangguan]

474
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,380
They are certainly skilled.

475
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,460
They made it

476
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,540
to the 15th floor in one go.

477
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,380
However, from the 15th floor onwards,

478
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,300
the guards will be the Elders.

479
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,140
That's strange.

480
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,500
Are they scared?

481
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,220
Don't take it lightly.

482
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,460
Let's have a look.

483
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,740
Why are there two people on this floor?

484
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,820
If both of you can come in together,

485
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
why can't the both of us

486
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,260
guard the pavilion together?

487
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,810
[Luo Fengzhong,]
Guardian of the 15th floor

488
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,380
[Guardian of the 15th floor]
of the Dengtian Pavilion,

489
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,180
[of the Dengtian Pavilion]
Luo Fengzhong.

490
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,180
Guardian of the 16th floor

491
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,460
[Luo Nianse, Guardian of the 16th floor]
of the Dengtian Pavilion,

492
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,020
[of the Dengtian Pavilion]
Luo Nianse.

493
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,940
Since both of you join forces,

494
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,420
then both of us will join forces too.

495
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,180
Well, control yourself.

496
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,980
Control?

497
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,420
They are humiliating the Xueyue City.

498
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,340
You're right.

499
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,980
Let's forget about their master.

500
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,540
But his disciples

501
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,140
are provoking us again and again.

502
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,460
Perhaps we shouldn't tolerate
their behavior.

503
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,500
Both of you have been well-known
for many years.

504
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,820
I suppose you wouldn't bully us.

505
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,340
Kid.

506
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,220
How long have you been
in the martial arts world?

507
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,460
Quite some time, sir.

508
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,220
Since you said

509
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,620
that my friend and I
have been well-known for many years.

510
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,380
So, do you know

511
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,820
who we are?

512
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,300
Oh no.

513
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,660
I was making it up.

514
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,980
I've never heard of them

515
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,740
in the martial arts world.

516
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,500
Sikong Changfeng, what's wrong?

517
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,100
We're in trouble.

518
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,420
Both of them conceal their identities
living here.

519
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,780
They are using pseudonyms.

520
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:46,740
Oh no.

521
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,180
Now you've realized.

522
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,220
No matter what you say

523
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,780
about us bullying you,

524
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,460
who knows

525
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,300
who we are?

526
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,220
How shameless of them.

527
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,860
Since you are here, let's battle.

528
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,940
Cut the nonsense.

529
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,300
What's the hurry?

530
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,940
Give them

531
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,420
a chance to talk.

532
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,460
The battle is inevitable for sure.

533
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,380
But can you don't hit my face?

534
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:27,940
Sure.

535
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,180
I thought we agreed to not hit my face.

536
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,460
You face danger without fear.

537
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,980
Impressive.

538
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,260
Really?

539
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,380
Are you scared?

540
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,260
No.

541
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,140
Beat me to death if you dare.

542
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,380
Are you scared?

543
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,360
No.

544
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,140
Sikong Changfeng!

545
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,300
Yes, I'm scared!

546
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,140
Will you end the battle

547
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,140
if I admit that I'm scared?

548
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,860
No!

549
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,380
Don't worry. I'm here.

550
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:35,780
Don't ask.

551
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:36,940
I'm scared.

552
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:38,860
Can I bring him

553
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,700
to take a break?

554
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,620
Fengzhong's skill

555
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,700
is ruthless.

556
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:46,980
Don't worry.

557
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,140
We are different.

558
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,460
For real?

559
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,260
Of course.

560
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,060
I'll use one finger only.

561
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,860
One finger?

562
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:04,900
I don't believe you.

563
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,580
It seems like both of you are weak.

564
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,420
Why don't you ask your master

565
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,060
for help?

566
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,940
The one who went in

567
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,100
is our master.

568
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,820
Mister.

569
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,740
Please deliver a message to him.

570
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,780
His name is Nangong Chunshui.

571
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,620
Stop it.

572
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,900
He won't be here

573
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,820
to help us.

574
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,860
He is more likely

575
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,500
to laugh at us.

576
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,540
No.

577
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,060
I want to tell him...

578
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,740
to just wait.

579
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,580
Fine.

580
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,980
The guy inside!

581
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,700
Nangong Chunshui, listen here.

582
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,380
Well, in the end,

583
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,100
my disciples...

584
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,980
Just you wait!

585
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,660
Baili Dongjun.

586
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:32,980
Fine.

587
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,180
Let them be beaten to death.

588
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,340
They are going to die

589
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,580
from being tortured by those two.

590
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,860
Since both of them are so arrogant,

591
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,740
that means they are far from death.

592
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,740
Why don't I say something back?

593
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,940
I'll tell them...

594
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,700
You call yourself a scholar.

595
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,020
Scholars

596
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,780
fight verbally.

597
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,340
I can say something gentle.

598
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,100
Well, fine, then.

599
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,060
We can part ways

600
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,460
and I wish you a happy life.

601
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,660
I shouldn't have taught him last night.

602
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,380
That bad old geezer!

603
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,940
I quit.

604
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,820
I'm going to get myself killed.

605
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,100
From now on, for the next seven days,

606
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,220
meet me at Dongyue Lake

607
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,500
at the Mao hour.

608
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Thank you, senior.

609
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,140
Oh, right, senior.

610
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,460
Are you hungry?

611
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,500
Your sword skill

612
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,700
is much more lively at this

613
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,140
than what you were doing in the daytime.

614
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,500
Are you mocking me?

615
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
You're strange.

616
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,020
I killed your master.

617
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,340
You should hate me.

618
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,420
Even if you want something from me,

619
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,980
it'd be nothing more than a deal.

620
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,220
But you don't show

621
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,980
any hostility towards me.

622
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,180
Do you know what Master wanted...

623
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,180
from the battle with you?

624
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,380
He wanted it to be delightful.

625
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,660
He wanted to fight
the top martial artist.

626
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,300
Senior, you did your best.

627
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,820
That was what Master wanted.

628
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,260
Master once told me

629
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,140
not to treat you as an enemy.

630
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,780
It's easier said

631
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,940
than done.

632
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,420
You are a sensible man.

633
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,620
I'm not.

634
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,620
But I know my master.

635
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,340
I know...

636
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,620
what he truly wanted.

637
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,700
You should do the same thing

638
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,700
for the next few days.

639
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,060
I'll train really hard

640
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,340
every single day.

641
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,500
The same goes for roasted chickens.

642
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,660
Since we are at the Dongyue Lake,

643
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,940
why don't we

644
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,260
grill fish tomorrow?

645
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,180
Your master has just passed away

646
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,100
and your loved one is getting married.

647
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:37,900
Aren't you resentful?

648
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,260
Who are you?

649
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,940
I know you want to be stronger.

650
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:43,980
And I

651
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,700
have a technique

652
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,820
that can make you stronger.

653
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,300
I'm asking,

654
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,660
who are you?

655
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,740
Beyond the sky and the earth,

656
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,900
I'm Yue Qing.

657
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,580
I don't know you.

658
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,340
And I'm not interested.

659
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,900
Why not?

660
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,100
Your master had been fighting

661
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,860
Li Changsheng his whole life.

662
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:18,860
Don't you want

663
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,580
to fulfill his dream

664
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,300
by beating his disciple,

665
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,300
Baili Dongjun?

666
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,100
You know Baili Dongjun?

667
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
You look like Yin Luoxia.

668
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,500
I bet you are sisters.

669
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,300
What now?

670
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,060
You couldn't
take Baili Dongjun with you,

671
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,140
so now you're plotting on me.

672
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,820
There's no need for that.

673
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,020
I'm not coming with you.

674
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,620
So stop following me.

675
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,900
Next time,

676
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,220
I won't be so nice to you.

677
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,780
Ye Dingzhi!

678
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,980
Ye Dingzhi!

679
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,580
She is getting married!

680
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,140
Don't you want to get her back?

681
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,460
Your friends are here to visit you.

682
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,900
Luoxia, why are you here?

683
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,580
Luckily, you don't have to fight.

684
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,500
Those old men

685
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,380
are simply inhumane.

686
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,300
I brought you some medicine.

687
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,220
Oh, right.

688
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,020
Mr. Li said

689
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,220
that if you couldn't

690
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,380
pass all 16 floors
in the Dengtian Pavilion,

691
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,860
then you might leave.

692
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,700
And also,

693
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,060
don't call him Master anymore.

694
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,060
Well...

695
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,340
He just wants us to get killed.

696
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
What can we do?

697
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,700
We can do nothing

698
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,020
but fight.

699
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,420
Ouch.

700
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:20,940
Well.

701
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,460
I'll go gentle.

702
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,980
Your identity,

703
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,620
your goal,

704
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,700
and

705
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,060
the cold power struggle aside,

706
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,380
are you...

707
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,220
in love with Baili Dongjun?

708
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,700
I...

709
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,900
I've never thought about it.

710
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,740
Give it a thought now, then.

711
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,260
Luoxia.

712
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,580
Well...

713
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,180
You smiled.

714
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,460
Why are you blushing?

715
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,580
You like him?

716
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,900
I think...

717
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,500
I do.

718
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,020
Both of you are her martial uncles.

719
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,420
How come

720
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,380
you only deserve me to dress your wound?

721
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,740
Jealous?

722
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,660
When I was injured
while practicing spear techniques,

723
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,540
the prettiest woman in the Royal Academy

724
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,340
dressed my wound.

725
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,940
This is nothing to be jealous of.

726
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,060
Why are you laughing?

727
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,260
You don't believe me?

728
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,420
I'm telling the truth.

729
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,740
Where are you going?

730
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,540
I'm really telling the truth.

731
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,140
Baili Dongjun,

732
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,620
are you going to sleep?

733
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,420
I can't fall asleep.

734
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,060
Tell me, what's going on?

735
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,740
Well, I can stay up and talk to you.

736
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,020
Sikong Changfeng,

737
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,860
we've known each other for so long.

738
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,660
But we never

739
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,540
talk about our past.

740
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,980
Do you remember my introduction?

741
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,340
You come empty-handed
and you leave empty-handed.

742
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,540
That's why you named yourself Sikong.

743
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,100
And you wish to go and never come back,
like a gust of wind.

744
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,140
So your name is Sikong Changfeng.

745
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,260
Yes.

746
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,260
This is how I imagined my life would be.

747
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,180
I'd carry a spear,

748
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,540
ride a horse,

749
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,380
wander through the world,

750
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,540
and at last,

751
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,540
die drunk in front of a temple.

752
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,060
I'd leave empty-handed.

753
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,460
That was the first half of my life.

754
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,540
I came empty-handed.

755
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:03,660
Do you remember

756
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,700
what I told you?

757
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,260
I once told you

758
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,860
that I lost my memory.

759
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,140
When I first became conscious,

760
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,580
I woke up in a broken temple.

761
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,020
That time,

762
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:12,940
I was

763
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,900
starving.

764
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,020
So I crawled out

765
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:15,900
into the street.

766
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,380
But I didn't have

767
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,740
any money on me.

768
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,660
I could only watch other people eat.

769
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,380
I kept staring at them.

770
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,380
And then,

771
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,460
a boy

772
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,820
in rag

773
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,420
gave me a pancake.

774
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,060
He asked for my name.

775
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,140
I said I didn't know.

776
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,460
Then,

777
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,140
he told me to follow him.

778
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,620
I don't know

779
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,540
how old I was.

780
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,540
But I remember that young man

781
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,700
was as tall as me.

782
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,260
He said he was 13.

783
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,500
And so,

784
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,380
I think I was 13 too.

785
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,580
Since then,

786
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,380
my name has been Sikong Changfeng.

787
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,260
Don't look at me like this.

788
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,540
It makes me look pathetic.

789
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,900
Listen.

790
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,860
In fact,

791
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,060
I don't think

792
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,980
I'm miserable.

793
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,380
Live in the moment.

794
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Isn't this fun?

795
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,340
Alright, that's all.

796
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,460
How about you?

797
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,540
Me?

798
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,100
Martial arts is never my thing.

799
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,100
I enjoy making liquor.

800
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,460
And so, I took

801
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,620
Gu Chen,

802
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,540
the best liquor brewer in the world,
as my master.

803
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,940
When Master Gu Chen passed,

804
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,260
he passed on
the Western Chu's Sword Song to me.

805
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,580
Since then,

806
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,580
I've been determined

807
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,540
to learn martial arts.

808
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,580
And then,

809
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,580
I took Mr. Li,

810
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,580
the best martial artist in the world,
as my master.

811
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,980
You're just bragging.

812
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,580
I'm not.

813
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,260
I'm just...

814
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,340
Well,

815
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,060
I'm joking.

816
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,980
You just happen to live a smooth life.

817
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,100
Yeah.

818
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,740
It seems like

819
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,860
my only unfulfilled dream

820
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,100
is to marry Miss Fairy.

821
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,900
But...

822
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,940
Now, I...

823
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,700
What's wrong?

824
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,060
Are you

825
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,540
in love with Luoxia?

826
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,540
Sikong Changfeng,

827
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,260
I'm not

828
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,260
a playboy.

829
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,060
But

830
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,740
their eyes

831
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,660
look so much alike.

832
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,980
I'm not making up excuses.

833
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,100
They do look alike.

834
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,700
Sometimes,

835
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,260
when I look

836
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,620
into Luoxia's eyes,

837
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,140
I feel like

838
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,460
I'm back to the night

839
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,660
when I first met her.

840
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,060
If they are so much alike,

841
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,540
how do you know

842
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,820
that the one you like is Luoxia,

843
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,500
but not

844
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,820
Miss Fairy's substitute?

845
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,500
Don't talk nonsense.

846
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,420
Substitute?

847
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,500
It's not.

848
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,260
If someone overheard this,

849
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,140
they'd misunderstood.

850
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,700
If they look so much alike

851
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,860
and you don't treat her as a substitute,

852
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,740
then what is it?

853
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,900
People do look alike.

854
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,700
But the feelings are different.

855
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,900
Ye Dingzhi.

856
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,060
She is getting married!

857
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,540
Don't you want to get her back?

858
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,420
Of course, I do.

859
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,340
I want to do so so badly,
even in my dream.

860
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,820
Soon,

861
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,060
she'll be in her wedding gown,

862
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,020
marrying someone else.

863
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,220
Dongjun.

864
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,580
I'm going after...

865
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,860
your senior's future sister-in-law.

866
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:08,900
When the time comes...

867
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,540
will you turn your sword against me?

868
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,200
[No animals were harmed
during the filming of this drama.]

869
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,620

using bionic props and 3D effects.]
