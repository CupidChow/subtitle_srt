It's not that I'm not going back.

194
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,780
I just want you to show me around
in the martial arts world

195
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,140
on our way back.

196
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,660
No, I don't have time.

197
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,700
You are free.

198
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
How can that be?

199
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,940
I'm not free at all.

200
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,860
I'm the Bodhisattva of Poison.

201
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,060
I'm busy.

202
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,100
Besides,

203
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,860
the Swords Forest
is about to start after four years.

204
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,180
I don't want to miss that.

205
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,660
Swords Forest?

206
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,540
What's that?

207
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,580
It seems you are in such a hurry.

208
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,780
Is that a great assembly?

209
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,300
Swordsmen
from all over the martial arts world

210
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,700
wait in the wings for four years

211
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,740
for the opening of the Swords Forest.

212
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,580
Does that sound grand to you?

213
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,660
Uncle,

214
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,060
you like me the most.

215
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
You are the best.

216
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,580
I will brew some liquor for you.

217
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,060
Save it.

218
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,740
Let me ask you this.

219
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,100
Have your mother taught you

220
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,980
any martial arts skills?

221
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,860
No.

222
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,140
But she got me a master

223
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,780
to teach my fist techniques.

224
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,540
That's enough.

225
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,100
Come back.

226
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Who is your master?

227
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,500
His name is Wangba or something.

228
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,700
It's an interesting name.

229
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,300
Wang Batian, the Fist Conqueror?

230
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,500
Right, it's him.

231
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,580
He's something to be reckoned with.

232
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,380
Exactly.

233
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,540
My mother also thought

234
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,900
he could teach me well.

235
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,380
He was working so hard,

236
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,140
so

237
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,460
I treated him to some liquor.

238
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,580
He said he had never drunk

239
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,100
such a wonderful brew in his life.

240
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,860
Then, I told him

241
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,740
he could drink that every day

242
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,020
as long as he stopped teaching me.

243
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,980
Therefore,

244
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,100
my mother drove him away

245
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,780
three days later.

246
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,180
Do you have other masters?

247
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,700
Later, she thought

248
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,260
male masters were unreliable,

249
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,580
so she found a female master.

250
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,780
She is so beautiful.

251
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,060
I still remember her name.

252
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,700
Su Muqing.

253
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,020
Ms. Su?

254
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,060
She is indeed pretty.

255
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,140
Not only that,

256
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,540
she also taught me seriously

257
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,260
for three days.

258
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,420
Luckily,

259
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,300
it was only three days.

260
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,140
Why is that so?

261
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,260
Since Ms. Su came,

262
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,780
my father

263
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,580
came to my backyard

264
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,900
for three consecutive days.

265
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,900
You can imagine what happened later.

266
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,540
You only learned

267
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,820
superficial skills.

268
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,300
So, what actually

269
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,420
are you good at?

270
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,580
Look at me.

271
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,380
What do you think?

272
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,420
Even you think that's a bad one, right?

273
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,060
Let's go.

274
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,660
Uncle.

275
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,580
Uncle.

276
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,060
Uncle.

277
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,700
Uncle.

278
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,700
Where are you going?

279
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,380
Back to Qiandong City.

280
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,420
That's a shorter route.

281
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,540
You can't be serious.

282
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,940
Wasn't that move amazing?

283
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,580
Wasn't that your father's

284
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,940
qinggong technique,
Three Flying Cat Moves.

285
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,540
Three Flying Cat Moves?

286
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,820
It's Three Flying Swallow Moves.

287
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,420
Don't underestimate this.

288
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,060
It's a great fleeing skill.

289
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,660
Don't go, Uncle.

290
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,580
I was being mischievous before,

291
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,260
but I have changed now.

292
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,260
I swear,

293
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,540
I'm serious this time.

294
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,660
It's true

295
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,300
that I didn't like practicing
martial arts skills before.

296
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,300
First,

297
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,300
I thought fighting was boring.

298
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,940
Second, as you know,

299
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,900
General Ye and Yun have died.

300
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,820
Grandfather didn't want me

301
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,180
to suffer the Ye Family's fate.

302
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,900
However, when I encountered

303
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,300
the Eight Young Masters
of Beili these days

304
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,540
and witnessed

305
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,060
those bloodshed...

306
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,300
I ask myself,

307
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,020
if I could protect

308
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,140
my friend

309
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,020
when he is in danger?

310
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,580
Would I act like
the Eight Young Masters of Beili

311
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,900
to draw my weapon

312
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,700
and fight alongside him?

313
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,900
Uncle.

314
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,020
Who do you admire the most

315
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,780
in the martial arts world?

316
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,700
Needless to say, it's Mr. Li.

317
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,660
Which Mr. Li are you referring to?

318
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,700
Whenever the Mr. Li is mentioned,

319
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,020
it must be that person.

320
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,900
Mr. Li, the One-Sword Deity.

321
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,420
When I was 19,

322
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,300
I was fortunate to witness

323
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,140
the darting sword from beyond

324
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,180
with my own eyes in Tianqi City.

325
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,220
Five invincible swordsmen from Nanjue

326
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,300
challenged Mr. Li to a duel.

327
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,780
They intended to tire him out
through attrition warfare.

328
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,100
However, Mr. Li defeated them
with only a sword.

329
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,260
From that day on,

330
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,180
no one from Nanjue ever dares

331
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,020
to challenge anyone from Beili
to sword fights.

332
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,940
Naturally, Mr. Li triumphed

333
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,380
in the Martial Ranking that year.

334
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,380
Unexpectedly, Mr. Li

335
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,780
tore the Martial Ranking apart.

336
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,300
"The lowly Martial Ranking

337
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,420
isn't entitled to judge a deity."

338
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,060
That's cool.

339
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,140
No wonder people said
Beili wields swords,

340
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,220
while Nanjue holds blades.

341
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,860
Turns out they have lost their guts
to practice swordsmanship skills.

342
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,580
Everyone in Beili

343
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,860
practices swordsmanship skills.

344
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,340
I used to learn that when I was young.

345
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,260
You did?

346
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,580
Don't you practice how to use poison?

347
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,100
I applied poison to the sword.

348
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,420
What?

349
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,540
Any problem with that?

350
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,220
No.

351
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,100
All right. I made up my mind.

352
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,700
I want to practice swordsmanship.

353
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,180
You practice swordsmanship?

354
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,900
Do you even have a sword?

355
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,740
It's Swords Forest we are going to.

356
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,140
How can I not find one there?

357
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:26,860
I see.

358
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,540
I didn't see this coming.

359
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,220
Baili.

360
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,420
All right.

361
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,580
It's time

362
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,020
to get you a fine sword.

363
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,180
Are you sure, Uncle?

364
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,300
I announce,

365
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,100
Uncle,

366
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,660
you have grown more important to me

367
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,540
than my father.

368
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,580
Like you respect him much.

369
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,580
You can't say that.

370
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,380
Mount up. Let's hit the road.

371
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,420
Baili, come on.

372
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,180
Coming.

373
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,900
Why?

374
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,060
Didn't you ask me

375
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,380
to get a proper job?

376
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,100
Now that I'm going,

377
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,260
why are you pulling

378
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,140
the long face?

379
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,180
I am not.

380
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,780
You are mistaken.

381
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,380
True though.

382
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,140
You are capable

383
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,380
and can become a military officer
in town

384
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,100
to earn money that's enough
to buy noodles every day.

385
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,340
By then,

386
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,100
all the elderly in the village

387
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,460
will like you

388
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,300
and bring their daughters

389
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,660
to propose marriage.

390
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,700
Then, you can choose

391
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,420
the prettiest girl and marry her.

392
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,180
By the way,

393
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,060
Ye Xiaofan,

394
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,700
who do you think

395
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,340
is the prettiest girl in the village?

396
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,060
Maybe Madam Chen.

397
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,220
She has a gracefully slender figure

398
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,180
and is plump.

399
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,580
I'm saying a girl.

400
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,420
Madam Chen isn't a girl anymore.

401
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,780
She is married.

402
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,420
You choose one for me then.

403
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,660
What do you think about my sister?

404
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,100
All the teachers in the village

405
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,420
say that my sister

406
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,740
will become a beauty.

407
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,540
Do you know

408
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,380
what "will become a beauty" means?

409
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,300
What does that mean?

410
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,460
It means

411
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,180
she is yet a beauty.

412
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,300
Besides,

413
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,100
I'm engaged.

414
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,860
What? You are engaged?

415
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,220
When did that happen?

416
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,980
It was when I was little.

417
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,540
At that time, I was engaged to someone.

418
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,580
It's just

419
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,660
I'm of age now,

420
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,260
yet I'm still wandering outside.

421
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,740
I wonder

422
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,460
if she has met someone else.

423
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,220
Why don't you go and find her?

424
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,220
I will.

425
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,020
It will be

426
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,580
after doing something I must do.

427
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,580
Very soon.

428
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,540
Well, stop here.

429
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,140
Ye Xiaofan,

430
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,300
though you are only going
to a city nearby,

431
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,700
you leave the village, after all.

432
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,220
You should have the last meal
with everyone

433
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,220
and bid farewell to them.

434
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,780
I'm not going to cities nearby.

435
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,420
No?

436
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,380
Where are you going then?

437
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,220
I'm heading

438
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,420
to somewhere I have been looking forward

439
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,660
and retrieve something.

440
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,500
After that, I will go

441
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,900
to a place I must go.

442
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,300
A place you must go?

443
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,300
Where is it?

444
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,340
A faraway city

445
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,140
called Tianqi.

446
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,460
Tianqi?

447
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
Isn't that the capital

448
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,780
of Beili?

449
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,100
It is a great distance away.

450
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,820
I only read it from books.

451
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,740
Ye Xiaofan,

452
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,380
why are you going there?

453
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,260
I'm going to Tianqi

454
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,980
to achieve something big.

455
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,660
Perhaps

456
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,820
I might meet

457
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,060
a long-lost friend there

458
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,020
and her.

459
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,460
Ye Xiaofan, what are you thinking?

460
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,780
You know what?

461
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,900
Stop calling me Ye Xiaofan from now on.

462
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,060
Call me Ye Dingzhi.

463
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,340
Ye Dingzhi?

464
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,060
Why this name?

465
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,300
Because I want

466
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,780
to wander the martial arts world
with my sword

467
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,060
and challenge Tianqi.

468
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,420
[Ye Dingzhi]

469
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,140
Practice well the sword techniques
I taught you

470
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,900
for a few more years

471
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,500
and you will protect

472
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,780
the entire village.

473
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,500
Ye Xiaofan,

474
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,420
don't leave yet.

475
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,420
How will I find you later?

476
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,180
When I become famous

477
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,500
and you enter the martial arts world,

478
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,060
tell everyone your name is Ye Xiaofan,

479
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,180
then I will come to you.

480
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,020
All right.

481
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,180
Fragrance sachets for sale!

482
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,540
[Shenjian Town]

483
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,140
As expected of the Shenjian Town.
[*Literally means Divine Swords Town]

484
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,860
Everyone here holds a sword.

485
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,300
Even a dog has one.

486
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,780
Uncle,

487
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,140
so this is

488
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,900
a sword dog?
[*Sword and nasty are homophones]

489
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,620
No name-calling.

490
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,620
Sorry about that.

491
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,580
A sword dog?

492
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,460
Uncle,

493
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,780
you haven't explained to me

494
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,500
what the Swords Forest actually is.

495
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,820
Swords Forest,

496
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,140
as its name implies,
it gathers tons of swords here.

497
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,540
At first,

498
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,700
there were swordsmen

499
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,180
thrusting swords into this land
where the Sword Deity perished

500
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,060
to show their resolution
in swordsmanship.

501
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,020
Later,

502
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,860
whenever a famous sword is forged

503
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,420
or an elite swordsman perishes,

504
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,060
the new swords
and the deceased masters' swords

505
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,940
would be kept in the Swords Forest

506
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,220
to await the fated one

507
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,020
to claim them every four years.

508
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,380
This person

509
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,780
looks familiar.

510
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:34,940
What an aroma.

511
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,100
Mister,

512
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,780
what liquor is this?

513
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,140
Sword Liquor.

514
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,420
How can you miss the Sword Liquor

515
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,420
in the Swords Forest?

516
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,220
Sword Liquor?

517
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,580
- Mister, fill it up.
- Mister, fill it up.

518
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,860
All right.

519
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,020
Baili,

520
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,820
you only introduced masters

521
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,820
who taught your martial arts skills.

522
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,900
Why don't you

523
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,740
tell me something

524
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,180
about your brewing master?

525
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,420
I don't need someone to teach me that.

526
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,260
This is an innate talent, you know?

527
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,740
Coming.

528
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,660
Sirs, here's your liquor.

529
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,740
Please enjoy.

530
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,060
That's intense.

531
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,780
It cuts my tongue

532
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,060
like a sharp blade.

533
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,300
It truly lives up to its name.

534
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,380
Nice brew.

535
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,420
Don't drink too much.
You will get drunk.

536
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,820
Uncle,

537
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,820
we have been walking for long.

538
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,460
I still see no end

539
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,340
to this forest.

540
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,580
It becomes foggy.

541
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,740
Uncle.

542
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,140
Uncle?

543
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,740
Uncle.

544
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,660
Uncle.

545
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,820
This is Qimen Dunjia Arts.

546
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,900
That place

547
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,620
is the external area
of the Swords Forest

548
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,780
which is accessible on regular days.

549
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,900
But here

550
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,700
is the very place,

551
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,500
which opens only every four years,
the Swords Forest.

552
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,460
How magnificent.

553
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,660
There are

554
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,140
two great sects of swords forgery,

556
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,140
and Famous Swords Manor.

[young master of Famous Swords Manor]
is in charge this year.

559
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,820
Speaking of which,
you have some connections

560
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,340
with Famous Swords Manor.

561
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,620
What connections?

562
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,700

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,860
yet small.

[Cheng Yu, Song Yanhui
, Wushuang City]

to claim swords,

573
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,620
I won't

574
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,780
keep you waiting for long.

575
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,540
Please

576
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,940
play the music.

577
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,100
The first-level sword

578
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,580
is the Mountain sword.

579
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,060
Everyone,

580
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,980
you may start.

581
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,100
Uncle, shall we?

582
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,500
Not now.

583
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,700
There are four levels of swords.

584
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,740
First, the Mountain.

585
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,340
As high as a mountain,

586
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,780
unreachable by ordinary swords.

587
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,420
Second, the Ocean.

588
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,940
All rivers converge
into the boundless ocean.

589
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,140
Merging one hundred Mountain swords

590
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,740
to form the very one.

591
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,500
Now, the Ocean sword.

592
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,380
Everyone, please.

593
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,260
Third, the Cloud Sky.

594
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,900
Above the ocean,

595
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,460
clouds in the ninth heaven
overlook the earth.

596
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,980
There's only one in ten thousand swords.

597
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,460
Fourth, the Celestial.

598
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,180
Beyond the ninth heaven,
a celestial palace resides.

599
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,020
It's a sword from beyond.

600
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,100
Whether or not
it will emerge in the Swords Forest

601
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,780
depends on your luck.

602
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,740
If so...

603
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,060
Given

604
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,860
my swordsmanship skills,

605
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,060
claiming an Ocean

606
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,540
is not a problem.

607
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,260
You should at least
get a Cloud Sky sword.

608
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,180
In that case, I need to use poison.

609
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,500
Is there any sword you like?

610
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,460
I only know

611
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,940
Cloud Sky lies above Ocean,

612
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,500
and a Celestial one
ranks highest of all.

613
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,940
Needless to say, I want the best sword.

614
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,500
If not, how else can I gain fame?

615
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,740
Well said.

616
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,980
Who are you?

617
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,380
[Wang Yixing, principal disciple]
I'm Wang Yixing from Mount Wangcheng.

618
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,340
[of Lyu Suzhen from Mount Wangcheng]

619
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,620
The disciple of Lyu Suzhen.

620
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,420
Setting aside
whether he spoke well or not,

621
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,380
his naive ambition

622
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,300
to rise to fame

623
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,140
is putting me on the spot.

624
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,020
Mr. Wen,

625
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,860
with due respect,

626
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,820
he should

627
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,180
claim the sword by himself.

628
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,500
Mister,

629
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,900
what did you say?

630
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,140
Who claims the sword?

631
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:49,940
I'm saying

632
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,060
that it's better
if you claim the sword by yourself.

633
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,380
Look at him.

634
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,780
I'm sure

635
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,340
he will get beaten up
with two or three strikes.

636
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,340
Are we going

637
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,060
to return empty-handed?

638
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,540
Don't jump to the conclusion yet,
Mr. Wen.

639
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,940
I think

640
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
this young man

641
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,500
might get a fine sword.

642
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,700
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

643
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,940
You can't be drunk, can you?

644
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,660
The Mountain sword

645
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,940
and the Ocean sword

646
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,460
have each found their owners.

647
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,220
The next sword

648
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,820
is of Cloud Sky level.

649
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,940
I named it Fire Divine.

650
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,500
It's a shard of the ablaze sword,
Grand Sun,

651
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,780
use by the Kunlun Sword Deity
in a battle.

652
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,820
To be more precise,

653
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,620
it's born out of the Grand Sun.

654
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,980
It belongs to the Celestial Palace,

655
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,540
but alas, falls from the ninth heaven.

656
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,460
What a waste.

657
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,740
I'm down.

658
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,420
Me too.

659
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,220
I'm coming.

660
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,700
Hands off my sword.

661
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,700
You called it a waste.

662
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
You hypocrite.

663
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,900
It depends on who owns the sword.

664
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,380
Swords have no levels,

665
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,420
but their owners

666
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,740
determine their value.

667
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,820
Why is the sword flying?

668
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,060
This is Sword Wielding Arts
from Mount Wangcheng.

669
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,980
Not just wielding arts,

670
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,300
it also contains
the secret technique of Mount Wangcheng.

671
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,020
With such cultivation at this age,

672
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,420
he must be the top

673
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,500
among all current disciples.

674
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,700
You are drunk.

675
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,700
This is Sword Liquor.

676
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,260
It's different from ordinary liquor.

677
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,260
Wang Yixing, the principal disciple

678
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,620
of Mount Wancheng's Leader, Lyu Suzhen,

679
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,620
will claim this sword.

680
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,780
Everyone.

681
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,620
This is the only Cloud Sky-level sword.

682
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,980
Why isn't Wushuang City involved?

683
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,420
Could it be...

684
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,060
I'm not interested

685
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,580
in swords of a higher level.

686
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,380
This sword

687
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,540
is a perfect gift

688
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
for my junior brother.

689
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,460
Everyone,

690
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,620
thank you.

691
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,300
He mentioned

692
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,460
"swords of a higher level".

693
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,100
Exactly.

694
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,300
Wushuang City hasn't started yet.

695
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,300
Is there really a fourth-level sword?

696
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,020
The fourth level,

697
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,780
Celestial Level Sword.

698
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,780
Please grant me

699
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,020
this sword from beyond.

700
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,940
Baili, look.

701
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,820
Celestial.

702
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,620
It smells great.

703
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,980
It's the fragrance of lotus.

704
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,340
I forged this sword

705
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,980
and named it Dustless.

706
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,860
I ask for a peerless gentry to claim it.

707
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,700
Hopefully, this fine gentry

708
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,860
will journey the world with this sword

709
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,860
and let it triumph

710
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,060
the Record of Famous Swords.

711
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,060
This is a great sword.

712
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,300
I want it.

713
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,020
You fool.

714
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,060
Do you want your uncle,

715
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,660
who uses poisons,

716
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,020
to be surrounded by all swordsmen?

717
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,500
I, Song Yanhui of Wushuang City,
wish to claim this sword.

718
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,300
Who will be my rival?

719
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
I doubt someone will compete
with Wushuang City.

720
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,820
I will.

721
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
Who is he?

722
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,460
Who are you?

723
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,500
Ye Dingzhi.

724
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,900
Ye Dingzhi?

725
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,660
I have never heard of this name.

726
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,500
He probably is a rash young man.

727
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,460
He dares challenge Wushuang City?

728
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,340
This time,

729
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,980
I suppose he might die here.

730
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,940
This guy...

731
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,300
looks...

732
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,900
like...

733
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,540
I can't recall it at all.

734
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,340
Such agility.

735
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,740
An innate swordsman.

736
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,060
You are indeed strong.

737
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,700
But I am

738
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,780
stronger.

739
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,780
Uncle,

740
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,060
are they powerful?

741
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,900
Given what they have shown,

742
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,780
they are both in the Sturdy Phase.

743
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,820
However, the difference

744
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,220
is that the guy from Wushuang City

745
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,860
is already out of his depth,

746
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,900
while Ye Dingzhi

747
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,900
hasn't fully exerted his strength.

748
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,540
He possesses such strength
at this young age.

749
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,860
That's not easy.

750
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,860
Wushuang City actually loses.

751
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,420
This is unbelievable.

752
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,860
How did this happen?

753
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,820
I concede defeat.

754
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,380
Thank you.

755
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
Hold on.

756
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,260
Baili!

757
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,460
I

758
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,060
want that sword too.

759
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,460
May I ask your name?

760
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,180
Baili Dongjun.

761
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,220
Baili Dongjun?

762
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,860
Do we know each other?

763
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:34,780
No.

764
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,340
No, we don't.

765
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,940
Then why did you...

766
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,180
You want to claim the sword,

767
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,540
but where is yours?

768
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,980
My...

769
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,140
Right.

770
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,100
Mister,

771
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,380
you can have this.

772
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,540
Such embarrassment.

773
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,420
What a disgrace.

774
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,900
I have one now.

775
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,780
He's just as silly as he was.

776
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,140
Hold on. I remember it now.

777
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,260
Why do I think

778
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,740
you look familiar?

779
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,100
Baili Dongjun,

780
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,660
are you trying

781
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,740
to cozy up to me?

782
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,900
You came to the wrong place.

783
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,900
He is great.

784
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,580
Are you not drawing your sword?

785
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,620
I don't know any sword techniques.

786
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,780
Young man, come down. Just surrender.

787
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,500
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

788
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,460
Just quit and come down.

789
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,780
Don't get hurt. Stop fighting.

790
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,780
It seems that you are no match for me.

791
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,500
This idiot

792
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,140
must be slacking off during practice

793
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,780
like he did back then.

794
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,660
Sword?

795
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,580
Can I wield a sword?

796
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,780
Master,

797
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,580
this is another illusion skill of yours?

798
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,300
No, this is a sword technique.

799
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,300
Pay attention.

800
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,620
I will only demonstrate once.

801
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,860
I have an unrivaled sword technique.

802
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,580
Why is it unrivaled?

803
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,100
On this earth,

804
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,860
from past to future,

805
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,020
no one with this technique

806
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,460
will ever emerge again.

807
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,500
If someone

808
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,020
does,

809
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,860
it will only be from the Baili Family.

810
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,460
I have recalled it.

811
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,020
I know swordsmanship.

812
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,540

I was fortunate to witness that once.

829
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,940
It was exactly the same

830
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,700

Sword Song.

840
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,100
But why are there only sword moves
and no song?

841
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,580
It's a shame
that the one who sings is already dead,

842
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,420
leaving only the sword moves,

843
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,300
Heaven's Path.

844
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,980
Back then, Gu Chen,
the Scholar Deity of Western Chu sings

845
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,140
and Gu Mo, the Sword Deity,
wields his sword.

846
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,220
In front of the gate of Luosang City,

847
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,860
the last city left of Western Chu,

848
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,500
with a sword and a song,

849
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,540
they confronted 9,000 Pofeng armies

850
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,420
till their every last breath.

851
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,940
Finally, Luosang was raided

852
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,700
and Western Chu was brought down.

853
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,460
This complete sword technique

854
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,580
became a lost art.

855
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,300
That's my nephew.

856
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,580
My nephew.

857
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,580
I didn't expect

858
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,140
that the Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion

859
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,980
would be more bolder than I imagined.

860
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,260
I thought

861
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,380
I only came here for a sword
and to gain fame.

862
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,620

such an interesting sword technique.

866
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,220
Liquor.

867
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,980
Where's my liquor?

868
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,700
There you go.

00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,780
