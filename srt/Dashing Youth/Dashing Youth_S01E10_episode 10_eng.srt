2
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:44,280
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,940
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,960
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,600
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,320
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,020
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,640
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,280
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,620
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,240
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,620
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,700

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,320

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,827

23
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,670

25
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,860
What I want to test is... gambling.

26
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,420
You wish to gamble at a gambling house?

27
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,880
She's trying to show her skills in front of the experts?

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,480
I heard her say her name was Yin Luoxia?

29
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,180
That's right. What about it?

30
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,560
Since I'm at Qianjin Gambling House, of course I have to gamble.

31
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,140
Gamble?

32
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,000
An expert at gambling in the Academy...

33
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,880
Do I need to ask Old Seven to come?

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,860
There's no need to trouble Little Master.

35
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,660
There are plenty of skilled gamblers at Qianjin Gambling House.

36
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,340
Baihua Hall's Miss Feng is about to perform.

37
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,620
I haven't heard her yet! Carry me back!

38
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,940
You audacious brutes! How dare you disobey my orders!

39
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,260
Carry me back!

40
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,800
Who asked you to bring me here?

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,360
What's the big problem that must be handled right now?

42
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,400
- Who dares! 
 - Go on, go on.

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,500
Tu Wan.

44
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,480
Are Miss Feng's songs really that good?

45
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,560
You listen to her every single day. Aren't you tired of it?

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,460
How can one ever tire of it?

47
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,460
Tu Zao. Listen, a vulgar man like you will never get it.

48
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,760
Master Tu and Second Master Tu look quite different.

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,540
Is that so?

50
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,760
We'll look alike soon enough.

51
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,220
- Tu Wan. 
 - Don't talk to me. You're so annoying.

52
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,860
Here's a young lady.

53
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,640
She's challenged you to a gambling match.

54
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,286
I'm not interested. Hurry up and have the men  take me back.

55
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:55,080
Miss Feng is starting her performance soon.

56
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,300
What? Is Second Master Tu scared?

57
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,120
See?

58
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,940
Me? Scared?

59
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,100
Come on! I'd like to see who dares to brag and claim I'm scared.

60
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,400
Miss, what would you like to bet on?

61
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,700
Is that guy a mood-changing expert?

62
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,540
Turns out the beauty is still the most powerful.

63
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,280
The promotion chart, wooden cards, Madiao, Tien Gow, Spiral City, or Big-small.

64
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,540
Take your pick.

65
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,360
You sure know a lot, Miss.

66
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,320
Let's play Tien Gow then.

67
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,400
Big or small?

68
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,600
You're at Qianjin Gambling House in Tianqi City,

69
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,440
the world's number-one gambling house in the world's number-one city.

70
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,700
Of course, it has to be big.

71
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,500
- Let's play big. 
 - Okay.

72
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,120
I'll be the banker. Two-player game?

73
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,560
In my opinion...

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,180
Those two lads over there seem to be very interested.

75
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,320
What about... What about you join us?

76
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,760
What if we win?

77
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,260
You think you can win against me? Dream on!

78
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,820
Let's not jump to conclusions.

79
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,860
We should outline the rules properly.

80
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,860
Am I right, Young Master Liuyue?

81
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,180
If you win, I'll accept that as a pass for the preliminary examination.

82
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,820
And what if you lose?

83
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,900
Then you'll get a portion of the liquor and meat.

84
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,280
Good deal. Come on, then.

85
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,680
Chu tiles, Tian tiles, Mo tiles.

86
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,700
What's your choice?

87
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,040
- Mo tiles. 
 - Tian tiles.

88
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,700
Then I'll take Chu tiles.

89
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,580
Why does it sound ominous though?

90
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,260
Miss, what made you turn to gambling at such a young age?

91
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,020
Gambling isn't a good hobby.

92
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,560
Once you get started, at best you become penniless

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,180
at worst, you lose your family and possessions.

94
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,580
I've only seen one type of person

95
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,540
who could live a comfortable life through gambling.

96
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,720
What type of person is that?

97
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,100
The one who runs the gambling house.

98
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,840
A gambling house manager is most unscrupulous.

99
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,420
They kill without shedding any blood.

100
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,060
Master Tu, he's criticizing you.

101
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,000
H-He's criticizing himself.

102
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,760
So today...

103
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,900
you'll see a second type.

104
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,000
You make it sound like you're the king of gambling.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,520
- Well? Are you all ready? 
 - Bring it on.

106
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,160
Let's do it.

107
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,520
Here, take a look at what I've got.

108
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,920
- How is it? 
 - Wow.

109
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,360
Three, six, and one goose.

110
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,380
Not even the gods can save you.

111
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,600
That's so low.

112
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,260
Why does it sound even more ominous?

113
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,700
Indeed, there's nothing worse than that.

114
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,820
Your tiles are the lowest hand one can ever produce.

115
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,600
No matter what the banker has, you'll still lose.

116
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,120
You...

117
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,940
You should go back to your liquor brewing.

118
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,960
I think your meat is overcooked.

119
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,180
Let me see what you've got.

120
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,500
- Not too bad. 
 - Tian King and Tian Nine.

121
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,960
A good match with your Tian tiles.

122
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,040
I have no idea what those fancy words mean.

123
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,720
But the words do sound pretty cool.

124
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
So, do you have a chance of winning?

125
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,020
You've shown my tiles but the banker hasn't shown his. How would I know if I can to win?

126
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,040
No need to trouble you, Young Master. I'll do it myself.

127
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,040
Double Earth and Plum.

128
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,960
Is it a good hand?

129
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,300
Not the best.

130
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,080
But it's more than enough to beat me.

131
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,760
And yours?

132
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,480
Double Human.

133
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,660
Is that good?

134
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,400
It's a good hand, but it's not better than the banker's Double Earth. She's lost too.

135
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,580
Your hand is pretty good.

136
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,880
But it's too bad...

137
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,560
That's not all I've got.

138
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,185
- Supreme Duo? 
 - What?

139
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:28,585
She indeed got the Supreme Duo!

140
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:30,320
I've never seen it before.

141
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,460
- What kind of luck is that? 
 - What's going on?

142
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,400
How could that be?

143
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,060
Could it really be her?

144
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,340
I can't believe it.

145
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,300
Even gamblers rarely encounter it in their lifetime,

146
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,020
the Supreme Duo that can win against any hand.

147
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,400
This is the first time I've seen someone deal with the Supreme Duo.

148
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,920
- Supreme Duo? 
 - That's a good deck.

149
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,300

150
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,120
Why are you so surprised, Master Tu?

151
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,980
That lady. She cheated.

152
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,380
Did you see it?

153
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:11,220
If I did, she'd have to leave her hands in Qianjin Gambling House no matter what.

154
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,960
If you didn't see it, why are you so sure she cheated?

155
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,900
Because Tu Wan cheated.

156
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,740
While he's seated there, no one will be able to get the Supreme Duo.

157
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,700
But didn't you say that in Qianjin Gambling House there have never been any cases of cheating?

158
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,700
If caught, it's cheating.

159
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,940
If not caught, then it's a skill.

160
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,000
Aren't you going to check whether or not your meat is grilled?

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,600
You go check if your liquor is done brewing.

162
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,520
- Yes. 
 - Let's go.

163
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,200
Second Master Tu. What now?

164
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,989
May I know your name, Miss?

165
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:10,943
I've told you, I'm Yin Luoxia.

166
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:14,563
Tu Zao! You think I'm a fool?!

167
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:18,803
I thought she was a scammer. That's why I called you to test her ability.

168
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:21,683
Besides, you deserved to lose.

169
00:10:21,683 --> 00:10:25,363
Ye Dingzhi. Is she famous?

170
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:29,903
Her? She's the daughter of the former King of Gambling.

171
00:10:29,903 --> 00:10:34,263
Back then, at the third biggest gambling house in Beili, Qingzhou's Xiaoyao Hall,

172
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:36,683
the King of Gambling lost to Lian Rulie from Nanjue.

173
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,383
The wealth he accumulated for decades was lost in one game.

174
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:42,383
The next day, his daughter took the seat at the table.

175
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:45,403
She won three games in a row and reclaimed the title King of Gambling.

176
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:47,843
She was just 10 years old.

177
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:51,683
She was too short and had to sit on the King of Gambling's shoulders to play.

178
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:57,380
Turns out you're the Little King of Gambling.

179
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,863
My skills pale in comparison. I admit defeat.

180
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:02,120
We can gamble another time.

181
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,340
Forget about gambling.

182
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,300
Did I pass the exam?

183
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,900
To be able to cheat in Qianjin Gambling House is indeed a skill.

184
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,300
Pass.

185
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,060
Candidate Yin Luoxia passes the preliminary examination.

186
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,160
You dare choose to brew liquor in such a limited examination period.

187
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,620
You are either a genius or a fool.

188
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,220
Hopefully, you're a genius.

189
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,820
Then we'll be able to be classmates.

190
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,300
Did she have to poke fun at me before she left?

191
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,120
Think positively.

192
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,420
She was encouraging you.

193
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,540
As if I'd believe that.

194
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,680
What are you doing?

195
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,160
Letting it rest while I take a nap.

196
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,260
Still not out yet?

197
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,060
It's been so long.

198
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,780
Judging by the time, they should be about done.

199
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
- How long have they been inside? 
 - I'm not sure.

200
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,680
They haven't come out after such a long time.

201
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,180
It's been so long. What are they testing?

202
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,190
Yes.

203
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,720
What exactly is going on in there? Why aren't they out yet?

204
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,240
- Yes! 
 - Exactly!

205
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,340
Why aren't they out yet?

206
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,040
Are two hours over?

207
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,400
No, not yet.

208
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,700
But the incense stick is half burned.

209
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,160
Don't worry about it.

210
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,860
The flow of time and space in here has become chaotic for some reason.

211
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,200
I filled the cup just now. Why is it empty?

212
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,920
It's Qimen Dunjia.

213
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,380
Qimen Dunjia?

214
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,800
That's right. Since you've mastered Qimen Dunjia, I already know who you are.

215
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,540
All the logic of this world is determined by the person who set up the formation.

216
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,960
My dish is overcooked!

217
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,600
Where are my flowers? What happened?

218
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,660
I won't break the formation.

219
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,880
Since you possess such a skill, you get a pass.

220
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,860
I'm Zhuge Yun. Thanks for seeing my poor performance.

221
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,780
You're too humble.

222
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,413
His surname is Zhuge.

223
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:22,320
Zhuge? What about it?

224
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,320
It means a lot. Just like your surname is Baili. It represents certain things.

225
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,180
My name is Zhao Yujia. Allow me to perform face-changing.

226
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,300
Another one performing face-changing.

227
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,020
Zhao Yujia? 
  (TN: Jia means fake)

228
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,060
Then I'll call myself Zhao Yuzhen. 
  (TN: Zhen means real)

229
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,930

230
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,280
Young Master, isn't the 12-hour time you set overly long?

231
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,840
Who can bear it?

232
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:35,600

233
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,180
You got up right on time.

234
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,300
Listen, practice makes perfect.

235
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,100
You'll know once your master beats it into you.

236
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,500
Your roast lamb looks almost ready.

237
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,660
Right.

238
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,640
Once your liquor is done, we'll be able to pair sumptuous meat with fragrant liquor.

239
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,040
One hour to go!

240
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,960
It's time.

241
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,260
Smells wonderful.

242
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,400
I, Li Xin, submit my work.

243
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,460
Looks like you're a step too late.

244
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,540
If his liquor is better than yours then it's over for you.

245
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,120
No one's liquor is as good as mine.

246
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,300
You seem very confident.

247
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,620
Of course, I am. I made a promise to someone.

248
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,980
He'll be the Sword Deity and I'll be the Liquor Deity.

249
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,900
The liquor brewed by the future Liquor Deity can't possibly be beaten in such a place.

250
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,120
 You still remember.

251
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,640
I, Baili Dongjun, want to be tested together!

252
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,580
Is there liquor to drink?

253
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,280
You, another candidate, are the last one left in the exam hall.

254
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,500
You, Master Tu, and I.

255
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,640
Why don't the three of us judge this exam together?

256
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,220
What do you say?

257
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,400
It would be my pleasure.

258
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,780
This liquor smells fragrant.

259
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,740
Good liquor.

260
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,420
It's as good as the Jinyinshui we serve in Qianjin Gambling House.

261
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,220
Not bad.

262
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,260
It's good indeed.

263
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,600
The liquor has a rich taste and it's smooth in the mouth.

264
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,280
It's something special.

265
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,380
Let's try the other one.

266
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,580
This liquor is clear as crystal. It doesn't smell strongly of liquor either.

267
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,020
If you hadn't told me it's liquor I would've thought it was water.

268
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,160
But it does have a refreshing scent.

269
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,240
It's...

270
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,880
It's sweet and light.

271
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,240
Baili Dongjun. What's the name of this liquor?

272
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,300
Guozao. 
  (TN: meaning premature)

273
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,620
Guozao? Why Guozao?

274
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,740
Because it should have been brewed for much longer.

275
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,580
But in order for you to taste it, I took it out prematurely.

276
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,740
But like an aged liquor has its own taste,

277
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,700
one that's under-brewed has the freshness of early fermentation.

278
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,460
As for this brew, it's not meant for liquor aficionados,

279
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,740
but more suited for gentle ladies or fragile elders.

280
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:42,340
Liquor can have different tastes. Not one particular flavor is the best.

281
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,960
Lingsu. Pour me another cup.

282
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,200
Young man, can I have another cup?

283
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,260
As you wish.

284
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,680
You both asked for another cup, but that's a bit greedy.

285
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,100
What a familiar taste.

286
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,880
You've sampled Guozao before?

287
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,620
I don't know what Guozao is or isn't.

288
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,260
All I know is that this liquor...

289
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,840
has the taste of Mother.

290
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,840
When I was young, Mother would make this kind of liquor for me every year.

291
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,300
I miss my mother.

292
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,720
Sorry for getting emotional. Sorry.

293
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,540
This liquor also reminded me of my younger days.

294
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,660
It reminds me of my childhood friends.

295
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,600
It was perfectly timed.

296
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:14,540
Dongjun. You said the liquor is suitable for gentle ladies and fragile elders,

297
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:19,220
but it seems like a heroic man like Master Tu

298
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,840
and a wandering traveler like Ye Dingzhi also love the liquor.

299
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,260
Every person is different and every liquor is distinct.

300
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,620
Who knows which one you might choose?

301
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,040
All right. We've tasted the liquor.

302
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,060
Now, let us try the meat.

303
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,100
The same goes for me. Help yourselves.

304
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,960
Liu Yue won't let me in.

305
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,920
Now you guys won't either?

306
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,060
I'm his senior brother.

307
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,090

308
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,480
It's been so long. Why aren't they out yet?

309
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,000
Could it be Liu Yue is pulling a prank on me?

310
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,540
Everyone, have a taste.

311
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,480
Another piece.

312
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,580
The lamb seems to have come from Man Country.

313
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,460
Man?

314
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,840
Ye Dingzhi? You've been to Man Country?

315
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,820
Beiman? I have.

316
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,020
I had the opportunity to take part in their god-worshipping festival.

317
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,200
This leg of lamb was grilled for exactly 12 hours.

318
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,360
Ye Dingzhi.

319
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,860
You didn't just visit Man but stayed there for some time, right?

320
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,780
The way the lamb was grilled and its taste couldn't have been reproduced

321
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,380
by someone who merely visited.

322
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:09,400
Yes. In my heart, visiting a place isn't just taking a quick look around.

323
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,380
It's about truly integrating into the life there.

324
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,120
Without a few years of living together, it can't be considered an actual visit.

325
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,540
Ye Dingzhi. We're about the same age, but I didn't expect you to have experienced so much more.

326
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,700
Beiman is the northern-most place I've been and Nanjue the southern-most place.

327
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,540
I've been to various Buddhist nations in the west and sailed across the seas in the east.

328
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,740
The world is vast.

329
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,140
I only worry that I won't be able to see it all or travel far enough.

330
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,840
You actually remind me of a childhood friend.

331
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,700
If he were still alive, he’d definitely live as carefree as you do.

332
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,880
So, Young Master Liuyue, when can you give me an answer?

333
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,660
As for the liquors presented, I’m sure everyone here already knows the answer.

334
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,520
The winner is...

335
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,960
Baili Dongjun.

336
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,940
The way he made the liquor is the most common way of making rice liquor!

337
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,700
Whereas mine is...

338
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,140
Your academy is prejudiced!

339
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,380
Your liquor is indeed good. It's rich and smooth.

340
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,340
Then why?

341
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:36,200
Even if you’re the best brewmaster, it would still take half a year to produce this flavor.

342
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,860
But you only took 12 hours to produce the taste.

343
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,440
Lingsu. Examine him.

344
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,400
Young Master, it seems he replaced the brewed liquor with the liquor from this bottle.

345
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,300
Your name carries the word Xin, 
  (TN: meaning trust)

346
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,700
yet you did such a despicable thing.

347
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,780
Remove him.

348
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,020
- Guards. 
 - Yes!

349
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,780
- Get out. 
 - Put me down!

350
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,420
This isn't fair! You're being unfair!

351
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,220
Let go of me!

352
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,420
Let go of me!

353
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,900
I don't care about your rules.

354
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,160
The point is, I think this young man's Guozao tastes better than that guy's!

355
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,700
You've judged the liquors and tasted my grilled meat.

356
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,480
Will Young Master Liuyue please pass judgment on it?

357
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,620
The examination period has ended.

358
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,826
Baili Dongjun. Ye Dingzhi. You've both passed the preliminary examination.

359
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,400
Liu Yue. I knew you wouldn't let me down.

360
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,580
You narrowed it down from 100 to 16.

361
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,580
That's great. Very good.

362
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,360
It was a task delegated by you, Master.

363
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,140
Of course, I had to complete it well.

364
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,240
You did well. Have a good rest.

365
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,520
For the upcoming final examination, I'll ask Lei'er and Mo to handle it.

366
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,060
No. I'd like to do it.

367
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,620
What a surprise.

368
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,040
When did you become so interested in this matter?

369
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,260
Because many interesting individuals showed up at the exam this time.

370
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:58,260
I'm excited to see what surprises they'll bring to the Academy.

371
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,380
Also...

372
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,340
Also what?

373
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,300
I'd like to take one as my disciple.

374
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Really?

375
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,700
Then we might compete with each other in the future.

376
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:19,200
No, we won't. I wouldn't be able to beat you, Master.

377
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,840
There are very skilled martial artists among them.

378
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,040
How skilled?

379
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,860
So skilled that I'm not qualified to be their master.

380
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,480

381
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,700
Please.

382
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,060
I, Ye Dingzhi, greet you, Prince Qing.

383
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:52,180
The Qiulubai is supposed to be Diaolou Tavern's best liquor.

384
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,200
Come on, have a taste.

385
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,570

386
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,060
What? He's not awake yet?

387
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,680
That's right.

388
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,200
He just sat for one little exam.

389
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,980
Is it that taxing?

390
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,420
You can't wake him.

391
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,800
Baili Dongjun. The final examination is in a few days.

392
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,260
I came to ask you

393
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,620
if there was anyone you wished to befriend during the preliminary exam

394
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,160
or any opponent you don't want to compete with.

395
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,720
What do you mean by that?

396
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,620
- Just answer me. 
 - Hey!

397
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,720
Ye Dingzhi.

398
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,320
I don't want to compete with Ye Dingzhi.

399
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,780
Ye Dingzhi doesn't want to bump into you either.

400
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,020
How come?

401
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,080
Like close friends, you know?

402
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Just like how you were with Old Third back then.

403
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,560
You're a smart man.

404
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,320
I'm sure you have an idea on why I asked to see you.

405
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,440
I don't deserve such kindness, Your Highness.

406
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,280
We'll know if you deserve it or not later.

407
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,500
If you can help me achieve my goal, as for fame, power,

408
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,820
wealth, and women, I can give them all to you.

409
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,460
I don't need those things. There's only one thing I need.

410
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,680
What is that?

411
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,340
As for the thing I want, I'm sure you have it.

412
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,080
All right. So long as it's not the imperial jade seal, anything else is fine.

413
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,040
But what you want...

414
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,360
Is it the imperial jade seal?

415
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,500
Of course not.

416
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,120
Fine. Then I'll agree in advance.

417
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,640
Okay. Then I'll thank Your Highness in advance.

418
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,640
 By the will of the Emperor,

419
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,180
 he decrees that Great General Ye Yu is arrogant due to his achievements.

420
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,640
 He abuses his power for personal gain and disrespects the sages.

421
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,120
 Someone has filed a complaint against him saying that he has conspired with our enemies.

422
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,960
 However, on account of his contributions to the state,

423
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,360
 his family will be executed while his clansmen will be exiled.

424
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,240
 Ye Yu shall be taken away and sent to see His Majesty.

425
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,280
 That is all.

426
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,680
 What are you waiting for General Ye?

427
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,380
 Do you expect me to personally ask you to accept the decree?

428
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:41,660
 If you want to accuse someone, you can always find a pretext.

429
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,640
 Accusing you without basis?

430
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,980
 Reporting. We found this in General Ye's mansion.

431
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,420
 It's correspondence with the enemy state.

432
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,206
 The evidence is clear. How is this accusing you without basis?

433
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,060
 Father!

434
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,840
 Father.

435
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,400
 Father.

436
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,520
 What are you waiting for? Take him away.

437
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,000
Prince Qing.

438
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,900
Why would I want the imperial jade seal?

439
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:46,840
 Dear Luoxia. I hope you're well.

440
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,480
 I've been secretly visiting Tianqi City in Beili lately.

441
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,720
 Fearing that my identity would arouse unwanted attention, I operated using your identity.

442
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,040
 It's an urgent matter. I'm unable to explain to you in detail.

443
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,800
 Thankfully I managed to learn a few tricks from you that let me bluff my way through.

444
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,720
 I promise to visit you with some good liquor soon.

445
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,100
 And together we shall drink and catch up.

446
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,200
 Thank you for everything.

447
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,880
 Sincerely, Yue Yao.

448
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,380
- Little ornaments. 
 - It looks nice, Sir.

449
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,940
- I want the red-colored tiger. 
 - Me too.

450
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,370

451
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,040
Miss, are you here to shop or to pawn something?

452
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,740
Miss Yue Yao. Why are you dressed up like our owner?

453
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,800
I wrote down the details in this letter.

454
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,400
Please pass it to Sister Luoxia personally.

455
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,660
Don't worry, Miss.

456
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,280
Qixuan? Why are you here?

457
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,820
Are you...

458
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,700
You deliberately showed yourself to Young Miss.

459
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,620
You're reminding her that we're here.

460
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:06,300
Isn't Young Miss the real master under the ruler of Tian Wai Tian?

461
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,380
It's her right to know what we're doing.

462
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:18,100
 Looks like Lord Wuxiang has found out I left Tian Wai Tian.

463
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,310
 Since he knows what I'm doing,

464
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:26,220
 Qixuan's appearance must be connected to Baili Dongjun.

465
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:33,620
 But I don't know if Qixuan is the only one who came.

466
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,580
 Never mind.

467
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,820
 Whatever it is, it adds for the chance for success.

468
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:53,990

469
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,520
You're here.

470
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,200
The final examination begins tomorrow.

471
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,120
After today I won't come to teach you internal strength.

472
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,020
Are we done with Falling Flowers and Flowing Water?

473
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,560
Silly boy. What martial art would really be called that?

474
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,460
I just made that up. This technique was actually created by your master.

475
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,920
It's called the Autumn Water Technique.

476
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,900
Autumn Water Technique?

477
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,400
When autumn water comes, streams flow into the river.

478
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,020
The river current is so strong that one couldn't distinguish between a cow and a horse.

479
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,440
When your master was young he traversed the world.

480
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,200
Sleeping next to grand rivers during autumn,

481
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,520
one night he dreamt of entering the waters and speaking with the River Deity.

482
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,320
The next day he came up with this Autumn Water Technique.

483
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,000
Use the natural energy to guide internal strength, flowing continuously like a river.

484
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,900
That's brilliant.

485
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,900
In my mind, there are three and a half brilliant people in this world.

486
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,040
Who are the three and a half?

487
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,540
The first one is your master, the Scholarly Deity, Gu Chen.

488
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,440
He read countless books and had limitless imagination.

489
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,060
As if there was nothing in the world he couldn't do.

490
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,340
The second one is Mister Li of the Academy.

491
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,920
However, I'm not one to appreciate tackiness.

492
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,480
Because too many people admire and respect him, I find him annoying.

493
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,400
But he once tore up the Martial Ranking and claimed that no one in the world can judge him.

494
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,280
Now that's far from being tacky.

495
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,760
So, I consider him brilliant, too.

496
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,960
As for the half, it's Imperial Master Qi Tianchen.

497
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,900
He's a very capable man. He's on par with Lu Suzhen.

498
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,680
But because he serves in the imperial court he's restrained by his title, Imperial Master.

499
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,600
He's lost half his divine aura.

500
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,220
That's why he's only half of one.

501
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,940
You only mentioned two and a half. Who is the other one?

502
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,980
Me.

503
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,960
Aren't you ashamed at all?

504
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,740
Every martial artist thinks their skills are the best.

505
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,040
In the final examination, it'll be a duel of power.

506
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,260
But the rules this time allow for teaming up.

507
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,420
- So I'd suggest you— 
 - I have my own plans.

508
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,740
But if you do as I say, you'll surely reach the last leg.

509
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,160
The Academy's exam forbids outsiders to be present.

510
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,240
How do you know so much?

511
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,100
Because there's nothing that gets past me.

512
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,600
It's just you're dumber than I thought.

513
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,520
You still haven't figured out who I am.

514
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,960
Bai Xiao Sect?

515
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,320
That's right. I'm the chief of Bai Xiao Sect, Ji Ruofeng.

516
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,180
Ruofeng.

517
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,080
How come you have the same name as Xiao Ruofeng?

518
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,660
Now you've got me stumped.

519
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,820
Although he and I are both named Ruofeng, he's wind that will become a dragon.

520
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,520
People want to use him to ascend to the Ninth Heaven and transform into a dragon.

521
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,420
Whereas I'm a shadowless wind.

522
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,660
I cannot be traced, cannot be found, and yet I'm everywhere.

523
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,780
We are not the same.

524
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,400
What kind of lightness technique is that?

525
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,700
Cloud-Stepping Wind.

526
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,080
I'm looking forward to your performance on the exam.

527
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,380
Just make sure you don't die.

528
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,560
Is fighting to the death part of the Academy's exam?

529
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,820
You've underestimated Tianqi City as well as the Academy's exam.

530
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,640
Did I underestimate Tianqi City?

531
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,240
I never underestimate anything.

532
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,800
I just believe that with a sword in my hand, I'll be the one who will make it to the end.

533
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,820
Old Seven. What do you think of the candidates taking part in the exam?

534
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,260
Aside from Ye Dingzhi, there's one more person whom we should pay attention to.

535
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,520
Despite him not having displayed any other strengths,

536
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,260
his name alone is enough to conjure up all sorts of thoughts.

537
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,560
Who?

538
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,340
Zhuge Yun.

539
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,800
Zhuge?

540
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,200
It's not that Zhuge, is it?

541
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:53,980
Aside from that Zhuge, who else in the world knows Qimen Dunjia?

542
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,840
So Baili Dongjun is...

543
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:07,210
 If Dongjun comes back safely, I'll give you the antidote.

544
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,260
 If something bad happens to him.

545
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,250
 Victims of Pleasant Death

546
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,420
 will die in a very pleasant way.

547
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:23,900
Senior Lei, your concern for Baili Dongjun far exceeds that of mine as his patron.

548
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,920
It's not normal.

549
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,540
Isn't it?

550
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,320
I don't think so.

551
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,760
He's helped Old Third after all.

552
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,640
We should help one another.

553
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,040
Rest assured.

554
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,360
The current Baili Dongjun is no longer just the Baili Dongjun we can see.

555
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,856

556
00:44:04,856 --> 00:44:06,700

557
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:18,830

558
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:29,098
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫
