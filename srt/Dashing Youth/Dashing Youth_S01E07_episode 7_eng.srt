♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920

♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,820
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,100

21
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,220

22
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:49,127

23
00:01:49,127 --> 00:01:52,320

24
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,820
I'm wondering about one thing.

25
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,380
If you know who I am,

26
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,760
what makes you think you can capture me?

27
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,500
Back then, you fought 10,000 soldiers with one sword.

28
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,340
After Xichu fell, everyone thought you died too.

29
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,400
Given that circumstance, even if you survived,

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,220
you must have sustained heavy internal injuries.

31
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,740
If you are as powerful as you were,

32
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,320
why didn't you reveal yourself to the world?

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,740
Why didn't you avenge Xichu?

34
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,460
Hence, while you're still breathing,

35
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:47,520
you must have been greatly weakened.

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,360
You think so?

37
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,680
Just a sleight of hand.

38
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,640
I haven't drawn my sword in awhile now.

39
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,100
Father.

40
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,100
What are you doing here?

41
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,220
I'm here to rescue my master.

42
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,460
Do you know who your master is?

43
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,460
It doesn't matter who he is.

44
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,540
What matters is he will always be my master.

45
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,620
I was indeed heavily injured.

46
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,420
But during the past decades, I mended my meridian system.

47
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,190
Today, I unsheathe my sword,

48
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,680
for a fight.

49
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,720
Scholarly Deity. Death awaits you today,

50
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,100
so quit bluffing.

51
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,360
Scholarly Deity. Just come with us now.

52
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,420
 I am the bully of Qiandong City.

53
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,620
 Who dares to hurt my master?

54
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,220
You... You're injured.

55
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,820
He spared me. I'm fine.

56
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,300
Don't mind me. I am Wen Hujiu from the Wen Family.

57
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,080
Pardon my tardiness.

58
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,120
You two again. Why are you always around?

59
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,060
Sirs, he is the innate martial artist.

60
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,620
Well then, we sure are lucky today.

61
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,020
Dongjun. Back off.

62
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,820
You're not strong enough to defeat them.

63
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,380
Wait, Scholarly Deity.

64
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,380
Those two are powerful.

65
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,300
You might fool others about your health, but not me.

66
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,940
After this battle, you might...

67
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,260
Thank you.

68
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,780
But perhaps... this is the best solution.

69
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:42,160
At this stage, allow me to recall the strength of my younger self.

70
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,900
Dongjun. You've already mastered Heaven's Path of the Xichu's Sword Song.

71
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,620
And now, I'll teach you the other half of it.

72
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,940
Watch carefully.

73
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,820
It's called Cosmic Path.

74
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,540
 The moon shines upon my clothes,

75
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,040
 donning me a robe of divinity.

76
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,380
 Where should a deity dwell?

77
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,900
 He points at the haven of Penglai.

78
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,900
It's a land of everything.

79
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,040
Beautiful gems,

80
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,540
ethereal glazed lanterns,

81
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,100
and mesmerizing beauties.

82
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,960
You will have what you desire.

83
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,490
When the deity sees it,

84
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,620
he looks around and feels lost.

85
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,960
Sirs!

86
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,400
My sword trembles with rage

87
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
as the sunset is dyed with blood.

88
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,040
So this is the so-called supreme technique.

89
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,320
When I was young I thought I could rule the world

90
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,420
by mastering the strongest sword technique.

91
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,660
And then I realized,

92
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,780
to master the strongest technique

93
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,780
is to shoulder the greatest responsibility.

94
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:05,160
Regretfully, I couldn't defend my country.

95
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,160
Dongjun... this is the Cosmic Path.

96
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,100
You must walk your own path.

97
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,480
Once you find your own path, you will achieve what you want

98
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,787
and be famous in all corners of the world.

99
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,070
Master.

You will not be able to restore your strength within the next five years.

113
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,180
Scholarly Deity, is it worth it to perform this slash?

114
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,695
I might have enough strength for another slash.

Master. Are you all right, Master?

133
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:02,000
Everyone. May I spend some time alone with my disciple?

134
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,640
Sir.

135
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,640
Farewell.

136
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,080
Xiao Baili, tell your mother that I'll be going.

137
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Next spring, I'll come and drink with you again.

138
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,660
Take care.

139

Master.

140
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,680
Dongjun, come and drink with me.

141
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,580
Thank you, for keeping me company all these years.

142
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,500
Dongjun. Will you go to Tianqi City for me?

143
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:51,960
Brew a pot of Peach Blossom Moonfall, and hang it at the tallest point in Tianqi City.

144
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,100
No, Master. I'll take you with me.

145
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,860
We'll go together.

146
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,500
You can... You can hang it yourself. All right?

147
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,840
Why are you crying?

148
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,960
I should have died long ago.

149
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:32,840
Back then, my senior brother prolonged my life with his.

150
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,920
Even then, I am but on my last breath.

151
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,940
I've only lived because of medicinal liquor.

152
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,240
Dongjun.

153
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:52,740
When we carry a lot of things on our shoulders, we won't be that free.

154
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,500
My wish is rather contradictory.

155
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,140
I want you to be unbound and carefree.

156
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:09,900
Yet I hope you can make a name for yourself, and be a true hero.

157
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,840
Sure.

158
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,460
I promise you.

159
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,960
But you must live until that day arrives.

160
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:26,540
Dongjun, a dragon will have to soar in the sky one day.

161
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,380
A hero will shine wherever he goes.

162
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,780
It doesn't matter whether I'm there or not.

163
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,060
No. Master.

164
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,120
Remember the first time you barged into this courtyard?

165
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,940
I took a liking to you immediately.

166
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,380
I didn't think twice about taking you in as my disciple.

167
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,580
Who would've thought that you were the grandson of Baili Luochen.

168
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,060
But it's too late to regret anything now.

169
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,440
I've never acted on impulse my whole life.

170
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,600
That day was an exception.

171
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,160
 Who are you? How did you get in here?

172
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,220
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude upon this place.

173
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,720
 I am trying to hide from my family.

174
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,260
 For some reason, they hired another master to teach me.

175
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,000
 I kept running until I came here, Grandfather.

176
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,580
Now that I think about it, perhaps this is fate.

177
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,900
Master.

178
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,500
This is a Phoenix Tree.

179
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,940
The national tree of Xichu.

180
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,040
However, phoenixes only reside on Parasol trees.

181
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,000
People may call me a deity,

182
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,700
but as Xichu fell, I shall have no place to stay.

183
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,820
 You know liquor?

184
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,580
 In the future, I want to become the Liquor Deity!

185
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,920
Dongjun. Life is full of partings.

186
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:39,440
You will encounter many more partings like this.

187
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,640
 Sir, please be my master. Teach me how to brew liquor.

188
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,860
Farewell, my dear disciple.

189
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,660
Master.

190
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,000
Master. Master.

191
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,340
Master.

192
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,980
Master.

193
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,880
Master. Master!

194
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,400
Father.

195
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,880
 Master! Master!

196
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,980
- Dongjun is... 
 - Don't worry.

197
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:05,300
- He has now experienced... 
  - Master.

198
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,560
The true taste of the Martial World.

199
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,600
The glamorous Eight Young Masters are not the real Martial World.

200
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,460
The romanticism of a swordsman in Sword Forest is not the real Martial World either.

201
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,880
Master!

202
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,440
Master!

203
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:32,080
 Today, he saw the true face of the Martial World.

204
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,140
Master.

205
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:12,380
Let's head back and cure this wound. We'll wait for him to come home.

206
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,200

207
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:52,060
From today on, the Scholarly Deity who charmed everyone with his gentleness ceased to exist.

208
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:57,100
To his friends and foes, it is a tragic loss.

209
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,940
In fact, he could have lived.

210
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,060
Yes. He could have lived.

211
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,320
He was surviving on his last breath.

212
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,260
If he hadn't performed that slash, he might have lived for several years more.

213
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,820
However, he didn't want to start a war or betray his home country.

214
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,320
He didn't want to implicate Marquis Zhenxi either.

215
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,440
Therefore, he sacrificed himself as a solution.

216
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,460
Or we can follow a simpler and romantic interpretation.

217
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:36,280
Perhaps... this is the final lesson and love from a master to his disciple.

218
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,950
You often babble

219
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,320
but what you said just now was good.

220
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,200
- Was that sarcasm? 
 - No, it wasn't.

221
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,460
Anyway, Old Seven, you were tasked to investigate this.

222
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,740
Now that the Scholarly Deity has passed away,

223
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,140
I'm sure you're smart enough to come up with a message

224
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,900
that can put your father's worries to rest and allow Qiandong City to stay peaceful.

225
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,580
Which means we...

226
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,380
We're done with the Imperial Court.

227
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,420
Now, it's about the Academy.

228
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,290

229
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,820
Have you reached a conclusion, Sir?

230
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,780
You must take Dongjun with you?

231
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,320
Yes.

232
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,020
But he's my only grandchild.

233
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,060
Sir. I understand your concern.

234
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:17,020
But like I said, I came on behalf of the Academy.

235
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:22,680
This is different from my visit to Mister Gu Chen.

236
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,680
I want Baili Dongjun because I merely think

237
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,920
that he is the final disciple my master has been looking for.

238
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,940
My grandson is the one I dote on the most in this world.

239
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,960
My wish is to keep him away from conflict and war.

240
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,400
I want him to live a carefree and pampered life in Qiandong City.

241
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,440
Why must you push him into the abyss?

242
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,920
I think only an idiot can be carefree.

243
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,160
Insolence! What did you say?

244
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,320
I told you not to say anything.

245
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,680
I said, only an idiot could be carefree.

246
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,060
We all have to grow up. When we mature we cannot live our lives without worry.

247
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,880
He witnessed the passing of his master not long ago.

248
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,280
Do you think he can pretend nothing has happened? He can't.

249
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,080
Besides, he is the only heir to the Xichu's Sword Song.

250
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,840
All swordsmen in the world are targeting him.

251
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,040
Can you protect him forever?

252
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,700
When it comes to swordsmanship I fear no one, even a powerful individual from the Academy.

253
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,880
My spouse inherited the Art of Toxins from the Wen Family.

254
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,780
In the Martial World, not many are a match for them.

255
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,340
If Dongjun wants to study martial arts, he can study it here.

256
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,940
Even if he only masters 80% of it, no one can hurt him.

257
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,020
What about Mister Li of the Academy?

258
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,880
Ask him to come here to talk to me personally.

259
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,620
He's being unreasonable.

260
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,840
If I were a reasonable man, my son wouldn't be like this.

261
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:10,100
Sir, I think my senior brother makes some sense.

262
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,340
If Dongjun studies swordsmanship here, he will always be a noble young master.

263
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:19,060
He can be powerful but not hardened.

264
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,860
Without experiencing life or death, he'll fall easily.

265
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,860
Furthermore, Baili Dongjun is now the target of a group of unidentified people.

266
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:36,380
Yesterday, we were ambushed by them at Mister Gu Chen's abode.

267
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,520
They are of dubious background yet strong.

268
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,380
Not only did they want to take Mister Gu Chen, but they also wanted to take Dongjun.

269
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,240
You are surrounded by enemies.

270
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,640
You can protect him once,

271
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,560
but how many more times?

272
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:12,180
I also heard from Chengfeng yesterday that those people fought with unseen techniques.

273
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,500
What a dilemma.

274
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,020
Sir, you traveled far away to hone your skills back then.

275
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:26,120
Why? Were there no skilled individuals in this vast mansion to tutor you?

276
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:36,180
Tianqi City is certainly a competitive city. However...

277
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,460
It is also the best stage for the young to make achievements.

278
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,500
I have faith in Baili Dongjun.

279
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,720
You are right, but I do not agree with it.

280
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,900
How about this? We'll ask Dongjun about his opinion.

281
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,880
Father.

282
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,740
Wise choice, Sir.

283
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,640
Sirs, bad news. Young Master took a horse and ran away.

284
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,680
Great! Well done!

285
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,780
Sir.

286
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,230
If I did not want him to head to Tianqi City,

287
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,820
I wouldn't have wasted your time here.

288
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,620
Where did he go? Did he leave the city?

289
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,260
No. He said he wanted to travel around Qiandong City.

290
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,520
Forgive me.

291
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,140
Never mind.

292
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,140
Let's take a look.

293
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,900
Young Master Baili, where are you going?

294
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,100
Nowhere. I just want to ride a horse.

295
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,280
I have fresh red date cakes. Catch it.

296
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,540
Young Master Baili, how long will you ride?

297
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,740
Until sunset, until the stars appear,

298
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,580
until this steed explores the whole of Qiandong City.

299
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,380

300
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,140
Captain, should we go after him?

301
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,740
Yes.

302
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,740
Go slowly. Don't catch up to him.

303
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,640
Come on, Captain. You've never caught up to him either.

304
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,400
I don't care. But this time, we can't catch up to him.

305
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,080
This time, we're tailing him to protect him.

306
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,560
He's a steed that will not be easily tamed.

307
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,800
It seems like he already knows if he's heading to Tianqi City or not.

308
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,640
Some people are like that. He joins the army and becomes a general.

309
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,520
He studies hard and becomes the top scholar.

310
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,460
And if he practices martial arts, he will become the strongest martial artist.

311
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:32,140
No need to ask what he can do. It all depends on what he wants to do.

312
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:37,860
With a promising heir like that, what are you afraid of, Sirs?

313
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,380
Your Highness.

314
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:49,420
Are you sure you're taking Dongjun away only for the Academy?

315
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,600
Yes.

316
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,200
All right.

317
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:59,460
Dongjun is heading to Tianqi City. But I don't want him involved in state affairs.

318
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,160
Can you give me that promise?

319
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:07,280
Fear not, Sir. I'll swear with my life.

320
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,440
 Thank you.

321
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,040
Not bad. He's decisive.

322
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,540
Just like that time when Gu Jianmen and I went to Tianqi City by horse.

323
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,680
Madam?

324
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,260
What brings you here?

325
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,660
M-M-Madam. W-What are you doing?

326
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,540
I invented this poison myself. Its name is Pleasant Death.

327
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,440
If Dongjun comes back safely, I'll give you the antidote.

328
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,500
If something bad happens to him...

329
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:15,520
Worry not. Victims of Pleasant Death will die in a very pleasant way.

330
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,220
Here I go. Tianqi!

331
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,600
Young Master, I, Chen Sheng, wish you a triumphant return!

332
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,890
 The Pofeng Army wishes you a triumphant return!

333
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:58,200
 The Pofeng Army wishes you a triumphant return!

334
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,940
Sikong Changfeng. People might think you went to the mountains to fight someone.

335
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,600
Look at you. You don't look like a physician's apprentice at all.

336
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,320
I'm not a physician's apprentice.

337
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,360
Xin Baicao. If you call me that again,

338
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,180
I'll knock you out with my spear.

339
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,460
The herbs you want are here. You can take a look.

340
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,900
You have a talent for studying medicine.

341
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,100
You gathered exactly the right herbs.

342
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,980
Now, brew the broth using the prescription I gave you.

343
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,740
What?

344
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,340
I gathered the herbs. And now, I have to brew them on my own.

345
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,980
I'm the hardest-working patient in this world.

346
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,920
- Did you pay me? 
 - No.

347
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,140
Then you have to brew the medicine yourself.

348
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,420
Do it yourself.

349
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,060
Is there even a carrier pigeon in Medicine Valley?

350
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,100
Of course. But this letter is for you.

351
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,180
For me?

352
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,700
"Are you still alive, Sikong Changfeng?"

353
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,620
How straightforward.

354
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,820
"If you're alive, don't meet me at Qiandong City."

355
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,520
"I left for Tianqi City. Do drop by one day to try my new liquor."

356
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,180
That's all?

357
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,620
What an interesting person. Who is he?

358
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,380
Well, he's the man I told you about.

359
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,100
He's Marquis Zhenxi's only grandson, Baili Dongjun.

360
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,060
But why did he leave Qiandong City this soon?

361
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,620
I thought his family wouldn't allow him to go to Tianqi City?

362
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,680
He didn't explain anything in this letter.

363
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,260
It seems you care a lot about him.

364
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,120
Of course. He's a good friend of mine.

365
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,900
All right. Once you inherit half my knowledge, you may head to Tianqi City.

366
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,100
Young people all want to head there.

367
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,980
In fact, everyone should visit there once.

368
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,220
It's a city full of talents.

369
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,180
It's also a place where the young make a name for themselves.

370
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:30,920
Does that mean you too went to Tianqi City when you were young?

371
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,300
Back then, the Emperor fell sick.

372
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,860
No one from the Imperial Academy of Medicine could cure him.

373
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,020
Within three days, more than 10 physicians were killed.

374
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,900
My master sent me to treat him.

375
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,720
Inside the chamber was an emperor near death.

376
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,620
Outside were armed guards ready to drag me out and decapitate me.

377
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,300
But the hand holding the acupuncture needle did not tremble.

378
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,660
I cured the Emperor.

379
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:04,840
And I said, as long as the person still had breath, I could heal him.

380
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,060
Interesting.

381
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,640
I will head to Tianqi City too.

382
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,200
Do you know why he refused to sit inside?

383
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,900
Didn't he explain already?

384
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,320
He's made a pact with someone to admire the landscape on the journey.

385
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,660
Really? You actually believe that?

386
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,020
Isn't it obvious?

387
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,680
Think about it. You came all the way from Tianqi City to arrest his master.

388
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,960
And now, his master is dead. Naturally, he'll put the blame on you.

389
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,500
In a way, you're the reason why his master died.

390
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:27,900
Arresting his master and his master's passing are two different things.

391
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,790
If he can't distinguish between them, he isn't who I'm looking for,

392
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:35,780
nor is he the disciple Master has been looking for.

393
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:40,220
Fine. Now look. He's just a young and inexperienced boy.

394
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,120
Do you think everyone is as ruthless as you...

395
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,320
I mean, as shrewd as you at the age of 18?

396
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:22,860
After crossing the hill ahead, we won't see Qiandong City again.

397
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,760
When I was little, I thought Qiandong City was huge.

398
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,760
That I could never see every part of it.

399
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,860
When I grew up, I thought Qiandong City wasn't that big.

400
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,620
Travel half a day on horseback and you'll see everything.

401
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:40,920
And now, I truly feel that Qiandong City is small.

402
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,300
It's so small that if I venture further, I won't see it again.

403
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,060
Then... Did you bid your parents farewell properly?

404
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,860
They refused to see me.

405
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,540
They said they'd only greet me once I came back triumphantly.

406
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,720
My grandfather said something to me.

407
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,300
He said that if I was bullied, I should write to him.

408
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:08,080
He'd bring his Pofeng Army to raid Tianqi and vindicate me.

409
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,660
Your grandfather is indeed heroic.

410
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,500
But I won't ask him to do that.

411
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,000
That would be rebellion, right?

412
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,580
Therefore, I'll take care of myself in Tianqi City.

413
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:27,400
When news travels back to Qiandong City, it will be of me becoming famous.

414
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,300

415
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,010

416
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,356

417
00:40:47,356 --> 00:40:50,000

418
00:40:52,990 --> 00:41:01,960

419
