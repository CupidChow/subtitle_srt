00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:44,280
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,840
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,820

20
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,500

21
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,920

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,220

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,820

24
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,000
The Haoque Sword.

25
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,920
Will I be able to see the Xiao Family's imperial sword technique, the Lieguo Sword Technique?

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,480
I'm afraid not.

27
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,700
He's not good at the Lieguo Sword Technique.

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,760
I do know a sword technique called the second-best sword technique,

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,700
and it's my own creation.

30
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,900
Back then I thought that if I claimed to be the second best,

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,780
no one would claim to be the best.

32
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,620
But he still couldn't master that one as well.

33
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,020
So he went back home and created another sword technique, the third-best sword technique.

34
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,060
That's right. The third-best sword technique.

35
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,540
Out of all the best sword techniques mine is second only to Mister Li's,

36
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,580
so my technique is called the third-best sword technique.

37
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,460
You call it the third-best sword technique?

38
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,340
Nice. I call my fighting style is called beat them all up.

39
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,340
He only has the eighth-best sword.

40
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,000
How can he compete with the Wuji Pole?

41
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,980
Baili Dongjun!

42
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,400
Senior, I'm here!

43
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,540
You... Why did you come here?

44
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,900
Ruofeng, you loudly called my name just now to ask me to help you, right?

45
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,480
I called you to escape with Master!

46
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,100
None of you can leave!

47
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,360
Stop fighting!

48
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,220
If you're under the age of 30 you might call yourself invincible.

49
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,500
If you're over the age of 30, less than ten people might defeat you,

50
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,140
and only three people at most can kill you.

51
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,960
I'm one of those three people. But I won't kill you.

52
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,360
I will give you the answer you seek but after this,

53
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,060
whatever my disciple, Prince Langya of Tianqi City,

54
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,700
wants to do in the future, you have to help him.

55
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,560
Water from the great river comes from Heaven!

56
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,500
You want to know the answer?

57
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,800
Sure, I shall tell you the answer.

58
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,400
I am the one who has dominated the world for 30 years at the Academy.

59
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
60 years ago, I was the one who wielded the Ablaze and Cold Swords

60
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,860
and defeated Wei Changshu from the Famous Swords Manor,

61
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,120
after which I was known as the Kunlun Sword Deity.

62
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,120
90 years ago, clad in tattered clothes and armed with a broken sword,

63
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,480
I was the one who exterminated the Demonic Sect.

64
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,280
120 years ago, I was the one who drank, lived, and created the Poetry-Sword Technique

65
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,740
with the Poetry Deity.

66
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,880
And to answer the question you want to know the most, 150 years ago...

67
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,580
I was the one who founded Bai Xiao Sect on my own.

68
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,040
A divine touched on my head and I was given eternal life.

69
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,280
I am now over 180 years old.

70
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,060
I am your ancestor.

71
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,500
How dare you fight your ancestor?

72
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,780
Preposterous.

73
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,400
So...

74
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,700
It really exists after all.

75
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,040
You've already guessed most of it, so why do you seek this answer?

76
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,800
I didn't expect that immortality would exist in this world.

77
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,300
There's no such thing as immortality in this world.

78
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,100
Everything in this world is bound to return somewhere.

79
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,340
It's just that I've been trapped in the mortal world...

80
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,840
for too long.

81
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,920
Senior, are my eyes fooling me?

82
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,700
Is... Is that our master?

83
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,380
Why does he look as young as I do?

84
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,480
Our master is just like his name.

85
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,020
Changsheng, an immortal. 
  (TN:The literal meaning of immortal)

86
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,940
You've already found the answer you seek.

87
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,700
Don't forget my little favor.

88
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,580
But Bai Xiao Sect never interferes in court affairs.

89
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,700
That's the rule set by our founder, right?

90
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,260
I'm asking you to help him, not Bai Xiao Sect.

91
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,180
Besides, I am the founder.

92
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,780
You have seen what you wanted to see.

93
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,700
Write it down in Bai Xiao Sect's records but don't let anyone else know.

94
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,580
Understand?

95
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,160
I...

96
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,700
No. Elder.

97
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,140
I understand.

98
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,180
Since we look about the same age now, you don't have to call me Elder.

99
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,720
It makes me sound old.

100
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,460
You may leave now.

101
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,020
I'll take my leave then.

102
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,560
If you ever return to Tianqi, do visit Bai Xiao Sect.

103
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,100
Xiao Ruofeng.

104
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,020
Yes, Master.

105
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,940
Master. So your real name is Ji Changsheng? 
  (TN: Ji and chicken have the same sound)

106
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,220
What kind of name is that?

107
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,380
You might as well call me Gou Changsheng.
  (TN: Gou means dog)

108
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,960
When I was young I didn't expect to become immortal.

109
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,180
My real name is Ji Huxie.

110
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,300
My successor you saw earlier is as strong as I was back then.

111
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,500
With his help, you have a better chance of securing the throne.

112
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,500
That young man back in Tianqi who fights with a spear is pretty impressive too.

113
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,960
As for the one standing behind there, forget about him.

114
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,940
He's too special.

115
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,900
I understand.

116
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,980
All right, you may also leave now.

117
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,340
There's somewhere I need to go. I'll write you a letter.

118
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,980
If you want to you can join us.

119
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,260
Who knows, we can have a round of drinks.

120
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:19,480
Master. Was there any truth in what you said earlier?

121
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,960
Why do I feel this might be the last time I see you?

122
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,660
Are you an idiot?

123
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,960
When have I ever deceived you? You just don't trust me.

124
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,120
I told you that I drank with the Poetry Deity and you turned your back and rolled your eyes.

125
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,520
You think I didn't notice?

126
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:48,560
All right. I hope this time you're not bluffing us.

127
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,820
Farewell.

128
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,400
Baili Dongjun.

129
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,320
Master.

130
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,700
Master, don't move.

131
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,820
You don't move.

132
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,280
Help me back to the carriage.

133
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,940
Yes, Master.

134
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,260
Carry me on your back.

135
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,300
Martial Uncle Baili, why has Mister Li turned young?

136
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,300
Let's get back to the carriage first.

137
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:01,120
What happened to him?

138
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,820
Ji Ruofeng was right.

139
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,980
I am losing all my internal strength.

140
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:16,320
Too bad he came a bit early and couldn't witness such a magnificent sight.

141
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:27,300
Now even you can easily kill me, the best martial artist in the world.

142
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,500
What exactly is going on?

143
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
What's going on?

144
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,980
You'll know someday.

145
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,180
Don't worry about me.

146
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,340
I'm just feeling a little weak.

147
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,500
I'm not dying.

148
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,600
Now, I just want to get some sleep.

149
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,500
Master, don't sleep.

150
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,840
You'll never wake up.

151
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,360
Right now all I want is to get some sleep.

152
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,140
Master, believe me. You can't fall asleep.

153
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,240
Believe me. This is not the first time.

154
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,080
Just head westward and I'll be awake in the morning.

155
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,460
Please do me this favor.

156
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,000
Master.

157
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,425
Master.

158
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:33,140

159
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,260
Have you heard?

160
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,760
The Rain Demon and his disciple have been traveling around Nanjue.

161
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,420
That demon seems to be heading to Dongyue Lake to challenge a sword deity.

162
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,860
I heard lots of martial arts masters have been there.

163
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,040
Back then the Poetry Deity could kill one man with every ten steps he took

164
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,460
with no trace to be found for a thousand li.

165
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,860
Now the Rain Demon keeps his sword sheathed, traveling far just to fight.

166
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,460
I wonder if he'll become a future legend.

167
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,420
How literary of you.

168
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,900
I did hear that the Rain Demon has been encountering attacks throughout his journey,

169
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,740
but has never killed any of his assailants.

170
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,700
Only fighting and not killing?

171
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,280
Has that demon truly changed?

172
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,520
- Come on. 
 - Master, you hear that?

173
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,860
You're stirring up quite a commotion.

174
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,300
All that's left is to put a flag on you that says "The Rain Demon is here".

175
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,900
But, Master, if this keeps up,

176
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,300
are you sure we won't die of exhaustion before we reach Dongyue Lake?

177
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,020
Before you kill someone, you need to sharpen your sword.

178
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,720
What is it?

179
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,980
It's that old geezer, Chen.

180
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,060
It's the Rain Demon.

181
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,020
Disciple, go hide in the woods.

182
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,380
I'm going to fight him.

183
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,460
Is he powerful?

184
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,660
He is known as Elder Tianxuan, Nanjue's martial arts master.

185
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,500
It would be easy for him to kill you.

186
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,140
He's still no match for you then.

187
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,500
It'd be much easier for you to do it.

188
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,960
Rain Demon. It's been seven years since we last met.

189
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,600
You are a martial arts master and I am a demonic sword deity.

190
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,900
If fighting is the only thing we can do we might as well not meet.

191
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,120
Heed my advice. Turn back.

192
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,420
Who do you think you are?

193
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,240
Who are you to advise me?

194
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,500
Would Li Changsheng heed your advice?

195
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,160
I even dare to fight Li Changsheng.

196
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,240
Who do you think you are to give me advice?

197
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,360
You've been winning fights but not killing.

198
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,700
You rely on natural forces like water, flowers, and leaves to fight,

199
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,860
but you haven't been using your sword.

200
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,660
You're storing your sword qi, aren't you?

201
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,020
When you have enough sword qi and murderous intent,

202
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:20,500
one single blow from your sword would be enough to turn the world upside down.

203
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:29,000
Do you think you're clever and you can see things other people can't see?

204
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,540
If I attack you, can you guarantee you won't have to unsheathe your Mystic Wind Sword?

205
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:44,540
If you unsheathe your sword now, all the sword qi that you've been storing would go to waste.

206
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,040
You old geezer.

207
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,680
You haven't been wasting all these years of living after all.

208
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,620
All these years Beili has been relying on Mister Li to dominate Nanjue.

209
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,020
It's true that Nanjue's martial arts can't compare to Beili's.

210
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,180
If you insist on battling Yan Lingxia,

211
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:18,820
no matter who wins, both of you are bound to take damage.

212
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:25,040
Nanjue's martial arts will be in a precarious position. Thus, heed my advice.

213
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,580
Turn back.

214
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,680
You're using Nanjue as an excuse to stop me?

215
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,140
Nanjue means nothing to me.

216
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,540
Anyone who tries to stop me will die by my hands.

217
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,180
If you attack me I will unsheathe my sword.

218
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:49,060
And when I unsheathe my sword, you will die.

219
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,960
What? Scared?

220
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,140
Don't think that being old gives you the moral high ground to talk down to me.

221
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:08,560
People like you shouldn't even be alive by now.

222
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,780
So you're going against the odds?

223
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,880
Just for the title of the best martial artist in the world?

224
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,360
Starting today, Elder Tianxuan is nothing more than an old geezer.

225
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,000
Good morning, Mister Li.

226
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,480
Morning.

227
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,540
Yesterday I was still the best martial artist in the world.

228
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,120
And today I can't even pluck some fruit from a tree branch.

229
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,140
That smells great.

230
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,980
Master, you're awake?

231
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,680
Are you training?

232
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,820
This fruit smells so nice.

233
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,580
What a sweet scent.

234
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,300
Martial Uncle Baili, what are you doing?

235
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,500
Having some fruit.

236
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,380
Time for breakfast.

237
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,720
Time for breakfast, Master.

238
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:47,920
What? You're eating without me?

239
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,980
Here, Master.

240
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,240
It's too dry. I can't swallow that.

241
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,540
Dongjun, wouldn't you say that the fruit on the trees taste absolutely delectable?

242
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,020
You've been peeking at me?

243
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,920
You can only ask one question.

244
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,960
Are you sure that's your question?

245
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,060
Of course I've prepared some for you.

246
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,000
That's more like it. What do you want to ask?

247
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,900
Master.

248
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,420
Are you really a deity?

249
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,720
What's a  deity?

250
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,500
Someone who travels through Heaven and Earth and can live forever.

251
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,720
I may be good at lightness technique but I could never leap across a mountain.

252
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,040
No matter how strong my internal strength is I can only send a river crashing at most.

253
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:50,160
As for swordsmanship, I guess I'm one of the best swordsmen.

254
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,200
But if you want me to kill 10,000 people in one go,

255
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,360
my sword would've already snapped in half.

256
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,560
And that's not good enough to be a deity?

257
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,880
If that doesn't make you a deity, what about  regaining your youth?

258
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,700
You're over 180 years old.

259
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,900
What normal person could live that long?

260
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:11,380
Besides, you got younger suddenly and now you look even younger than I do.

261
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,980
Other than the white hair.

262
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,460
Fine. I'll talk about it.

263
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,380
Actually, it wasn't a big deal.

264
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,760
When I was younger I went to Huanglong Mountain and learned a formidable skill.

265
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:31,100
It wasn't an easy skill to master and it went by the name...

266
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,300
Chun.

267
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,100
Chun?

268
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,800
The Chun is an ancient tree which has a spring and autumn each of eight thousand years in duration.

269
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,840
What Zhuangzi wrote in "Wandering at Ease" is the meaning of Chun.

270
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,380
Once you master the art of Chun you can regain your youth every 30 years.

271
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:56,500
And during the year you become young again, you lose all your powers and need to train all over again.

272
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,660
If I were still in Tianqi now, my secret would have been exposed.

273
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,540
There are too many eyes and too much gossip in Tianqi so I had to leave.

274
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,960
- That's why I... 
 - That's why you had me and Luoxia

275
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,180
follow you so we could protect you.

276
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:18,060
Looks like you're not that useless after all.

277
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,580
But Mister Li, why us?

278
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,180
Yes.

279
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:29,000
Out of all your disciples we're the weakest and the least experienced.

280
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,140
Ji Ruofeng was right.

281
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:39,260
Since the cycle restarts every 30 years, I have to use a new identity every 30 years.

282
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:44,320
If they keep staying by my side, then I could only remain as Li Changsheng

283
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,820
because we've spent so much time together.

284
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,060
And there are too many things that we can't let go.

285
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,620
I don't want that to happen.

286
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,900
So I brought you along.

287
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,340
As for you, it was your master who came to beg me.

288
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,740
Someone like your master would actually beg me for a mere disciple.

289
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,460
Interesting.

290
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:13,900
Speaking of which, both of you should stop calling me Mister Li.

291
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,840
Why?

292
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:25,340
Because the 30 years that belonged to Li Changsheng have ended.

293
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:36,780
Tell me, what kind of name should I take for my next life?

294
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,140
Maybe a surname with two syllables like yours.

295
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,160
Maybe Yuchi.

296
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,980
Or Ouyang, Shangguan, Sima?

297
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,980
- Sima... 
 - Nangong?

298
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,660
What?

299
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,100
I just thought that the surname Nangong suits you now.

300
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,300
Nangong?

301
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,240
Very well! Nangong.

302
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,480
And what will your first name be?

303
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:18,040
Mister Li may have run the Academy but he didn't look like a scholar at all.

304
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,660
He could be wild and unrestrained.

305
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:29,500
In this life I want to be a genteel scholar, flowing gracefully like the spring water.

306
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,120
As gentle as the spring water.

307
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,300
Chunshui... 
  (TN: Spring water)

308
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,580
Chunshui.

309
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,440
Nangong Chunshui.

310
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,620
It's settled, then. Nangong Chunshui.

311
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,940
That's it?

312
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,990
Giving yourself a name shouldn't take much effort.

313
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:58,660
From now on just call me Brother Nangong or Brother Chunshui.

314
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,780
Either one will do.

315
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:06,800
If anyone asks, just tell them that I'm a friend that you met during your travels, understand?

316
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,980
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

317
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,500
Great.

318
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,980
- By the way, Mas... 
 - Nangong Chunshui.

319
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,020
Brother Chunshui. Where are we heading next?

320
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:24,320
There is a city known for its romance and beauty.

321
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,860
Here it is, Xueyue City.

322
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,420
 Xueyue City?

323
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,640
 That's right. It's surrounded by a pleasant breeze, bountiful flowers,

324
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,900
 snowy mountains, and bathed in moonlight.

325
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,620
 To get to Xueyue City we need to go through Dengtian Tower.

326
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,040
 Beyond the tower is nothing but the mortal world.

327
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:58,640
 But once you reach the top of the tower, you will witness what beauty truly means.

328
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,980
 It will be a long journey.

329
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,500
 We can take this opportunity to travel around the world.

330
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,740
 Brother Chunshui, does Xueyue City really exist?

331
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,280
Are you just making it up? I've never heard of it.

332
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,500
There are many things that you've never heard of.

333
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,700
Anything can happen in this wild and wide world.

334
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,600
Even the Emperor of Beili doesn't know how many cities there are in this world, let alone you.

335
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,380
As for that sword technique your master taught you, Mist and Clouds Sword Dance,

336
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,260
I taught him that when he first became my disciple.

337
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,620
Now that he has taught you, I see that it suits you.

338
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,640
Keep practicing. Ask me if you have any questions.

339
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,660
Thank you, Brother Chunshui.

340
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,500
By the way, forget about what your master does when showing up.

341
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,600
That is embarrassing.

342
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,260
- Oh my. 
 - Yes.

343
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,400
Then don't tell my master.

344
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,280
Don't worry.

345
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,180
As for you...

346
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,080
What about me?

347
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,260
Are you still trying to teach me martial arts given your current state?

348
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,340
I may have lost my powers but the techniques are imprinted in my mind.

349
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,180
As for you, you have such incredible internal strength,

350
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,760
peerless swordsmanship, and a body strengthened by medicinal liquor,

351
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,160
but why are you still so weak?

352
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,040
Teach me if you must, but don't insult me.

353
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:42,360
Think about it. If someone can't walk, yet he knows how to fly.

354
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,900
How high and far do you think he can fly?

355
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,460
Take this.

356
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,940
- What's this? 
 - A manual of the peerless martial arts.

357
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,640
"19 Embroidery Sword Techniques?"

358
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,080
 Young Master, you have good taste.

359
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,000
 This is our best-selling sword manual.

360
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,060
 How much is it?

361
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,480
 Only three wen.I deal honestly with my customers.

362
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,578
19 Embroidery Sword Techniques?

363
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:12,700
Are you sure this is a manual of peerless martial arts?

364
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,060
Isn't this a random cheap book from the roadside?

365
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:22,100
I had a friend who learned only from this random cheap book bought from the roadside.

366
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,960
 That sword technique looks dumb. Why are you still practicing it?

367
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,240
 Because I'm poor and all I could afford was that manual.

368
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,540
 How long have you been practicing?

369
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,560
 I've been practicing since five, so it's been 17 years.

370
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,720
 I have to say this though.

371
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:57,600
 Even the most mediocre sword technique can reveal its true essence once you practice it thousands of times.

372
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,300
 As they say, even tiny grains of sand can form a majestic tower

373
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,360
 and water constantly dripping wears holes in stone.

374
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,120
Even tiny grains of sand can form a majestic tower. And water constantly dripping wears holes in stone?

375
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,060
Why does that sound so self-delusional?

376
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,720
By the way, what happened to him afterward?

377
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,440
He must have been a nobody for life.

378
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,000
A nobody?

379
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,200
That friend of mine created a peerless sword technique based on these mediocre sword techniques.

380
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,240
He named his sword technique Lieguo.

381
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,640
Lieguo?

382
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,660
Isn't that the Xiao Family's inherited sword technique?

383
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,820
Exactly. That friend of mine was the man who wielded the ultimate sword, Tianzhan,

384
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,980
had thousands of soldiers under his command, subsequently built his own empire

385
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,960
and became known as the Founding Emperor of Beili, Emperor Tianwu,

386
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,160
Xiao Yi.

387
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,080
Are you making this story up?

388
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,820
Believe it or not, it's your choice.

389
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,840
What he's trying to tell you is your Xichu's Sword Song may be fantastic,

390
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,740
but there are many other incredible sword techniques.

391
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:41,140
In fact, some of them are too delicate to the point that it's hard to unleash its power.

392
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:47,700
What you should do is to make these 19 Embroidery Sword Techniques into part of your Xichu's Sword Song.

393
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,320
The sword is in your hands.

394
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,440
Even the most mediocre sword technique can turn into the most magnificent technique.

395
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,500
Not bad. Not bad.

396
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,340
"19 Embroidery Sword Techniques."

397
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,040
Practice it hard.

398
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,900
Is that how it really works?

399
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,840
Junior Niece.

400
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,560
Junior Niece.

401
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,160
What are you thinking about? You seem engrossed.

402
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,200
Nothing. Maybe I'm just tired.

403
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,020
You're tired?

404
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,300
Brother Chunshui, we're going to take a break at the creek up ahead.

405
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,460
 Young Lady, Second Young Lady is here.

406
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,280
 She wishes to meet you.

407
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,740
Martial Uncle Baili.

408
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,160
Brother Chunshui.

409
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,640
I... I'm going to find some wild fruit.

410
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,040
Why don't I go instead? You shouldn't be doing such work.

411
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,840
Martial Uncle Baili, you're more powerful than I am

412
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,400
so it's better that you stay and guard Brother Chunshui.

413
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,140
Well, thank you. Come back soon.

414
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,780
All right.

415
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,880
Why don't I create my own sword technique?

416
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,320
It'd be better than this mediocre sword technique.

417
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,360
I've told you countless times.

418
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,560
This is not a mediocre sword technique.

419
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,880
Someone once turned it into a sword technique worthy of a sword deity.

420
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,080
He had practiced for 19 years before he became famous.

421
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,020
I don't have that much time to wait. I'd be almost 40 by then.

422
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,760
What's the point?

423
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,320
- Are you so desperate to become famous? 
 - Of course.

424
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,120
I made a promise.

425
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,320
She said she would come and find me when I became famous.

426
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,280
So I can't make her wait.

427
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,000
Women.

428
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,380
She is not an ordinary woman. She's the prettiest lady in my heart.

429
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:59,580
Of course, I've only met her twice so I wouldn't say we're in love.

430
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:04,639
But I believe that when I become famous and meet her again,

431
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:09,566
that will be the true beginning of our story.

432
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,660
What if you realize that she's not a good person?

433
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,760
What do you mean by that?

434
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,920
I mean, what if the lady you fancy and the way you met were actually staged,

435
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,140
and what you presume as love at first sight may have been her plan all along?

436
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,920
You must be joking.

437
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,380
Even if she could arrange our encounter, how could she predict my feelings for her?

438
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:03,240
Only I can decide whether I can fall in love with someone at first sight.

439
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,340
What if you are on the different sides and the public sees her as an evil person?

440
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:16,660
I would love only her, not the general public or her position.

441
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,926
Well said.

442
00:40:19,926 --> 00:40:24,680
But what if she's an atrocious demon who kills the innocent?

443
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,720
I can accept your previous presumptions but not the last one.

444
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:35,880
That's because the lady I fancy would never be like what you described.

445
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,320
Are you that certain?

446
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,800
It's because she has a pure gaze nestled between her elegant brows.

447
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,920
I read that one's looks reflects one's personality.

448
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,840
That's why...

449
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,440
she would never be like that.

450
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,700
19 Embroidery Sword Techniques. I've finished practicing all 19 moves.

451
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,670
 Li Changsheng.

452
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,040
 You really took on a good disciple

453
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,260
Little Sister.

454
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,180
Older Sister.

455
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,760
Why have you come here?

456
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,520
I came to meet you.

457
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,640
Sister. Is the man with you Baili Dongjun,

458
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,080
the one who made you give up on restoring our nation?

459
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,940
Sister. I have never given up on restoring our nation

460
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,680
or even let Baili Dongjun make me give up— 
 - I understand.

461
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,400
I understand.

462
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,940
You're just trying to avoid another battle.

463
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,200
I know about that.

464
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,800
Sister...

465
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,000
I do understand everything.

466
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,960
Sister, let's not talk about that.

467
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,020
I've heard that you're traveling with the best martial artist, Li Changsheng.

468
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,440
I'd love to see him in person. Where is he?

469
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,580
He...

470
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,240
He had something to attend to,

471
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,220
so he's gone elsewhere.

472
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,460
I see. Sister, is it inconvenient for you to separate from your group?

473
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,080
Head back now. I need to go, too.

474
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,560
Sister, I'm leaving.

475
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,540
Sister.

476
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,400
I still owe everyone an explanation.

477
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,560
Once I settle everything here, I will accept my punishment at Tian Wai Tian.

478
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,560
Have you found the other path that you mentioned before?

479
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:30,680
I am somewhat aware of it.

480
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,460
That's good. Whether I get to join your journey or not,

481
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,080
I hope that all your wishes can be fulfilled.

482
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,540
Also, no matter what happens,

483
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,040
I will never harm you, not one bit.

484
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,560
Second Young Lady, did you come here just to meet your sister?

485
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,600
Of course not.

486
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,080
Even if Yue Yao can't take Baili Dongjun back, it's fine.

487
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,140
I will...

488
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,020
definitely take Ye Dingzhi back.

489
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,812

490
00:44:20,812 --> 00:44:22,820

491
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:35,130

492
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:46,357
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

493
00:44:46,357 --> 00:44:54,060
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

494
00:44:54,060 --> 00:45:04,000
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

495
00:45:04,747 --> 00:45:12,100
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

496
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,080
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

497
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,340
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

498
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,580
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

499
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:26,240
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

500
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,720
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

501
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,780
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

502
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:35,300
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

503
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:39,720
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

504
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,080
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

505
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,380
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

506
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,960
♫  I met you  ♫

507
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:37,516
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

508
00:46:37,516 --> 00:46:45,040
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

509
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:54,900
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

510
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:03,020
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

511
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,980
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

512
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,380
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

513
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:12,724
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

514
00:47:12,724 --> 00:47:17,340
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

515
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,773
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

516
00:47:20,773 --> 00:47:23,802
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

517
00:47:23,802 --> 00:47:26,260
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

518
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,620
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

519

♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

520
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,420
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

521
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:44,020
♫  I met you  ♫
