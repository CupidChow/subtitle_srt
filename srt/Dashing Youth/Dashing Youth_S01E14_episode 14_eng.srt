1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:15,110

2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,840
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,300
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,440
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,540
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,820
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,640
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,620
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,240
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,920
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,500

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,020

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,271

23
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,820

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,200
Not bad.

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,700
You have achieved some success in the Mist and Clouds Sword Dance.

26
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,390
I remember practicing the Sleeve Swordplay when I was young too.

27
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,970
Watching you today reminds me of my younger self.

28
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:30,470
Master, you're still quite young now and as otherworldly as ever.

29
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,610
People as graceful as us must learn the most beautiful martial arts.

30
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:42,040
Then we must be stunningly magnificent every time we make an appearance.

31
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,480
Like you?

32
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,980
With handsome men carrying the palanquin, maidservants leading the way,

33
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,570
and a light veil hanging down covering half of your face?

34
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,980
That's now. When I was younger...

35
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,610
I was financially strained.

36
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,770
I couldn't afford palanquins or maidservants.

37
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,640
Then how did you make an appearance back then?

38
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,830
Watch carefully.

39
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,220
When people as graceful as us make an appearance,

40
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,770
first of all, there must be a sound and an aesthetic mood.

41
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,490
With your hands behind your back, land yourself elegantly,

42
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,570
revealing your transcendent back before turning your head slightly.

43
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,210
- For a self-introduction? 
 - No.

44
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,700
This is just what comes first.

45
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,660
Wait until everyone exclaims, then in a leisurely tone you say,

46
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:53,490
"I apologize for being late. If you want to do anything here, you'll need to defeat me first."

47
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:59,020
However Master, what do I do if they're not impressed?

48
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,960
Just wait.

49
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,340
There will definitely be those who are amazed.

50
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,730
Then, just don't say anything else.

51
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:22,200
Show a few moves and defeat your opponent before you turn around,

52
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,130
stand sideways, and say,

53
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,460
"I am..."

54
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,030
"I am..."

55
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,250
"Young Master Liu Yue."

56
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,370
"Fairy... Luoxia?"

57
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,170
That's right, exactly. You practice it now.

58
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,000
In front of you?

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,940
Of course. Is that a problem?

60
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,230
It's really... embarrassing.

61
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,000
What's there to be embarrassed about?

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,340
You can ask for advice from your martial uncle, Luo Xuan.

63
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,320
This is called "style."

64
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,280
It's not being pretentious. Don't feel pressured.

65
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,830
Yes, Master!

66
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,560
All right. I'm leaving. You keep practicing.

67
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,360
I am Fairy Luoxia.

68
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,790
I am Fairy Luoxia.

69
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:43,180
I am... Fairy Luoxia.

70
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,130
This is too embarrassing. Why am I actually practicing?

71
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,320
Right.

72
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,390
Why am I...

73
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,100
actually practicing?

74
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:22,125

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,790
Miss.

76
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,370
You've become a disciple of the Academy. What now?

77
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,090
Do you still remember Tian Wai Tian?

78
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:57,030
I didn't act according to the plan that day, so your anger towards me makes sense.

79
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,730
Miss, not at all. I dare not.

80
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,107
I was going to look for you after walking Baili Dongjun to Qinglong Gate that day,

81
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:12,340
but I didn't expect that Master Liu Yue would take me in.

82
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,760
I came to see you today as soon as I found an opportunity.

83
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,960
But why didn't you take Baili Dongjun to the path Yuji was on that day?

84
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,470
After several assassination attempts that day,

85
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,960
Baili Dongjun's nerves had reached a state of extreme tension.

86
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,390
If he went down that path and met Yuji, was defeated, and then taken by us,

87
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,640
with his temperament, Xunian Technique aside,

88
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,320
I was afraid he'd find an opportunity to go down with us.

89
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,790
This was the first reason.

90
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,690
Secondly,

91
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,610
I was wondering...

92
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,050
if this was the only way to restore our nation.

93
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,030
What do you mean?

94
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,910
It's not that

95
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,250
I have a better plan yet.

96
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,080
We'll talk about it later.

97
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,390
Qixuan, I have to go now.

98
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,130
I'll continue to observe Baili Dongjun.

99
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,270
Once I decide what to do, I'll contact you.

100
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,570
As for Yuji, please help me explain this to him.

101
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,130
Miss.

102
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,980
Is there anything else?

103
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,690
 Should I tell you that there's another natural martial artist?

104
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,070
Nothing.

105
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,180
Please take good care of yourself, Young Miss.

106
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,420
 Is this the only way to restore our nation?

107
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,450
Miss.

108
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,440
What exactly are you planning to do?

109
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,450
Disciple.

110
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,900
Master?

111
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,230
That's enough.

112
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,900
It seems today is not a good day for playing GO.

113
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,030
You should go rest early.

114
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,980
Master...

115
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,210
Do you think I'd ask you where you were?

116
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,020
What does that have to do with me?

117
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,180
I was just bored and wanted to play GO with you.

118
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,140
Master...

119
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,540
Now can you focus on playing GO?

120
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,100
Come on. Let's play.

121
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,460
That's more like it.

122
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,280
 Brother Yun, this is for you!

123
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,700
 What's this?

124
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,280
 My mother started teaching me needlework.

125
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,720
 This is the first pouch I embroidered.

126
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,620
 Wenjun, this is so beautiful. I like it very much.

127
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:51,300
 Even if I could have predicted everything, I couldn't have foreseen our reunion to be like this.

128
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,060
 Can you tell me about the world outside?

129
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,440
 Once you're done, I'll let you go.

130
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,880
 I have been staying here for a long time.

131
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,280
 Like this dish, Caged Bird,

132
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:24,940
 I am caged. But I long for... the world outside.

133
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,940
 I wonder if I suggested taking her out of here, would she be willing.

134
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,260
You're back.

135
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,760
I met Young Miss today.

136
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,040
What was her explanation?

137
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,100
I'll explain the details to you later.

138
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,980
However, there's one thing that we can confirm.

139
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,680
She hasn't betrayed Tian Wai Tian.

140
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,420
That's good.

141
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,640
Are there any other instructions from Lord Wuxiang?

142
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,340
He instructed us to give a great gift...

143
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,120
to the imperial family of Beili.

144
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,540
What? You're saying that Ye Dingzhi is Ye Yun?

145
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,340
You mean the son of Ye Yu?

146
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,580
No wonder he didn't want the imperial jade seal.

147
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,860
No wonder he said I could definitely provide him with what he wants.

148
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,200
What he wants... is my life.

149
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,500
Saddle the horses. Now!

150
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,380
I'm going to the palace.

151
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,100
Good morning, Ye Dingzhi.

152
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,260
Good morning, Miss.

153
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,540
You weren't done with the previous story.

154
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,100
We'll talk about the Buddhist States today.

155
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,700
Sure.

156
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,000
Give me a minute. I'll go wash my face.

157
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,360
♫  The cool breeze has died  ♫

158
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,300
♫  The sparrows flit through the forest singing  ♫

159
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,860
♫  The clouds obscure the view, as if still in a dream not yet awake  ♫

160
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:20,660
♫  The clouds obscure the view, as if still in a dream not yet awake  ♫

161
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,000
♫  Seems there are countless beautiful moments to enjoy  ♫

162
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,680
♫  Alone, gazing at the vast ocean fading into mulberry fields  ♫

163
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,897
♫  Traveling alone is simply about looking at the vast  sea to the ever-changing world  ♫

164
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:31,957
♫  Until a single red leaf embraces the passing years/i&gt; ♫

165
00:17:31,957 --> 00:17:34,177
♫  Until a single red leaf embraces the passing years/i&gt; ♫

166
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:38,757
♫  Only then can one appreciate the beauty of seasons  ♫

167
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,634
Sorry to keep you waiting.

168
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,547
What's the matter?

169
00:17:47,547 --> 00:17:50,517
N-Nothing.

170
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:54,597
You're not cold... from the water?

171
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:56,563
I'm not afraid of the cold.

172
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,837
Let's talk about the Buddhist States.

173
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:05,977
One must pass by a city named Biluo City to go to the 32 Buddhist States in the Western Regions.

174
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:10,377
On the way to Biluo City one will pass through a small city called Sangu City.

175
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:14,337
A town visited repeatedly by, and full of stunning beauties.

176
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:18,437
- When you visit... 
 - Wait, there are a lot of beautiful women?

177
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:20,160
Yes.

178
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,100
I don't want to hear about it. Next story.

179
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,420
Then, let me tell you about the characteristics of Sangu City.

180
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,120
Sangu City is actually established by merchants.

181
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,660
There are plenty of gambling houses. The largest one is called Belle Manor.

182
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,140
Beauties again? Can't we skip this?

183
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,940
- I'm talking about the gambling house. 
 - Why is it called Belle Manor then?

184
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,600
Because there are many belles there.

185
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,740
The person in charge of the largest gambling house is a top courtesan named Tiannu.

186
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,820
Even a courtesan has appeared.

187
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,280
I-I'll stop talking about it. That's what I heard from others.

188
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,800
I've never been to Belle Manor.

189
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,060
After passing through Sangu City, you'll arrive at Biluo City.

190
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,420
This city has a very big temple named Jiulong Temple.

191
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,180
Accessories for sale.

192
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,700
Xuan'er. Is the book that interesting?

193
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,100

194
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,740
Mister Li.

195
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,640
You haven't answered my question yet.

196
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,000
There are countless books in the world.

197
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,980
Even if I read non-stop without resting until the moment of my death,

198
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,360
I still couldn't finish reading all of them.

199
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,200
For me, this will be my biggest regret.

200
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,820
To make it less regretful, I can only seize the time to read more books.

201
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,460
Some people become bookworms from reading too much.

202
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,000
However, if one reads so many books that a hundred bookworms combined couldn't surpass the amount,

203
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,700
then perhaps one could become a Scholarly Deity.

204
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,160
Child, your master isn't as good as me.

205
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,820
He doesn't know martial arts nor does he have fame.

206
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,060
You might as well take me as your master.

207
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,560
How about this? I'll make an exception for you.

208
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,660
Although I've already accepted my last disciple,

209
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,860
you can still become my last, last disciple ever.

210
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,100
You'll be the real last one. What do you think?

211
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,020
I don't want to.

212
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,300
You read less than my master.

213
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,340
Who said? I'm at least twice his age.

214
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,740
I've walked past more bridges than the roads he has travelled.

215
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,947
The books I have read are definitely...

216
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:41,400
slightly more than the ones he read 20 years ago.

217
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,220
I have better martial arts skills than him.

218
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,500
I can learn martial arts from books.

219
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,400
You are probably the only person in this world who refuses to be my disciple.

220
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,660
That's not right, Mister Li.

221
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,160
Go ask the farmers in the fields, the courtesans in brothels,

222
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,200
or the wealthy men lounging in their homes.

223
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,900
They probably aren't willing to be your disciple.

224
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,780
Each person has their own way of living.

225
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,420
Not everyone has an interest in earning a reputation through swordsmanship.

226
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,820
Fine, fine. I can't argue with you.

227
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,320
You didn't forget anything for your trip, did you?

228
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,580
No worries, Mister Li. I didn't.

229
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,420
Good, good.

230
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,780
Let's go. I'll give a reception in your honor.

231
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,180
Let's go.

232
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080

233
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:34,760
Seniors, have the two of you ever seen each other face-to-face with no veils?

234
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,880
Junior, this isn't called a veil.

235
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,620
Young Junior.

236
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,580
You should read more books.

237
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,460
Stop avoiding the important issues.

238
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,900
By the way, isn't this the banquet to celebrate my initiation?

239
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,980
We're here at Diaolou Tavern which I've been thinking of visiting.

240
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,080
Will there be Qiulubai?

241
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,900
Qiulubai is only available once a month.

242
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,960
I'm afraid there won't be any today.

243
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,500
Such a pity.

244
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,960
If I'd known, I would have asked Master to keep some for me.

245
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,820
By the way, aren't we going to ask Master to join us?

246
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,220
Young Junior.

247
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,160
We don't usually call him to join us on these occasions.

248
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,540
What occasion?

249
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,140
Why?

250
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,080
The less you know, the better.

251
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,340
Didn't I already tell you not to come in unless I asked for you?

252
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,980
There is a guest outside who has a question for you, Sirs.

253
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,300
What is it?

254
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,300
Should you start the banquet when your master isn't here yet?

255
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,580
Go, go, go.

256
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,120
Run!

257
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,460
Let's drink together. What are you running away from?

258
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,240
M-Master.

259
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,840
Sit.

260
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,380
Xuan'er, have a seat, too.

261
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,820
Sorry for disturbing you.

262
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,260
Xie Xuan. It's been a while.

263
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,800
Lei'er, this is...

264
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,400
So rude. Have a guess.

265
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,040
Do you really think I didn't know?

266
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,000
Since you all know him, and Master invited him,

267
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,700
among the Eight Young Masters of Beili,

268
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,540
apart from Senior Wuming whom I've never met

269
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,940
and Third Senior Gu who is far away on the Xinan Circuit,

270
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,720
only Young Maser Qingxiang remains.

271
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,240
Pretty smart, Young Dongba.

272
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,700
It has been awhile since I had a drink with you all.

273
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,180
Such a splendid banquet, Old Seven you're treating everyone, right?

274
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,220
Your new junior, Young Dongba, just joined us.

275
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,020
It should be celebrated indeed.

276
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,280
Feel free to decide how you want to drink, and I'll be up for it.

277
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,140
Well...

278
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,460
Master.

279
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:24,560
Dongjun just joined the Academy today, so why don't we... forget about it.

280
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,260
How can we do that?

281
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,860
Here, let us toast Master together.

282
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,500
Nice, Dongba. Come on, cheers.

283
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,640
- Cheers. 
 - Drink up.

284
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,000
This is good liquor.

285
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,440
Old Seven, listen.

286
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,160
The most important thing for a man at home is his status.

287
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:57,920
Whenever I went to Baihua Hall, Li Xinyue would help me pay the bill.

288
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,800
Good.

289
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,020
Senior.

290
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,460
Dongjun.

291
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:15,940
Now you know why... we refrained from asking Mister Li to join us.

292
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,940
Never forget the dreams of the mortal world.

293
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,280
Drink thousands of cups without getting drunk to attain immortality.

294
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,660
Poetry Deity wrote this exclusively for me back in the day.

295
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,380
Why are you all drunk already?

296
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,420
This is no fun.

297
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,700
Dongba, I knew you could hold your liquor.

298
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,300
Here, have a drink with me.

299
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,320
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

300
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,520
I can't.

301
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,720
After leaving Jiulong Temple you'll arrive at the Buddhist States.

302
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,280
Speaking of Buddhist States, when I was there I took a monk as my master

303
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,700
and studied Buddhism for a month.

304
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:10,420
After that, I encountered my master, a sword master from Nanjue...

305
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,360
Master?

306
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,300
Dongba.

307
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,100
Since you just joined the Academy, I prepared a gift for you.

308
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,880
Really? There's a gift?

309
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,280
Of course.

310
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,980
I'm the Mister Li who never lies.

311
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,620
Xuan'er.

312
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:51,180
Drink 30 cups of liquor in a row and your inner force and aura will be greatly improved.

313
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,680
This is no ordinary book, nor is it ordinary liquor.

314
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,480
Your former master, Gu Chen, also read this book.

315
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,520
I'm giving it to you now.

316
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,440
Keep it well.

317
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,460
It's a loan.

318
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,100

319
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,160
Thank you, Master.

320
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,980
Thank you, Young Master Qingxiang.

321
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,460
Now that we're done drinking, it's time for a fight.

322
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,200
What a strong sword aura.

323
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,040
Look.

324
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,960
Someone even more pretentious than Xuanliu has finally appeared.

325
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,000
Making a big fuss like he's worried others won't know his identity.

326
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,520
But Master, who is he?

327
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,220
He's the Sword Deity, Rain Demon.

328
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,320

329
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Li Changsheng.

330
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,520
I haven't seen you in a long time.

331
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,740
I don't think I'd like to see you.

332
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,200
He... He's a man?

333
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,280
- Indeed. 
 - But why...

334
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,560
He practices Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

335
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,658
Rumor has it the sword manual can only be passed down by mortals who borrow powers from a demon god.

336
00:28:49,658 --> 00:28:52,400
Those who practice it are highly susceptible to backfire.

337
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,125
He's an example of someone who suffered a strong backfire from suppressing Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

338
00:28:56,125 --> 00:29:01,320
That's why, despite having a male body, his face is becoming more and more woman-like.

339
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,460
Rain Demon. Why did you come all the way from Nanjue?

340
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,380
To find someone.

341
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,080
- Could it be Ye Dingzhi? 
 - You're aware?

342
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,060
Get out of the way!

343
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,040
Why are you attacking me?

344
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,920
- Where is he? 
 - What he?

345
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,200
- Who are you talking about? 
 - Don't play dumb. Ye Dingzhi.

346
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,660
Where is he?

347
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,080
Who are you? Why should I tell you?

348
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,200
I'm his master.

349
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,600
If you say so.

350
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,920
He came to take the Academy exam and tried to take my master as his.

351
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,860
Ridiculous.

352
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,140
Let me borrow your sword.

353
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,900
What's happening?

354
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,540
This is a duel between two Sword Deities.

355
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,000
It's not just a matter of moves and techniques,

356
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,480
but an unparalleled display of brilliance that resonates with the heavens and earth.

357
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:17,040
Your Majesty, it's Rain Demon's Mystic Wind Sword.

358
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,040
Imperial Father, Rain Demon must be...

359
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,000
He must be here to find Ye Yun.

360
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,860
The son of that treacherous minister has been hiding in Nanjue for many years

361
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,280
and has acquired excellent swordsmanship.

362
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,640
He must...

363
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,760
He must be a disciple of Rain Demon.

364
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Father. You can't hesitate any longer.

365
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,400
He's here for revenge.

366
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,220
He wants my life!

367
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:52,100
Although I'm not afraid of death, I'm more worried about your safety.

368
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,100
Imperial Father!

369
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,280
Issue a wanted order.

370
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,800
Conduct a citywide manhunt for Ye Dingzhi.

371
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

372
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,940
Stop.

373
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,880
Where are you going?

374
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,040
I'm going to see my master.

375
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,780
He came to find me. I have to go see him.

376
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,180
- You can't go. 
 - Miss—

377
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,160
It was you who wanted to stay and repay my kindness by telling me stories.

378
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,520
I don't want to leave.

379
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,440
It's that my master will cause chaos in Tianqi if he can't find me.

380
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,840
Miss, I promise you that I'll definitely come back after seeing my master.

381
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,620
I don't believe you.

382
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,640
Miss!

383
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,580
Miss, please don't cry. I really...

384
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,240
What a rare opportunity.

385
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,120
So are you a human or a demon?

386
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,960
Why do you keep appearing out of nowhere?

387
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,700
Li Changsheng and the Rain Demon have had three battles in total.

388
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,260
During the first battle, Li Changsheng was already a world-famous swordsman

389
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,140
whereas the Rain Demon had just entered the Martial World.

390
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,680
The Rain Demon challenged Li Changsheng and was defeated by Li's sword.

391
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,760
Due to the fact the Rain Demon wasn't famous, only a few people knew about this battle.

392
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,900
For the second battle, Li Changsheng again defeated the Rain Demon with his sword.

393
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,820
The Rain Demon's sword was destroyed so he started to practice Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

394
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,700
There were no spectators during the third battle.

395
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,320
However, the Rain Demon never set foot in Beili during the next eight years.

396
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,680
So, why are you here?

397
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,460
This is a peerless showdown.

398
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,700
I'm naturally here to record it.

399
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:45,340
Li Changsheng. You'll surely be defeated in this battle.

400
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,440
You said the same thing in our last battle.

401
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,220
The Academy will have to pay a hefty sum after this battle.

402
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,080
Break.

403
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,840
Who's there?

404
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,780
How noisy.

405
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,220
Wait, that's it?

406
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,320
Not so soon.

407
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,560
His pupils are exhibiting an unusual hue. He must have fallen into the demonic path.

408
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,000
I've read this in a book before.

409
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,840
That's indeed true.

410
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,760
However, this isn't the kind of demonic path that ordinary people experience.

411
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,320
The Rain Demon becomes a demon voluntarily by trading his own flesh body

412
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,880
to acquire this supreme sword technique.

413
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,240
You haven't changed in decades, as dramatic as ever.

414
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,800
You still have to show you're a master by causing a big commotion.

415
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,860
Falling Swords.

416
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,980
Shake the Sky!

417
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,680
The audacity.

418
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,000
Is this what they mean by struck by lightning?

419
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,480
That's a bad choice of words.

420
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,200
Where are they?

421
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,300
Could it be they were struck by lightning and vanished?

422
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,360
I just started my apprenticeship and I haven't learned anything yet.

423
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,700
It is only natural that they have left since the battle is over.

424
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,700
It's over?

425
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,200
Who won?

426
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,260
You couldn't tell?

427
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,820
- Could you? 
 - I saw everything clearly of course.

428
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,720
What?

429
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,980
Since I'm the weakest, I didn't see it clearly?

430
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,460
He's just bluffing, he couldn't tell either.

431
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,580
How about you?

432
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,800
As expected, he's the best in the world.

433
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,480
I told you before your technique devours its practitioner.

434
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,680
It's been so many years. Why can't you just let go?

435
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,260
Is it really that important to beat me?

436
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,160
Actually, you just need to go back, get some rest,

437
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,360
improve yourself, and wait for me to die in a few years.

438
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,180
Then return to fight to be the best in the world.

439
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,500
Wouldn't that be easier?

440
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,480
No one knows how long you've lived.

441
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,140
I'm... afraid I can't wait until then.

442
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,560
Don't worry.

443
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,560
It won't take too long.

444
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:59,160
I know that I can't defeat you but I heard that Yun...

445
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,520
that Ye Dingzhi came to Tianqi City.

446
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,300
I know his background.

447
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,450
I'm afraid that he might be put in a difficult spot by others in Tianqi City.

448
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:17,160
I didn't expect you, the cold-hearted Rain Demon, to care so deeply for your disciple.

449
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,860
Three days after you leave, I promise your disciple will return safely.

450
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,320
Is my promise enough?

451
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,140
I... can't see through you.

452
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,360
That's right.

453
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,960
I'm the best in the world, so it shouldn't be easy to see through me.

454
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,460
Don't worry. Ye Dingzhi is a genius, he won't die in Tianqi City.

455
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,400
I'll take my leave.

456
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:05,800
You can't defeat me in this life, but if your disciple defeats mine in the future,

457
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,860
we'll consider it your win.

458
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,514

459
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,560
Why is it so cold?

460
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,900
What's happening?

461
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,380
Why is there a big hole in the roof?

462
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,280
Why is the roof gone after my nap?

463
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,580
Right. If you didn't wake up, you would've become a popsicle.

464
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,600
What happened?

465
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,440
Master got into a fight with someone

466
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,760
and caused the hole before the fight started.

467
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,560
This is just the inside. You haven't seen outside yet.

468
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,280
We can't see a single intact tile up there.

469
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,020
This is the bill.

470
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,440
Didn't Mister Li cause the hole?

471
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,520
Why do we have to pay compensation for the store's losses?

472
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,220
- Well... 
 - Right.

473
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:23,960
Dongba. Who is bold enough to not only challenge Master, but also flee without paying?

474
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,480
We have to ask him to pay up.

475
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,840
Yes. But I'm afraid that's a bit difficult.

476
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,240
It's a sword deity, the Rain Demon.

477
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,700
The Rain Demon?

478
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,300
It seems that Old Seven will have to spend a lot.

479
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,440
Fine.

480
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,060
Take this bill to Prince Jingyu's Mansion tomorrow to get the money.

481
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,740
All right.

482
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,220
Senior, wake up.

483
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,740
Senior.

484
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,380
Wake up.

485
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,900
Everyone, wake up. What will outsiders think when they see this?

486
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,440
And you call yourselves the Eight Young Masters?

487
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,040
What's this?

488
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,200
Master caused it.

489
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,320
This way.

490
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,120
This way.

491
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,420
Oh right, Xie Xuan.

492
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:29,020
I forgot to tell you, next year's Young Master Rankings will have nine young masters.

493
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,940
We already came up with a title for him.

494
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,560
Listen to this.

495
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,980
Ninth Young Master, Young Master Liquor.
  (TN: Liquor and nine sound the same)

496
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,460
It's got a double meaning. What do you think?

497
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,700
It'll do.

498
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,080
But you woke up long ago and were just pretending to be asleep.

499
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,380
Is it because you were worried the owner would pass you the bill?

500
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,420
Don't expose me.

501
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,220
I heard everything.

502
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,880
- Have you seen this person? 
 - No.

503
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,380
Let me take a look. I've never seen him.

504
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,640
- No. 
 - I've never seen him.

505
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,080
- Take a closer look. 
 - I've never seen this person.

506
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,480
Let's go.

507
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,320
Seems like someone has become a wanted criminal yet again.

508
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,160
I wonder what he did.

509
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,960
The world now is far from being peaceful.

510
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,860
Xie Xuan.

511
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,580
The rebel is quite handsome.

512
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,260
A remnant from the former General's Mansion.

513
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,420
Maybe he was once a young general.

514
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,921

515
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:03,240

516
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:14,990

517
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:26,283
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

518
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:34,001
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

519
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:43,661
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

520
00:46:44,629 --> 00:46:51,989
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

521
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:55,049
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

522
00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:57,447
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

523
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:01,749
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

524
00:47:01,749 --> 00:47:06,309
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

525
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:09,789
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

526
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:12,649
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

527
00:47:12,649 --> 00:47:15,269
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

528
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:19,589
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

529
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:24,049
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

530
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:27,349
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

531
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:33,229
♫  I met you  ♫

532
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:17,381
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

533
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:25,213
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

534
00:48:25,213 --> 00:48:34,696
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

535
00:48:35,638 --> 00:48:42,978
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

♫  I met you  ♫
