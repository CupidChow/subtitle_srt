00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,420
we'd change Beili

135

182

183

185
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,940

Saying them

187
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,180
is like raising a banner,

00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,100
and in the end, that banner

189
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,900
will stand on my grave.

00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,740
Look what's happening now.

192
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,220
I said we'd meet again,

193
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,780
and we did.

194
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,740
Well,

195
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,540
you have become a great martial artist
on the Conquerors Ranking

196
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,420
and I

197
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,980
have become

198
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,620
a famous general in Beili.

199
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,020
I think this has been a great reunion.

200
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,620
Have I matured a lot?

201
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,180
Yes.

202
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,780
All right.

203
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,620
We don't have much time.

204
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,180
Just say what you need to say.

205
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,620
I'm surprised

206
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,140
to see you two here.

207
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,740
Where are you going?

208
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,780
We were going to the border of Nanjue.

209
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,700
We then got

210
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,820
word from Senior Liu Yue

211
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,420
that you'd be stopping

212
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,540
at Dongji Sea City,

213
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,500
so we came here to meet you.

214
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,940
It's been a long time.

215
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,260
We really

216
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,580
should have a drink.

217
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:55,900
Let's make it next time.

218
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,660
You've come all this way to see me,

219
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,260
so you must have something important

220
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:03,940
to say.

221
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,460
Yes.

222
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,540
It's no accident
that Nanjue is violating

223
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,540
our borders.

224
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,660
Now, the demonic sect is rampant
in the west

225
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,780
and the northern tribes in the north

226
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,100
are eyeing us like predators.

227
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,660
Beili is now

228
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,860
truly surrounded on all sides.

229
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,900
Your father is guarding the west,

230
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,220
we'll go to the south soon.

231
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,700
But some people

232
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,340
can't be stopped by the army.

233
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,180
Dongjun, I want to ask you a favour.

234
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,900
He's my best friend.

235
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,820
Do you trust me that much?

236
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,460
It's because

237
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,620
he's your best friend

238
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,820
that I'm sure

239
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,540
you'll never let him

240
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,020
make another mistake.

241
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,220
Dongjun,

242
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,860
I need a promise from you.

243
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,260
Sure.

244
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,700
Call me Big Brother

245
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,460
and I'll give you that promise.

are still so disrespectful

248
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,020
to me.

I've heard

307
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,780
that two months ago,

308
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,380
an army of 100,000 soldiers
from Nanjue

309
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
captured ten of our cities

310
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,380
in less than seven days.

311
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,380
Luckily, Prince Langya arrived in time

312
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,020
or they would have

313
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,860
gone all the way north

314
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,660
to take the imperial city.

315
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,860
What a worrying situation.

316
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,660
It's worrying.

317
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,860
Nan'an City

318
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,620
is so far from the north

319
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,620
and the imperial city.

320
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,380
Chief General,
why do you have to worry?

321
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,340
Everyone bears responsibility
for the survival of the nation.

322
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,900
We must be always ready

323
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,380
to fight on the battlefield.

324
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,020
Today, I'm writing

325
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,540
to request
the Governor-General's approval

326
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,860
for me to lead 10,000 troops

327
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,260
to Nanjue

328
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,900
to set an example for the world.

329
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,900
There are only 600 soldiers
under the command

330
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,500
of the Chief General in Nan'an,

331
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,300
and they're all city garrison soldiers.

332
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,740
Who has the guts

333
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,100
to talk about the General?

334
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,580
I'm Xie Xuan,

335
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,020
a scholar,

336
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,700
passing through Nan'an City

337
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,980
and trapped here by the rain.

338
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,220
What did you mean?

339
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,900
Did you mean

340
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,500
the soldiers in Nan'an City are no good?

341
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,700
What I meant to say is

342
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,300
that it's not your soldiers
who are no good,

343
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,260
it's you who are no good.

344
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,340
How bold you are!

345
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,700
How dare a humble scholar like you

346
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,340
provoke the Chief General?

347
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,500
If he is no good,

348
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,660
are you?

349
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,540
You scholar,

350
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,580
I know you people

351
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,740
see yourselves as above others.

352
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,500
But leading an army in battle

353
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,740
is not the same as

354
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,180
just talking about it.

355
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,300
For example, do you know
how to use a sword?

356
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,980
I've read a lot of sword manuals.

357
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,060
I've also read Sun Tzu's Art of War.

358
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,580
Those are some
of the best sword manuals ever written.

359
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,260
Scholar, if you know how to use a sword,

360
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,540
I'll spare you today.

361
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,780
Otherwise,
you will be punished severely.

362
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,700
My martial uncle once said

363
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,900
that one day I'd hold a sword.

364
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,740
Although I scoffed at it,

365
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,580
I can't help but wonder

366
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,420
what kind of sword

367
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,340
it would be

368
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,980
if I ever truly held one.

369
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,580
I didn't expect it

370
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,500
to be such a mediocre sword.

371
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,460
It's even a bit tacky.

372
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,220
But it's for the best.

373
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,020
The world is never short
of famous swords,

374
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,460
only

375
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,580
of renowned swordsmen.

376
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,980
Sir,

377
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,500
it seemed to have stopped raining

378
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,220
for a moment.

379
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,980
Your sword hasn't been used
for too long.

380
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,780
It can't even hold a single sword qi.

381
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,700
Sword... Sword...

382
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,500
Sword... Sword Deity.

383
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,420
Sword Deity.

384
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,740
One swing of the sword
and you call me the Sword Deity?

385
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,740
Unfortunately,

386
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,260
you don't have a say.

387
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,060
The chaos is like rain,

388
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,900
no one can hide from it

389
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,740
when it falls.

390
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,540
So we have to get involved.

391
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,280
[Man State, Western Regions, Nanjue]

392
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,260
Winter of the seventh year
of the Mingde's era.

393
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,980
Those from Nanjue are moving north,

394
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,220
the northern tribes
are approaching the border,

395
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,740
and Western Regions are in turmoil.

396
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,620
In the spring of the following year,

397
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,460
the demonic sect sets out east

398
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,460
to invade the Central Plains.

399
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,820
Xiao Ruofeng, Prince Langya

400
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,180
is leading an army to the south
to fight against Nanjue.

401
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,140
A disciple of the Tang Clan in Shu,

402
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,540
Tang Lianyue, is taken under his wing.

403
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,620
Chief General, Lei Mengsha,

404
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,860
has rerouted his troops to the north

405
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,500
to defend the country.

406
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,300
Liu Yue, Qingge, Mochen

407
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,780
of Eight Young Masters
have gone to help.

408
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,620
The son of the Marquis
of Zhenxi, Baili Chengfeng,

409
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,780
is guarding the West Gate
of the country.

410
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,260
Besides,

411
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,820
Baili Dongjun's returned to Xueyue City

412
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,700
as the head of the righteousness,

413
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,480
leading martial artists
of the Central Plains

414
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,380
to fight the demonic sect.

415
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,620
It's freezing here.

416
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,340
Here, have some hot soup

417
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,540
to warm yourself up.

418
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,460
I feel better now.

419
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,180
Look at you.

420
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,180
You're the best
on the Conquerors Ranking.

421
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,780
Why don't you resist the cold

422
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,420
with your zhenqi?

423
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,980
That's no fun.

424
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,790
Through spring, summer,
autumn, and winter,

425
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,300
with cold and heat,

426
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,980
we must truly experience it all.

427
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,620
That's what it means to truly live.

428
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,700
It's the Spring Festival today.

429
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,340
Sikong Changfeng

430
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,500
has been fighting

431
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,820
all over the place these months,

432
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,540
and he hasn't even had time

433
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,500
to see me.

434
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,340
He said he'd come to meet me today.

435
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,020
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

436
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,700
I'm here!

437
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,700
You came at just the right time.

438
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,860
A hot bowl

439
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,500
of mutton soup

440
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,420
on a day like this

441
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,540
is just wonderful.

442
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,340
Sikong Changfeng,

443
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,540
after years apart,

444
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,300
this is how you show respect

445
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,540
to your senior?

446
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,140
Baili Dongjun,

447
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,180
it's been a few years.

448
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,860
You've switched

449
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,300
from hot liquor to hot soup?

450
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,980
I'll leave you two to it.

451
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,740
I'm going to check
if the dumplings are ready.

452
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,300
I've got the liquor you want.

453
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,220
It's the Spring Festival.

454
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,500
I've prepared a few more pots.

455
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,300
Let's drink to our hearts' content.

456
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,180
I want the best kind.

457
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,020
Do you have Seven Starry Nights?

458
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,580
I haven't had it in years.

459
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,580
I've been craving it every day.

460
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,020
You're asking for too much.

461
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,260
Fine. I'll treat you to it
when we get back to Xueyue City.

462
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,340
Sure.

463
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,660
Why did you

464
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,940
paint it black?

465
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,900
What a terrible taste.

466
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,420
You've ruined

467
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,300
the Silver-Moon Spear.

468
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,380
What are you talking about?

469
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,940
It's a gift from the elder

470
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,540
of Xueyue City.

471
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,940
It's dark gold.

472
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,540
It's a good spear.

473
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,220
But it doesn't look

474
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,780
much better than the Silver-Moon Spear.

475
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,340
Why did you switch from a spear
you were familiar with?

476
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,460
Haven't you heard

477
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,900
about my fight with Ye Dingzhi?

478
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,180
Of course I have.

479
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,060
The Third City Lord of Xueyue City,

480
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,860
Sikong Changfeng,

481
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,860
fought with the chief
of the demonic sect.

482
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,100
He was slightly outmatched

483
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,220
and withdrew in one piece.

484
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,740
I was slightly outmatched?

485
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,900
Are you teasing me?

486
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,940
But that's not the end of the story.

487
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,740
I got away unscathed,

488
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:27,900
but my spear broke.

489
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,180
That day,

490
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
I used my strongest move of

491
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,500
Dragon Transformation,

492
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,420
but Ye Dingzhi broke my spear

493
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,220
with just one move.

494
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,220
I even spat out

495
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,140
a lot of blood.

496
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,180
Thanks to the bond

497
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,180
I formed with him

498
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,460
when I went with you
to rob the bride for him,

499
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,500
I didn't die there.

500
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,460
Is he that strong now?

501
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,260
Let me put it this way.

502
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,140
There's only one person
I've seen in my life

503
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,980
who's stronger than him.

504
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,420
Master?

505
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,020
Yes.

506
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,500
But the feeling

507
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,060
when Master exerted all his power

508
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,540
was different from Ye Dingzhi's.

509
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,980
It's strange.

510
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,180
I can't describe it.

511
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,100
You are overthinking it.

512
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,700
You'll find out when you test him

513
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,860
with your sword.

514
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,140
Hanyi,

515
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:26,900
why are you suddenly

516
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,060
dressed as a man?

517
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,580
You even lowered your tone
of voice on purpose.

518
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,180
Next time, at least

519
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,180
put on a veil or something

520
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,220
like Senior Liu Yue.

521
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,020
After so many years apart,

522
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,020
you make fun of me

523
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,540
as soon as we meet.

524
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,140
If I had known,
I wouldn't have come here.

525
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,260
I'd rather

526
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,620
teach a few more villains
of the demonic sect a lesson.

527
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,540
How dare I make fun of you?

528
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,580
Sit down.

529
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,580
Why are you

530
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,100
suddenly

531
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,220
dressed as a man?

532
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,740
Because it makes me look

533
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,940
even more menacing.

534
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,340
All right.

535
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,900
Your sword

536
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,460
is the third most powerful one
in the Record of Famous Swords,

537
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,340
Iron-Horse Glacier Sword.

538
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,020
Holding this,

539
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,060
even a three-year-old

540
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,020
would exude a killing intent

541
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,900
that others can't ignore.

542
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,940
I heard you were at Dongji Sea City

543
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,780
before you came here.

544
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,220
Yes.

545
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
I met your father.

546
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,780
He's still talking a lot of rubbish.

547
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,140
Don't worry about him.

548
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,700
What's there to worry about?

549
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,380
I wasn't asking about him.

550
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,060
Come on.

551
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,460
Pour the liquor. Come on.

552
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,540
Come on, here's to you.

553
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,260
Here's to you.

554
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,180
Nice. You're a good drinker.

555
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:51,940
Let's drink more.

556
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,740
Come on.

557
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,420
Here.

558
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,060
Nice.

559
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,060
Who is playing the flute at this hour?

560
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,500
It sounds pleasant

561
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,820
and not hostile.

562
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,180
Let's just enjoy it.

563
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,340
Good liquor and flute playing,

564
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,220
how wonderful.

565
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,860
Sikong Changfeng,

566
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,180
I heard you were getting married

567
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,180
before I left for the immortal mountain.

568
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,620
Did you get my letter

569
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,500
and wait for my return?

570
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,660
I did.

571
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,540
Senior,

572
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,220
you were late with the letter.

573
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,020
He's just married to a beautiful woman,

574
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,180
and he's very anxious.

575
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,260
Li Hanyi.

576
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,380
He was already married

577
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,940
when your letter arrived.

578
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,460
Li Hanyi.

579
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,820
Now, he's even got a daughter.

580
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,380
Don't drink anymore.

581
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,260
Don't drink.

582
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,540
You're such a disloyal friend.

583
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,140
Don't be like this.

584
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,140
If I don't drink this fine liquor,
who will?

585
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,340
Don't waste it.

586
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,860
Don't be mad.

587
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,460
Of course someone will drink it.

588
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,060
The guest outside,

589
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,620
care for a drink?

590
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,700
I don't dare to enter
without being invited.

591
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,460
And since the guest
didn't give their name,

592
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,300
how could the host
dare to extend an invitation?

593
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,380
My name is very common.

594
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,780
Even if I tell you,

595
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,300
none of you inside

596
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,580
have ever heard of me.

597
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,060
He doesn't look like someone
from the demonic sect.

598
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,500
How can you tell

599
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,340
I'm not from the demonic sect

600
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,660
without seeing me?

601
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,220
Because the aura on you

602
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,460
is too ordinary.

603
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,340
And those of the demonic sect

604
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,180
always claim to be extraordinary.

605
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,580
The host has permitted you. Come on in.

606
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,220
Yes.

607
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,180
I'm Ye Xiaofan.

608
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,100
I wonder why

609
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,140
you're here.

610
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,860
I, though of humble abilities,

611
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,340
aspire to to join Xueyue City

612
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,900
to fight against the demonic invasion.

613
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,460
It's not easy to join Xueyue City.

614
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,500
Hanyi, test him.

615
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,180
I've been waiting for a long time.

616
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,660
It's not good for a woman to be so cold.

617
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,700
Indeed.

618
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,220
Only the warmest man in the world

619
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,460
can subdue her.

620
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,780
You're not bad.

621
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,100
It's not over yet.

622
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,540
This technique...

623
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,700
You said your surname is Ye.

624
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,820
My surname wasn't Ye at first.

625
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,140
But where did you get
the surname Ye from?

626
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,260
There used to be

627
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,540
a lazy man in our village

628
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,780
who slept in a tree all day long.

629
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,420
One day,

630
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,500
when bandits came to our village,

631
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,700
he broke

632
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,820
a branch from the tree

633
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,460
where he slept

634
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,740
and jumped down to beat them away.

635
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,740
From that day on,

636
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,860
he became
the man all the girls in the village

637
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,340
wanted to marry.

638
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,900
And many children were clamoring

639
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,740
to learn martial arts from him.

640
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,300
But he

641
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,100
only taught me.

642
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,140
Anyway,

643
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,700
I've never

644
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,900
called him Master

645
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,740
because I want him

646
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,140
to be my brother-in-law one day.

647
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,460
His name is Ye Xiaofan.

648
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,820
So, why are you called Ye Xiaofan now?

649
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,020
Then, he left the village.

650
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,060
I asked him where I could find him.

651
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,820
Ye Xiaofan, don't go yet!

652
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,780
How will I find you in the future?

653
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,300
He said...

654
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,140
When I'm famous,

655
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,300
and you're new to the martial world,

656
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,820
say you're Ye Xiaofan

657
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,780
and I'll come looking for you.

658
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,060
So I'll call myself Ye Xiaofan

659
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,180
and he'll come looking for me.

660
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,100
If you're called Ye Xiaofan,

661
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,260
what about him?

662
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,420
He said he's going
to fight his way into Tianqi

663
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,340
with his sword.

664
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,220
He will be called

665
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,940
Ye Dingzhi.

666
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,220
Ye Dingzhi?

667
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,580
You're the disciple
of the chief of the demonic sect.

668
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,180
Young Lady.

669
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,980
Young Lady.

670
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,540
Am I still

671
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,460
your Young Lady now?

672
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,100
You're always our Young Lady.

673
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,540
Even if the Chief

674
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,940
dares touch you,

675
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,300
I will draw my sword.

676
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,220
But why did you,
who once stood beside me,

677
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,100
decide

678
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,140
to draw your sword against Beili?

679
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,220
The Chief saved Yuji's life,

680
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,900
for one thing.

681
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,740
Secondly,

682
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,660
Yuji and I have always felt

683
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,820
that Lord Wuxiang could not lead us

684
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,260
to truly defeat Beili,

685
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,420
so we were hesitant

686
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,620
in our previous actions.

687
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,020
But the Chief is different.

688
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,780
In just two years,

689
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,780
he's integrated

690
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,940
the 32 sects outside the region.

691
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,780
You also know

692
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,580
that the 32 sects outside the region

693
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,900
were independent

694
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,620
during the time of Beique.

695
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,580
It was impossible

696
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,540
to integrate them,

697
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,060
but the Chief did it.

698
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,620
He's worth following
for the rest of our lives.

699
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,420
Are all men like this?

700
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,460
They believe in strength

701
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,180
and power,

702
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,580
and they want to go

703
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,740
their heroic way.

704
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,300
My father,

705
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,060
Lord Wuxiang,

706
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,940
and even you.

707
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,100
After all, everyone
wants something better

708
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,500
than to stay

709
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,420
in this land of bitter cold forever.

710
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,780
We came here

711
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,980
to take you back.

712
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
But before we could say that,

713
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,380
it seemed

714
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,220
impossible.

715
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,660
I don't want to see any war,

716
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,980
even if I admit

717
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,500
that Ye Dingzhi

718
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,940
can lead the people of Beique

719
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,180
back to the continent.

720
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,820
We've always known

721
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,620
about your heart.

722
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,420
But everyone

723
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,220
in the world

724
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,620
has their own selfish desires.

725
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,700
I have my selfish desires,

726
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,020
so does Qixuan,

727
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,380
and so do the 32 sects
outside the region.

728
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,140
Young Lady.

729
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,700
You too have your selfish desire.

730
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,060
What is my selfish desire?

731
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,420
Your selfish desire

732
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,380
is called Baili Dongjun.

733
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:26,900
Hanyi.

734
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,700
The Ye I know

735
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,540
won't become the chief
of the demonic sect.

736
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,340
He must have his reasons.

737
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,420
I want to join you

738
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,180
to ask him about his reasons.

739
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,940
I heard that an unidentified swordsman

740
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,900
warded off

741
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:42,900
an attack

742
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,420
by the demonic sect this afternoon.

743
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,900
It was you, wasn't it?

744
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,900
Yes, I warded them all off

745
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,140
and told them

746
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,740
my name,

747
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:52,860
Ye Xiaofan.

748
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,300
I'm waiting for him to come to me.

749
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:56,820
Okay.

750
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,460
From now on,

751
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,500
you are Ye Xiaofan of Xueyue City.

752
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,100
Senior.

753
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,940
How come there are so many guests

754
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,980
after I went out for a while?

755
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,260
Yao, you're finally back.

756
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,700
I'm starving.

757
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,340
It's the Spring Festival.

758
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,460
I went to see two old friends.

759
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,540
Don't just stand there.

760
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,380
Sit down.

761
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,540
Come on, it's the Spring Festival.

762
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,460
Let's drink to our heart's content.

763
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,100
Let's drink.

764
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,540
Cheers!

765
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,460
Today

766
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,300
is the day of our sect's rise
to power in the Central Plains.

767
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,260
I hope everyone here will

768
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,540
wipe out our past shame
and never rest until death!

769
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,460
Wipe out our past shame
and never rest until death!

770
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,300
Wipe out our past shame
and never rest until death!

771
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,900
Wipe out our past shame
and never rest until death!

772
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,940
- Chief.
- Chief.

773
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,140
We wish the Chief
and the Left and Right Guardians

774
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,580
victory in conquering Tianqi!

775
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,260
Victory in conquering Tianqi!

776
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,420
Sword Deity Xie, it's been a long time.

777
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,420
How come you came to travel here?

778
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,100
I did not come as a traveler,

779
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,940
but with my sword in hand.

780
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,180
Mr. Xie Xuan, what does that mean?

781
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,340
Literally.

782
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,140
I'm the new head

783
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,340
of Shanqian Academy

784
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,100
as well as a swordsman.

785
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,500
Even a scholar has to hold a sword

786
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,620
when his country is in trouble.

787
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,060
This is...

788
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,540
The signal
for the demonic sect's eastward march.

789
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,220
Listen to this.

790
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,020
It's the first time
I've seen such a big event

791
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,540
in all the time

792
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,300
I've been here.

793
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,260
Sword Deity Xie.

794
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,740
You're just in time.

795
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,220
With the world in turmoil,

796
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,780
let's take it upon ourselves
to restore order.

797
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,100
I'm not well educated.

798
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,620
What do you mean by that?

799
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,540
It means it's time to kill.

800
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,820
Just a few of them

801
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,060
trying to get through?

802
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,340
It's Ye Dingzhi.

803
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,060
Has he become so strong?

804
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,620
I'll alert the others.

805
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,940
Okay. Give chase.

806
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,860
Left and Right Guardians.

807
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,540
We've set up Lone Void Formation.

808
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,380
Those from Beili can't get through.

809
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,100
We wish the Chief victory

810
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,700
in conquering Tianqi!

811
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:24,900
Yun.

812
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:50,780
Changfeng?

813
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,500
Baili Dongjun?

814
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:53,900
You must be

815
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,740
after Ye Dingzhi, too.

816
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,060
This fog is unusual.

817
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,620
Find your opponent's weaknesses
and deal the killing blow.

818
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,050
Even one woman can defeat
ten thousand men.

819
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,740
Loneliness is a sign of supremacy.

820
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,500
The void is a sign
of inferiority and weakness.

821
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,780
The secret way to victory

822
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,900
is to be lonely and weak.

823
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,100
Lone Void Formation.

824
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,100
You know about it, too?

825
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,500
I encountered it during the examination
at the Academy.

826
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,620
At that time, Zhuge Wucheng,

827
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,180
Lord Wuzuo from Sky's Beyond,

828
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,700
used this formation

829
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,660
to trap Yun, me and the others.

830
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,340
Zhuge Wucheng?

831
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,220
It's true.

832
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,580
Lone Void Formation

833
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,740
is one of the formations

834
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,500
in Qimen Dunjia Arts.

835
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,820
It's lost with the disappearance

836
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,460
of the Zhuge Clan.

837
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,140
It's a formation

838
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,540
with a military aura.

839
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,460
Yet, after leading troops for years,

840
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:47,860
I see none of that military aura

841
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,860
in this formation.

842
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,500
Instead, it seems to be a ghostly one.

843
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,460
If it's used for evil purposes,

844
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,500
it's no longer Lone Void Formation.

845
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:55,860
It's

846
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,780
Ghostly Formation.

847
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,260
What happens to those
who enter the formation?

848
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,380
Is it haunted in the middle of the day?

849
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,860
What you see is not what it seems.

850
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,820
Hidden dangers lurk everywhere.

851
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,380
What you see is not what it seems.

852
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,740
But what you hear is the truth.

853
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,580
When the wind is torn around you,

854
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,700
that's when the enemy appears.

855
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
This fog is getting thicker.

856
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,060
On Qilian Mountain,

857
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,780
people from various Beili sects gather,

858
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,300
unaware of the Lone Void Formation

859
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,140
hidden here.

860
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,500
Qilian Mountain?

861
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,620
Could it be a coincidence?

862
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:32,580
What?

863
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,460
We need to break the formation.

864
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,300
How to break it?

865
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,300
Locate the formation's core.

866
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,820
What kind of evil formation is this?

867
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,900
We must break it as soon as possible.

868
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,100
Is this Lone Void Formation?

869
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,380
It's said

870
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,540
that this isn't

871
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,380
the Zhuge Family's
true Lone Void Formation.

872
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,540
And it's so profound.

873
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,540
The Zhuge Family's Lone Void Formation

874
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,700
only responds to the Way of Heaven,

875
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,460
but ours

876
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,340
steals the Way of Heaven.

877
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,660
Fellow guardians,

878
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,220
please enter the formation.

879
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,060
Xie Xuan, have you found it?

880
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,900
I've found the trace.

881
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,420
Break!

882
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,200

during the filming of this drama.]
