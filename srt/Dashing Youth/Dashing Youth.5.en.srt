Ye Yu, the Great General,

He abuses his power for personal gains

I'm so sorry about that.

211
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,060

that young man's name.

215
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,140
It wasn't the kind of shocking look

216

that one shows after hearing the name
of a famous figure

217

or encountering
a talent for the first time.

218

with an acquaintance accidentally.

a skillful swordsman,

but you're also pretty good
at observing people.

372
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,500
This is a Celestial Level Sword

373
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,020
called Dustless.

374
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,980
This is a Celestial Level Sword
from Famous Swords Manor?

375
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,660
It's been so many years

376
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,180
since I've seen a sword of this level.

377
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,300
So, you went to compete for the sword

378
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,820
when the Swords Forest was open?

379
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,620
If you used poison
to compete for the sword,

380
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,660
I'm afraid all swordsmen in the world

381
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,460
will hate you for it.

382
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,300
I'm afraid all swordsmen in the world

383
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,820
will hate someone else after this.

384
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,100
I did head to the Swords Forest.

385
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,900
However, I didn't take the sword.

386
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,300
Your son was the one who took the sword.

387
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,140
Hujiu,

388
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,340
stop lying to me.

389
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,700
My son barely knows
any sword techniques.

390
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,140
How could he compete for such a sword
in the Swords Forest?

391
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,820
I told you guys to stop spoiling him.

392
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,460
You retrieved it for him, right?

393
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,980
You're afraid that Marquis might be mad,

394
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,100
that's why you're saying
that he retrieved it, right?

395
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,620
I'm being serious.

396
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,500
Fine. Tell me, then.

397
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,620
What kind of sword techniques

398
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,100
did my son use?

399
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,660
It's Western...

400
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,980
It's Western Chu's Sword Song,
Heaven's Path.

401
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,060
Say that again?

402
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,580
Western Chu's Sword Song, Heaven's Path!

403
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,940
Now, I know you're boasting.

404
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,260
Famous Swords Manor,

405
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,060
Wushuang City,

406
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,060
and all the swordsmen in the world
witnessed it themselves.

407
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,980
Maybe

408
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,660
it's more than just
the swordsmen in the world.

409
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,260
[Tianqi City]

410
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,420
[Chengtian Gate]

411
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,340
[Pingqing Hall]

412
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,540
[Emperor Tai'an, Beili]

413
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,580
[Zhuoqing,
Head of the Five Eunuchs, Beili]

414
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,260
Your Majesty.

415
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,820
Zhuoqing.

416
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,540
Your Majesty.

417
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,020
What's the matter?

418
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,940
This is the news

419
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,820
we received from the Shadow Sect today.

420
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,540
[In the Swords Forest,
Western Chu's Sword Song:]

421
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,180
[Heaven's Path, had resurfaced]

422
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,780
Years ago, Baili Luochen was ordered
to go on a military expedition.

423
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,300
He captured the last city
of Western Chu.

424
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,060
The Scholarly Deity and the Sword Deity
of Western Chu died in the battle.

425
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,060
Now, you're saying

426
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,700
that the Western Chu's Sword Song
has resurfaced?

427
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,580
Could it be that both of the deities

428
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,020
are still alive?

429
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,140
Where's Baili Luochen?

430
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,020
He already left Tianqi

431
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,660
after the grand court assembly.

432
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,300
He's on his way back to Qiandong City.

433
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,980
[Baili Luochen, Beili, Marquis of Zhenxi]

434
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,060
Who used that sword technique?

435
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,420
Baili Dongjun.

436
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,220
You mean Baili Luochen's only grandson?

437
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,820
That's right.

438
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,460
Back then, Marquis of Zhenxi

439
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,420
attacked Western Chu

440
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,260
under the late Emperor's
deliberate order.

441
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,140
Marquis of Zhenxi was great friends
with Western Chu's Sword Deity

442
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,420
and Scholarly Deity.

443
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,180
The late Emperor

444
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,540
issued that order to test his loyalty.

445
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,020
His vice general

446
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,420
was the late Emperor's trusted aide.

447
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,060
He carried a secret order.

448
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,380
Back then,

449
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,740
if Marquis of Zhenxi hesitated
even the slightest bit,

450
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,260
he could have been replaced at any time.

451
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,780
However,

452
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,180
everyone in the world knew about

453
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,740
the result of the war.

454
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,860
Western Chu was defeated.

455
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,460
Both the Sword Deity
and the Scholarly Deity were killed.

456
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,620
Back then,

457
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,340
I saw the body
of the Sword Deity myself.

458
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,820
May I make a bold assumption?

459
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,380
If the Scholarly Deity

460
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,380
did survive the battle,

461
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,980
that means Baili Luochen

462
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,220
has failed the late Emperor.

463
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,100
Although Western Chu's Sword Deity
had impeccable swordsmanship,

464
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,780
he was just a normal martial artist.

465
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,180
However, the Scholarly Deity
mastered Art of Drugs as well.

466
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,100
He could make an ordinary soldier
fight against 100 soldiers.

467
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,940
He was even capable
of reviving the dying

468
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,260
to make them fight again.

469
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,900
That sorcery of his

470
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,340
was the reason

471
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,780
why a small border country
like Western Chu

472
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,300
could stand up against Beili.

473
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,460
If the Scholarly Deity is still alive,

474
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,540
he'll be a more fearsome entity

475
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,300
than the Sword Deity.

476
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,300
During that battle,

477
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,180
even if Western Chu's
Scholarly Deity did survive,

478
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,100
I'm sure he was seriously wounded.

479
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,940
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
hidden himself in Qiandong City

480
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,020
for that many years.

481
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,900
I'll send someone to Qiandong City

482
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,380
and bring back
that remnant of Western Chu.

483
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,940
Summon Ruofeng.

484
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,540
I'll entrust this task

485
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,460
to Ruofeng.

486
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

487
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,340
[Prince Jing's Mansion]
When I first reached Chaisang City,

488
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,460
I smelled the stench of blood.

489
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,620
But I had no choice.

490
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
Gu was in trouble.

491
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,700
My surname is Lei.

492
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,980
I am a member of Lei Fortress.

493
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,060
I had to rescue him.

494
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,460
Back then,

495
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,420
I gave him a punch,

496
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:09,980
you know?

497
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,940
Mainly, it's because

498
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,740
a handsome and charming person like me

499
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,700
can't leave weak people in the lurch.

500
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,340
That's why I rescued them.

501
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:16,940
So...

502
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,220
you guys were able

503
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,900
to resolve the crisis of Chaisang...

504
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,740
[Xiao Ruofeng, Ninth Prince of Beili,
Mr. Fenghua,]

505
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,580
[Eight Young Masters of Beili]
all because

506
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,700
of Mr. Baili's help.

507
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,420
If I didn't risk

508
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,380
exposing my identity

509
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,500
and protected him,

510
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,980
Yan Bietian would've

511
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:34,980
slit his throat.

512
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,460
But speaking of which,

513
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,500
I do like

514
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,460
his temperament.

515
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,740
Therefore, in my heart,

516
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,860
I've already taken him

517
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,820
as my sidekick.

518
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,900
Ruofeng, judging from your expression,

519
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,060
are you up to something again?

520
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,340
The main academy exam

521
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,140
will begin soon.

522
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Are you saying that...

523
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,660
Maybe,

524
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,820
he'll be Master's last disciple.

525
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,100
He might be our junior.

526
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,820
But no matter what,

527
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,740
he's the young master
of Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion.

528
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,260
Will Marquis of Zhenxi

529
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,860
let him come to Tianqi?

530
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:13,900
Impossible.

531
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,500
Besides, he's terrible

532
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,340
at martial arts.

533
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,940
Only his Qinggong is dependable.

534
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,540
I was just saying.

535
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:41,900
What's wrong?

536
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,460
The Western Chu's Sword Song

537
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,380
has resurfaced.

538
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,700
And, the one who used
this sword technique

539
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,540
is the one we were talking about.

540
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,100
What did you say?

541
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,700
Marquis of Zhenxi has mastered
the Western Chu's Sword Song?

542
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,380
Did I mention Marquis of Zhenxi just now?

543
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,220
We also mentioned Baili...

544
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,300
What did you say?

545
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,700
That kid can wield a sword?

546
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,980
He couldn't even defeat

547
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,300
Yan Bietian's guards, you know?

548
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,780
Not only does he know
how to wield a sword,

549
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,260
but he also practices

550
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,100
the most famous sword technique
in the world.

551
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,980
Your Highness,
someone from the palace is here.

552
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,700
Who are you?

553
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,900
How did you get in here?

554
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,620
I'm sorry.

555
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,300
I didn't mean
to intrude upon this place.

556
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,740
I am trying to hide from my family.

557
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,620
For some reason,
they hire another teacher

558
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,500
to teach me.

559
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,340
I kept running

560
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,340
until I came here, mister.

561
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,780
You came inside just like that?

562
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,460
That's right.

563
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,580
I scaled the wall.

564
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,980
But I slipped and fell

565
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,940
into this place.

566
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,620
That's the place.

567
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,740
This...

568
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:38,620
This...

569
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,460
But I fell

570
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,740
into a courtyard.

571
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,820
I set up a formation
outside the courtyard.

572
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,180
Ordinary people cannot reach this place.

573
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,940
Since you could
break through my formation,

574
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,220
that means we're destined to meet.

575
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,100
Are you willing to be my student?

576
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,940
Mister, what will you teach me, then?

577
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,140
What will I teach you?

578
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,140
Is it martial arts again?

579
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,900
I'm not interested.

580
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,140
If so,

581
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,180
there will be no more connections
between us.

582
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,060
Go now.

583
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,140
You know liquor?

584
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,820
In the future,

585
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,980
I want to become the Liquor Deity!

586
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,740
If so, Little Liquor Deity,

587
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,260
come and have a sniff.

588
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,540
It has such a rich and fragrant smell.

589
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,740
Where did you buy this?

590
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,900
I want to buy this too.

591
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,140
You cannot get
this liquor anywhere else.

592
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,420
I brewed it myself.

593
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,660
Sir, please be my teacher.

594
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,340
Please teach me how to brew liquor.

595
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,180
Master.

596
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,980
Have I

597
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,500
got you in huge trouble this time?

598
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,140
Donglai!

599
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,340
Young Master, I'm not Donglai.

600
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,380
Where's Donglai?

601
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,500
Since when

602
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,780
did I have a female servant?

603
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,580
Young Master,
Donglai is your trusted servant.

604
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,380
But your father has transferred him
to the western courtyard.

605
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,940
I'm Rui. I was transferred here
from another courtyard.

606
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,220
When will Grandfather come back?

607
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,780
Today,

608
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,780
I heard from the messenger

609
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,180
that it'd take him
at least three to four days.

610
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,420
I can't afford to wait any longer.

611
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,060
I have to see Master immediately.

612
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,020
Rui,

613
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,700
head to Luocheng Alley immediately.

614
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,100
Find a herbal medicine shop
called Huairen.

615
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,860
Notify the people inside

616
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,260
to head in the direction of Tianqi

617
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,100
immediately

618
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,260
until they meet up
with Grandfather's army.

619
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:35,940
Did you hear me?

620
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,140
Young Master,

621
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,420
are you trying

622
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,700
to get Marquis to return earlier

623
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,780
so that he can stand up for you?

624
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,940
But I'm your mother's servant.

625
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,140
Stop pretending.

626
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,900
I'm sure my mother staged an act

627
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,620
and lied to my father

628
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,100
so that you could serve me.

629
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,380
We're on the same side.

630
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,900
Oh my.

631
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,620
Young Master, I wonder

632
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,740
why you are so confident?

633
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,140
Of course, it's the tacit understanding

634
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,540
between my mother and me.

635
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,940
[Qiandong City]

636
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,420
That brat.

637
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,180
I'll deal with him.

638
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,100
Yesterday,

639
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,980
Hujiu told me

640
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,020
that they went to the Swords Forest

641
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,060
before coming back.

642
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,700
I think Hujiu

643
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,140
did the right thing.

644
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,700
It's time for Dongjun
to learn how the world works.

645
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,900
If not, he'll turn
into a good-for-nothing for real.

646
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,940
They went to the Swords Forest

647
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,660
and retrieved a Celestial Level Sword.

648
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,580
Dongjun retrieved it himself.

649
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,300
Hujiu did nothing.

650
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,180
He used

651
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,860
Western Chu's Sword Song's

652
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,460
Heaven's Path.

653
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,340
Baili Dongjun,

654
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,460
you're something else, aren't you?

655
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,540
Greetings, long time no see.

656
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,780
Where are you going in such a hurry?

657
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,340
Brat,

658
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,140
how dare you come outside?

659
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,860
Who released you?

660
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,780
Who was it?

661
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,940
It was me.

662
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,380
Father.

663
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,700
Tie Baili Chengfeng up.

664
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,260
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

665
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,540
Father?

666
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,020
What are you doing here?

667
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,860
Is it fun being tied up?

668
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,900
Why don't you take a break
in the woodshed?

669
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,060
Dongjun.

670
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:34,940
Mother.

671
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,940
Father.

672
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,860
After all, Chengfeng is your heir.

673
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,100
I know you dote on Dongjun.

674
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,540
But you've already embarrassed him

675
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,580
and punished him.

676
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,260
You should untie him.

677
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,060
That's right, Father.

678
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:51,860
I...

679
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,060
Did I tell you to stand up?

680
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,420
Dongjun.

681
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,220
What do you think?

682
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,820
If so, we should untie him.

683
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,820
Dongjun.

684
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,940
You went on a long journey.

685
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,700
Have you learned anything new from it?

686
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,060
I learned plenty of things from my trip.

687
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,860
Grandfather, have you
ever heard of this poem?

688
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,060
"Fenghua is unpredictable
and Qingge is elegant.

689
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,180
Zhuomo is eloquent and Lingyun is crazy.

690
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,500
Liuyue is peerless and Mochen is plain.

691
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,540
Qingxiang is talented
and Wuming is nowhere."

692
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,860
Eight Young Masters of Beili.

693
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,780
They're major figures

694
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,180
that are renowned in the world.

695
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:45,660
That's right.

696
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,460
During my trip, I encountered

697
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,140
Qingge, Zhuomo, Lingyun,

698
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,020
Liuyue, and Mochen.

699
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,340
Not only that,

700
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,700
but I also did them a favor.

701
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,220
Come here, Dongjun.

702
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,380
According to what I know,

703
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,700
they usually stay in Tianqi City.

704
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,500
They came there

705
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
because of Gu Jianmen.

706
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,060
They traveled far to Chaisang
for the sake of their friend.

707
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,460
With their loyalty alone,

708
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,060
I think they're worthy friends to make.

709
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,220
Dongjun,

710
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,860
I heard from your uncle

711
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,380
that you retrieved a sword
from the Swords Forest.

712
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,220
Why don't you tell us
about your experience

713
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,060
in the Swords Forest?

714
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,380
The Swords Forest

715
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,300
is a grand and magnificent place.

716
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,380
I just happened
to obtain an excellent sword

717
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,140
by accident.

718
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:44,980
What's wrong?

719
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,260
Last night,

720
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,260
when I was sleeping in the woodshed,

721
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,300
the mosquitoes irked me.

722
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,180
I couldn't sleep well.

723
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,180
And, Grandfather,

724
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,020
you had a long trip.

725
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
I'm sure you're tired.

726
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,460
Why don't we end

727
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,220
the gathering here?

728
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,100
Let's return to our rooms and rest.

729
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,500
Dongjun.

730
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,420
You've grown up.

731
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,980
Now, you even know how to care for me.

732
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,460
All right. Go back and rest, then.

733
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,540
All right.

734
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,220
You should head back and rest too.

735
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,140
Yes, Father.

736
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,420
Father, when Dongjun
was in the Swords Forest, he...

737
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,620
I knew that long ago.

738
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,620
A storm is coming.

739
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,900
Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion

740
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,420
is able to erect an iron wall

741
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,820
to defend him.

742
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,100
Father,

743
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,820
once you give us the order,

744
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,580
the Pofeng Army will
rush to Tianqi immediately.

745
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,460
I will surely lead the charge

746
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,660
and ride ahead.

747
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,500
What do you mean by that?

748
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,620
Do you think I intend to rebel?

749
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,780
We aren't trying to rebel here.

750
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,380
We're on a campaign
to conquer the world.

751
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,140
If that's the case,

752
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,420
you have to raise your voice

753
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,820
so that the entire world will know

754
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,700
that Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion
intends to rebel.

755
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,540
This way, someone

756
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,260
can offer their loyalty to His Majesty

757
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,700
by stabbing you in the throat

758
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,540
while you're asleep.

759
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:43,820
Father.

760
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,820
Back then, Great General Ye Yu

761
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,980
was loyal to His Majesty.

762
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,260
But he was falsely accused of treason.

763
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,180
In the end,

764
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,820
his entire family was executed.

765
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,380
Right now, we...

766
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,100
Right now,

767
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,180
we have to make
a preemptive strike, right?

768
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,220
Chengfeng,

769
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,020
those who have

770
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,820
experienced war before

771
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,020
will never

772
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,220
want to go back
to the battlefield again.

773
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,020
One who knows the nature of war

774
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,620
will never

775
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
start a war easily.

776
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,060
There's no end to one's greed.

777
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,340
But the soldiers who have to fight

778
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,460
are innocent.

779
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,540
If so, Western Chu's Scholarly Deity...

780
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,580
Are you trying to say that I spared him?

781
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,660
You're wrong.

782
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,820
I didn't spare him in that battle.

783
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,380
I don't know

784
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,540
how he managed
to survive until now either.

785
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,740
If so, why did you let Dongjun go?

786
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,300
It's obvious that he's going
to tip the Scholarly Deity off.

787
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,700
We were the ones
who captured Western Chu.

788
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,740
Aren't you afraid that he'll...

789
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,860
If that person

790
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,340
were truly Western Chu's
Scholarly Deity,

791
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,500
he would never blame Dongjun

792
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,140
for this.

793
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,060
But Father...

794
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,780
Head back and rest.

795
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,380
Father.

796
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,820
One last question.

797
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,580
You're trying to ask me

798
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,340
if you're my biological son,

799
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:13,860
right?

800
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,260
Isn't it obvious?

801
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,580
I might not be your biological son,

802
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,300
but Dongjun is surely
your biological grandson.

803
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Enough.

804
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,660
I know what you're trying to say.

805
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,940
You're trying to say

806
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,900
that even if we don't intend to rebel,

807
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,180
the people of Tianqi

808
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,180
won't think so.

809
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,420
That's right.

810
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,100
What if they come here?

811
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,820
What should we do by then?

812
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,660
If so,

813
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,740
we shall wait for them to come.

814
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:05,460
[Protect the country and the people]

815
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,660
[I'll poison you to death]

816
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,540
Just look at that cunning boy.

817
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,180
Master.

818
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,500
Dongjun, you're back.

819
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,180
Have you accomplished your goals

820
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,580
during the trip?

821
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,300
Master,

822
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,500
this isn't the time to talk about me.

823
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,820
I think I've got you

824
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,620
in huge trouble.

825
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,500
How do you define

826
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,260
huge trouble?

827
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:51,940
Master.

828
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
During the Swords Forest Assembly,

829
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,140
I used

830
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,220
the sword technique you taught me.

831
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,340
But all of the swordsmen there

832
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,460
seemed shocked.

833
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:58,940
They said

834
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,220
it was a long-lost sword technique.

835
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,420
Master.

836
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,100
Although you've never told me

837
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,540
about your background all these years,

838
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,100
my instinct is telling me

839
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,980
that you are an ordinary person.

840
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,780
Your sword technique is unique too.

841
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,540
I'm sure

842
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,620
they'll come looking for you eventually.

843
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,500
Since when

844
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,500
did I teach you sword technique?

845
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,940
Master.

846
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,220
I only remember

847
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,940
that you once did the sword dance

848
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,180
when I was drunk.

849
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,580
Before this,

850
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,900
I thought it was just a dream.

851
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,660
But this time,

852
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,540
I used the sword technique

853
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,260
naturally

854
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,460
after getting drunk.

855
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,500
It's as if...

856
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:39,940
It's as if

857
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,420
it's been imprinted in my brain.

858
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:42,980
I don't need to recall

859
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,580
or even think about it.

860
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,380
It felt as if I wasn't
wielding the sword.

861
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,500
Instead...

862
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,020
Instead, it felt like
the sword was wielding me.

863
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,660
Take this.

864
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,260
Close your eyes.

865
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,580
Feel it.

866
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,420
It takes people ten years
to master the technique.

867
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,220
But it only took you one glance
to master it.

868
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,860
Do you know why?

869
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,460
Could it be

870
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,460
that I was born
to wield a sword as well?

871
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,180
Fine.

872
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,700
I don't know.

873
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,260
It's not because
you're born to wield a sword.

874
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,780
It's because

875
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,340
you're Baili Dongjun.

876
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,780
And, Baili Dongjun is...

877
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,580
It's because I'm Baili Dongjun?

878
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,980
Master, I don't understand.

879
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,580
Many people said the same thing.

880
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,060
Who am I?

881
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,140
I'm Baili Dongjun.

882
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,220
But why is it

883
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,620
because I'm Baili Dongjun?

884
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,740
You'll know it in the future.

885
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,140
Dongjun,

886
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,060
the innocent has no fault to bear,

887
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,860
yet he has to bear the faults of others.

888
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,740
Do you wish to learn swordsmanship?

889
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:06,940
I do.

890
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,100
Master.

891
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,100
I wish to learn swordsmanship.

892
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:13,900
After Yun's death,

893
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,860
I became erratic and excessive.

894
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,260
Grandfather has always spoiled me.

895
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,540
I know

896
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,660
that we have the same thoughts.

897
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,260
As the young master

898
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,540
of Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion,

899
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,900
the more flamboyant I am,

900
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,020
the more the ruler in Tianqi City
can rest at ease.

901
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,340
Grandfather doesn't want me

902
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,500
to follow Yun's old path.

903
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,540
But this time,

904
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,540
I have encountered

905
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,500
true martial artists.

906
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,420
I've encountered plenty
of powerful martial artists.

907
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,740
Maybe right now,

908
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,620
I'm not strong enough
to make a name for myself.

909
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,740
I'm not strong enough

910
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,740
to protect the people I wish to protect.

911
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:49,220
Master,

912
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,140
I also wish to travel

913
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,100
the martial arts world
with the sword in my hand.

914
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,500
I don't care about
what the Emperor will think about me.

915
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,460
I, Baili Dongjun,

916
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,220
will never be

917
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,500
a golden canary in a cage!

918
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,140
I'm relieved

919
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,260
to hear that.

920
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,260
Since you wish to learn swordsmanship,

921
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,700
I shall teach you swordsmanship.

922
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,980
In this world, apart from Mr. Li
from the Academy,

923
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,100
no one has sword skills

924
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,380
as formidable as your master's.

925
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,060
Dongjun, you should head back for now.

926
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,660
When we meet again,

927
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:14,900
I shall impart
