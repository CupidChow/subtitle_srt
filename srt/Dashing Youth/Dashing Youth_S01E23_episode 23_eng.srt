00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,300
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:44,280
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,440
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,520
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,800

21
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,720

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,020

23
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,940
Baili Dongjun.

25
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,600
It's the first time I've never heard you talk about these things in detail.

26
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,580
It's hard for you to get over this.

27
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,540
Not really.

28
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,440
If I figure it out, I can get pass it.

29
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,180
Changfeng.

30
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,660
I suddenly got inspired.

31
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,560
Come on. Have a friendly fight with me.

32
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,100
That's the feeling.

33
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,940
After watching Master's battle in the Tang Clan, there's a real energy in my heart.

34
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,760
I finally found it just now. Come again.

35
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,140
All right. You two are having a great time.

36
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,420
I'll join you.

37
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,500
What's wrong?

38
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,120
Come on.

39
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,640
Nice move.

40
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,100
Who taught you that move?

41
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,660
Changfeng. Didn't I tell you I got inspired?

42
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,680
Then I got more inspiration and created this move.

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,540
What's it called?

44
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,140
It's called... Yearning.

45
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,140
Baili Dongjun.

46
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,060
After conquering Dengtian Pavilion, what would you like to do most?

47
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,740
I haven't really thought about it.

48
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,540
If you want an answer, I'd like to go to Shangguan and get some sleep.

49
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,100
And drink to our heart's content.

50
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,620
Sure.

51
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,600
Young man. Why do you care so much about my two disciples?

52
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,560
It's you.

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,380
You?

54
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,740
I'm your brother-in-law.

55
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,280
Get lost.

56
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,580
Don't get mad.

57
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,080
The last time I saw you, you were still this tall.

58
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,900
You kept making a fuss about learning blade techniques,

59
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,860
but your family forced you to learn sword techniques.

60
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,380
I was the one who gave you this blade.

61
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,320
Have you forgotten about my kindness?

62
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,420
How did you know?

63
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,460
Was it really you? But how did you...

64
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,060
It's a long story.

65
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,300
Let's not talk about it.

66
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,180
In fact, I lied to you then.

67
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,500
Hunyuan Blade Technique works well with Hunyuan Technique.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,820
But bursting out of your clothes doesn't make you stronger.

69
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,340
It makes you more attractive.

70
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,780
You...

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,550
You're really annoying.

72
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,830

73
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:15,225

74
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,380
I wonder why you're here every day looking for a fight?

75
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,340
Haven't you been beaten enough?

76
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,700
Of course, we've had enough.

77
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,850
So, today we're here to give you...

78
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,440
a beating too.

79
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,480
So, do you think my two disciples can make it this time?

80
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,340
Just check it out.

81
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,220
They probably won't disappoint you.

82
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,100
These two brats are pretty good.

83
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,360
Junior Niece.

84
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,740
Isn't it a bit lonely to drink alone?

85
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,740
Martial Uncle Baili.

86
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,120
Talking to a woman like that at night could easily make you a pervert.

87
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,200
How can that be?

88
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:37,140
I read in the novels that it's very romantic to meet in the moonlight.

89
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,060
I suppose you don't have any good liquor.

90
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,680
After all, no one makes liquor better than me.

91
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,340
So...

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,400
I've brought you some good liquor.

93
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,300
How generous.

94
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,280
You live up to your name.

95
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,340
Martial Uncle Baili. How did you win in the end?

96
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,500
Because...

97
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,360
Because by chance, I created a sword technique.

98
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,120
Chance?

99
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,300
What chance?

100
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,900
 If they look so much alike, and yet you don't treat her differently, then what is it?

101
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,060
 People do look alike.

102
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,720
 But the feelings are different.

103
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,180
 After catching a glimpse of Miss Fairy, I immediately had feelings for her.

104
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,580
 And that feeling was true.

105
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,540
 The time I spent with Junior Niece, the memories we shared,

106
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,940
 and the love I developed for her were also genuine.

107
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,880
 If...

108
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,966
 If I must compare, Miss Fairy is like the bright moon over the sea,

109
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:44,500
 while Junior Niece is the entire world.

110
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,820
 The bright moon over the sea...

111
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,960
 captures my heart for sure.

112
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,460
 It's not that she's out of reach.

113
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,040
 Walking on the sea with a sword, one can go up to the moon in the sky.

114
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,080
 I once longed to be illuminated by the moonlight.

115
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,560
 But now I think...

116
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,600
 whether the moon is full or the sun is up, it doesn't matter.

117
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:25,500
 As long as I have the world by my side, all that matters is that we're happy together.

118
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,540
Martial Uncle Baili.

119
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,680
Martial Uncle Baili. What chance?

120
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,380
Well...

121
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,820
Fine, it's good that you won.

122
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,940
After conquering Dengtian Pavilion, you're now considered a top-notch expert.

123
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,900
You've now made a name for yourself.

124
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,920
Are you going to meet the Miss Fairy you've been longing for?

125
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,820
Yes, of course.

126
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,100
Not only am I meeting her, but I'll also make it a good meeting.

127
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,320
What's wrong, Junior Niece?

128
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,600
The moon is bright tonight.

129
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,560
Since it's such a good night, let's drink up.

130
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,400
Not bad. It has a feeling of longing.

131
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,640
What's the matter?

132
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,860
Are you missing your lover?

133
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,500
Master, how do you know?

134
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,700
Right.

135
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,820
There is nothing in this world that you don't know.

136
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,060
She... She's not my lover.

137
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,860
We've only met twice.

138
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,180
I fell for her the last time.

139
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,520
But she doesn't seem to have any feelings for me.

140
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:43,040
But since we've met twice, maybe we can meet for a third time someday.

141
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,440
After meeting for the third time, I can say some things I've kept deep in my heart.

142
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,540
I just don't know if she's willing to listen.

143
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,480
Master, it's all trivial matters.

144
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
I made a fool of myself.

145
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,690
Reluctance to bid farewell and romance are all important.

146
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,000
So, when are you going to see her for the third time?

147
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,360
I don't know.

148
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,820
Perhaps when I venture into the Martial World again,

149
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,620
when I've honed my spear technique enough,

150
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,540
and when I'm confident enough to stand in front of her.

151
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,220
You have good ambition.

152
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,320
Hone your spear technique?

153
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,620
- How are you going to hone it? 
 - Well...

154
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,400
With the mere eight or nine moves of Chasing Ruins Spear that you know of?

155
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
But Chasing Ruins Spear is all I know.

156
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,580
- Is Chasing Ruins Spear all you know? 
 - Yes.

157
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:46,000
What about the fact that your master is the best martial artist?

158
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,420
You're right.

159
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,340
Master, do you know Chasing Ruins Spear remaining moves?

160
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,460
Why are you still thinking about Chasing Ruins Spear?

161
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,220
You have the best martial artist as your master. Why don't you think of more advanced moves?

162
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,280
- More advanced ones? 
 - For example...

163
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,700
For example?

164
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,540
Dragon Transformation.

165
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,580
Dragon Transformation?

166
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,600
How can Dragon Transformation have no dragon?

167
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,220
- Did you get a good look? 
 - There are 33 moves.

168
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,320
Except for the last move when you transformed into the dragon, I saw everything.

169
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,340
The last move is an illusion,
not a spear technique.

170
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,240
It would be weird if you could see it clearly.

171
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,000
But seeing clearly and being able to learn them are two different things.

172
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,260
Otherwise, others will learn your moves when you fight them.

173
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,340
How can we allow that to happen?

174
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,380
I'm going to travel the world with my wife.

175
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,680
I don't have time to go through all the moves with you.

176
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,960
But with your talent you probably don't need me to teach you.

177
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,600
Take that and train yourself.

178
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,020
Thank you, Master.

179
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,400
You're probably the luckiest one among all my disciples.

180
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,640
Why do you say that?

181
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,480
My swordsmanship is the best in the world. So are my blade skills.

182
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,020
My fist and palm techniques are probably the best in the world too.

183
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,160
It's just that spear technique isn't my specialty.

184
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,720
How can Baili Dongjun and Xiao Ruofeng be better with blades and swords than me?

185
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,780
- But you're different. 
 - Me?

186
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:44,200
If you become a Spear Deity, you'll be the one and only Spear Deity in the world.

187
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,020
Master, you think too highly of me.

188
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,240
I'm telling the truth.

189
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,000
Baili Dongjun was born into a noble family.

190
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,760
Xiao Ruofeng was born into the imperial family.

191
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,660
Ye Dingzhi is a descendant of a famous general.

192
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,980
Except for you. You're a wanderer born on earth who can live anywhere,

193
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,900
but you can stand shoulder to shoulder with them.

194
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,220
How is that not amazing?

195
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,740
Don't let me down.

196
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,600
I want to see you at your wedding the next time we see each other.

197
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,000
 She loves food.

198
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,580
 I wonder if she's tried this before.

199
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,940
 She'll like it when she comes to Nanjue.

200
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,960
Watch out.

201
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,360
You're annoying.

202
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,580
I'm just joking, Hero Ye.

203
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,120
What are you thinking so seriously about?

204
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,880
What's this?

205
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,840
Bamboo Rice?

206
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,020
Did you make it yourself?

207
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,500
I haven't had Bamboo Rice. Is it tasty?

208
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,220
Ye Dingzhi. Since you want to become stronger,

209
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,740
why don't you listen to me and learn our skills?

210
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,600
What's the point of practicing the sword technique all day in this bamboo forest ?

211
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,720
I know you were practicing with a female blade deity.

212
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,500
But I don't think that's a big deal.

213
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,820
Your master's dead. Yi Wenjun is getting married too.

214
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,760
What else is holding you back?

215
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,640
Wouldn't it be good to follow me back and become the best?

216
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,800
Those living in Tian Wai Tian are remnants of Beique, right?

217
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,780
What do you want from me?

218
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,560
It was my father who led the army to destroy Beique.

219
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,540
Let the previous generation settle their own grudges.

220
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,820
General Ye acted on Beili's imperial orders when he wiped out Beique.

221
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,320
The Beique clan was able to escape death because General Ye didn't pursue them.

222
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,940
I came to you because we can get what both of us wants by working together.

223
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,600
We have a technique called Xunian Technique.

224
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,020
Only natural martial artists can practice it.

225
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,960
My father went into seclusion to practice it and hasn't come out.

226
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,960
So we need a natural martial artist to learn the same technique and help him.

227
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,320
And you're a natural martial artist.

228
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,540
Do you have anything I need?

229
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,060
You'll become the best martial artist.

230
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,020
If you learn the supreme technique you'll become the best.

231
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,540
Once my father comes out of seclusion we'll head south with the northern tribes

232
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,820
to crush Beili and kill the Xiao Family.

233
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,260
We'll avenge your father and your family's death.

234
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,820
You can also be reunited with the woman you love. Isn't that good?

235
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,570
Although I hate the Xiao Family,

236
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:26,420
I didn't plan to involve Beili's people in my grudge.

237
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,120
If Beique and the northern tribes head south together,

238
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,600
do you know how many people will die?

239
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:41,260
Do you know how many people were sacrificed and died when Beili crushed Beique?

240
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,560
Even my mother...

241
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,980
I admit I want to be the best,

242
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,210
but I can't cover up the previous mistake with a bigger one.

243
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,140
I can't do it.

244
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,340
Leave.

245
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,480
Ye Dingzhi!

246
00:20:12,575 --> 00:20:15,300

247
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,680
City Lord, Mr. Nangong. A strange man wants to enter the city.

248
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,120
- A strange man? 
 - The man is dressed in black and wears a bamboo hat.

249
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,640
His hat has a strange emblem.

250
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,060
Oh, right. And he's holding a scroll.

251
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,220
Looks like it's time to let people in the Martial World know about Xueyue City.

252
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,280
Bai Xiao Sect is the largest intelligence organization in the Martial World.

253
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,720
It's said that Bai Xiao Sect will eventually hear about everything that happens in the world.

254
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,700
Bai Xiao means knowing everything.

255
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,380
Bai Xiao Sect's Jade Ranking.

256
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,940
Ranked eighth. Wen Xiaoxiao from the Wen Family.

257
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,640
Ranked seventh in Jade Ranking. Zhao Yuzhen from Mount Wangcheng.

258
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,900
Ranked sixth in Jade Ranking. Zhai Yuejun from Nanjue.

259
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,840
Ranked fifth in Jade Ranking.

260
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,500
Sikong Changfeng from Xueyue City.

261
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,160
Fifth. Not bad.

262
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,880
Zhao Yuzhen?

263
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,280
- Is he Wang's junior? 
 - That's right.

264
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,980
He's the youngest person to ever be on Jade Ranking.

265
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,126
What about Dongjun? What's his rank?

266
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:38,140
Patience.

267
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,860
Ranked fourth in Jade Ranking, Tang Lianyue from the Tang Clan.

268
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,640
Ranked third in Jade Ranking, Xiao Tianzi from Nanjue.

269
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,080
Ranked second in Jade Ranking.

270
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,140
- None. 
 -  None?

271
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,240
What's going on?

272
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,680
Tied for first place, Baili Dongjun from Jixia Academy.

273
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,980
Great!

274
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,600
 - Amazing. 
 - How amazing.

275
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,100
 - We're convinced.  
 - Amazing.

276
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,070
Ye Dingzhi, swordsman.

277
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,820
Who's that?

278
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,500
Brother Yun.

279
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,020
Am I as strong as Brother Yun now?

280
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,340
 Congratulations!

281
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,220
 Congratulations!

282
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,140
This brat is pretty good.

283
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,300
Why hasn't Luo He come back yet?

284
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,040
Junior Niece is also missing.

285
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,660
I'm starving.

286
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:57,680

287
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,440
- Are we really leaving? Won't you regret it? 
 - I won't regret it.

288
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,960
He's Jade Ranking's number one. Changfeng is also on Jade Ranking.

289
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,760
Let them find their own paths from now on.

290
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,220
We have our own path to follow.

291
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,470
Besides, if we feel like it, there's always a chance to see them again.

292
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,680
Luo He.

293
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,640
Brother-in-law, everything's ready.

294
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,420
Baili Dongjun.

295
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,800
Sikong Changfeng.

296
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,740
What does the old man want now?

297
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,300
 Well, I'm traveling to get married.

298
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,240
 We'll meet again someday.

299
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,920
Don't embarrass me in Beili.

300
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,060
Everyone in Xueyue City, listen.

301
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:02,240
I, Luo Shui, pass my title of lord to Baili Dongjun and Sikong Changfeng.

302
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,420
 They're now the third lord.

303
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,860
 The disciples and elders in the city must listen to both of them.

304
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,540
 Never disobey them.

305
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,380
 Anyone who disobeys will be banned from re-entering Xueyue City.

306
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,600
 Xueyue City disciples shall obey the lord's orders.

307
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,100
Are you two drunk?

308
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,500
- Master! 
 - Master!

309
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,780
 Dongba. Changfeng. You heard her.

310
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,880
 My wife just named you two Xueyue City lords.

311
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,840
- Do a good job. 
 - I don't know how to be a lord.

312
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,780
I don't want you two coming back to find me ruining the city.

313
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,220
Don't worry. You'll have help.

314
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,220
Master, I have a question.

315
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,620
Why am I the third lord?

316
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,360
- What about the second lord? 
 - Guess.

317
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,960
Wait. Who is this help?

318
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,560
Explain yourself before you leave.

319
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,560
A stunning beauty from the north.

320
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,620
 Think about it.

321
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,500
A stunning beauty?

322
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,840
- Is she as beautiful as me? 
 - No.

323
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,520
How could she be as beautiful as you?

324
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,780
But the one I'm talking about is indeed amazing.

325
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:32,540
But she's not mine. She's Baili Dongjun's.

326
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,620
She?

327
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,500
That bad old man. We've been waiting all night.

328
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,380
I don't know when the person he mentioned is going to show up.

329
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,000
It's not like you don't know Master's temper.

330
00:27:08,218 --> 00:27:11,338
♫  The wind passes through the window frame  ♫

331
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,578
♫  The rain falls gently in the Martial World  ♫

332
00:27:14,578 --> 00:27:21,137
♫  The stars change in the misty waves  ♫

333
00:27:21,137 --> 00:27:24,338
♫  How many people in the world  ♫

334
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:27,658
♫  really understand your intentions?  ♫

335
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:33,298
♫  We're all friends who gather as kindred spirits  ♫

336
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:37,338
♫  Let me ride my horse with the wind  ♫

337
00:27:37,338 --> 00:27:40,538
♫  Wandering freely wherever I please  ♫

338
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:44,240
♫  Even if the road ahead is mysterious, I will not stop  ♫

339
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,040
Long time no see.

340
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,860
It has indeed been a long time.

341
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,080
It's been so long that the silly boy

342
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,360
has become a young man who can protect what he wants.

343
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,220
Mister Li is my master.

344
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,320
I beat Qiulubai from Diaolou Tavern with Seven Starry Nights.

345
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,860
And now I'm Jade Ranking's number one.

346
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,800
Am I considered famous now?

347
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,400
Yes.

348
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,030
That's why I came today to fulfill my promise.

349
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,920
When we first met

350
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,560
the fallen petals were as beautiful as these today.

351
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,200
Miss. Can you tell me your name now?

352
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,740
My name is Yue Yao.

353
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,760
Yue Yao.

354
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:46,200
That's nice. It turns out the person I have waited for so many years has a beautiful name.

355
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,100
Baili Dongjun. I came to Xueyue City.

356
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,200
Can you buy me a drink?

357
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,780
What would you like to drink?

358
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,960
Wind, Flower, Snow, and Moon.

359
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,760
Lower District's wind, Upper District's flower, Cangshan Mountain's snow, and Erhai Lake's moon.

360
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,180
Sounds like a romantic liquor.

361
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,220
I haven't brewed it.

362
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,020
But I want to brew the first cup for the one I love.

363
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,220
I'll treat you to something else.

364
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,640
I imagined today's scene countless times.

365
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,540
Should I be at a loss?

366
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,140
Should I be overjoyed?

367
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,920
Should I be so happy that I just want to draw my sword and dance?

368
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,350
But when this moment finally came and all I want to say is

369
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,960
Hello, Miss Fairy.

370
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,420
Even though you never responded to me

371
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,620
I firmly believed that the moment when we were reunited

372
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,740
would be the real beginning of our story.

373
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:02,070
But I didn't expect this moment would be the end of our story.

374
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,620
I've...

375
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,740
fallen for someone.

376
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,680
Or I should say... I've really fallen in love with someone.

377
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,840
That person also asked me if I wanted to see you.

378
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,420
I told her I wanted to see you,

379
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:26,150
but I simply want to quietly fulfill a promise from a chance meeting

380
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,000
that I've been remembering for years.

381
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,020
This liquor on my hand is called Guozao.

382
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,220
It's the first liquor I made after returning to Tianqi City.

383
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,400
I'll treat you to this.

384
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,440
Sister Yue Yao. Farewell.

385
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,760
Martial Uncle Baili.

386
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,620
 Martial Uncle Baili.

387
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,700
 Martial Uncle Baili.

388
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,780
 Martial Uncle Baili.

389
00:31:25,308 --> 00:31:27,468
♫  The cold breeze dies down  ♫

390
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:32,908
♫  Swallows and sparrows weave through the dense forest  ♫

391
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,968
♫  The mists covers my vision  ♫

392
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:41,768
♫  As if I haven't awaken from a dream yet  ♫

393
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:46,208
♫  There are truly countless beautiful scenes  ♫

394
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,288
Martial Uncle Baili.

395
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,048
Why are you leaving as soon as we meet again?

396
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:55,268
♫  Embraces the passing years  ♫

397
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:58,968
♫  Only then can one appreciate the beauty of seasons  ♫

398
00:31:58,968 --> 00:32:03,288
♫  Joy and sorrow, like the fleeting bloom of a Queen of the Night, silently passes by  ♫

399
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,448
♫  Joy and sorrow, like the fleeting bloom of a Queen of the Night, silently passes by  ♫

400
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:09,608
♫  Yet in a glance, a sudden wind pulls at the heartstrings  ♫

401
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:15,728
♫  Yet in a glance, a sudden wind pulls at the heartstrings  ♫

402
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:29,190
Just by its name, Xueyue City is a place suitable for romance and love.

403
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,240
I hope I can bring her here one day.

404
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:49,940

405
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,480
Do you have a lot of questions for me?

406
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,160
Baili Dongjun.

407
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,220
The first thing I want to tell you is...

408
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,520
I'm sorry...

409
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,440
for tricking you.

410
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,180
- I... 
 - Hear me out.

411
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,640
I'm from Tian Wai Tian.

412
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,240
It's a place that's far, far away.

413
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,000
It's in the freezing north.

414
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,540
It's a home for the Beique survivors whose country was destroyed.

415
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,950
The king of Beique had the last name of Yue.

416
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,620
And I'm his daughter.

417
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:03,020
They call me the Princess of Beique.

418
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,760
My father went into seclusion at Death Ground after our country was destroyed.

419
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,346
If he wants to achieve success in his cultivation and come out of seclusion,

420
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:18,500
he needs a natural martial artist's help.

421
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,440
No wonder you approached me.

422
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,580
It's because I'm a natural martial artist.

423
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,280
Yes.

424
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:31,100
I went to Qiandong City to find your master, Gu Chen, the Scholarly Deity of Xichu.

425
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,860
I thought of asking him to come out of seclusion and help us restore Beique.

426
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,040
We unexpectedly found out that you're a natural martial artist.

427
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,800
My father has been in seclusion for 15 years.

428
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,950
15 years

429
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,960
is a long period of time for anyone.

430
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,440
We don't know whether he's alive or dead.

431
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,520
That's why we want to find a natural martial artist.

432
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,960
Of course, if he's alive

433
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,520
Beique will have a chance to make a comeback.

434
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,960
I heard you're joining the Academy examination.

435
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,840
With my identity it's inconvenient for me to move around Beili.

436
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,280
So I borrowed my sworn sister's name, Yin Luoxia, to join the exam.

437
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,620
So...

438
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,190
I approached you with an agenda from the beginning.

439
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,420
The Yin Luoxia in your eyes isn't the real me either.

440
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:42,140
Are you disappointed in me after hearing all this?

441
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,500
Baili Dongjun.

442
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:11,420
I'm wondering why you're suddenly telling me this.

443
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:16,060
After thinking about it, there's only one answer.

444
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,220
What is it?

445
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,640
You don't want to take me back to Tian Wai Tian.

446
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:33,340
Sometimes I think you're foolish, but sometimes you're surprisingly perceptive.

447
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:43,100
Since I chose to tell you, it means I've made my decision.

448
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,340
I won't take you back to Beique.

449
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:51,840
And I won't allow Beique's army to set foot in Central Plains.

450
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,700
Why?

451
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:01,540
Because I don't want to see war raging and people suffering.

452
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:06,720
My country is gone. What's lost is lost.

453
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,800
I've found what I've been looking for.

454
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:16,700
I want to build a new home for my people.

455
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,880
In a new place.

456
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,940
A new home? It sounds exciting.

457
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,360
So you've chosen a difficult but admirable path.

458
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,880
But you said so many things.

459
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,900
Don't you have a more romantic reason?

460
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:51,377
I thought you'd think that being with me is more important than anything.

461
00:37:51,377 --> 00:37:53,700
Who wants to be with you?

462
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,960
Isn't that what you want?

463
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,740
I thought Junior Niece and I were in love with each other.

464
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,400
I told you I'm not Yin Luoxia.

465
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,160
A name is just a name.

466
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:14,280
In my opinion your identity is false but you are real.

467
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,700
Everything we've gone through is real.

468
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:26,640
You have your own intentions. That's why you made friends with me during the exam

469
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,540
and joined me when forming a team.

470
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,002
But that didn't stop you from fighting side by side with me,

471
00:38:34,002 --> 00:38:37,320
not abandoning me in times of crisis,

472
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,640
nor treating my wounds for me when I was injured.

473
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,340
Anyway, you're the one I like.

474
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,586
It's not because of what you have.

475
00:38:55,586 --> 00:39:01,760
Who you are, your identity, and what you're after are not important to me.

476
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,560
It just makes me know you better.

477
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,300
You just said...

478
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,880
you like me.

479
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,380
Did I say that?

480
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,480
All right.

481
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,780
What about you?

482
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,860
Well...

483
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,075
I...

484
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,440
I probably think the same way too.

485
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,760
Strong sword energy. You look a bit like Rain Demon now.

486
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,660
Senior Yan Lingxia

487
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,560
Looks like you've perfected your Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

488
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,660
Thank you for your guidance these days.

489
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,160
- I'm very thankful. 
 - Take a stroll with me.

490
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:21,240
You're the most talented young man I've ever met. Maybe one day you'll conquer the world.

491
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,700
The Rain Maniac is lucky.

492
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:30,320
I'm flattered. My friend, Baili Dongjun, is no less talented than me.

493
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,700
It's too early to say that I'll conquer the world.

494
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:39,700
There are good men in every generation. Good. Very good.

495
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,480
I've a question to ask.

496
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,260
You're clearly not eager to succeed. Why are you so eager to master Demon Deity Sword Techniques?

497
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,600
I made a promise to someone.

498
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,640
I said...

499
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:02,240
I'll take her to eat beef from the steppe,

500
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,360
worship Bodhisattvas from the Buddhist States, drink Nanjue's herbal tea,

501
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,020
and sail through the East Sea.

502
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,340
The world...

503
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,640
isn't in that cage called Tianqi.

504
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,820
A woman?

505
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,160
Yes.

506
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,860
The woman I love the most.

507
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,620
But are you going there alone?

508
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:41,040
It must be difficult to get into Beili's Tianqi City.

509
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,380
I still want to give it a try.

510
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:50,100
That's good. If only...

511
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,520
Ye Dingzhi.

512
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,460
Since you're doing this for her, whether you succeed or not, she will be the happiest woman in the world.

513
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,220
I'll definitely succeed.

514
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,440
All right. I hope you can be with your beloved.

515
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,440
When the time comes, take her to Dongyue Lake. I'll prepare some good liquor for you.

516
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,120
Senior...

517
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,800
Oh, right, Senior.

518
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,800
I would like to leave Mystic Wind Sword with you for safekeeping.

519
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,400
- Are you not taking it with you? 
 - No.

520
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,660
It's the only thing that Master left me.

521
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,120
Fine.

522
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,660
All right. You may leave now.

523
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,540
Grass sways in the stream in spring.

524
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,720
Fish swim and cause ripples.

525
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,620
Waves come steeply.

526
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:26,100
Smoke rises from the boat.

527
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,710
Write new sentences with a brush,

528
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,620
and dress like ancient sages.

529
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:41,830
Flowers show their beauty in the morning light in front of 36 mountains.

530
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:52,340
 Wenjun. I'll definitely take you home.

531
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,300

532
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:11,550

533
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:23,246
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

534
00:45:23,246 --> 00:45:31,080
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

535
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:40,540
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

536
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:49,020
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

537
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,111
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

538
00:45:52,111 --> 00:45:54,431
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

539
00:45:54,431 --> 00:45:58,697
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

540
00:45:58,697 --> 00:46:03,360
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

541
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,722
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

542
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,800
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

543
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,220
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

544
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,740
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

545
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:21,100
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

546
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,300
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

547
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,280
♫  I met you  ♫

548
