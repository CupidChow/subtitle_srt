31
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,020
have you ever heard

of such a person in the Academy?

33
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,220
The Academy is so big.

Besides Master,

35
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,740

The sword of an evil man

131
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,020

132
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,820
The anger of a gentleman
is the fear of his vassals.

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,780
We're after them.

190
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,220
They've taken

191
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,220
my best friend.

192
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,980
I see.

193
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,540
There was a man

194
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,180
in that carriage
whose breath was very weak,

195
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:20,900
as if

196
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,500
he was seriously injured.

197
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,140
If I

198
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,260
could have stopped that carriage,

199
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,100
would this trip

200
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,140
have ended earlier?

201
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,300
Yes.

202
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,860
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,700
Junyu,

204
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,460
you said the breath of the man
in the carriage

205
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,980
was weak?

206
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,180
Yes.

207
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,620
He was more like dying

208
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,020
than weak.

209
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,380
They won't let Ye Dingzhi die.

210
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,420
In that case,

211
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,860
there are only two possibilities.

212
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,190
One is

213
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,940
that they

214
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,460
seriously injured Ye Dingzhi

215
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,660
when they took him away.

216
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,580
I haven't seen Yun in years,

217
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,300
but his martial arts

218
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,540
are not inferior to mine.

219
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,260
It's unlikely

220
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,580
that he was seriously injured.

221
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,780
So it could be the second possibility.

222
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,860
Dongjun.

223
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,700
Do you remember Beique's search

224
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,660
for innate martial artists?

225
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,180
And Ye Dingzhi

226
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,060
is another innate martial artist.

227
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,580
Are you saying

228
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,340
Yun has mastered Xunian Art?

229
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,740
But what does that have
to do with weakness?

230
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,340
If you practice on your own,
you won't get weak.

231
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,420
I'm afraid someone forced his power

232
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,140
into Ye Dingzhi's body.

233
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,300
- Forced power into his body?
- Forced power into his body?

234
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,940
Zhong Feili,
the Soul Official of Beique,

235
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,540
looks frivolous on the surface,

236
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,460
but he's a martial maniac.

237
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,260
With a mortal body,

238
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,100
he forcibly made his way
to the third level of Xunian Art.

239
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,980
If he transfers

240
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,780
this power to Ye Dingzhi,

241
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,540
Ye Dingzhi

242
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,180
only needs to forge
these three levels of power

243
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,700
within the limit of his meridians.

244
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,940
And he will be able to obtain
the third level of Xunian Art

245
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,020
that Feili has adopted.

246
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,500
Amazing.

247
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,820
I can't believe there's
such a martial art in the world

248
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,140
that allows us to transfer power.

249
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,780
Yao,

250
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,620
how long will it take us
to get to Sky's Beyond?

251
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,340
If we travel day and night,

252
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,300
we'll arrive in about 17 days.

253
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:08,900
Junyu,

254
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,500
I have a favour to ask of you.

255
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,540
Please help me

256
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,100
drive the carriage the rest of the way.

257
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,900
I'll continue to practice Xunian Art.

258
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,300
Although Yun's three levels of power

259
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:16,980
are given to him at no cost,

260
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,460
I can't lose to him either.

261
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,740
When he reaches the third level,

262
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,740
I must reach the third level as well.

263
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,380
Just leave it to me.

264
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,620
Miss, please wait here.

265
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,620
I'll go and report
to Deputy Commander Luo.

266
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,300
He will bring Prince Xiao Yu here

267
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,700
as soon as possible.

268
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,060
Thank you.

269
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,260
He's also the one

270
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,100
who took Princess Consort Jingyu
from Tianqi City last time.

271
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,660
He looks so ordinary.

272
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,620
But

273
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,260
such an ordinary-looking person

274
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,700
is the Soul Official of Sky's Beyond.

275
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,860
Is he amazing?

276
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,260
He's a survivor of Beique.

277
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,300
Even the Baixiao Hall

278
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,100
has trouble finding out about him.

279
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,060
Why do you think

280
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,700
they're interested
in Princess Consort Jingyu,

281
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,140
and why did they go
to such lengths

282
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,060
to send her away

283
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,340
and then send her back again?

284
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,820
You want to get involved?

285
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,140
I wonder

286
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,580
if he'd be involved

287
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,620
if he were here.

288
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,380
He would.

289
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,540
If so, I'll have to do something
about it.

290
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,260
But you're

291
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,620
Lord Vermilion Bird of Tianqi City now.

292
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,220
I've stayed in this boring city

293
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,140
for too long,

294
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,100
and I don't want

295
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,060
to be Lord Vermilion Bird anymore.

296
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,860
Are you leaving?

297
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,020
But if you leave,

298
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,940
what about the woman
who plays the guqin?

299
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,220
Well...

300
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,860
I don't think she still likes me.

301
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,660
If she didn't like you,

302
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,540
why would she

303
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,220
wait for you to listen
to her playing the guqin every day?

304
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,060
It's possible,

305
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,220
because I look like

306
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,100
her old friend.

307
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,540
What brings him here?

308
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,100
Father.

309
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,860
You left,
and you shouldn't have come back,

310
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,340
for any reason.

311
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,420
Father,

312
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,860
why won't you

313
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,820
let me go?

314
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,780
Our family has served the Xiao Family

315
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,260
for generations,

316
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,740
and we've been in the shadows
for a long time.

317
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,460
If you hadn't left then,

318
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,060
you might even have had a chance

319
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,260
to be the Empress.

320
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,180
But she doesn't want to be the Empress.

321
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,060
Lord Vermilion Bird.

322
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:16,980
Mr. Yi.

323
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,300
That's troublesome.

324
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:20,860
Why did you

325
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,220
let someone tell me this?

326
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,060
I don't want to be involved.

327
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,060
I'm a general now.

328
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,900
Can't you leave me alone

329
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,580
with this kind of love affair?

330
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,500
I'm leaving.

331
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,820
Pretend I wasn't here

332
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,900
and that I knew nothing about it.

333
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,620
General Lei,

334
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,380
Yi Bu was just here.

335
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,780
Let them

336
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,820
sort it out themselves.

337
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,300
Then, Sikong Changfeng went in.

338
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,540
With the relationship

339
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,380
between the Shadow Sect
and the Four Guardians of Tianqi,

340
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,980
if they fight,

341
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,860
it will be very difficult to end.

342
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,300
Here we go again.

343
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,220
There's the Shadow Sect in Tianqi City,

344
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,700
and now there's the Four Guardians.

345
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,820
Obviously,

346
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,300
one of them must be redundant.

347
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,620
You shouldn't be meddling in my affairs

348
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,020
because I'll kill you

349
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,860
if I get the chance.

350
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,060
Well...

351
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,660
Miss Yi,

352
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,180
I'm Sikong Changfeng,

353
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,660
Baili Dongjun's junior.

354
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,580
You and I

355
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,580
never met,

356
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,980
but I almost died for you in Tianqi

357
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,460
back then.

358
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,900
Ye Dingzhi

359
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,140
is half a friend of mine.

360
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,820
If I just sit by

361
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,900
and do nothing today,

362
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,340
Dongjun

363
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,940
will cut ties with me for sure.

364
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,140
We never met,

365
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,100
but you've already

366
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,140
risked your life for me once.

367
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,100
You don't have to do it again.

368
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,140
This time is different.

369
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,740
This time, I'm not risking my life

370
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,020
because I'm

371
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,540
not the same boy

372
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,260
who couldn't beat anyone anymore.

373
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,920
Since the founding of the country,

374
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,500
the Shadow Sect has been ordered
to guard the imperial family

375
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,740
and the ruler of Beili.

376
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,580
Even though we were the ones

377
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,420
who helped His Majesty take the throne,

378
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,780
we're still

379
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,780
Prince Langya's men.

380
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,980
Clear accounts even among close kin.

381
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,260
If we're not one of them,

382
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,300
then there's always a reason.

383
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,700
Who do you think

384
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,940
the Emperor would choose,

385
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,540
if he could only choose

386
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,060
one of us?

387
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,340
General Lei,

388
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,900
it's still not too late to stop them.

389
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,260
If I take action,

390
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,220
this will never end.

391
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,820
So, what are you going to do?

392
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,460
Sikong Changfeng,

393
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,380
you can do it!

394
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,940
I have finally seen

395
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,580
your Dragon Transformation.

396
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,340
It's really impressive.

397
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
You're getting old.

398
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,700
Is that so?

399
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,220
Instead of saying you're getting old,

400
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,260
you just

401
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,860
don't want to believe
in your sword anymore,

402
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,660
but in something else,

403
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,300
like power.

404
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,060
But your disciple, Luo Qingyang,

405
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,700
is different

406
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,260
because he only believes

407
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,220
in his sword.

408
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,180
Maybe.

409
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,700
But there's no turning back.

410
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,380
How stubborn.

411
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,420
That's a nice spear.

412
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,700
Master said

413
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,300
he

414
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,780
could be a Spear Deity someday.

415
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,980
There's someone else.

416
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,340
The carriage from the palace.

417
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,740
General Lei,

418
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,740
you've hidden your honor.

419
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,180
I'm flattered.

420
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,800
[Jinxuan, head
of the Five Grand Eunuchs]

421
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,700
You're just in time, Grand Eunuch.

422
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,020
It's a disgrace to Beili

423
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,530
for Lord Vermilion Bird to fight

424
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,260
with the Shadow Sect's leader
in the middle of the street.

425
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,580
Cut the nonsense.

426
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,140
Say it. What do you want?

427
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,900
Consort Xuan,

428
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,700
His Majesty has sent me

429
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,460
to escort you back to the palace.

430
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,900
Consort Xuan?

431
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,780
I don't like this title.

432
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,660
I'm here to welcome you back
to the palace, Your Highness.

433
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,820
I've heard that you're a martial expert
in the palace

434
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,220
who's on par with Luo Qingyang.

435
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,980
Luo Qingyang

436
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,220
wouldn't draw his sword

437
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,180
even if I talk
until I'm blue in the face.

438
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,300
Today,

439
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,260
you shall fight me.

440
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,580
Lord Vermilion Bird,

441
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,460
please mind your position.

442
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,580
Don't say that.

443
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,700
I'm not Lord Vermilion Bird.

444
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,740
I

445
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,100
am just a wanderer in the martial world.

446
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,260
Miss Yi,

447
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,460
all you have to do is
tell me your decision.

448
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,980
As long as I'm alive,

449
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,140
no one will take you away

450
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,460
from here today.

451
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,500
What if they fight?

452
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,700
The worst thing to do is

453
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,060
let Ruofeng clean up the mess.

454
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,580
Your Highness.

455
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,900
Mr. Sikong, I'll never forget

456
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,100
your favour.

457
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,620
Miss Yi,

458
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,140
have you thought this through?

459
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,020
I'd been trapped in this cage

460
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,940
for too long.

461
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,220
I know exactly

462
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,820
how powerful it is.

463
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,500
I was lucky to get out once.

464
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,740
But this time,

465
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,660
I know I'll never

466
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,780
get out of here again.

467
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,420
Mr. Sikong, that's enough.

468
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,140
You've done

469
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,020
enough for me.

470
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,340
Life

471
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,020
is not about enough.

472
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,580
It's about not regretting.

473
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,620
Let's go.

474
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,460
Let's escort Consort Xuan back
to the palace.

475
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,780
This is no fun.

476
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,420
She did it

477
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,620
to protect you.

478
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,420
If she nods,

479
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,820
even you

480
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,060
won't be able

481
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,300
to leave Tianqi City safely.

482
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,660
What were Miss Yi's last words

483
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,900
just now?

484
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,580
She said,

485
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,620
"Let's go."

486
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,860
Let's go, then.

487
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,300
Are you leaving?

488
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:07,820
Yes.

489
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,180
I don't belong here.

490
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,340
Are you sure you don't want
to say goodbye to her?

491
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,380
No.

492
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,860
But didn't you say

493
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,940
that life

494
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,460
is about not regretting?

495
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,420
Who says I will regret it?

496
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,060
After all, we're still so young

497
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,180
and the world is so vast.

498
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,260
Who knows

499
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,660
if we'll meet again?

500
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,700
But you say you've been wandering around

501
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,940
without a day of schooling,

502
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,740
but why do you speak

503
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,900
so poetically sometimes?

504
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:32,980
Because I once

505
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,300
met a poor scholar.

506
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,060
He

507
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,860
loved to say such poetic things.

508
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,260
This scholar
must have been so interesting

509
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,300
that you haven't forgotten him

510
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,100
even after all this time.

511
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,940
Yes, his name is Junyu.

512
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,260
He told me

513
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,100
he'd travel the world

514
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,380
and never miss

515
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,620
the girl who was waiting for him.

516
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,420
Horseman.

517
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,180
Take it.

518
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,060
Thank you.

519
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,660
My friend,

520
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,300
see you when I see you.

521
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,380
Sikong Changfeng,

522
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:14,980
Junyu.

523
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,660
Such an interesting

524
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,740
fate.

525
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,420
He's left?

526
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,060
Really?

527
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,980
He didn't come here to say goodbye?

528
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,900
No.

529
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,780
He went all the way to the city gate

530
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,300
without even looking back.

531
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,580
Sikong Changfeng,

532
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,980
you're a jerk!

533
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,980
[Sky's Beyond]

534
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,780
Father, you're awake.

535
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,580
You're awake.

536
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,620
Where are we?

537
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,860
Sky's Beyond.

538
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,260
What?

539
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,380
Where else would you want to go?

540
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,660
Tianqi, of course.

541
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,380
You want to go to Tianqi
in this condition?

542
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,900
If we hadn't saved you,

543
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,220
you'd have been killed

544
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,140
by the demonic energy.

545
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,780
Demonic energy?

546
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,780
You've been living too carefree

547
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,020
in Gusu City,

548
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,020
but you don't know

549
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,820
that Yi Wenjun's husband, Prince Jingyu,

550
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,860
has already become the Emperor.

551
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,580
If she goes back,

552
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,700
she'll be the new consort.

553
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,140
I know you want to go to her,

554
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,340
but you're going

555
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,500
to get yourself killed if you do so.

556
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,740
Feel your innerscape.

557
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,780
This is...

558
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,580
Earlier, you went mad

559
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,460
and lost control of yourself.

560
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,620
Then, I forcibly

561
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,180
transferred my three levels
of power of Xunian Art

562
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:46,900
to you

563
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,420
and saved your life.

564
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
Now you've got

565
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,420
my three levels of power in you.

566
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,860
This technique

567
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,220
allows you to transfer power directly?

568
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,060
Yes.

569
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,540
I'm not an innate martial artist.

570
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,340
Hence,

571
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,620
this is only the third level
of Xunian Art

572
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,660
that ordinary people can achieve.

573
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,700
But you're different.

574
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,580
You're an innate martial artist.

575
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,180
If you practice it, you'll be able
to achieve much more than this.

576
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,420
Why must you

577
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,620
let me practice this technique?

578
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,020
There are countless
martial experts in Beili.

579
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,620
With Mr. Li alone

580
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,620
guarding the gate,

581
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,740
Beique

582
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,020
has no chance at all.

583
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,180
That's why we need someone

584
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,260
who masters Xunian Art

585
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,540
to lead us through the gate.

586
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,060
You want to use me to destroy Beili?

587
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:35,980
As I said...

588
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,300
That's what you thought before.

589
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,300
What about now?

590
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,500
Legend has it
that Demon Deity Sword Techniques

591
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,300
are the result
of a Sword Deity's sacrifice

592
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,300
to the demon god
a hundred years ago.

593
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,140
Ye Dingzhi.

594
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,420
Instead of borrowing power
from the demon god,

595
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,380
why don't you become a demon yourself?

596
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,100
If you can master Xunian Art,

597
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,820
the Demon Deity Sword Techniques

598
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,900
are nothing.

599
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,780
By then, no one

600
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,100
will be able to stop you in Tianqi City.

601
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,060
Even Li Changsheng himself

602
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,460
may not be your match.

603
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,020
You will be able
to avenge your family's death,

604
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,860
your wife will come back,

605
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,340
and all the suffering of the past

606
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,260
will not be repeated.

607
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,980
Beili mistreats you.

608
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,580
So does the world.

609
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,620
Do you still want

610
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,820
to persist in this nonsense?

611
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,860
After Prince Jingyu ascended
to the throne,

612
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,660
he sent many martial experts

613
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,620
to look for you.

614
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,380
Even if they didn't find
Yi Wenjun that day,

615
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,460
what about tomorrow,

616
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,620
the day after tomorrow?

617
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,380
She may have once really

618
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,540
wanted to live

619
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,780
the life she dreamed of with you.

620
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,300
But you have to put yourself
in her shoes.

621
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,700
She'll have to wander around with you.

622
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,460
Is that what she wants?

623
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,060
Is that what your son wants?

624
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,500
So, what do you want now?

625
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,660
We'll take you to my father

626
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,500
in Langyue.

627
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,780
He's the only one who can teach you

628
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,900
the rest of the techniques.

629
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,340
Sure.

630
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,100
How long will it take
for us to get there?

631
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,340
Within a month.

632
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,940
Dongjun,

633
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,260
you're awake.

634
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,580
How's it?

635
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,020
I've had

636
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,380
a long, long dream.

637
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,300
Did you have a nightmare?

638
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,180
What did you dream about?

639
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,380
I felt like

640
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,180
I was falling

641
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,580
into an endless abyss,

642
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,420
with no end in sight.

643
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,580
I kept falling

644
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,380
and falling.

645
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,620
Sometimes it's as hot as hell.

646
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,620
Sometimes it's

647
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,460
as cold as falling into an abyss.

648
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,820
I feel nothing

649
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,020
but despair.

650
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,060
In my dreams,
there's a fellow traveler.

651
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,860
Then, a man

652
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,860
gave me a hand.

653
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,060
But he cut me

654
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,980
on the hand.

655
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,500
But I broke free.

656
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,180
Who was he?

657
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,140
My best buddy.

658
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,580
Baili Dongjun.

659
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,860
Why is it so cold all of a sudden?

660
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,540
Of course it's cold, Dongjun.

661
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,460
We are

662
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,860
in the far north now.

663
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,660
Come on.

664
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,740
Junyu, close the curtain.

665
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,220
You want to freeze me to death?

666
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,820
When you were meditating just now,
your zhenqi was surging.

667
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,460
I was afraid your zhenqi
wouldn't dissipate,

668
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,300
so I didn't put this on you.

669
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,260
How are you? Feeling better?

670
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,740
Yao,

671
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,020
wouldn't you be freezing, then?

672
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,980
Let's share it.

673
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,740
Dongjun,

674
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,900
you're so shameless.

675
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,820
Dongjun,

676
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,500
how many levels have you reached
in Xunian Art?

677
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,100
You said

678
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,780
every level is a step up.

679
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,380
Each level has its obstacles.

680
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,180
If I'm not mistaken,

681
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,140
I've reached the third level.

682
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,730
No more, no less.

683
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,620
It's the third level of Xunian Art.

684
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,100
So this is Sky's Beyond.

685
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,980
Soul Official,

686
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,900
take the child inside

687
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,420
and use your internal energy
to protect him from the cold.

688
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,660
Ye Dingzhi and I

689
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,420
will go directly to Langyue
to look for Father.

690
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,660
Why can't we go together?

691
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,100
Even though it's a blessed land,

692
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,540
not everyone can go there.

693
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,500
There's an icy field

694
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,940
even more terrifying than this one.

695
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,420
Even the bravest horse

696
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,380
would be deterred.

697
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,380
We'll have to go there on foot.

698
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,100
Anshi, go with this mister

699
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,460
to a warmer room.

700
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,380
I'll be there soon.

701
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,060
Father, be careful.

702
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,220
Don't worry.

703
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,900
I'll be right back.

704
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,300
Your mother is still waiting for us.

705
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,220
Lord Wuxiang.

706
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,060
Is this

707
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,620
the current head

708
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,940
of Sky's Beyond?

709
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,860
I've been waiting

710
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,260
for your arrival

711
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,740
for a long time.

712
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,180
I'm Ye Dingzhi.

713
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,660
Lord Wuxiang,

714
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,420
please take care of things outside.

715
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,620
Please take care of the child, too.

716
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,540
The journey to Langyue

717
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,740
is fraught with danger.

718
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,500
You two must be careful.

719
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,500
Thank you.

720
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,620
Lord Wuxiang.

721
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,260
Take the child and head back first.

722
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,460
I'm waiting

723
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,860
for a few more friends here.

724
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:02,980
Lord Wuxiang,

725
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,820
are you going to fight in person?

726
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,340
The secret envoy
has sent a message back.

727
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,100
They've already killed Wuzuo.

728
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,740
If I don't fight,

729
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,780
will there be anyone else
in Sky's Beyond

730
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,940
to stop them?

731
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,700
Feili,

732
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,020
go.

733
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,620
Soon,

734
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,540
the world will belong

735
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,820
to us.

736
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,660
We're almost there.

737
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,260
They must have

738
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,900
gone straight to Langyue.

739
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,140
The carriage can't travel there.

740
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,460
In a while,

741
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,500
we'll have to get off
and head there on foot.

742
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,820
Junyu, what's wrong?

743
00:38:59,180 --> 00:38:59,940
Dongjun,

744
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,220
it's not that I want to stop.

745
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,580
Someone's blocking the way.

746
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,460
Your Highness,

747
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,260
we meet again.

748
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,940
I'll tell you

749
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,020
what I couldn't tell you last time.

750
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,320
For your lust for power,
for your desire,

751
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,380
you've made

752
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,900
the people of Sky's Beyond,
who are now finally able

753
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,500
to live in peace, work for you.

754
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,100
How can you sleep tight at night?

755
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,420
In my opinion,

756
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,900
this is what will lead Beique

757
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,420
to real destruction.

758
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,900
Your Highness,

759
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,980
you're wrong.

760
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,940
I've never been obsessed with power

761
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,060
in my life.

762
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,260
It's just that our people

763
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,540
should be living

764
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,700
in a warm and fertile land,

765
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,220
not

766
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,700
a barren and cold one like this.

767
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,940
But some things are predestined.

768
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,780
If you can't let go,

769
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,300
you'll only lose more.

770
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,170
Instead of letting the war start again,

771
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,540
we should be reborn in a new home.

772
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,780
Lose?

773
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,460
When the Lord is released
and returns to Beili,

774
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,820
no one will be

775
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,620
more powerful than him in the world.

776
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,060
Your Highness,

777
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,780
do you want your father

778
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,020
to stay dormant?

779
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,540
If his awakening

780
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,420
will lead Beique to destruction,

781
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,300
my answer is yes.

782
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,060
Another one
who's fallen into evil ways.

783
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,500
But this one

784
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,260
is much harder to deal with.

785
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,580
Why?

786
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,860
Lord Wuzuo fell into the evil path,

787
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,180
just superficially strong,

788
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,100
but easily defeated.

789
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,140
As for Lord Wuxiang,

790
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,420
his very heart
has embraced the evil path.

791
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,020
His heart is as solid as a rock.

792
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,500
He's determined that what he's doing

793
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,540
is the right thing to do.

794
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,380
A man like this

795
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,700
is really tough to deal with

796
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,060
because he has faith.

797
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,140
And faith

798
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,100
can often lead

799
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,780
to greater power.

800
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,540
If you can stand up,

801
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,540
why do you need a wheelchair?

802
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,220
To tell you the truth,

803
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,260
I haven't been on my feet

804
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,580
for 20 years.

805
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,620
If we don't leave now,
it'll be too late.

806
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:46,900
If Lord Wuxiang is willing

807
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,980
to risk his life to stop us,

808
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Ye Dingzhi and the others must be

809
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,100
on their way to Langyue.

810
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,060
Dongjun,

811
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,220
you'll have to walk the last part
of the journey

812
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,900
on your own, I'm afraid.

813
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,660
Before you leave,
I have four words for you.

814
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,220
Do not regret it.

815
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,500
I'll remember

816
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,660
your words.

817
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,020
Thank you for everything

818
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,420
throughout this journey.

819
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,980
You're the one who killed Wuzuo,
aren't you?

820
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:22,860
And I'm going

821
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,020
to kill you next.

822
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,020
It's not a good choice

823
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,860
for you to use your Dragon Power

824
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,420
to force

825
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,100
your crippled legs to stand up

826
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,060
in such a cold wind.

827
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,580
It's not a choice,

828
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,340
but I have no choice.

829
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,420
Some people are annoying

830
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,180
but admirable.

831
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,130
You're an admirable opponent.

832
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,820
Though you're not a good person.

833
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,780
I'm flattered.

834
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,660
You and I

835
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,780
will fight

836
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,100
to the death here, then.

837
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,340
No one

838
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,300
can get out of this icy field.

839
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,860
It's like there's no end to it.

840
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,580
Langyue

841
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:02,980
is

842
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,660
as far as we can go.

843
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,860
Well,

844
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,420
if we stop here for a moment,

845
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,660
our blood

846
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,660
will freeze.

847
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,380
Why did your leader

848
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:15,780
choose to practice

849
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,220
in such a place?

850
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,580
My father said

851
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,260
that practicing in a place like this

852
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,140
would help him remember

853
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,620
the pain of losing his country.

854
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,620
Your father's obsession

855
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,420
is really deep.

856
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:30,330
[Langyue]

857
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,140
We've arrived.

858
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,940
This door weighs a thousand jin.

859
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,860
We can't open it with brute force.

860
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,780
My father put a restraint on the door

861
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,460
to prevent us from disturbing him.

862
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,260
Except for innate martial artists

863
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,220
pushing the door
with the power of Xunian Art,

864
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,780
the stone door

865
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:08,900
can't be opened from the outside.

866
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,580
I see.

867
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,140
The person inside

868
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,420
doesn't even know I'm here.

869
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,540
He won't open the door and walk out,

870
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,100
but you

871
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,780
are eager to see him.

872
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,460
Am I the key to this?

873
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:43,620
Forget it.

874
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,100
I've come this far.

875
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,140
There's nothing to be afraid of.

876
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,100
I'm determined to practice

877
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,060
Xunian Art.
