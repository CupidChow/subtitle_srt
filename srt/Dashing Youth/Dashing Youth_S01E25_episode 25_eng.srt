♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,920

20
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,600

21
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,720

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,420

23
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,660
Right now, Prince Jingyu's Mansion and the Shadow Sect have become a family.

25
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,820
This really is frustrating.

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,220
Your Highness, the carriage sent by Prince Jingyu's Mansion has been waiting outside for some time.

27
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,820
- Your Highness, should we... 
 - I'm not going.

28
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,900
Tell them I have a headache.

29
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,900
- Your Highness, please wait. 
 - For what?

30
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,480
I won't show any respect for Prince Jingyu. What can he do about it?

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,200
Complain about me in front of Imperial Father? Tell them to get lost.

32
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,660
It's not about the wedding banquet. Someone is charging toward Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

33
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,020
Judging from their actions, they're trying to steal the bride.

34
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,620
The Shadow Sect has already sent Shadow Guards to stop them, but they seem to have failed.

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,580
What did you say? They're trying to steal the bride?

36
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,180
That's right.

37
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,720
Who is it? Who's stealing the bride?

38
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,340
Ye Dingzhi. Also known as Ye Yun.

39
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,980
Are you sure he's here to steal the bride and not here to... kill me?

40
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,440
He's here to steal the bride.

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,680
Ye Dingzhi and Yi Wenjun, the daughter of the Shadow Sect's leader, have been engaged since young.

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,380
Therefore, his attempt at stealing the bride isn't without merit.

43
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,780
He could reach Prince Jingyu's Mansion all by himself?

44
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,160
Initially, he couldn't, but someone's helping him.

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,000
- Who is it? 
 - A spear wielder.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,140
It's the man we saw during the drinking contest at Diaolou Tavern.

47
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,340
As for the other guy, judging by his techniques, he should be a member of the Shadow Sect.

48
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,460
There's one more. He has a special sword.

49
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,620
It resembles the sword wielded by Mister Li's last disciple, Baili Dongjun.

50
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,100
You mean the young master of Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion?

51
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,820
Indeed.

52
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,140
Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion, huh?

53
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,500
His father is establishing an alliance with us, while his son is going against us.

54
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,840
This is interesting. Let's go.

55
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,940
Your Highness, where are you heading?

56
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,380
Naturally, it's Prince Jingyu's Mansion. We have a show to catch.

57
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,200
Your Highness, please wait.

58
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,360
Since we're doomed either way, let's just observe the situation for now.

59
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,900
Qingyang, I'm very disappointed in you.

60
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,600
Master.

61
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,740
I'm very disappointed in you as well.

62
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,340
Will you draw your sword against me today?

63
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,540
I've always wondered

64
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,540
whether I would draw my sword against you one day, Master.

65
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,020
Maybe when the day arrived, I would no longer fear you.

66
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,580
I would be brave enough to pursue the things I like.

67
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:29,620
Excellent. I would've been relieved to hear that if the circumstances were otherwise.

68
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,700
Draw your sword.

69
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,360
Sorry for the offense, Master.

70
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,720
It seems I've overestimated myself. I used up too much energy back there.

71
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,440
I'm here. My powers have increased considerably after mastering the Sword of Longing.

72
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,300
Not even my senior can stop me now.

73
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,800
- Which senior were you referring to? 
 - None of them...

74
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,780
What are you doing here?

75
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,400
- Heir Apparent. 
 - I'll take them both with me.

76
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,540
They won't go to Prince Jingyu's Mansion. You can head back.

77
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,980
Who are you to order us around?

78
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,980
Since you're this arrogant while standing, lie down then.

79
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,860
Do you know what you're doing right now?

80
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,800
Of course.

81
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,680
I'm here to help Brother Yun. As long as Brother Yun is still alive, his engagement with Wenjun is valid.

82
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,820
Moreover, they love each other. They should be together.

83
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,100
You cannot stop me today.

84
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,320
Give it a try, then.

85
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,540
- Senior Lei, do you wish to give it a try as well? 
 - You misunderstood me.

86
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,700
This is your family affair. It's none of my business. You guys can go ahead.

87
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,380
Heir Apparent, please teach him a lesson on my behalf.

88
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,020
Heir Apparent, sorry for the offense!

89
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,775

90
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,520
Dingzhi, do you want to come up here and enjoy a drink with me?

91
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,420
I'm in a hurry.

92
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,460
I'm in a hurry, too. I have a banquet to attend in the front yard.

93
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,460
We still have time for a drink, though.

94
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,570

95
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,340
 The bride taking her own life during the wedding banquet,

96
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:03,520
 this should embarrass a conceited person like Xiao Ruojin more than anything.

97
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,020
Young Lady, it's time.

98
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,020
Have you detected any movement out there?

99
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,020
They've already rung the gong.

100
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,900
That's not what I'm asking.

101
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,060
I mean, did the wedding proceed smoothly?

102
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,440
Everything is proceeding smoothly. Now, we just need to send you to the hall.

103
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,080
 Six months. Wait six months for me. I'll be back.

104
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,180
Back then, I had great hopes for you.

105
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,440
I thought you would become my junior as well.

106
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,220
We almost became disciples of the same master.

107
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,700
I think this toast is enough.

108
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,160
You're the descendant of General Ye. I admire you.

109
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,900
If it's possible,

110
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,540
Dingzhi, you should stop here. Stop fighting.

111
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,080
But there's a lady waiting for me inside. I don't want to disappoint her.

112
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,520
You're no match for me.

113
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,600
Even so... we won't know until we fight.

114
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,820
Haoque Sword, ranked eighth out of the top ten in Record of Famous Swords.

115
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,060
It's known as The Sword of Righteousness.

116
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,520
But, Little Master, do you think your action today is worthy of its title?

117
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,840
Power? The bigger picture? Are those truly more important than her will?

118
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,580
Sorry for this.

119
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,440
You're much stronger than you were six months ago.

120
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,660
It's because I spent the past six months preparing for this day alone.

121
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,660
- You learned the Demon Deity Sword Techniques? 
 - So what if I did?

122
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,400
Learning that technique will cause great stress to one's body.

123
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,060
You're still young. You shouldn't have learned that.

124
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,900
You shouldn't repeat your master's mistake.

125
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:09,600
As long as I win today, then it won't have been a mistake. It's over!

126
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,780
You've underestimated me.

127
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,020
That's the Xiao Family's Lieguo Sword Technique.

128
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,740
You thought you could win.

129
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,340
Since you learned the Demon Deity Sword Techniques, that proves you know you can't win.

130
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,020
You knew that you couldn't win.

131
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,060
That's why you're risking everything you have to learn this move.

132
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:06,630
The Rain Demon could never beat Mister Li, just like you can never beat me.

133
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:12,010
Dingzhi, leave or die.

134
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,440
How dare you talk back to your father when this is all you have?

135
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,820
Baili Chengfeng! You're not the one getting married here.

136
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,580
Why are you putting so much effort into this?

137
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,400
I just want to let you know that when youngsters like you try to go against adults,

138
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,540
they need to think about whether they're strong enough to overcome the hurdle.

139
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,920
If they're not strong enough, they can still afford to wait.

140
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,680
Still not enough.

141
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,260
 I don't wish to miss out on that sword technique.

142
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,860
 I don't wish to regret that I didn't get to see that sword technique today

143
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,220
 after losing everything I have.

144
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,260
 It's pointless even if you see it.

145
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,540
 It's just like how Rain Demon can never defeat Li Changsheng.

146
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,480
That's right.

147
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,940
I thought I couldn't win.

148
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,820
That's why I'm risking everything I have.

149
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,620
But I'm different from Master.

150
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,140
If he can't win, he'll wait for his next chance.

151
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,700
This is my only chance.

152
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,420
If I can't win, I will continue to think of other solutions.

153
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,020
I'll think of solutions and keep on winning!

154
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:07,900
Immovable Lord Technique, now!

155
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,940
If I keep waiting,

156
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,600
the girl he loves will belong to someone else.

157
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,680
I will never let them achieve their dirty goals.

158
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,740
Dongjun, if she were the girl you like,

159
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,720
I would resist the world with you, even if everyone were against us.

160
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,920
I'd beat them up until they agreed with you.

161
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,640
It's a shame that she's not.

162
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,820
You're here to steal a bride on a stranger's behalf.

163
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,840
He's not a stranger!

164
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,500
He's Brother Yun.

165
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,180
You once promised me that you would protect the Shadow Sect.

166
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,700
But Junior Sister shouldn't be the sect's sacrificial lamb!

167
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,840
Don't do it! You've already used Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

168
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,720
If you use Immovable Lord Technique now and activate both sinister skills, you'll die at any time!

169
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,180
There's no way back now.

170
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,040
Anyway, I won't leave. At most, I'll just die here.

171
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,260
Ye Dingzhi, why are you putting yourself through this?

172
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:27,320
Rumor has it that Prince Langya, Xiao Ruofeng, is open-minded and righteous.

173
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,440
He's the most magnanimous person among the princes.

174
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,400
"Even with such magnanimity, you still can't tolerate the love between two people?

175
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,620
This wedding is a marriage alliance between the Shadow Sect and Prince Jingyu’s Mansion.

176
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,380
I can't just...

177
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,480
If Prince Qing gains influence, the world will be in turmoil.

178
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
So, for the sake of the world,

179
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,940
you'll sacrifice the relationship of a loving couple, right?

180
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:04,080
Just like how my family was slain to achieve world peace, right?!

181
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,740
- Sorry about this. 
 - Die!

182
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,840
The auspicious hour is nearing.

183
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:21,210
Young Lady, if you don't move now, when the steward gets angry, I'll be...

184
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,940
I wish to wait a little longer.

185
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,980
Young Lady, what are you waiting for?

186
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,540
What's your name?

187
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,660
My name is Xiao Die.

188
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,400
Can you sing?

189
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,360
I can.

190
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:49,430
Do you know how to sing the most popular song in Tianqi City, "Butterfly Lovers"?

191
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:02,280
♪  Green willows and mist hasten the end of spring  ♪

192
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,200
♪  The fog is light and cold  ♪

193
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,980
♪  The swallows fly off in pairs  ♪

194
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:17,540
♫  The bright moon doesn't understand the bitterness of parting  ♫

195
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:26,400
♫  Its slanting rays shine through the red door until dawn  ♫

196
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,300
♫  The west wind withered the green trees last night  ♫

197
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,340
♫  Alone, climbing the high tower  ♫

198
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,300
It's your win.

199
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,520
Ye Dingzhi!

200
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,220
Even if you defeat me, you won't be able to leave Tianqi.

201
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,940
If you go berserk, you'll become wasted for the rest of your life!

202
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,820
Give up!

203
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,080
"Give up"?

204
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,880
I no longer wish to give up on anything.

205
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,560
I will never give up.

206
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,620
I won't stop until I die!

207
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,660
Ye Dingzhi. Ye Dingzhi!

208
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,900
 The auspicious hour has arrived!

209
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,660
 Play the music. Welcome the newlyweds.

210
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,400
 This is bad. He has lost his mind.

211
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,860
I won.

212
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,300
I...

213
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,840
I won...

214
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,660
Young Lady, we're just waiting for you.

215
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,380
Is there still no movement outside the residence?

216
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,040
Nothing's changed.

217
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,640
E-Everything is fine.

218
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,860
All right, then.

219
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,960
Let's not wait any longer.

220
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,440
You should leave together with him. Forget your dumb ideas.

221
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,400
You can't defeat me, even after ten years.

222
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,520
But if Baili Dongjun finds out that I surrender before fighting you,

223
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,340
he'll mock me for the next ten years.

224
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,160
What are you going to do, then?

225
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,620
You want to be like him?

226
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,900
My master taught me some new spear techniques.

227
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,740
I wish to try them on you.

228
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,800
Dragon Transformation!

229
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,700
Stop your transformation.

230
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,020
Youngsters like you all talk too much.

231
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,620
Still mainly inexperienced.

232
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,100
Kill me! Kill me!

233
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,320
You want to die now?

234
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:43,040
Don't you wish to come back, defeat me, and escape with Wenjun in the future?

235
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,740
To lose and die is simply the mindset of a weakling.

236
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,680
And you said you wanted to be the top martial artist?

237
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,500
There's no second chance when it comes to this.

238
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,640
You're indeed the strongest disciple the Shadow Sect has had in the last several decades.

239
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,840
You were stronger than me when I was young.

240
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,160
But that's not enough.

241
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,160
You have to become stronger.

242
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,100
Take him away.

243
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,020
No one can release him without my orders.

244
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,220
Master!

245
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,140
This brat.

246
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,680
He's actually this powerful at this age.

247
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,740
Maybe there's a chance for him to be the top martial artist after all.

248
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,060
Xiaoying, take him away.

249
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,760
Put him in a carriage.

250
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,475
Do not let anyone see him.

251
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:07,925

252
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,360
You're seriously wounded.

253
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,760
Are you still going to attend the wedding?

254
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,960
I have to go.

255
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,320
I must go.

256
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,980
This wedding...

257
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,000
 looks perfectly normal in every aspect.

258
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,930
 It's so normal, as if nothing else had happened.

259
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,840
Ruofeng, are you all right?

260
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,700
Brother, I'm fine.

261
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,340
You should receive your bride.

262
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,300
 During the 16th year of Taihe's era, Prince Jingyu, Xiao Ruojin, took Yi as his secondary consort.

263
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,740
 The Emperor was very pleased.

264
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,580
 Emperor Tai'an valued her virtuous nature

265
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,140
 and appreciated her father's contribution to the state,

266
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,080
 so specially promoted her to principal consort, alongside the current consort.

267
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,180
 She's going to take her own life.

268
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,660
 Everything will be over now.

269
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,420
 I was just one step away.

Dongjun, don't worry.

278
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,404
Prince Langya said he would ensure his safety.

 The weather today is great.

292

 It's appropriate for a trip.

00:28:51,881 --> 00:28:55,821
♫  Is that from now on you're alone in this world  ♫

317
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:58,921
♫  By the window  ♫

318
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:00,773

319
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,840
I would've wanted to try the 12-course wedding banquet if it weren't for you,

320
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,360
even though I'd have to spit it out after eating it.

321
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,760
If it were possible, I’d want to attend your wedding even more.

322
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,080
As long as there's some liquor and roasted chicken.

323
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,580
My son, go home.

324
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,200
Let's depart.

325
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,580
We're too close to Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

326
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,080
And the person Xiao Ruofeng assigned to escort the carriage is difficult to deal with.

327
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,600
If we go and take him directly, I'm afraid...

328
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,920
Write to Envoy Wuxiang.

329
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,100
We will stay here and observe the situation.

330
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,680
The wedding yesterday was lively indeed.

331
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,600
They did a great job hiding it from me.

332
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,240
Yi Bu and Ruojin didn’t want me to know about it

333
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,440
because they couldn’t tell what my intentions were.

334
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,860
They were afraid that I might jeopardize the wedding.

335
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,340
As for Ruofeng, he's the only one doing it for other people's sake.

336
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,040
He did it for his brother's sake.

337
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,780
He even did it for Ye Yun's sake.

338
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:38,580
Among all my sons, some have wild ambitions, some are ruthless,

339
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,960
and some are strategically brilliant.

340
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,740
However, only Ruofeng is kind.

341
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:53,090
As a ruler, I wonder if being kind is a blessing or a curse.

342
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,540
Do you think I'm kind?

343
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,960
Your Majesty, pardon me for speaking too much.

344
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,680
Small kindness benefits individuals, while great kindness benefits the world.

345
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,580
Good people practice small kindness, while a wise ruler practices great kindness.

346
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,920
When there is a wise ruler, a prosperous era will be ushered in.

347
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,340
However, if a good person rules the nation, the world will be plunged into chaos.

348
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,730
As I don't practice great kindness, I don't pay attention to small kindness either.

349
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:34,160
But Ruofeng,

350
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,880
he's different.

351
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,640
Your Majesty, Prince Qing requests an audience.

352
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,900
- Summon him. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

353
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,800
Summon Prince Qing!

354
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,880
Old Second, what brings you here today?

355
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,760
I'm not busy today anyway.

356
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,200
Imperial Father, I can visit you every day as long as you're willing.

357
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,440
You're not busy today, huh?

358
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,880
But I heard that you didn't even attend Old Third's wedding.

359
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,760
I didn't attend it as I was afraid I might embarrass him.

360
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,500
Not only did you not attend it, but you're also saying that you might embarrass him if you do?

361
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,620
Initially, I was planning to attend.

362
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,640
But I heard that someone was going to steal the bride.

363
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,920
It was a prince's wedding, yet crooks were trying to steal his bride.

364
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,540
If I witnessed the event, I'm sure Ruojin would be embarrassed.

365
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,000
Why haven't I received any news about it?

366
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,060
I'm afraid someone... swept it under the rug on purpose.

367
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,440
Imperial Father, they have no respect for you at all.

368
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,400
That's enough.

369
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,880
Tell me, then.

370
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,080
Who's daring enough to sabotage the marriage that I've granted?

371
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,360
Of course, it's that wretched Ye Family's Ye Yun.

372
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,060
Not only did he do it himself, but he also called upon his best friend, Baili Dongjun.

373
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:30,280
Of course, with Old Nine around, they were unable to do anything.

374
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,320
Baili Dongjun?

375
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,450
Are you saying that Old Nine was the one who handled it in the end?

376
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,560
About that, I don't know the details either.

377
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,000
The lass from the Shadow Sect was indeed betrothed to the General's Mansion.

378
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,320
But that was a long time ago.

379
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,640
So, they actually had such a relationship?

380
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,680
- Where are they? 
 - They vanished.

381
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,080
But I saw one of Marquis of Zhenxi's carriages leaving Tianqi in secret later.

382
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,160
And there were two individuals in the carriage.

383
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,560
Are you saying that the Marquis of Zhenxi took them away?

384
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,880
It does make sense when you think about it.

385
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,440
After all, the Marquis of Zhenxi was great friends with the Great General.

386
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,300
They were close indeed.

387
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,897
Although they've been separated by death for many years,

388
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:34,080
he's still protecting that son of his.

389
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,500
You're wrong.

390
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:47,800
It was Baili Luochen, Ye Yu, and I who were sworn brothers together.

391
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,240
Pardon me for the offense.

392
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:04,760

393
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,660
You're awake.

394
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,240
- What time is it? 
 - You don't need to worry.

395
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,300
You've been unconscious for two days.

396
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,080
Who are you?

397
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,180
I have the same surname as you, Ye.

398
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,660
My name is Ye Xiaoying.

399
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,920
But don't misunderstand. I'm not related to you by any means.

400
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,320
I was born in an ordinary village called Ye Village.

401
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,960
I grew up listening to tales of General Ye.

402
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
I admire him a lot.

403
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,360
- Who are you? 
 - Didn't I make myself clear?

404
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,460
Fine. I'll be more specific. Right now, I'm a commander, leading a squad.

405
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,040
It's called Ye Camp. I came up with it.

406
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,220
That's right. I want my Ye Camp to be just like the legendary Ye Camp.

407
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,660
We'll dominate the battlefield.

408
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,780
Stop using your real energy. You'll die for real if you keep using it.

409
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,020
But don't worry. My boss is wealthy.

410
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,080
He fed you over ten kinds of pills and elixirs.

411
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,160
You'll recover in around ten days or so.

412
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,060
But I have a piece of advice.

413
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,000
don't use the Immovable Lord Technique and Demon Deity Sword Techniques again.

414
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,000
Why did you stop me... without killing me?

415
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,640
It's because my boss is a good person.

416
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,580
He just has a scumbag for a brother.

417
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,400
I'll tell you this again.

418
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,840
My name is Ye Xiaoying.

419
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,560
Right now, I may be a nobody, but I'll be a great general in the future.

420
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,000
Forget being a general. It would be a shame.

421
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,400
You should just become the top martial artist in the world.

422
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,940
All right, he's here.

423
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,180
Take care of yourself. May we see each other again.

424
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,220
Xiao Ruofeng!

425
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,720
- You must hate me to the core. 
 - What do you think?

426
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,720
Even if I didn't stop you, you still wouldn't have had a chance to win.

427
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,820
The ending would still be the same.

428
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,200
However, there would be no turning back.

429
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,160
Is that your excuse?

430
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,880
Do you think Tianqi City is beautiful?

431
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,280
Tianqi City is known as the best city of all cities.

432
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,960
It's a city that gathers all the glory and wealth of the world into one.

433
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,240
However, the more beautiful something is, the more fragile it is.

434
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:53,400
To some, it consists of 32 music houses, 64 liquor parlors,

435
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,480
the legendary gambling parlor, Qianjin House, and the legendary Changyu House.

436
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:06,720
But to me, it consists of one imperial palace, three princes' mansions,

437
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,600
the Five Grand Eunuchs, the Directorate of Astronomy, Marquis of Huaiyu Mansion,

438
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,120
the Six Ministries, the Grand Preceptor Mansion,

439
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,120
Jinwu Guards, who patrol the city openly, and the Shadow Sect, which lurks in the dark.

440
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,620
And it also consists of the Imperial Guards stationed outside the city.

441
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,800
There are many forces and their relationships are complex.

442
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:30,440
Due to that, I cannot judge an issue or event based on my preference most of the time.

443
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,240
Are you going to tell me...

444
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,480
that you can't do anything because you're controlled by the court?

445
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,940
Why aren't you saying anything?

446
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,400
Because you're right.

447
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,300
I can't do anything when I'm being controlled by the court.

448
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,180
I'm different from other princes.

449
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,820
I loved spending time in the military camp since young.

450
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:15,200
Back then, General Ye taught me a lot of things.

451
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,580
I was on my first expedition when the tragedy befell General Ye.

452
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:25,240
Everything had already been decided when I rushed back to Tianqi City upon hearing the news.

453
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,540
I know.

454
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,500
Back then, Dongjun idolized me.

455
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,200
And I...

456
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,520
once idolized you as well.

457
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,620
Look, to the north of Beili are barbarian tribes.

458
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,280
They excel at combat and are ferocious.

459
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,020
South of Beili is Nanjue.

460
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,940
They just achieved unification.

461
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,140
They're raring to achieve greater feats.

462
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,000
But Beili?

463
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:03,380
The greatest general and his clan were executed.

464
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,880
The most influential marquises left the imperial court.

465
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,940
My father, the Emperor, is getting old. The princes are having an internal struggle.

466
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:15,780
Tianqi City may look prosperous, but it's on the brink of collapsing.

467
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:22,300
At this moment, someone has to stand up and stabilize the situation.

468
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,420
You want to become... that individual?

469
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,320
It's not that I wish to do so.

470
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,080
It's that I have to do so.

471
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,800
Our backgrounds aren't as noble as the other princes.

472
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,180
We don't have influential forces backing us up.

473
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,180
Therefore, we have no choice but to ally ourselves with other forces.

474
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,060
For example, the Shadow Sect.

475
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,420
This marriage is just an alliance between the two forces.

476
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,180
Dingzhi, I wish to help you out as well.

477
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,300
I wish to draw my sword and side with you as well.

478
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,480
But I cannot!

479
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,980
It's because

480
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,100
I'm Prince Langya.

481
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:14,300
I'm Prince Langya of the Xiao Family in Beili.

482
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:23,740
I know. In the end, we ruined your happiness for the sake of our interests.

483
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,660
I... I've let you down.

484
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,970
But Dingzhi, in this world,

485
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:38,340
who can truly live with a clear conscience?

486
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,460
Ye Yun, regarding the case of General Ye, I'll give you my promise.

487
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,940
I'll definitely overturn his case.

488
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:52,640
I'll also uphold justice for the entire General's Mansion.

489
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,820
So, farewell.

490
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:06,980
From now on, I hope you can live on.

491
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,190
Do you think I'll take pity on you

492
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:18,440
because of what you said?

493
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:27,100
Actually, I understand everything you said just now.

494
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,940
After all, I was born in the General's Mansion.

495
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,900
"I've seen plenty of cases where people forsake small matters for the so-called greater good.

496
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,440
My father could've staged a rebellion back then.

497
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:50,760
But he also chose to die for the sake of the greater good.

498
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,540
Although I understand where he was coming from, I don't agree with it.

499
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:22,030

500
00:44:24,939 --> 00:44:26,492

501
00:44:26,492 --> 00:44:28,779

502
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:51,865
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

503
00:44:51,865 --> 00:44:59,660
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

504
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:08,880
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

505
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:17,540
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

506
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,605
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

507
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:23,027
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

508
00:45:23,027 --> 00:45:27,257
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

509
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:31,860
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

510
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,340
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

511
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:38,200
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

512
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,820
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

513
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,140
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

514
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,700
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

515
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,900
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

516
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:57,680
