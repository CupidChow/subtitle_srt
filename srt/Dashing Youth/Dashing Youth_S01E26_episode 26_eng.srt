2
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,300
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,280
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,840
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,400
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,440
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,220
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,920
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,640
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,240
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,020
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,500

21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,320

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,340

23
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,100

24
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,700
You're protecting a traitor's descendant.

25
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,520
Ye Xiaoying, are you trying to rebel?

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,980
When the traitor's descendant broke into Tianqi City, none of you showed up.

27
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,460
Now that he's injured you're all coming after him.

28
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,240
It's really interesting.

29
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,272
Your Highness.

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,240
Go back and tell him that for the sake of stability in the imperial court,

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,420
I can go against my former friend and force a couple to break up.

32
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,540
I'm not afraid of what the world will think of me!

33
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,520
But just because I can do it doesn't mean I agree with it.

34
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,760
Ye Dingzhi's life and death is my bottom line.

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,520
I won't agree to his death.

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,500
Unless... I die first.

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,200
Get lost!

38
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,280
Retreat.

39
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,420
Your Highness, they're your brother's men aren't they?

40
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,720
Xiaoying.

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,860
Am I being annoying?

42
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,220
To be honest, you're doing this for the greater good.

43
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,760
In my opinion there's no difference between your elder brother, Prince Qing,

44
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,920
and the First Prince.

45
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,080
Though it's not pleasant to hear, I still have to say it.

46
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,620
Your Highness, why not be a dragon if you can reach the sky?

47
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,520
You know we'll assist you.

48
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,340
Your Highness.

49
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,700
You may leave now.

50
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,220
Yes.

51
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,240
Guard.

52
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,420
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

53
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,060
Go to Imperial Academy of Medicine and find a medicine for the Princess.

54
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:33,280
A medicine that can make a person unconscious after falling asleep.

55
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,760
Yes.

56
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,580
Lord Wuxiang.

57
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,860
You're back, Your Highness.

58
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,000
Beique has vanished for years.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,120
Lord Wuxiang, you don't have to address me as Your Highness.

60
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:47,480
There's a lot of meaning in that statement, Your Highness.

61
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,700
It seems that you've already heard about it.

62
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,060
I'm sure you have a lot to say to me,

63
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,640
but I don't want to hear it.

64
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,760
Your Highness, please think it over here.

65
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,660
Wuxiang, are you trying to rebel?

66
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,520
Betraying Beique, no matter what your identity is, is the true rebellion,

67
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,480
I hope you'll figure that out in the next several days.

68
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,260
 Young Lady.

69
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,820
Qixuan... Is that you?

70
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,240
 Young Lady, sometimes I really don't understand you.

71
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,720
 Are you smart or stupid?

72
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,200
Can you explain it for me.

73
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,660
I'm not well-educated and easily fooled.

74
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,880
 Why try to reason with Lord Wuxiang?

75
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,680
 If you lose the argument you'll be punished.

76
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,380
If you win, you'll be locked up.

77
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,680
You're wrong there.

78
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,280
This time I got locked up before I could say anything.

79
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,720
 Are you still in the mood to joke with me?

80
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:52,940
I had to come back eventually so I could have a clear conscience.

81
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,880
 Do you feel sorry for me?

82
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,660
I have to find a way to get you out of here again.

83
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,940
- Qixuan, you don't have to risk your life for me. 
 - Where is that brat?

84
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,740
Where's that brat enjoying himself now?

85
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,780
He...

86
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,440
is probably in Tianqi City seeing his seniors.

87
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,240
That liquor addict is probably drunk again.

88
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,630

89
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,360
- Sir. 
 - Where is Dongjun?

90
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,920
In the carriage. But he's tied up with the Sky Dragon Lock by order of the Heir.

91
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,260
- Unlock the Sky Dragon Lock now. 
 - Yes.

92
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,940
Young Master, the Marquis is waiting for you.

93
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,900

94
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,240
Dongjun, you've suffered.

95
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,180
Grandfather.

96
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,520
This time your father was ruthless.

97
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:37,520
I promised that I'd let him decide everything in the Mansion from now on.

98
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,120
Your father said he'd lock you up until he got back.

99
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,900
Do you feel aggrieved?

100
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,440
I don't feel aggrieved at all.

101
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,780
I'm at the mercy of you and Father.

102
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,460
I have only one request.

103
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,360
Go ahead.

104
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,200
I don't want to be locked up in the backyard of the Marquis of Zhenxi Mansion.

105
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,680
I have another home in Qiandong City.

106
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,200
Please lock me up there.

107
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,860
As for my friend, please send him away from Qiandong City when he recovers from his wounds.

108
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,620
All right.

109
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,900
Thank you, Grandfather. I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you.

110
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,400
No trouble at all. Get up.

111
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,900
Get up. Come on.

112
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,720
I know all about what happened.

113
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,940
I don't think you did anything wrong.

114
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:46,000
If I had the courage of youth like you back then, Ye Yu might still be alive today.

115
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,900
Dongjun, don't worry.

116
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,220
I'll take care of everything.

117
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,480
I won't be like that fool, Ye Yu.

118
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,160
If anyone tries to hurt my family, I won't let them go.

119
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,040
Grandfather.

120
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,040

121
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,020
Master.

122
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,420
I'm back.

123
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:01,389
♫  The wind passes through the window frame  ♫

124
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,489

125
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,629
♫  The rain falls gently in the Martial World  ♫

126
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:12,288
♫  The stars change in the misty waves  ♫

127
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:15,489
♫  How many people in the world  ♫

128
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:18,709
♫  really understand your intentions?  ♫

129
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:24,349
♫  We're all friends who gather as kindred spirits  ♫

130
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:28,389
♫  Let me ride my horse with the wind  ♫

131
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,689
♫  Wandering freely wherever I please  ♫

132
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:37,009
♫  Even if the road ahead is mysterious, I will not stop  ♫

133
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:41,449
♫  These tender feelings have flown far away with the wind  ♫

134
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:44,729
♫  Oh, what feelings  ♫

135
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:51,629
♫  The bold horse prances, kicking up dust  ♫

136
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,280
How long will the Marquis of Zhenxi Mansion lock up Baili Dongjun?!

137
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,840
This is our family affair so we don't have to tell you, Young Master Sikong.

138
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,100
Young Master Sikong, you'd better mind your own business.

139
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,120
If you don't leave Qiandong City today,

140
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,010
you won't have the chance tomorrow.

141
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,280
I've heard that the Marquis of Zhenxi was so gallant on the battlefield that he was feared.

142
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,900
Now I see he's nothing more than this.

143
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,880
Baili Dongjun drew his sword for his friend.

144
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
First, he didn't kill anyone and second, he didn't rebel.

145
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,360
Why put him under house arrest?

146
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,100
Is the meritorious Marquis of Zhenxi
afraid of Prince Jingyu?

147
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,780
You impertinent brat. Get lost!

148
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,940
Get lost, my foot!

149
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,040
I dare you to curse one more time.

150
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,420
I...

151
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,540
I'll be back when I've become the Spear Deity!

152
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:06,820

153
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,400
Young Master Zhao, it's been a long time since you were here.

154
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,800
Sister Zi, Miss Feng still won't come out to play the guqin today?

155
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,730
Second Master, you ask me this every day

156
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,700
and I'm embarrassed to answer you anymore.

157
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,910
Miss Feng isn't in the mood these days

158
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,720
so I'm afraid you'll have to wait a little longer.

159
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,500
How uninteresting.

160
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,140
Baihua Hall is getting less and less interesting.

161
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,180
Are you Second Master Tu of Qianjin House?

162
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,480
Yes, yes, I'm Tu Wan.

163
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,740
My young lady wants to see you.

164
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,380
What?

165
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,580
I... Say that again.

166
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,240
My young lady wants to see you.

167
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,460
What is this called? It's called "Nothing is impossible with sincerity."

168
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,700
Everybody, I'm happy today.

169
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,980
All the tabs will be on me today!

170
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,740
Thank you, Second Master Tu.

171
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,660
Miss Feng, I'm Tu Wan.

172
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,720
Second Master Tu, please sit down.

173
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,620
Have some tea.

174
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,920
Second Master Tu, the tea leaf.

175
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,140
Miss, I'm sorry.

176
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,460
Why did you want to see me all of a sudden?

177
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,540
You're the vice manager of Qianjin House.

178
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:06,850
I seldom go out but I've heard a lot about Qianjin House.

179
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,000
That's for sure. We are very rich.

180
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,740
If you want, I'll buy Baihua Hall and give it to you.

181
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,479
That's not necessary.

182
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:23,800
I just think that Qianjin House is very powerful in Tianqi City,

183
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,300
and that you should know things that others don't know.

184
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,940
- Do you mean you want to get some information. 
 - Not really.

185
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,320
I heard that a few days ago

186
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,300
some people were galloping in Tianqi City.

187
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:47,160
They said it was Baili Dongjun, the young disciple of the Academy who traveled with Mister Li.

188
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,520
He was accompanied by a young man with a spear.

189
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,600
But the next day, no one saw them again.

190
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,520
You want to know what they did on this trip,

191
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,400
especially that fool with the spear, right?

192
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,100
I just don't see what's so great about him.

193
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,740
It seems you still can't let go of that young man.

194
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,520
Second Master Tu, will you tell me?

195
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,490
If this secret is spread,

196
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,400
it's a capital offense.

197
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,100
But if you ask me,

198
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,840
of course I'll tell you everything.

199
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,020
From now on, reserve a seat for Master Tu when he comes to listen to music.

200
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,300
No need to arrive early.

201
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,580
Miss, I have one more request.

202
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,620
Please go ahead, Second Master Tu.

203
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,693
After all, it's a capital offense.

204
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:58,473
I can only whisper it in your ear.

205
00:17:58,473 --> 00:18:00,320
How dare you!

206
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,460
Alright.

207
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,020
Sorry to offend you!

208
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,220
Do you know who I am?

209
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,300
Miss, he came to steal the bride.

210
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,500
Don't worry, he's fine.

211
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,640
He's just a little injured.

212
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,800
Please make sure you reserve a seat for me.

213
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,220
What a jerk.

214
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,380
Came back to steal someone else's bride, huh?

215
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,920
It seems that the Dragon Transformation still needs the sea to work.

216
00:19:25,843 --> 00:19:31,619

217
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,980
Wait for me.

218
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,120
When I've become the top martial artist in the world,

219
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,640
I'll come back.

220
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,630

221
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,940
Whether it works or not

222
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,760
all depends on a single thought.

223
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,133
You're too profound again.

224
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:27,500
I'm not well-educated, so I don't understand.

225
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,160
You're a man of wisdom.

226
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,990
How could you not understand?

227
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,780

228
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,920
I was thinking that

229
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,860
if Ye Dingzhi ever became the top martial artist in the world,

230
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,260
it would be many years from now.

231
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,660
By then if he goes to Tianqi City to look for her,

232
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,980
what's the point?

233
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,260

234
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,140
Wuchan, we have to go now.

235
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,480
I'm coming! I'm coming!

236
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,080
Master, don't rush me.

237
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,360

238
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,380
It's not that I want to rush you.

239
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,500
It's just that if we're late, we won't be able to make it.

240
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,160
Are you leaving?

241
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,600
Well, see you later. Let's go.

242
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,650
See you later.

243
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,780
See you later.

244
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,840
Master, why are you walking so fast?

245
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,100
Wait for me.

246
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,160
Let's go.

247
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,170

248
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,700
Xiao Ruofeng really keeps a close eye on Ye Dingzhi.

249
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,300
Not only does his trusted man guard him,

250
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,140
but he even sent an old man to follow him after he's left.

251
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,880
Second Young Lady, it seems it's not the right time to take Ye Dingzhi.

252
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,440
Send someone to follow him and see where he goes.

253
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,000
We can take our time to plan.

254
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,160
There's nothing I can't have if I want it.

255
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,660
Master, I can't hold on any longer!

256
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,580
You can't hold onto such a small bag?

257
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,101
Master, I can't bear the thought

258
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:28,880
that with this bag on my back,

259
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,620
I'll have to walk hundreds of li.

260
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,820
Are we practitioners of Buddhism afraid of this?

261
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,350
We practitioners can't eat this or that,

262
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,480
so why must we always suffer?

263
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,700
Do you think I'm going to stop after you've said all that?

264
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,460
Master is more stubborn than that big black bull down the hill.

265
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,100
If you say you're going, you're going.

266
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,000
Then why are you still complaining?

267
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,370
Can't I just express my thoughts?

268
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:14,980
Wuchan, do you know there's a Gusu City at the foot of the mountain we're going to?

269
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,100
So what? Can it compare to Tianqi City?

270
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,460
I've seen a lot of fun in Tianqi City!

271
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,900
Although Gusu City isn't as big as Tianqi City,

272
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,260
it's much more interesting than Tianqi City.

273
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,860
In spring there are flower vendors in the streets, shrimp fighting,

274
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,940
board jumping, and juggling.

275
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,340
Everything you like is there.

276
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,910
Besides, the candied hawthorns there

277
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,340
are especially good.

278
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,660
When we get there, I'll buy you two skewers,

279
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,380
one to eat and one to look at.

280
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,960
What do you think?

281
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,180
Say no more. Master, let's go now!

282
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,080
Quick!

283
00:23:58,098 --> 00:24:01,460

284
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,980
A'Yu.

285
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,340
A'Yu.

286
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,260
You'll have to get a hold of yourself later.

287
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,400
Don't worry, Father. I won't go too far.

288
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,340
Father, I'm back.

289
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,700
My dear!

290
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,380
Dear!

291
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,060
Dear, please talk nicely!

292
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,480
Tell me. Should I punish you with Three-inch Ash or kill you?

293
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,400
Dear, please spare my life. Spare my life!

294
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,100
Didn't you say you wouldn't go too far?

295
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,400
I let you attend the wedding banquet in Tianqi City.

296
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,600
Did I tell you to beat up our son?

297
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,000
Did I tell you to bring our son back here and lock him up?!

298
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,700
What's wrong with him stealing a bride?

299
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
If you hadn't stolen a bride, would he even exist?

300
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,000
- No, wait. 
 - Didn't you always say he's no good?

301
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,700
He's following in his father's footsteps and you're not satisfied?

302
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,600
Go right now and release him.

303
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,800
I can't, Dear.

304
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,200
It's important to keep him locked up for awhile to help him grow up.

305
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,000
He's not a kid anymore.

306
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Fine. Then I'll let you grow up too.

307
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,900
Three... Three-inch Ash.

308
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,300
Dear, don't act rashly.

309
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,200
You two can settle this between yourselves.

310
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,800
I'm waiting to talk to Chengfeng.

311
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,500
I don't want to see you fight.

312
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,100
I'll wait for you in the backyard tonight.

313
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,400
I... I'll sleep in the barracks tonight.

314
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,300
Fine. Then stay in the barracks for the rest of your life!

315
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,820
She scared me to death.

316
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,600
Father, why didn't you do something?

317
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,000
She almost killed your son just now.

318
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Dongjun's temper is all because she's spoiled him.

319
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,900
And me, too.

320
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,380
Regarding the bride snatching in Tianqi City,

321
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,800
is the man Dongjun helped really a descendant of Brother Ye?

322
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
I've spoken to Prince Langya in private.

323
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
His identity is confirmed.

324
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,800
He's indeed Xiao Yun'er who escaped the extermination of the Ye family.

325
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,000
He's changed his name now. He's called Ye Dingzhi.

326
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,500
Ye Dingzhi. What a good name.

327
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:59,700
I didn't expect Brother Ye to have a descendant after he's been gone so long.

328
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,200
Yes. Heaven knows what's in store for us.

329
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,000
Is he safe now?

330
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Prince Langya said he took him out of Tianqi in secret

331
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,100
and promised me to keep him safe.

332
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,300
The words of the imperial family aren't to be fully trusted.

333
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,500
I think we need to get someone to protect him in secret.

334
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,100
After all, we couldn't save Brother Ye back then.

335
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:32,200
At a minimum we need to protect his lineage now.

336
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,800
I understand.

337
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:41,200
However, my heart says that Xiao Ruofeng is trustworthy.

338
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,800
He can be trusted but what about Xiao Ruojin?

339
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,720
Father, as you said, he's a member of the imperial family.

340
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,940
Prince Langya is a man of great talent and virtue.

341
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,780
But usually such people don't wish to be an emperor.

342
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:07,380
Only someone like Prince Jingyu is eager to seize power.

343
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,400
We must be careful.

344
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,440
Yes.

345
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,200
Shouldn't we go and see how he's doing?

346
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:27,240
It's the first time I've seen Dongjun stay in one place for so long.

347
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,700
Forget it. I don't think he wants to see me.

348
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,500
If you didn't do something, he and Xiao Yun'er would be dead.

349
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:44,200
You should at least tell them, let them know.

350
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,900
They're kids. They won't listen.

351
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,200
Kids?

352
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,800
I think I just heard someone say he's not a kid anymore.

353
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,900
You...

354
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,900
Wuchan, do you remember everything I just told you?

355
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,400
I'm not listening to a turtle chanting!

356
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,100
I'm a turtle? Then you're a little turtle.

357
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,200
Master, you don't even have a map!

358
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,700
If we just walk like this can we make it to Gusu City?

359
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,400
No rush. We've got some important things to do.

360
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,600
It's him.

361
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Isn't he the one who stayed in our yard for a few days?

362
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,500
I heard that he's going to be killed if he's caught.

363
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,380
What a coincidence that you're here too, Young Hero Ye.

364
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,300
Since we've crossed paths, let's travel together.

365
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,600
Crossed paths?

366
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,500
That's a nice way of putting it.

367
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,700
Elder Wang You, I've heard that you're a profound practitioner

368
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,200
who doesn't care about worldly affairs.

369
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:08,900
When did you become the accomplice of the imperial family of Beili and start following me?

370
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,200
You've followed me all the way here.

371
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,500
So it's time to stop, isn't it?

372
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,800
Young Hero Ye, that's not true.

373
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,800
It's because I don't like Tianqi City that I'm leaving.

374
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,400
It's just that the journey is boring,

375
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,600
and I don't know martial arts, so I'd like to travel with you.

376
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,300
I hope you can take care of us.

377
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,300
Master, you didn't say we were going to travel with him.

378
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
Shush.

379
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,160
But why should I travel with you?

380
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,440
That's scary.

381
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,520
How interesting.

382
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,900
The master doesn't know martial arts but his disciple is a future martial arts expert.

383
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,400
Young Hero Ye, you must be joking.

384
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,600
I don't need any companions.

385
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,000
I'll walk my own path.

386
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,620
Mister Ye, be patient.

387
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,860
You dare to say you don't know martial arts?

388
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,600
Young Hero Ye, I really don't know martial arts.

389
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,080
I can only dodge, run and...

390
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,100
What else?

391
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,400
 As expected.

392
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,100
 Bell of Heart Wisdom, drop.

393
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,260
I can trap people.

394
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,900
Master.

395
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,100
Young Hero Ye, you'd better travel with me.

396
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,700
Why is this happening?

397
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,600
Demon Deity Sword Techniques are the ways of the demon after all.

398
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Before, you had a firm heart so there was no harm.

399
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:02,700
But now you can't get what you desire so your mind is unstable.

400
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,200
If your mind is unstable and the barrier is broken,

401
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,800
the demonic thoughts will penetrate your body, and this is the result.

402
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,700
That's why I insist on traveling with you.

403
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,100
It's only for two years.

404
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,100
After two years, your mind will be stable

405
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,800
and you won't be afraid of the demonic power's repercussions.

406
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,400
Why are you helping me?

407
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Aren't we practitioners supposed to help people in need?

408
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:40,000
I met you when you happen to be in trouble, so I help you.

409
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,700
What reason do I need?

410
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,120
To be honest,

411
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:57,600
I have no destination in mind and don't know where I'm headed.

412
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,040
I thought...

413
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:09,680
I could take her away from Tianqi and we could go back to Nanjue together.

414
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,840
I have a hut there

415
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,500
surrounded by bamboo, mountains, and a river.

416
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:35,200
We would live a carefree life together.

417
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,300
There's a mountain outside of Gusu City.

418
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:45,300
It's perfect for hermits like us.

419
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,400
That's where I was headed.

420
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:54,100
Gusu City is a good city and so is the mountain.

421
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:00,900
Since you don't know where you're going, why don't you follow me there?

422
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,900
It's far away from Tianqi City and no one will disturb you.

423
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,300
It only needs two years, right?

424
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,900
Two years at most.

425
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,300
After two years, my Demon Deity Sword Techniques won't have any more repercussions?

426
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:27,500
Not only will it not have repercussions but it will also advance to a higher level.

427
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,500
All right.

428
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,600
Master, so you were this good?

429
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,500
I can't believe you made a big bell out of no where.

430
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,900
Master, can you make a candied hawthorn skewer out of nowhere?

431
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,240
No.

432
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,540
Sister... you're back.

433
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,360
Yes. I'm back.

434
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,040
But why are you here?

435
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,547
I...

436
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:54,780
I heard them say you were going to give up on the restoration of the country.

437
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,560
You lied to me.

438
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,400
You've betrayed us.

439
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,360
Sister, I...

440
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,880
Sister, you're so heartless.

441
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,660
Have you forgotten that mother is dead?

442
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,600
I haven't.

443
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,756
Because I watched her die and experienced the pain of separation,

444
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:31,760
that I don't want this to happen to anyone else.

445
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,180
War requires countless innocent lives to pay for it.

446
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,520
Our country is history. Why don't we rebuild a new home?

447
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,580
It's only because you're in love with Baili Dongjun!

448
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:49,180
You're doing it for your own selfish reasons. Don't make yourself sound so grand!

449
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,320
Yes.

450
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,320
I,m in love with Baili Dongjun, but that has nothing to do with my decision.

451
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,340
You expect me to believe that?

452
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:12,680
In your heart is love, such a vague feeling, worth trusting with your life?

453
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,380
Yue Yao, stop with the jokes.

454
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,420
To him, you're a liar.

455
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,120
You're just an enemy of his nation!

456
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,200
Of course our relationship...

457
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,760
is worth trusting with our lives.

458
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,100
Sister, that's because you haven't encountered love yet.

459
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,380
So what if it's worth trusting with your life?

460
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,200
In the end, there's nothing you can do about it.

461
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,860
What did you say?

462
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,660
Baili Dongjun helped his good friend, Ye Dingzhi, to try to steal his bride.

463
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,080
But they failed in the end and his whereabouts are unknown.

464
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,060
Perhaps he's already dead.

465
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,680
Dongjun...

466
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,240
No.

467
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,560
If only I had someone to keep me company.

468
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,020
Why don't I play the guqin Master left me first?

469
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,700
What? Can't you stand it anymore?

470
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,260
 You sound like you just woke up.

471
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,320
Sir, you're here to laugh at me aren't you?

472
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,960
I'm curious because you accepted your punishment without saying a word and stayed put.

473
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,960
Have you learned your lesson or are you trying to challenge me?

474
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,460
Now it seems neither.

475
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,920
You're just hiding out here to slack off.

476
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,360
Who's slacking? I've been practicing my guqin and sword.

477
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,520
If you're so capable, come in and let's have a fight.

478
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,560
Who wants to fight with you?

479
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:30,320
I'm here to ask if you've thought about why you've been locked up.

480
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,020
Because I was stealing a bride for a friend,

481
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:48,980
and the one I was steaing her from was the Prince of Tianqi City.

482
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,660
My surname is Baili. I can't just think about myself.

483
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,400
I have the entire Marquis of Zhenxi Mansion behind me.

484
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,300
 Rubbish! I think what you learned from Mister Li has been for nothing.

485
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:08,020
Yun'er is your childhood friend and your friend for life when you grow up.

486
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,620
It's not wrong for you to help your friend steal his bride.

487
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:18,412
Even if the entire Marquis of Zhenxi Mansion is implicated as you said, you're still not wrong.

488
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:23,620
If we live in the world just for fame and fortune, and have no regard for integrity,

489
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,580
 then what kind of heroes are we?

490
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:31,720
 What you did wrong was to overestimate yourself.

491
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:44,359
 Overestimating yourself is when you do something you can't yet do

492
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:47,480
 and can't bear the consequences of your failure.

493
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,580
 However, you're indeed my offspring.

494
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,860
I also stole a bride when I was young.

495
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,640
Back then I wanted to marry your mother, but her father refused

496
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:10,120
because he had already betrothed her to the eldest son of the Xu family in Lingnan.

497
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,140
So on their wedding day, I went to steal the bribe.

498
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,820
Your grandfather didn't support me either.

499
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:23,340
Your grandfather had thousands of soldiers, but he let me steal the bride by myself with only a sword.

500
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,020
But that's fine.

501
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:31,600
From the eldest son of the Xu family, to the head of the Xu family, to the Xu family's altar, they all fell under my sword.

502
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,660
I was able to take your mother not only because we were in love,

503
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,920
but also because I was capable of doing so.

504
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,180
But do you think you have the ability?

505
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,920
That's the real reason why I've grounded you here.

506
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,180
You also know that today's Emperor Tai'an

507
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,300
is no longer the same friend who fought alongside your grandfather and General Ye Yu.

508
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:59,420
The loyalty of the past can't stand up to a heart hardened by power.

509
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:05,140
That's why your grandfather didn't want you to get involved in this complicated matter.

510
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:10,660
But since you chose to get involved, you must be prepared.

511
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:15,260
There's no sentiment in the imperial court, but we have to have it.

512
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,100
You can leave here anytime you want. But...

513
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,900
How?

514
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,880
Tell these soldiers outside the door you're ready.

515
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,280
There's only one chance.

516
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:50,460
I'm not a man of leisure. I don't have time to come and chat with you all the time.

517
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,820
Anyway, remember, if you want to get out early, have someone pass me a message.

518
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:01,900
I expect to see what you're truly capable of when you come to me.

519
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,520
Sir.

520
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,740
You brat, stop calling me that. I'm your father.

521
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,240
Baili Chengfeng!

522
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,360
You brat, I...

523
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,000
Father!

524
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,700
Thank you.

525
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,840
Thank you so much... for saying all of that to me.

526
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,420
Enough, you brat. Keep practicing.

527
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,920
He just likes to talk tough.

528
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:01,940

529
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,370

530
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:15,970

531
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:27,432
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

532
00:46:27,432 --> 00:46:35,100

533
