00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:15,760

2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Holding onto life and death in the face of danger  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,940
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,960
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,500
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,220
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,820
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,540
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,960
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost   ♫

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,320
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,600

21
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,320

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,310

23
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,520
- Greetings, honored guests. 
 - Tianqi City is famous for the courtesan and Lord Vermilion Bird.

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,000
Please, sit there.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,620
He's a total playboy.

27
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,940
Precisely. The courtesan chased him for a thousand li.

28
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,940
What a great love story.

29
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,440
Come.

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,140
Sir, your liquor is here.

31
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,440
It's Martial Uncle Sikong.

32
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,300
Mister, give me some paper and a brush.

33
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,780
- And an envelope too. 
 - All right!

34
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,460
What are you up to?

35
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,480
I'm going to write to Changfeng.

36
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,180
Changfeng?

37
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,160
Is your Senior Uncle, the so-called Lord Vermilion Bird, Sikong Changfeng?

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,240
Senior, have you heard of his name before?

39
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,540
 Seems like that brat made a name for himself.

40
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,920
Sir, please.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,640
 During my travel, I heard that you won your beloved's heart.

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,180
 Congratulations.

43
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,020
 I shall return soon.

44
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,580
 No need to hurry with the wedding banquet. You have to wait for me.

45
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,980
Add something for me. Tell him to wait for me too.

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,180
First Senior, are you going to join the fun as well?

47
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,280
We did encounter each other in an abandoned temple. Write it this way.

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,220
There's a scholar who, in pursuit of academic success,

49
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,180
hopes to ask for a few cups of celebration liquor.

50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,940
All right.

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,660
I'm just worried that he might be too impatient and hold the wedding banquet in an instant.

52
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,220
I've never attended the wedding banquet of a junior yet.

53
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,540
Brother Yun...

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,860
I couldn't make it to Brother Yun's wedding.

55
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,780
I can't afford to miss out on Changfeng's wedding now.

56
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,680
Let's head back when you've recovered.

57
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,460
Yao'er,

58
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,260
sorry for the trouble lately.

59
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,480
Let's rent a boat and depart this afternoon.

60
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,140
All right.

61
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:09,900

62
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,220
- Be careful. 
 - Be careful.

63
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,020
Everyone, everything is ready.

64
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,900
We may depart now.

65
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,020
Junior, I'll stop here.

66
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,660
Now that we're parting ways, I don't know when we'll meet again.

67
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,100
First Senior, thank you for everything you've done for us.

68
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,840
Take care.

69
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,780
Take care.

70
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,820
Martial Uncle, take care.

71
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,060
Take care.

72
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,380
Stop looking.

73
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:59,860
When you return, may you still be the same old vigorous Baili Dongjun.

74
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:43,145
♫  The wind passes through the window frame  ♫

75
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:46,385
♫  The rain falls gently in the Martial World  ♫

76
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:53,244
♫  The stars change in the misty waves  ♫

77
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:56,145
♫  How many people in the world  ♫

78
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:59,465
♫  really understand your intentions?  ♫

79
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:02,660
♫  We're all friends who gather as kindred spirits  ♫

80
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,440
Yao'er.

81
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,045
I'm fine.

82
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,802
I was just reminded of Father.

83
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,210
♫  These tender feelings have flown far away with the wind  ♫

84
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,027
Dongjun.

85
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,220
I was separated from my parents since young.

86
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,060
My impressions of my father are very blurry.

87
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:37,310
I only remember that during festive occasions,

88
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,240
when I wanted to admire the lanterns in the streets,

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,140
Father and I disguised ourselves as commoners

90
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,360
and blended into the lantern party.

91
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,920
He would carry me on his shoulders.

92
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,960
His shoulders were broad.

93
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,598
They were warm.

94
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,700
♫  Embracing both sorrow and joy  ♫

95
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:10,660
♫  Turns out loneliness is also a kind of courage  ♫

96
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,685
My reunion with my father was too short-lived.

97
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:18,860
It was just like a dream.

98
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,680
Tell me...

99
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,300
had I opened that door earlier...

100
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,460
could I have persuaded my father to stop?

101
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,206
Yao'er.

102
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,540
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,342
I should have considered your feelings more.

104
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,260
I suppose all of us will blame ourselves.

105
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,016
However...

106
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,663
We still have to move on eventually.

107
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,820
♫  Swallowing the farewell  ♫

108
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:05,160
♫  Facing the never ending trials in the martial world  ♫

109
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:14,020
♫  Casting away sighs into my dreams  ♫

110
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,240
We've arrived.

111
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,740
Yao'er, look.

112
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,640
A dazzling star has risen in the eastern sky.

113
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,260
It's Alkaid.

114
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,000
The Sovereign Lord.

115
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,440
Alkaid at the east and Sovereign Lord to the west.

116
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,420
The undercurrent has stopped.

117
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,340
Penglai Island. I'm finally here.

118
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,600
This feels sentimental.

119
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,700
 Elder Mo Yi.

120
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,300
Long time no see.

121
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,800
You're still as dashing as always.

122
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,620
Elder, just look at you.

123
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:28,120
You're already in your forties. Even so, you still look like a teenager. Aren't you embarrassed?

124
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,740
Why don't you ask your master that question?

125
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,720
He's already over 100 years old. Even so, he still looks like a teenager. Isn't he embarrassed?

126
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,320
Kid, you're not kind at all. It's no wonder you lost all of your powers.

127
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,700
Elder, you do live up to your title as a deity. You can tell at first glance.

128
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,940
How did you lose your powers?

129
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,780
It's a sad story. Let's not bring it up.

130
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,120
Still so young, what's there to be sad about?

131
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,860
Xiao Baili, what was the internal strength technique you practiced?

132
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,880
The Autumn Water Technique.

133
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,900
"When autumn water comes, streams flow into the river."

134
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,040
"The river current is so strong that one couldn't distinguish between a cow and a horse."

135
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,260
That's an impressive internal strength technique indeed. But it's not enough.

136
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,580
Elder, please enlighten me.

137
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,160
The Scholarly Deity invented the Autumn Water Technique after being inspired by the water in autumn he witnessed.

138
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,520
But that was his enlightenment after all.

139
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,840
No matter how good you are at it, you'll never be as good as the Scholarly Deity.

140
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:37,320
Moreover, "When autumn water comes, streams flow into the river" isn't good enough.

141
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,960
Come with me.

142
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,900
Where's your master?

143
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,180
He went on a journey. I don't know when he'll return.

144
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,780
I'm afraid it'll be difficult for him to return.

145
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,500
Elder, what do you mean?

146
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,340
Your master went to the north. The far northern land.

147
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,860
Why did Master go there?

148
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,740
Why do you think I'm here, then?

149
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:14,620
Elder, I've lost all of my powers. You should stop talking in riddles.

150
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,540
You only lost your powers, not your brain.

151
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,220
There is always something greater beyond the heavens.

152
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,820
The way of the martial arts is limitless. Therefore, what you can achieve is also limitless.

153
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,520
The stronger you are, the heavier your responsibilities are.

154
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:36,040
The icy plains in the north, the desert in the west, the boundless sea to the east, and the endless mountains to the south,

155
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,780
these four directions are guarded by four saints.

156
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,100
One day, you'll guard one of them too.

157
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,820
Me?

158
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,680
But that's all in the future.

159
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:07,720
Once you go beyond the stone monument, you can see... a spectacular view.

160
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:21,060

161
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,500
Boundless Sky?

162
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,060
My predecessor wrote Bounded Sky alone.

163
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,740
But in my opinion, it's only bound because there's an end to our vision.

164
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:41,000
Whereas it's truly boundless. So, I changed it to Boundless Sky.

165
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,300
Over there... is a different world.

166
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,980
Go on.

167
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,500
This place...

168
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,800
According to A Record of Mountains and Seas, at the end of the sky lies a bottomless cliff.

169
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,680
The swirling clouds and mist gather there, yet they flow like seawater.

170
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,800
The rapid flow causes sparks, dyeing the sky with a crimson shade.

171
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,040
Another ancient manual, Heavenly Wind Chronicles, states that at the end of the sky,

172
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,028
whenever a prosperous era is dawning, deities will come and Buddhas will do their prayers.

173
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:54,720
It's a place where deities live.

174
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,260
I assume the authors must've visited this place before.

175
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,980
It's because what they said was true.

176
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,380
What's behind the clouds and mist?

177
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,860
I don't know either.

178
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:18,020
Maybe you'll find deities and Buddhas there. Maybe you'll find out that it's only a fantasy.

179
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,400
Or, perhaps you'll really reach the end of the sky.

180
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,860
It's not what we can seek out.

181
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:42,100
Now, do you understand why I said the Autumn Water Technique wasn't good enough?

182
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,760
"Sea of clouds cascading from above."

183
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,200
That sentence alone reminds me of the magnificent view where thousands of horses tread upon the plains.

184
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,340
Even if this were an boundless sea, stretching far and wide,

185
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,660
with the fastest ship traversing a thousand li each day for years or decades,

186
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,100
it would still be impossible to explore the entire realm of clouds.

187
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,860
The world is full of vibrant and wondrous experiences, with countless sights and things yet unseen.

188
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,260
That's why you said "when autumn water comes, streams flow into the river" isn't enough.

189
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,880
Indeed.

190
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,640
When the autumn waters come, the River Deity may be proud.

191
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,740
Yet before the vast sea, he can only lament his own insignificance.

192
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,020
Not to mention the sea of clouds we're looking at right now.

193
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:29,120
But in the presence of such a magnificent view, nothing matters that much.

194
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,900
With your internal strength gone, just train anew. It's nothing major.

195
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,260
You can always turn back as long as you're not at the end of the road.

196
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,610
You can always turn back as long as you're not at the end of the road.

197
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,120
The Scholarly Deity invented the Autumn Water Technique, a profound internal strength technique,

198
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,020
after witnessing the autumn rain flowing into the river.

199
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,720
Now, you've witnessed a magnificent sight as well.

200
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,430
Don't you think it's time for you to invent another technique that's more profound than his?

201
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Are you saying that one can invent an internal strength technique by admiring this view alone?

202
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,720
It's more than just a view you're admiring here.

203
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,600
There's also the Way of Heaven.

204
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,520
For the days to come, you can ponder upon your internal strength behind the stone monument.

205
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,100
Elder.

206
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,120
Are you serious?

207
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,500
Of course. All things have their principles.

208
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,300
Now, you can train in the presence of the Way of Heaven. Not everyone gets an opportunity like this.

209
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,320
You should cherish it.

210
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,280
Elder Mo Yi.

211
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,200
What were you doing?

212
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,120
I was observing the sea. The tide rises and falls, just like life.

213
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:22,200
When my father was young, he was gentle and polite.

214
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,000
My sister grew up together with me. She was once naive and carefree.

215
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,280
Maybe it's because our lifespan is too long.

216
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,900
As we continue on our path,

217
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,400
we get distracted and confused.

218
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,440
When we live as humans, we might be searching for what we desire all the time.

219
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,500
Even if you don't know what you desire, it's fine.

220
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,700
However, you must know what you do not desire.

221
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,660
Once you cast away the things you don't desire, everything will become clearer.

222
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,540
Elder, why did you suddenly turn into a scholar of philosophy?

223
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,200
I'm not used to it.

224
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,740
I'm getting older.

225
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,320
I can't stop myself from sharing my experience with them when I see youngsters I like.

226
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,800
Just let it go.

227
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,580
Brother Yun?

228
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,760
Brother Yun!

229
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,260
Brother Yun!

230
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,820
Let it go.

231
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,420
Brother Yun!

232
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,300
Brother Yun...

233
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,460
Brother Yun!

234
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,700
Ye Dingzhi? Ye Dingzhi!

235
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,300
Ye Dingzhi.

236
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,320
You're finally here.

237
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,340
You asked me to, didn't you?

238
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,100
Go ahead. What do you want?

239
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,440
Release me.

240
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,540
Can you please release me?

241
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,560
Ye Dingzhi! If not, you should just kill me!

242
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,280
Do you think I intend to spare you?

243
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I've killed everyone who participated in the plan.

244
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,500
To protect you, Zhong Feili said that you had nothing to do with the plan before his death.

245
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,460
He took me for a fool.

246
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,120
If so, why are you...

247
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,340
It's because...

248
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,640
I need a puppet.

249
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,080
More importantly,

250
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,980
I realize that you suffer more like this.

251
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,580
Don't you like playing hard-to-get?

252
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,140
Then enjoy this process.

253
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,140
Enjoy the fun.

254
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,600
Ye Dingzhi! Ye Dingzhi, come back!

255
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,400
Come back! Release me!

256
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,000
Come back!

257
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,800
Ye Dingzhi!

258
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,700
Ye Dingzhi!

259
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,500
Come back!

260
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,700
I am the old Left Guardian of Tian Wai Tian, Zi Yuji, Purple Robe Marquis.

261
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,800
I am the old Right Guardian of Tian Wai Tian, Mo Qixuan, the White-Haired Deity.

262
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,100
We ask to return to the sect.

263
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,780
Don't you guys fear me?

264
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,900
I was supposed to be dead.

265
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,420
You were the one who saved my life.

266
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,920
I have nothing to fear even if you wish to take my life!

267
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,140
I've never saved you before.

268
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,700
After Qixuan and I betrayed our former sect,

269
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,300
we escaped to that bamboo forest and found that shack.

270
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,600
We found this in the shack.

271
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,000
Back then, I was seriously wounded.

272
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,300
I only managed to survive thanks to your medicine.

273
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,400
And, I also received the help of Miss Yan Lingxia.

274
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,000
Although you had no idea, Qixuan and I are still indebted to you.

275
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,500
And?

276
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,200
And, you're strong enough.

277
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,740
Only those who are truly strong can lead us out of these icy plains.

278
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,600
We only believe in the power of one's sword.

279
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,380
You two wanted to return to the sect, right?

280
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,360
Why are you two still here?

281
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,500
Thank you, Sect Leader.

282
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,780
 It was all part of a game.

283
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,080
 If one isn't strong enough, you'll end up as a pawn.

284
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,740
 That's why my father was accused of treason, and his entire clan was executed.

285
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,100
 That's why my wife was taken away on numerous occasions.

286
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,820
 Why I could never live in peace!

287
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,820
 From now on, I no longer want to be a pawn.

288
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,860
 I want to be the one who controls the pawns.

289
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,580
A game. A pawn.

290
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,940
I'm sure you're not doing this of your own accord.

291
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,600
Even if I'm stuck in the game, I'll finish it my own way!

292
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,160
No. I won't let you go.

293
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,140
Why bother?

294
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,620
If you don't let go, your inner demon will keep pestering you.

295
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:44,060
You'll never move on, or be released from this torment as long as it pesters you.

296
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,600
I've told you I won't let go.

297
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,880
It's already been so long. You keep thinking about that day.

298
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,480
But that day has already happened. Everything is already set in stone!

299
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,960
What's the point in holding on?

300
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,660
Who said everything has been set in stone?

301
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,900
It's not over as long as I think the path I'm treading upon isn't over yet!

302
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,900
But my path has already ended.

303
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,760
I chose this path...

304
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,100
of my own accord.

305
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,400
Stop dwelling on it.

306
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,300
It's pointless.

307
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,700
Just give up.

308
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,100
No.

309
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,200
Why would you tell me to give up if giving up doesn't make a difference?

310
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,240
Brother Yun, come back.

311
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,100
Farewell.

312
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,300
Brother Yun! Come back!

313
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,900
You're not allowed to leave!

314
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,203
Not bad.

315
00:29:13,203 --> 00:29:15,460

316
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,340
Elder Mo Yi?

317
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,620
How did it go?

318
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,580
For one year, my dantian was empty. 
(TN: where qi resides)

319
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,800
But today, internal strength is gushing out of my body.

320
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,400
My body is filled with internal strength.

321
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,200
You've been mediating for a year.

322
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,700
It's not strange for you to achieve this feat.

323
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,400
Have you straightened out your thoughts?

324
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,300
I want to go and bring him back.

325
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,900
What if he doesn't agree to leave with you?

326
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,600
Then, I'll reason with him.

327
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,800
I'll persuade him and bring him back.

328
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,020
Good. At least you have an aspiration.

329
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,220
Elder Mo Yi, why does it sound like you were mocking me?

330
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,220
However, there's no rush.

331
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,360
Compared to finding him,
I think I prefer to take a bath first.

332
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,780
Exhilarating! Elder Mo Yi, you said the autumn rain wasn't enough.

333
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,200
Now, even the sea of clouds isn't enough either!

334
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,900
What will be enough, then?

335
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,900
The sky!

336
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,200
Only the vast sky will satisfy me!

337
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,600
My internal strength technique, is called Hanging Sky.

338
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,080
Come.

339
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,520
Who said you could grow such a long beard?

340
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:02,400
Yao'er, when I went beyond the stone monument, I lost the concept of time.

341
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,100
It's already been over a year, yet it feels like it's only been a few days.

342
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,600
Only my beard can tell the truth.

343
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,400
But I did gain something out of it.

344
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,800
I invented my internal strength technique. It's called Hanging Sky.

345
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,820
Not bad, right?

346
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,780
Yes, yes.

347
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:24,600
But it would be even better if you shave your beard.

348
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,380
Don't move.

349
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,140
Otherwise, I might cut your face by accident.

350
00:32:53,128 --> 00:32:55,188
♫  The cold breeze dies down  ♫

351
00:32:55,188 --> 00:33:00,528
♫  Swallows and sparrows weave through the dense forest  ♫

352
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:09,588
♫  The mists covers my vision, as if I haven't awaken from a dream yet  ♫

353
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,863
♫  There are truly countless beautiful scenes  ♫

354
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,536
All done.

355
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:22,968
♫  Until a single red leaf embraces the passing years  ♫

356
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:26,788
♫  Only then can one appreciate the beauty of seasons  ♫

357
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:34,208
♫  Joy and sorrow are fleeting and short-lived  ♫

358
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:42,628
♫  Yet in a glance, a sudden wind pulls at the heartstrings  ♫

359
00:33:42,628 --> 00:33:46,728
♫  Making it hard to discern between the thoughts and reality  ♫

360
00:33:46,728 --> 00:33:51,748
♫  Longing for the unrealistic beauty I imagine, to hold it in my palm in winter  ♫

361
00:33:51,748 --> 00:33:54,548
♫  I still search for those beautiful eyes  ♫

362
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:59,888
♫  Living boldly, while every day feels like a year  ♫

363
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:04,328
♫  It's hard to untangle the emotions in my heart,  ♫

364
00:34:04,328 --> 00:34:09,028
♫  the countless knots stirring  ♫

365
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:11,748
♫  I wait for the half full moon, so that we may meet again  ♫

366
00:34:11,748 --> 00:34:16,628
♫  I wait for the half full moon, so that we may meet again  ♫

367
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,500
That brat Baili Dongjun, actually entered the Mental Phase of the Unknown for a second just now.

368
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,740
Interesting.

369
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,000
It's a shame that it only lasted for an instant.

370
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,260
Elder Mo Yi, it's time for us to leave.

371
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,080
Once I bring Ye Dingzhi back from Tian Wai Tian.

372
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,740
I'll invite you to Xueyue City to try the liquor I brew.

373
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,780
See you then.

374
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,260
I hope we won't see each other again.

375
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,980
People say that deities transcend emotions and feelings.

376
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,560
Elder, you're heartless indeed.

377
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:28,700
If you do see me again,
you'll regret what you said today.

378
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,860
Initially, I was worried as Ye Dingzhi had absorbed all of your internal strength.

379
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,300
I never expected you to recover your powers this soon.

380
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,600
And became stronger, too.

381
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:02,020
But the thing I'm happiest about is that you look as vigorous as always.

382
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,460
Senior, what about you?

383
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,400
How have you been for the past two years?

384
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,860
It's been good, and not good.

385
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,300
What do you mean?

386
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,980
It's a long story.

387
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,820
Let's talk inside.

388
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,100
Is that guy outside Baili Dongjun?

389
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,080
Then, I'll take a good look at him later.

390
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,140
Sister.

391
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,140
I went to Riverside Manor with your token.

392
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,980
I've become your master's disciple too.

393
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,840
From now on, you can't call me sister anymore.

394
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,720
You have to call me Junior according to seniority.

395
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,040
Sister Luoxia, stop teasing me.

396
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,660
It's fun to tease you.

397
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,540
Young Master Baili, I've long heard of your name.

398
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,740
I never expected my name to be that famous in the martial world even though I've been away for a few years.

399
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,440
I'm ashamed.

400
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,620
It's not about your name, you know? It's...

401
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,260
Sister!

402
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,400
- Master. 
 - Have a seat.

403
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,140
Senior, what did you mean by that?

404
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,400
Did you encounter some trouble?

405
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,120
It's the guy that you wish to avoid the most.

406
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,060
Was it Ye Dingzhi?

407
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,540
That's right.

408
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,780
Half a year ago, a sudden force emerged from the northwest of Beili.

409
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,420
They unified all the sects on the icy plains.

410
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,980
They were unpredictable and ruthless. People call them a demonic sect.

411
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,080
They kept harassing the borders of Beili.

412
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,780
Therefore, Beili sent out some expert martial artists to fend them off.

413
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,360
None of them were their match.

414
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,660
Because we have no idea about their background, we dare not act recklessly.

415
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:16,500
Until last month, three veterans of the martial arts world infiltrated the demonic sect.

416
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,600
They intended to take down the sect leader of the demonic sect to leave them leaderless.

417
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,060
They were prepared to sacrifice their lives to achieve their goal.

418
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,160
But we never imagined...

419
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,900
 that none of them died.

420
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,080
 All of them came back alive.

421
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,499
 Before the martial arts world of Beili could celebrate,

422
00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:44,660
 they realized that these three veterans had lost all of their powers

423
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,700
 even though they were still alive.

424
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,000
 They said the person who did this to them was the demonic sect's leader.

425
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,920
 His name was Ye Dingzhi.

426
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,260
Dongjun, what's on your mind?

427
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,980
I'm thinking about Brother Yun.

428
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,880
I'll definitely bring him back.

429
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:53,940

430
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,321

431
00:39:57,321 --> 00:39:59,740
