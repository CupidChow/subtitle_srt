and traveled around.

137
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,740
He taught me several sword techniques.

When I asked him who he was,

139
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,660
he only said

140
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,100
that he was a wandering martial artist
from Jiangnan.

141
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,460
Back then, I admired him.

with an opportunity.

165

Right now, Beili's foes
are closing in from three directions.

166

At this moment,

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,820

when you narrowly won against him.

171

But from the moment
you escaped with him on your back,

172
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,620
the entire Beili

173
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,420

176

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,300
Our scout said

188
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,140
that Baili Dongjun escaped southward

189
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,100
with Mr. Ye.

190
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,460
However, he didn't know

191
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,860
where they were heading.

192
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,460
Southward?

193
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,300
Could it be Nanjue?

194
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,140
No.

195
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,900
Father will head to Gusu City.

196
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,980
Father

197
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,700
doesn't want to be the leader of a sect.

198
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,740
He only wants to return to that hut.

199
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,740
Child as you are,

200
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,620
what you said are profound.

201
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,820
You're still a child.

202
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,740
Leave all this

203
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,020
to us adults.

204
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,660
I burned some sleeping grass.

205
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,580
He overexerted himself.

206
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,500
However, he does possess
great internal strength.

207
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,260
We should lower our volume.

208
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,500
Mr. Ye, what do you want to tell me?

209
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,620
I assume you know.

210
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,100
I've heard of many instances

211
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,180
of descent into demonhood.

212
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,820
But I've never seen one like yours.

213
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,900
You're clear-headed.

214
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,380
You still have a conscience as well.

215
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,260
What kind of
descent into demonhood is this?

216
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,780
Shouldn't they

217
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,980
be irrational

218
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,260
and filled with bloodlust?

219
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,380
Only a thin line lies
between demonhood and deityhood.

220
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,460
Before this,

221
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,300
I didn't care about
the people of the world.

222
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,940
I wanted to kill everyone

223
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,620
who saw me as their enemy.

224
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,180
To those who uphold righteousness,

225
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,020
I'm a demon.

226
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,980
Dongjun.

227
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,700
He wishes to save the world.

228
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,300
He wishes to save me as well.

229
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,660
That's not the path of righteousness

230
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,900
or demonhood.

231
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,020
What is it, then?

232
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,100
It's

233
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,460
his path.

234
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,220
But no matter how broad his path is,

235
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,340
I cannot travel

236
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,900
on the same path with him.

237
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:21,940
I'm leaving.

238
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,740
You need not waste your energy
in stopping me.

239
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,460
I don't wish to hurt you either.

240
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,220
But your wound is...

241
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,620
It's fine.

242
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,620
Dongjun didn't target my vital points.

243
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,340
Moreover, you should be aware

244
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,780
of the regenerative abilities
of Xunian Art.

245
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,300
All right.

246
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,300
Once he's awake,

247
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,180
travel westward with him.

248
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,300
The faster, the further,

249
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,460
the better.

250
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,660
Do not try

251
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,100
to make any contact with me again.

252
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,740
I'll end all this

253
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,020
in my way.

254
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,660
It smells great.

255
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:10,740
Here.

256
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,700
Here, try this.

257
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,700
It's delicious.

258
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,780
It's not raining.

259
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,060
Why are you holding an umbrella?

260
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,740
It's an umbrella

261
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,340
as well as a weapon.

262
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,460
It's the legendary
Eighteen-Sword Formation, right?

263
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,580
I do wish to witness it myself.

264
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,700
It's a shame

265
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,460
that I'll be

266
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,500
witnessing it as your enemy.

267
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,020
What are you laughing at?

268
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,980
Because it's hilarious.

269
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,060
I've never heard of anyone

270
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,740
trying to spar with
the Dark River's Umbrella Ghost before.

271
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,580
Do you have any idea

272
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,180
how terrifying it is?

273
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,740
I wish to spar with

274
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,260
powerful swordsmen in the world.

275
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:06,780
You do have a point.

276
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,020
Miss Li...

277
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,820
I mean, Mr. Li,

278
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,300
you can become
a Sword Deity in the future.

279
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,460
You did draw your sword

280
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,260
against Mount Wangcheng twice before.

281
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,580
Does this peach look familiar to you?

282
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,220
Yuzhen planted it.

283
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,820
I spoke too much.

284
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,260
Oh, right.

285
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,820
I wanted to ask you this just now,

286
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,260
mister.

287
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,420
This isn't the season

288
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,740
for peaches yet.

289
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,780
Indeed.

290
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,020
Yuzhen

291
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,300
set up a formation

292
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,260
on Mount Wangcheng.

293
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,020
Because of that,

294
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,420
we can enjoy peaches all year long.

295
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,420
It's a huge mountain,

296
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,740
yet he can set up
a formation there without any trouble?

297
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,420
Seems like this junior of yours

298
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,300
is extraordinary.

299
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,500
Mr. Li.

300
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,020
Here you go.

301
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,060
You should eat while you can.

302
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,900
Maybe

303
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,180
this will be the last peach

304
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,300
you eat in this life.

305
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,020
My old friends are here, huh?

306
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,100
It's been a while.

307
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,340
It's been a long time since we met

308
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,500
after parting ways at the Academy.

309
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,700
However, I won't regret my decision.

310
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,820
Ye.

311
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,740
During the Spring Festival's Eve,

312
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,740
I was there.

313
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,500
Initially, I wanted to visit you.

314
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,820
But I didn't.

315
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,500
Before this, you said
we would meet again.

316
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,220
Now that we've met again,

317
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,020
I'm pleased.

318
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,220
When I saw you back then,

319
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
you were still dashing
and brimming with energy.

320
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,180
I wanted to challenge you to a duel

321
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,460
hoping to win by a single move.

322
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,220
I never expected myself

323
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
to come here with all these people

324
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,180
to try and kill you now.

325
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,580
You see,

326
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,460
life is

327
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,700
truly unpredictable sometimes.

328
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,020
The Dark River's assassins, huh?

329
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,740
I've heard of you guys before.

330
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,260
I heard

331
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,580
that you intend to kill

332
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,620
when you start to spin your umbrella.

333
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,140
Wuchan.

334
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,260
Master, Ye is in trouble!

335
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,020
I'll go and...

336
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,980
Wuchan,

337
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,620
there's a consequence for every cause.

338
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,660
This is the karma he has to bear.

339
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,580
You're truly
the hardest assassination target

340
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,180
I've ever encountered.

341
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,380
Ye Dingzhi!

342
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,220
It's not too late for you to escape!

343
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,100
Watch out!

344
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,060
Muyu.

345
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,780
I finally understand now.

346
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,900
The seven of us aren't enough.

347
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,940
Just you, me,

348
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,100
and the unyielding Li Hanyi

349
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,820
are trying to kill him, huh?

350
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,220
What has the Dark River done

351
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,580
to deserve this?

352
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,620
He hasn't recovered from his injury yet.

353
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,140
It isn't time yet.

354
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,260
If so, I'll leave the last blow

355
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,140
to you, then.

356
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,340
What's the name of this technique?

357
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,460
It's called Muyu.

358
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,020
It does resemble
a beautiful rain of swords.

359
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,300
The Xuanfeng Sword
left behind by my master

360
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,420
was just like this.

361
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,260
It's a shame

362
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,220
that I don't have it with me now.

363
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,380
Lend me your sword.

364
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,420
Yao,

365
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,260
you should've stopped Yun.

366
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,980
He was bent on
not dragging you into this.

367
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,460
He insisted on parting ways with you.

368
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,900
You wouldn't be able to stop him
even if you were awake.

369
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,860
There's no need to waste your energy

370
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,220
and let the pursuers

371
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,140
take advantage of the situation.

372
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,220
Dongjun,

373
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,860
if there's one person in the world

374
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,260
who can change his mind,

375
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,940
it can only be Yi Wenjun.

376
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,420
Ji Ruofeng.

377
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,140
What are you doing here

378
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,300
instead of recuperating?

379
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,660
On my way here,

380
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,100
I've witnessed the annihilation

381
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,060
of many sects.

382
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,940
Many innocent people
were killed as well.

383
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,180
They were committed by the sect members
of the demonic sect

384
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,340
who infiltrated Beili.

385
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,180
Although it might not have been

386
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,580
Ye Dingzhi's order,

387
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,220
in the end, it's still related to him.

388
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,300
If you save him,

389
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,220
that means

390
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,940
you're going against
the martial world of Beili.

391
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,700
However, you represent the Academy.

392
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,780
You represent Xueyue City

393
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,140
and Beili's path of righteousness.

394
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,140
Although the old man

395
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,260
didn't give me any instructions,

396
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,420
I have to stop you here.

397
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,940
Try me, then.

398
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,020
You think you're saving him.

399
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,900
You have no idea that you're killing him

400
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,860
by doing so.

401
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,860
What do you mean?

402
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,980
Although Ye Dingzhi has entered
the Malevolence Phase,

403
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,740
he still has feelings

404
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,580
for those around him.

405
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,300
You're his best friend.

406
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,700
Due to that, he'll

407
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,820
not accept your grace.

408
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,980
It's because

409
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,300
he's the vilest person
in the world right now.

410
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,620
If you save him,

411
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,620
you'll be pushing yourself
into the abyss

412
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,340
and to the point of no return.

413
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,340
Therefore, he'll never let you

414
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,060
save him.

415
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,740
If you wish to bring him to Nanjue,

416
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,660
he'll stay in Beili.

417
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:48,980
Can you understand me

418
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,900
if I put it that way?

419
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,540
So, in your opinion,

420
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,820
what should I do?

421
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,860
Let Ye Dingzhi engage them in battle

422
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,300
and escape by himself.

423
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,020
If he wins against
the martial world of Beili

424
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,220
and manages to escape to Nanjue,

425
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,660
that means he's lucky.

426
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,420
If he loses and dies,

427
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,260
that's his affair.

428
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,020
It has nothing to do with you,

429
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,260
Baili Dongjun.

430
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,540
You've done enough for him.

431
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,220
You've committed
plenty of mistakes as well.

432
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
Although the world
has let Ye Dingzhi down,

433
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,100
Ye Dingzhi

434
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,060
already exacted his revenge
against the world.

435
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,900
It's too late for him to turn back.

436
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,220
Now, he has no choice but to be a demon.

437
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,580
As for you,

438
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,860
if you insist on taking this path,

439
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,980
you'll cease

440
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,260
to be Baili Dongjun of the Academy

441
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,100
and Xueyue City.

442
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,940
Gu Chen, Li Changsheng,

443
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,900
and Nangong Chunshui,

444
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,940
all advised you
to act according to your will in life.

445
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
You may do so,

446
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,980
but that doesn't mean
you should act recklessly.

447
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
You should stop here.

448
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,940
If not,

449
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,700
this time, I won't reserve my strength.

450
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,340
I'll fight you to the death.

451
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,420
Miss Yue Yao,

452
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,740
what do you think

453
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,580
about my speech?

454
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,020
In my opinion,

455
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,980
of course I wish for Dongjun

456
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,860
to be safe.

457
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,260
I hope he can return to Xueyue City

458
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,020
in a carefree manner.

459
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,180
But now I

460
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,940
have decided to follow Dongjun's will.

461
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,380
If Dongjun wants to leave,
I'll leave with him.

462
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,620
If he wishes to fight,
I'll fight alongside him.

463
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,980
Chief, if you wish
to fight us to the death,

464
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,940
you will die

465
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,740
as we outnumber you two to one.

466
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,820
Miss Yue Yao,

467
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,020
you're impressive indeed.

468
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,700
There are plenty of things I can accept.

469
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,180
But I can never accept

470
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,340
Yun's death.

471
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,300
Never.

472
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,500
As long as I can protect him for now,

473
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,140
I can negotiate a deal

474
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,420
with the emperor

475
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,460
and the major sects of Beili after this.

476
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,340
You make it sound too easy.

477
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,980
Someone's here.

478
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,460
Mr. Ye, you're powerful indeed.

479
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,780
You thought

480
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,740
you utilized the best chance you had.

481
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,460
But in the face of me,

482
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,700
you stand no chance at all.

483
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,740
No.

484
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,940
I know

485
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,860
that the chance hasn't appeared yet.

486
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,660
That's the chance
we've been waiting for.

487
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,940
It's as if you all
rehearsed that countless times

488
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,180
before you could execute
such a joint attack.

489
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,420
But it also contained the resolve

490
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,980
that came from exhausting all efforts

491
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,180
for the first time.

492
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,820
Maybe this is

493
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,580
the chemistry between swordsmen.

494
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,780
I once thought of

495
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,460
becoming such a swordsman as well.

496
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,020
Wang,

497
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:52,980
I'm sorry.

498
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,820
I broke your blade.

499
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,660
I said it before.

500
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,660
You all...

501
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,700
I hid some sword qi

502
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,940
within my sword of blood.

503
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,380
It'll rupture

504
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,020
your internal organs

505
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,380
if you don't come up
with a solution soon.

506
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,380
He's regulating his qi

507
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,100
to force out that sword qi of yours.

508
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,100
We just need someone

509
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,380
to go there

510
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,540
and chop off his head.

511
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,020
There's no way around it.

512
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,660
None of us reserved our strength

513
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,500
due to that joint attack.

514
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,580
That's how it is for opportunities.

515
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,620
You only get them once.

516
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:49,860
No.

517
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,660
One of us

518
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,460
hasn't acted yet.
