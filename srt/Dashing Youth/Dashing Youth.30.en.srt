28
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,580
Because you are not worth my time.

29
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,220

193
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,620
to meet you here today.

194
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,820
Since when

195
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,460
did you start speaking so pompously??

196
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,580
I beg your pardon.

197
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,380
Also, I would like you to see

198
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,300
the countenance of the Marquis.

199
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,380
Forget about that.

200
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,060
Why don't you

201
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,820
see the countenance of Mr. Li?

202
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,180
Master, you...

203
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
Long time no see.

204
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,660
Su Zhe,

205
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,700
we also haven't seen each other
in quite some time, right?

206
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,100
Oh, it's Mr. Li.

207
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,660
It has been a long time.

208
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,340
This man

209
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,140
is the world's top martial artist,
Mr. Li?

210
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,540
If I kill him,

211
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,700
I can take over his place.

212
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,580
If so, you will be
the world's top idiot.

213
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,980
Do you still want to see

214
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,980
the countenance of the Marquis?

215
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,540
I don't think so.

216
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,060
I have seen

217
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,580
what I should see.

218
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,300
Changhe, Muyu,

219
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,180
let's go.

220
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,100
Master, you...

221
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,020
We will catch up after reaching Tianqi.

222
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,660
Let's go.

223
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,660
Send a message to the first client.

224
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,820
"Mission failed

225
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,540
because of Li Changsheng."

226
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,340
Send a message to the second client.

227
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,700
"Mission accomplished

228
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,340
because of Li Changsheng."

229
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,140
How was it?

230
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,340
How do you feel

231
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,420
after meeting an old acquaintance

232
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,020
after years?

233
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,700
What I went through,

234
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,260
still gives me the jitters.

235
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,540
That man named Su Zhe

236
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,220
was once the top martial artist
of the Su Family.

237
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,180
I know.

238
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,780
He's the Conical Hat Ghost.

239
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,620
But don't worry.

240
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,700
You are no longer part of Dark River,

241
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,620
so even the Conical Hat Ghost

242
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,580
can not catch you.

243
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,700
Since he recognized you,

244
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,340
he probably figured out

245
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,140
that we used a mask.

246
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,820
Fortunately, Su Leng's imitation
was convincing.

247
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,300
It is worth my effort to tell you

248
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,300
about Master the whole night.

249
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,900
I do blame Ruofeng

250
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,780
because of Yun,

251
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,460
but I won't question

252
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,420
any promise

253
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,820
he makes to me.

254
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,980
The thing is...

255
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,140
What's it?

256
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,220
I have my plan.

257
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,660
Come in.

258
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,980
[Su Leng, Mu Fengqing]
Greetings, Mr. Baili.

259
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,900
This is Su Leng.

260
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,660
One of Grandfather's bodyguards.

261
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,340
His father went on an expedition

262
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,100
with Grandfather.

263
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,980
His father was the best spy in the army.

264
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,660
A spy?

265
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,020
They are good at impersonation.

266
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,660
They can convincingly play

267
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,260
a peasant or a merchant.

268
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,300
This lady

269
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,260
is adept at Face-Changing Arts.

270
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,940
She creates face masks

271
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,780
that are so flawless

272
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,140
that they can completely pass as real.

273
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,740
Miss,

274
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:46,940
I would like to ask you

275
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,900
to create a face mask for me.

276
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,900
Who do you want to disguise as?

277
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,020
Him.

278
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,980
Who is he?

279
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,620
This is an exact duplicate

280
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,700
of my drawing.

281
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,540
Dark River is prudent.

282
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,700
They wouldn't dare take the risk.

283
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,060
Mr. Su.

284
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,740
What brings you here

285
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,820
from the main hall?

286
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,740
Something urgent, of course.

287
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,180
Something urgent?

288
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,220
What's it about?

289
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,700
After you two left,

290
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,220
Soul Reaper Hall received

291
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,500
its new orders.

292
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,820
New orders?

293
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,940
One order is to kill Baili Luochen,

294
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,060
while the other one

295
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,300
is to save him.

296
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,460
Mr. Su,

297
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,220
Dark River never accepts orders

298
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,860
with conflicting interests.

299
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,980
Once we accept a client,

300
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,180
no matter

301
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,260
how hefty the price
the second client offers,

302
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,940
we won't renege.

303
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,220
What changed

304
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,620
that old man's mind

305
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,740
to engage

306
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,860
in such unethical business?

307
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,380
First,

308
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,700
killing Baili Luochen

309
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,820
is no easy task.

310
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,260
Of course, that's not
the most important thing.

311
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,620
Most importantly,

312
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,580
the second client

313
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,540
has a more dignified identity.

314
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:31,980
Your Majesty.

315
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,540
How was it?

316
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,460
It succeeded.

317
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,100
Very well.

318
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,500
But something went wrong.

319
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,860
What went wrong?

320
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,880
Mr. Li showed up again.

321
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,780
As long as the second client

322
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,380
is determined enough,

323
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,820
the first client

324
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,540
will wind up dead.

325
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,620
Li Changsheng?

326
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,740
Why is Li Changsheng back?

327
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,580
Even so,

328
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,220
why is he

329
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,860
with Baili Luochen?

330
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,660
Why are they all

331
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,900
in my way?

332
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,580
Just why? Why?

333
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,180
Your Highness, please calm down.

334
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,620
Calm down?

335
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,660
How can I stay calm?

336
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,260
Your Highness,

337
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,140
I have an idea.

338
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,460
Fire away.

339
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,580
His Majesty

340
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,940
is wary of Li Changsheng.

341
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,660
This time, he showed up together

342
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,500
with Baili Luochen,

343
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,420
isn't that a chance for us

344
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,660
to clean them up in a fell swoop?

345
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,620
You are

346
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,220
so clever.

347
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,860
I'm just easing your burden.

348
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,940
Ease my burden, my foot!

349
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,180
Your Highness.

350
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,060
Do you know who Li Changsheng is?

351
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,580
To clean them up in a fell swoop,
you say?

352
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,660
Even if all the experts in the palace

353
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
and the State Preceptor join forces,

354
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,100
they are no match for him.

355
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,700
And you want me to kill him?

356
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,100
Do you want to get killed?

357
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,660
Or do you want me to get killed?

358
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,500
Bugger off!

359
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,380
Yes, Your Highness.

360
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,660
Top Leader thinks

361
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,140
it's no harm

362
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,060
to take money from a dying person.

363
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,020
Li Changsheng?

364
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,860
Didn't he claim

365
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,580
that he wouldn't return to Tianqi City?

366
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,660
I don't believe it was him.

367
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,700
Look into this.

368
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,060
Yes.

369
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:18,980
Dongjun,

370
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,620
I need to return to the palace
to report for duty.

371
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,900
You check in at a stage station first.

372
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,980
I mustn't be seen with you,

373
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,940
so I can't come these days.

374
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,740
All right.

375
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,050
[Stage Station]

376
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,860
Well, Censor Zhang,

377
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,060
you keep pacing

378
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,500
back and forth.

379
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,740
I'm getting dizzy.

380
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,460
What's the point
of wringing your hands here?

381
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,220
Just take whatever comes at you.

382
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,900
Oh, my.

383
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,660
You are actually in a mood

384
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,540
to drink even now.

385
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,780
Censor Zhang, how could you say that?

386
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,740
This is Diaolou Tavern.

387
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,820
Since you are here,

388
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,820
isn't it a waste

389
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
if you don't taste the nice brew here?

390
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,260
Come on and drink.

391
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,540
His Majesty ordered
the Imperial Censorate to send someone

392
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,020
to interrogate the Marquis of Zhenxi.

393
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,300
How about you go?

394
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,540
Uh...

395
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,540
That won't do.

396
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,900
I can have a drink here.

397
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,260
But I can't do

398
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,540
the interrogation.

399
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,100
What good are you?

400
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,260
I thought

401
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,260
you had gotten used to the fact

402
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,540
that I'm an idler
in the Imperial Censorate.

403
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,180
Censor Zhang,

404
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,940
I have had enough liquor today.

405
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,580
I will leave you
to your trouble alone here.

406
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,700
Well, I...

407
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,020
You!

408
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,540
I shall take my leave.

409
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,340
Goodbye.

410
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,220
This is

411
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,260
a nice brew.

412
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,940
Luckily, I didn't drink much today.

413
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,700
Otherwise,

414
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,940
I would be done for

415
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,260
if my dear found me reeking of liquor.

416
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,820
[Baihua Pleasure House]

417
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,540
No sooner

418
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,420
had I stepped out of Diaolou Tavern

419
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
than I entered

420
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,740
the Baihua Pleasure House.

421
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,940
I sure have enjoyed
both brew and beauties today.

422
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,580
However,

423
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,780
I have an uninvited guest.

424
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,500
Censor Hu, cheers.

425
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,740
I have seen you.

426
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,420
On the wanted list.

427
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,340
Censor Hu, you are funny.

428
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,580
Do you really think

429
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,580
I'm being funny with you?

430
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,500
It doesn't matter.

431
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,700
What matters is

432
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,980
that my sword is faster.

433
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,660
Yes, it's funny.

434
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,500
General Ye

435
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,820
was my father's acquaintance.

436
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,420
How could I

437
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,020
arrest his son?

438
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,180
That's impossible. Not a chance.

439
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:11,980
My friend,

440
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,820
how can I help you?

441
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,820
I have heard a lot about you, Censor Hu.

442
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,060
I came here

443
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,460
with a favor to ask of you.

444
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,420
I'm afraid

445
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,300
I can't help you with that.

446
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,940
You haven't even heard what it is.

447
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,980
The Marquis of Zhenxi is now

448
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,500
a hot potato.

449
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,340
I still want to slouch
in the Imperial Censorate

450
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,940
for some more years.

451
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,020
Are you really that kind of person?

452
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,820
Why not?

453
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,340
I am.

454
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,620
I have a buddy

455
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,300
named Baili Dongjun.

456
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,740
He is the grandson

457
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,220
of the Marquis of Zhenxi, Baili Luochen.

458
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,740
I know.

459
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,540
I suppose you know his name

460
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,140
not because

461
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,860
he is Baili Luochen's grandson.

462
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,780
Instead, it's because

463
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,700
of his Seven Starry Nights

464
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,900
winning Qiulubai

465
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,020
in Diaolou Tavern, right?

466
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,300
What are you getting at?

467
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,340
Just speak.

468
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,580
He's here.

469
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,820
Don't you want to

470
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,140
have a few drinks with him?

471
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,580
Well,

472
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,220
people always

473
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,220
look for some indecent excuses

474
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,580
to hide their true intention to help.

475
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,850
[Stage Station]

476
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,060
Your Lordship,
someone seeks an audience.

477
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,460
Bring him in.

478
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,580
Greetings, Your Lordship.

479
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,220
Did you steal this uniform?

480
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,260
Dongjun, don't be rude.

481
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,060
This is Censor Hu Bufei.

482
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,740
Three generations in his family
have been in service.

483
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,580
They are the pillars of the nation.

484
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:44,860
Your Lordship,

485
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,220
that sounds

486
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,780
rather ironic, though.

487
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,260
Oh, it's the Censor.

488
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,260
Why?

489
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,700
Are you going to interrogate us
on our turf?

490
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,620
Uh...

491
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,420
I wouldn't dare.

492
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,660
I heard

493
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,140
that the genius brewmaster

494
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,740
who defeated Qiulubai

495
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,260
with his Seven Starry Nights
in Diaolou Tavern

496
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,820
is here,

497
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,620
that's why I came

498
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,420
to ask for a drink.

499
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,540
I have two cups of liquor here,

500
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,100
a pleasant one
and an unpleasant one.

501
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,820
Which one do you prefer?

502
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,340
Your Lordship,

503
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,660
Mr. Baili

504
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,780
is quite different

505
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,540
from what I heard.

506
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,020
Seeing him today,

507
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,300
he has some hard edges,

508
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,380
which resemble you

509
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,660
back then.

510
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,220
He is

511
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,500
my grandson.

512
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,420
Shouldn't he resemble me?

513
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,060
Have a seat.

514
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,620
This is the finest Biluochun tea.

515
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,140
Use the tea fragrance

516
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,740
to cover your liquor smell.

517
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,460
Otherwise, you will have
a hard time when you get home.

518
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,140
Your wife can be quite fierce.

519
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,860
Your Lordship, you still remember her.

520
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,100
Well,

521
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,620
since you are willing
to have tea with me,

522
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,740
I shall obey you.

523
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,660
Grandfather,

524
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,460
have you

525
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,140
met him before?

526
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,060
You both seem quite familiar.

527
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,700
His father

528
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,740
is the principal academician
of Longyun Pavilion,

529
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,340
Hu Cheng.

530
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,860
Back then,

531
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,460
he was my classmate.

532
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,140
Academician Hu

533
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,260
once held you

534
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,900
when you were little.

535
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,780
An academician?

536
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,860
How come

537
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,820
he doesn't take after his father?

538
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,340
Are you not going to tell me

539
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,540
the business of the Imperial Censorate?

540
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,060
What business?

541
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
Has the Imperial Censorate

542
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,540
ever had any serious business?

543
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,780
Funny lad.

544
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,060
Those sorry bunch
in the Imperial Censorate

545
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,300
dare not come to me.

546
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,260
They see me as a hot potato,

547
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,700
so you were sent here.

548
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,530
But you are a spoiled brat

549
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,140
who lives off

550
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,780
your father's reputation.

551
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,260
You came here to interrogate me.

552
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,820
Surely, you won't find out anything,

553
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,780
good or bad,

554
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,460
from me.

555
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,940
Your Lordship,

556
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,100
you are insightful.

557
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,100
However,

558
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,260
the Imperial Censorate

559
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,140
underestimated me.

560
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,340
You don't question me,

561
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,780
but I want to tell.

562
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,380
I'm not listening.

563
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,460
No, I'm not.

564
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,180
Do you want me

565
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,260
to twist your ears open?

566
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,340
Yes, please, Your Lordship.

567
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,620
I'm jotting it down.

568
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,620
The brush you are holding demands lives.

569
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,620
Your Lordship,

570
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,260
I hope

571
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,660
you won't talk too much.

572
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,580
I'm old,

573
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
and I talk a lot.

574
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,460
How about this?

575
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,700
Dongjun, you will speak on my behalf.

576
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,220
The Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion
has 100,000 soldiers

577
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,980
guarding the west gate of the country.

578
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,020
We never intend
to disrupt national safety.

579
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,500
This trip to Tianqi

580
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,300
is led by the Heir, Baili Chengfeng,

581
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,580
with the Pofeng Army.

582
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,340
The Heir is a martial artist
and is impulsive.

583
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,060
However, he has been instructed

584
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,500
to keep the army in check
and not to act rashly,

585
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,340
no matter what happened
during this trip.

586
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,660
The Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion believes

587
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,580
that the Seven Imperial Censors
inspects all officials

588
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,620
judiciously,

589
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,660
and they will clear the name
of the Marquis of Zhenxi.

590
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,700
If necessary,

591
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,380
the Marquis of Zhenxi
is willing to confront

592
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,460
the accuser in court.

593
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,020
I hope you

594
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,500
will relay this wish to His Majesty.

595
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,780
The Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion
will be deeply grateful.

596
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,420
Is that too much?

597
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,260
No, not at all.

598
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,020
Mr. Baili,

599
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,660
your words carry much weight.

600
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
If you say a few more words,

601
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,100
I won't be able to continue

602
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,100
with my trembling hands.

603
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,820
Leave if you want.

604
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,740
I'm not keeping you here.

605
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,060
Dongjun, see him off.

606
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,250
[Stage Station]

607
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:57,900
Mr. Baili,

608
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,300
given what you said just now,

609
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,900
it conveys only a message,

610
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,420
that is, you don't intend
to rebel.

611
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,860
But if someone wants to kill you,

612
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,620
100,000 Pofang soldiers are ready

613
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,580
to charge into Tianqi City.

614
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,020
I'm so impressed.

615
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,180
My friend said

616
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,340
Seven Starry Nights

617
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,180
defeated Qiulubai.

618
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,580
That's right.

619
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,540
I want to drink it.

620
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,140
If you can prove

621
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,220
my grandfather's innocence,

622
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,300
I will give you seven jars of it,

623
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,740
not just seven cups.

624
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,220
Mr. Baili,

625
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,620
I will take your word for it.

626
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,060
I'm having this liquor for sure.

627
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,740
Have the Seven Imperial Censors
reached a verdict?

628
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,340
There is no proof of the Lord's guilt.

629
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,500
Who are the Seven Imperial Censors
to allege him?

630
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,820
Mr. Baili, rest assured.

631
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,340
His Lordship will be safe.

632
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,340
It's just that...

633
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,220
What is it?

634
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,580
Mr. Baili, you ought to be careful.

635
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,140
Of course.

636
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,500
I came here

637
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,740
to keep my grandfather safe.

638
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,100
I won't allow anything to go wrong.

639
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,420
I mean,

640
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,820
you have to be cautious

641
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,260
of the danger to yourself.

642
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,060
The danger to myself?

643
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,260
All right, Mr. Baili,

644
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,100
the Imperial Censorate is
two streets away.

645
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,140
I will head back myself.

646
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,900
Night roads are treacherous.

647
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,660
Please be extra cautious.

648
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,460
I'm leaving.

649
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,260
Mr. Baili.

650
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,700
Tell us

651
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,380
what Baili Luochen told you,

652
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,700
and we won't kill you.

653
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,060
Get lost.

654
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:48,700
You!

655
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,420
You don't want to make this harder.

656
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,180
Why do you people

657
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,220
always threaten me?

658
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,460
So boring.

659
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,660
Let me tell you this.

660
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,820
I don't give a fig

661
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,300
for what you will do.

662
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,340
I only want

663
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,980
to drink what I crave.

664
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,140
Don't waste your breath on him.

665
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:06,740
Take him away!

666
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,540
Thank you, General Ye Jr.

667
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,100
You saw this coming,

668
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,740
didn't you?

669
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,020
Could you have handled this

670
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,220
without me?

671
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,300
That's impossible.

672
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,060
I... I'm nothing but a frail scholar.

673
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,020
Setting aside
the older generation's matter,

674
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,300
I saved your life

675
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,620
today.

676
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,780
Thank you so much, General Ye Jr.

677
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,380
Tianqi City is a place of chaos.

678
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,460
You should leave soon.

679
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,220
All right. One last question.

680
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,580
Commander Luo from the palace

681
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,860
seems not to be in Tianqi City recently.

682
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,580
I think Commander Luo has been sent out

683
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,420
on a mission,

684
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,860
but I don't know

685
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,620
the details.

686
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,660
About my buddy...

687
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,780
They will be safe.

688
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,940
I will take your word for it.

689
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,300
I bet my life on it.

690
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:29,170
[Sun and Moon Shine Together]

691
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,980
Speak.

692
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,580
First,

693
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,980
when Li Changsheng and Baili Dongjun

694
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,220
left Tianqi for a journey back then,

695
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,260
and the former disappeared midway.

696
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,660
Therefore,

697
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,980
that Li Changsheng should be a faker.

698
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,220
Second,

699
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,020
I sent a message to Jinxian and others.

700
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,260
Judging by the dates,

701
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,460
they should arrive in Tianqi in no time.

702
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,050
[Jinxian]

703
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:27,800
[Dream to the Sky]

704
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,060
May I?

705
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,300
Yes, please.

706
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,500
Mister,

707
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,340
give me exactly what he's having.

708
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,460
All right.

709
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,740
- Nice sword.
- Nice sword.

710
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,340
Shen Jingzhou, Wind and Snow Sword.

711
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,940
Ye Dingzhi, an unnamed swordsman.

712
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,140
I heard about you.

713
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,780
You are the disciple
of the Sword Deity, Rain Demon.

714
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,300
Back then,
the Sword Deity brought you to Nanjue

715
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,500
to challenge a couple of experts.

716
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,820
It was awesome.

717
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,500
I was mesmerized when I heard that.

718
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,180
I heard about you, too.

719
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,780
An immortal from beyond

720
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,380
with a sword summoning wind and snow.

721
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,940
The merciful killer,

722
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,900
Shen Jingzhou.

723
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,100
I didn't expect

724
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,780
to run into

725
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,060
the best young swordsman here.

726
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,140
My pleasure.

727
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,540
We should have had a drink

728
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,060
over this fortunate encounter.

729
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,020
Sadly, there is no liquor here.

730
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,420
Why don't we replace that with tea?

731
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,900
I hope you don't mind.

732
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,820
Since you have heard about me,

733
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,420
you should know

734
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,380
my other identity.

735
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,460
I'm Ye Yu's son.

736
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,500
The wanted criminal of Beili.

737
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,300
I also know

738
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,500
the real identity of Shen Jingzhou

739
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,380
who owns the Wind and Snow Sword.

740
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,020
You are the direct disciple

741
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,340
of Grand Eunuch Zhuoqing in the palace.

742
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,260
We are outside Tianqi City.

743
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,100
Since I haven't entered Tianqi,

744
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,420
I'm a martial artist.

745
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,220
So

746
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,100
I'm only Shen Jingzhou.

747
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,460
And you are only

748
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,740
a friend I met by chance,

749
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,980
Ye Dingzhi.

750
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,100
Very well.

751
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,780
Ye, until next time.

752
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,660
Shen, you should roam
in the martial arts world.

753
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,980
Why confide yourself to Tianqi?

754
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,740
Master summons me back urgently.

755
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,660
I have no choice.

756
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:37,900
I see.

757
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,220
Until next time.

758
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,020
Your Majesty,

759
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,820
this case is hard to judge.

760
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,460
Please enlighten me, Your Majesty.

761
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,780
The Xiao Family governs the country
with national laws.

762
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,020
The Imperial Censorate
supervises all officials

763
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,180
according to the national law.

764
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,300
There is no case you can't judge

765
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,460
and no one you can't investigate.

766
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,980
Yet, you are kneeling here

767
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,340
and want me to clarify for you.

768
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,340
If I can decide who is guilty

769
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,060
or innocent,

770
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,340
why do we need the law, then?

771
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,780
And what do I need
the Imperial Censorate for?

772
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:34,940
Zhang Chengzhong,

773
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,180
you have become a dotard.

774
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,180
Your Majesty,

775
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,500
the Imperial Censorate

776
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,220
is responsible
for supervising all officials.

777
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,300
But the Marquis

778
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,140
has 100,000 elite soldiers.

779
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,660
Any verdict made

780
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,780
would probably cause a stir in Beili.

781
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,300
I dare not make a decision.

782
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,740
Zhang Chengzhong,

783
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,900
can the case file in your hands

784
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,820
convict him of treason?

785
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,940
It's difficult to say.

786
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,580
Hu Bufei,

787
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,540
yesterday,

788
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,180
you went to interrogate him.

789
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:11,980
Answer me.

790
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,460
Your Majesty,

791
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,060
I believe the Marquis of Zhenxi

792
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,330
didn't commit treason.

793
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,220
Look at him.

794
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,500
Your Majesty, uh...

795
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,500
Like I said,

796
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,420
judge according to the law.

797
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,700
If he isn't found guilty of treason,

798
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,700
then no.

799
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,020
As for those
who harbor rebellious thoughts,

800
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:35,820
you might go and ask

801
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,860
my sons.

802
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,860
They all harbor such thoughts.

803
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,580
Your Majesty.

804
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:40,820
Zhang Chengzhong,

805
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,060
you have served two emperors.

806
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,420
You are the pillar of the nation.

807
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,020
How come

808
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,260
you are so useless?

809
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,820
Your Majesty,

810
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,580
since this problem

811
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,820
has been solved,

812
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,860
there is another one.

813
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,000
[Depose]

814
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:15,820
Your Majesty!

815
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,100
This is too much, Your Majesty.

816
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,420
I'm saying that you are a disposed good.

817
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,860
You good-for-nothing!

818
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,940
You are right, Your Majesty.

819
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

820
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,940
Creating discord between the Prince
and the first-ranked Marquis

821
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,100
is very detrimental

822
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,900
to the long-term stability

823
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,140
of the country.

824
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,860
It's best to downplay the issue and

825
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,140
resolve it quietly.

826
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,060
Prince Qing's name mustn't be mentioned.

827
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,860
Just say the Emperor

828
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,700
has punished the accuser.

829
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,260
As for the punishment,

830
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,700
a deduction of two years' salary
in private

831
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,220
will be enough.

832
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,620
You said you didn't know how to judge.

833
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,820
Didn't you just

834
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,820
clearly explained everything

835
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,460
in detail?

836
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,380
Since you have figured out

837
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,500
how to judge and do,

838
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,300
just go ahead.

839
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,860
Really?

840
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,660
Get lost already!

841
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

842
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,380
I shall take my leave, Your Majesty.

843
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,140
What a relief.

844
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,340
Zhuoqing.

845
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

846
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,060
You will leave the palace

847
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,100
with me later.

848
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

849
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,260
Aren't you curious
about where I'm going?

850
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,620
There is no one else

851
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,180
in Tianqi City

852
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,060
worth

853
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,420
your personal visit.

854
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,620
You know me well.

855
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:03,980
Initially,

856
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,420
I wanted you to approach Xie

857
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,180
and persuade him to collect

858
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,740
the evidence against Baili Luochen.

859
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,580
But in the end,

860
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,140
I pardon

861
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,540
Baili Luochen

862
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,340
and put Xie on a spot.

863
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,860
Do you know why?

864
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,700
That's not my business.

865
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,500
I only do what you say.

866
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,340
Xie

867
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,820
is ruthless and impatient.

868
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,460
He hasn't been behaving lately,

869
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,060
so I decided to teach him a lesson.

870
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,700
You are right, Your Majesty.

871
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,540
Zhuoqing,

872
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,540
did you think

873
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,380
I wanted to name Prince Qing
as the heir?

874
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,260
It's windy today.

875
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,940
I will have the servants
prepare a cloak for you.
