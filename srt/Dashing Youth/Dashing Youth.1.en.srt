Eighteen liang per jar.

My liquor tastes better than it.

204
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,660
So I'm selling it at twenty liang.

Please enjoy.

Excuse me.

211
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,660
Since you have nothing else to do,

212
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,340
let's have a drink together.

213
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,660
In that case, I won't refuse.

What should I call you?

215

My last name is Bai,

against the tips of willow trees.

219

Someone has said the same thing
about my name.

Come on, let's drink.

222
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,900
Chang'an has a long-lasting flavor

223
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,980
and is best enjoyed on rainy days.

224
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,580
It's a shame

225
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,460

226

Have this one.

227

perfect for travelers returning
from afar.

229

You've come all this way.

230
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,540
A cup of it is just right.

231
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,180
It's not good for you to drink this one.
And it's a shame to have that one.

232
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,300
May I ask
what you'd like to drink?

233
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:34,940
Then...

234
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,260
Let's have Xuyu then.

235
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,860
It means a moment's thought.

236
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,580
Sometimes

237

238

within a moment.
[*Xuyu means 'a moment']

239
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,500
Mister,

240
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,940
I'll drink this.

241
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,700
So, what do you think?

242
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,980
Can I make a name with this liquor?

243
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,620
Indeed, it's good liquor.

244
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,260
Among all the liquor
I've had in my life,

245
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,020
it ranks in the top five.

246
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,660
Fifth?

247
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,980
Then tell me,

248
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,260
what's number one?

249
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,340
In Tianqi City,

250
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,020
it's Qiulubai

251
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,380
from Diaolou Tavern.

252
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,500
Qiulubai...

253
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,580
In my opinion,

254
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,460
good liquor could only have one flavor.

255
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,580
But Qiulubai of Diaolu Tavern

256
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,420
offers three flavors.

257
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,420
So if I can brew a pot of liquor

258
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,140
better than Qiulubai,

259
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,340
it will make a name for itself.

260
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,180
If you have the chance to go to Tianqi,

261
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,180
you should try it.

262
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,780
I'm afraid I won't have that chance.

263
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,460
My family wouldn't

264
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,740
allow me to return to Tianqi.

265
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,060
Return?

266
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,940
It's truly good liquor.

267
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,380
I really am a genius

in martial arts.

of the leader of Xinan Circuit,
the Gu Family

373
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,180
and the second-best Yan Family's

374
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,220
marriage alliance.

375
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,380
Bai Dongjun.

376
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,820
Don't be disrespectful.

377
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,700
Call me sir.

378
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,740
Actually, since the beginning,

379
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,580
I have felt something peculiar

380
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,580
about this street.

381
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,860
I only stayed

382
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,780
because I coveted your fine liquor.

383
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,820
But now

384
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,980
I regret it a bit.

385
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,860
I should have left sooner.

386
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,340
What do you mean?

387
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,300
We've got involved

388
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,060
in the struggle between the Gu Family
and the Yan Family accidentally.

389
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,380
Not just them.

390
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,660
The group of people just now as well.

391
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,780
After wandering the world
for so many years,

392
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,580
I still have a sense for these things.

393
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,980
So, can you sense

394
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,540
what they're after?

395
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,500
Earlier you mentioned

396
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,500
the Gu Family
and the Yan Family's marriage alliance.

397
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,700
But the first young master
of the Gu Family

398
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,580
suddenly died not long ago.

399
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,820
If this celebration is real,

400
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,980
it's very suspicious.

401
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,540
If he's already dead,

402
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,780
how can they proceed with the marriage?

403
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,100
The Gu Family still has another son.

404
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,980
Have you heard

405
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,660
of this poem?

406
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,700
"Fenghua is unpredictable
and Qingge is elegant.

407
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,580
Zhuomo is eloquent and Lingyun is crazy.

408
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,620
Liuyue is peerless and Mochen is plain.

409
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,140
Qingxiang is talented
and Wuming is nowhere."

410
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,420
That doesn't rhyme at all.

411
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,580
This is the list
of young masters published

412
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,740
by Baixiao Hall.

413
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,740
It's not about rhyming

414
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,660
but about relevance.

415
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,660
It talks

416
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,780
about Beili's

417
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,620
eight exceptional talents.

418
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,420
The deeply scheming Mr. Fenghua,

419
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,620
the refined and elegant Mr. Qingge,

420
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,100
the eloquent Mr. Zhuomo,

421
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,260
the arrogant
and unrestrained Mr. Lingyun,

422
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,580
the peerlessly handsome Mr. Liuyue,

423
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,740
the tanned-looking Mr. Mochen,

424
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,180
the exceptionally talented
Mr. Qingxiang,

425
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,260
and

426
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,820
the currently vacant Mr. Wuming.

427
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,260
So, what does this have to do

428
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,460
with Chaisang City and the Gu Family?

429
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,180
Mr. Lingyun's last name is...

430
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,660
Gu.

431
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,020
Therefore,

432
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,500
the groom of the Gu Family

433
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,820
in this marriage alliance
is Mr. Lingyun,

434
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,460
Gu Jianmen.

435
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,820
Mr. Lingyun.

436
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,700
The name sounds quite marvelous.

437
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,140
Let's go.

438
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,340
Where are we going?

439
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,100
Gu's Mansion.

440
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,660
Let's invite Gu Jianmen here
for a drink.

441
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,740
"With soaring ambition,
he rises to the skies."

442
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,540
That sounds like he is a great figure.

443
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,060
Once he drinks my liquor

444
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,300
and spreads the word outside,

445
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,420
my fame will soon follow.

446
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,620
All right.

447
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,580
Let's walk against the wall.

448
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,460
Aren't you taking me
to the Gu's Mansion?

449
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,540
Why does it feel like
we're sneaking in like thieves?

450
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,660
If we walk openly

451
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,380
we won't even get out
of Longshou Street.

452
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,460
I didn't expect a wastrel like you

453
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,540
to know so much.

454
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,460
Of course.

455
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,900
Having wondered the world
for so many years,

456
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,100
I'd be dead long ago

457
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,260
if I didn't have such a sense.

458
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,300
Come on.

459
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,420
What's the matter?

460
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,220
Someone's here.

461
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,420
Sikong Changfeng, look.

462
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,980
Why did the sky suddenly turn dark?

463
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,860
[Burial]

464
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,820
Young Master, the sky...

465
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,340
It's a ghost.

466
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,260
Young Master.

467
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,780
Stop right there!

468
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,500
You must be a guest from the Dark River.

469
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,580
[Su Muyu, Umbrella Ghost, Dark River]

470
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,300
Su Li, don't be rude.

471
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,940
Here comes a respected guest.

472
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,220
Would you like to have a drink with me?

473
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,340
Thank you for offering.

474
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,020
But no.

475
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,100
Is it because you don't trust me,

476
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,260
Gu Jianmen?

477
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,980
If there's anyone in Beili

478
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,820
that the Dark River can trust,

479
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,140
it would be you.

480
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,940
Everyone knows

481
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,180
that the Dark River is a feared presence

482
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,020
in the martial world.

483
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,260
Wherever someone
from the Dark River appears,

484
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,540
there will be slaughter and death.

485
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,940
Do evil assassins like you

486
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,020
even need friends?

487
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,820
You've gone too far.

488
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,620
Even if we are assassins,

489
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,900
we also need friends.

490
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,260
Just like

491
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,460
the Dark River has chosen you

492
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,300
because we believe

493
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,580
you can help us with certain things.

494
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,620
And

495
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,860
we can also help you

496
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,020
with some matters.

497
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,820
Some important things.

498
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,740
So, in the Dark River's terms,
friends are merely

499
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,900
people who share mutual benefits?

500
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,940
Isn't that more reliable?

501
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,300
You are supposed to have many friends.

502
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,500
But

503
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,620
where are they now?

504
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,340
It doesn't matter where they are.

505
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,900
Your brother...

506
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,060
never aspired to power.

507
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,540
Yet, he still died in Babie Cit.

508
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,700
He died in a place

509
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,420
which is three hundred li from his home.

510
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,820
Mr. Lingyun,

511
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,660
your enemies cannot tolerate you,

512
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,260
let alone your brother.

513
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,420
The enemies have already made
their move.

514
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,940
And the Dark River

515
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,180
will send our best assassins here

516
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,260
to help you

517
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,260
and we'll ensure the Yan Family
doesn't have a chance to return alive.

518
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,260
My brother was like a father to me.

519
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,180
I swear to avenge his death.

520
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,220
But I don't need the Dark River
to help me with it.

521
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,060
The famed sword Yuexue.

522
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,940
It's said that this sword's edge

523
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,100
is so sharp

524
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,380
that it can cut snowflakes in midair.

525
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,500
Do you intend to kill me?

526
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,460
If the Dark River wants
to set a foothold in Xinan Circuit,

527
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,140
shouldn't you show

528
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,380
some sincerity?

529
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,500
Come on!

530
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,540
Let me see your sincerity.

531
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,340
Sure.

532
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,140
Good!

533
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,500
Young Master!

534
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,020
Fine blades rain down mercilessly

535
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,300
at the moment of the killing,

536
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,020
like evening rain.

537
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,820
You are clearly a ferocious assassin

538
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,940
from the Dark River.

539
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,460
But your sword carries

540
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,220
the sword thought unique to swordsmen.

541
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,500
From the beginning,

542
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,060
you had no intention
of cooperating with us.

543
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,860
Why did you force me

544
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,900
to use my dreadful move?

545
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,180
If I tell you...

546
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,860
it's because my elder brother died

547
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,940
and I'm trapped here

548
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,820
unable to leave,

549
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,700
so I really want to find someone

550
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,060
to have a good fight with,

551
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,340
will you pierce me

552
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,860
with your sword?

553
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,300
If you think it over,

554
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,020
you can find me at Qingsong Inn.

555
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,020
I'll wait for you there for seven days.

556
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,060
What is your name?

557
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,300
I am not supposed to have a name.

558
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,380
But I'm willing to tell you

559
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,180
my name.

560
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,940
My name is Su Muyu.

561
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,220
Farewell, Mr. Lingyun.

562
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,700
Young Master, he...

563
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,500
Among the three prominent families
of the Dark River,

564
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,500
the Mu Family is renowned

565
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,220
for their mastery of secretive arts.

566
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,500
Su Muyu definitely has not come

567
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,620
to Chaisang City himself.

568
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,820
Beyond these walls,

569
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,420
members of the Mu Family
are certainly stationed

570
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,340
to protect him.

571
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,540
Even the sudden dark sky

572
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,740
is their doing.

573
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,460
As for these mysterious techniques,

574
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,220
it's best not to dwell on them

575
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,820
if you can't figure them out.

576
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,540
Well, about what he just mentioned...

577
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,220
the Dark River's
uninvited presence looms

578
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,700
with sinister intentions
that send chills down one's spine.

579
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,300
Our enemies are merely

580
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,980
criminals in the mortal world.

581
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,980
But the ones who come to make a deal

582
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,220
are ghosts from hell.

583
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,900
Has that ghost left yet?

584
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,500
How odd.

585
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,420
The sky has brightened again.

586
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,820
I have an ominous feeling.

587
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,540
Let's leave here at once.

588
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,020
Run!

589
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,340
Well,

590
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,980
what did you two see?

591
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,460
Umbrella Ghost,

592
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,580
they've been waiting here

593
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,940
for quite some time.

594
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,020
We didn't see anything.

595
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,900
Let's go.

596
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,420
Leave this place.

597
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,380
Better yet, leave this city.

598
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,300
Umbrella Ghost.

599
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,380
Leave now.

600
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,340
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

601
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,500
[Donggui Tavern]

602
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,660
That was terrifying.

603
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,820
I only sneaked out

604
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,620
to open a tavern

605
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,940
and sell my liquor.

606
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,580
It nearly cost me my life.

607
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,060
Is there any justice left in this world?

608
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,340
Sir.

609
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,700
You must be kidding me.

610
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,620
It's like trouble brewing

611
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,780
everywhere.

612
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,340
What?

613
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,860
We just got out of trouble

614
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,740
and here comes another one.

615
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,140
Mister,

616
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,340
where have you been?

617
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,260
Where did you go?

618
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,260
I still need to buy liquor from you.

619
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,100
Unfortunately,

620
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,180
all liquor is sold out.

621
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,500
Come back another day.

622
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,140
Another day?

623
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,860
There might not be another chance.

624
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,900
The one who won't have a chance is you.

625
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,900
We managed to avoid the first fight

626
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,820
but not the second one.

627
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,260
So there will be a fight today.

628
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,340
Sir,

629
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,940
find a place to hide.

630
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,900
Sikong Changfeng.

631
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,580
Be careful.

632
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,100
With your spear techniques,

633
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,500
you're no ordinary person.

634
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,660
Who are you?

635
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,660
Coincidentally,

636
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,660
I truly am an ordinary person.

637
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,100
I never knew my parents,

638
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,260
fed by lots of people,

639
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,620
lived in rundown temples,

640
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,300
never had a surname,

641
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,060
and no one ever gave me a name.

642
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,420
But living life empty-handed

643
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,500
isn't too bad either.

644
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,100
I gave myself the surname Sikong.

645
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,540
I'd also like to turn into wind,

646
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,780
going forward without turning back.

647
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,540
So my name is...

648
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,140
Sikong Changfeng.

649
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,660
So this is the real boss?

650
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,580
So you two are in this together.

651
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,940
We've never met before

652
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,780
nor had any grudges.

653
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,700
I even offered you a jar

654
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,620
of my fine liquor.

655
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,940
Why do you want to kill me?

656
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,780
Surely it's not

657
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,260
because my liquor
is too expensive, right?

658
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,740
Blame yourself

659
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,580
for opening your tavern
at the wrong location.

660
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,740
That is such a petty reason.

661
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,060
Life is precious.

662
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,580
Everyone only has one life.

663
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,780
We have no right

664
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,580
to take away someone else's life

665
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,580
randomly.

666
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,660
Idiot.

667
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,620
What did you call me?

668
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,980
Sir,

669
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,100
haven't you figured it out yet?

670
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,580
Gu's Mansion has been surrounded

671
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,460
by these people.

672
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,740
We're in their way.

673
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,020
Calling you an idiot isn't wrong.

674
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,860
Do you actually think

675
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,380
you can reason with people like this?

676
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,460
Mister,

677
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,140
let me ask you a question.

678
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,380
Go ahead.

679
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,660
If we leave now,

680
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,860
will you let us go?

681
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,100
No.

682
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,980
Enough talking, then. Let's fight!

683
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,140
You haven't learned
the complete spear techniques.

684
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,660
You learned it stealthily.

685
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,580
I know who you are.

686
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,140
"Face official justice in life
and meet Yama in death."

687
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,780
[Yan Qiansui, Golden-Mouthed Yama]
You're Yan Qiansui, Golden-Mouthed Yama.

688
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,300
Sir, leave first.

689
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,220
I came all this way here

690
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,140
to open a tavern.

691
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,220
I did not come unprepared.

692
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,220
I said, leave.

693
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,380
Young man,

694
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,420
where are you going?

695
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,620
Why are you avoiding me?

696
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,660
Am I not beautiful enough?

697
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,780
Of course.

698
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,580
Where do you think you're going?

699
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,140
Over there.

700
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,060
Why are you still here?

701
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,100
Just look up there.

702
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,700
I underestimated you, sir.

703
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900
I didn't expect your qinggong
to be this skillful

704
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,500
when your martial arts skills
are mediocre.

705
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,860
But if you want to defeat me,

706
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,740
these skills are not enough.

707
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,100
How about this?

708
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,100
The both of you are handsome,

709
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,100
so I can't bear to kill you all.

710
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,340
How about...

711
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,700
How about letting us go?

712
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,980
Are you kidding me?

713
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,300
How about I spare

714
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,620
one of you?

715
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,900
And the other one will die.

716
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,220
What do you think?

717
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,660
You can discuss

718
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,060
who gets to die and who to live.

719
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,340
Bai Dongjun, I...

720
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,300
I know.

721
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,500
We're just strangers
who happened to meet.

722
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,500
Our friendship

723
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,820
in that battle just now

724
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,580
has run its course.

725
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,860
I understand.

726
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,340
What?

727
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,940
I didn't even finish my sentence.

728
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,220
You understand nothing.

729
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,060
I still have one last skill to show.

730
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,660
With this move,

731
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,260
the one in front of me
will definitely die.

732
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,820
But I might not survive either.

733
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,660
Do your best to protect yourself.

734
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,420
If I survive,

735
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,580
I'll take you out of here.

736
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,780
How confident are you?

737
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,500
One in ten.

738
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,740
One in ten?

739
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,660
With only one in ten certainty,

740
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,380
you dare say it

741
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,340
so confidently.

742
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,940
It is just

743
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,340
a dying man's gamble.

744
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,300
Sikong Changfeng...

745
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,220
If we make it through today

746
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,020
and if we both survive this,

747
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,900
