00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:16,790

2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Holding onto life and death in the face of danger  ♫

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,840
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,400
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,440
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,540
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,820
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,540
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,420
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,820
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,500

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,720

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,320

23
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,460
You're back.

25
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,320
Have you not found him yet?

26
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,340
When he first mentioned wanting to leave, he said it casually on the day he took Baili Dongjun as his disciple.

27
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,960
He said it the second time in His Majesty's Imperial Study.

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,420
It's just like what he did in the past. He said it for no reason.

29
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,640
It seemed like he said it on a whim.

30
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,200
- That's impossible. 
 - Ruofeng. Although we're all-knowing,

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,740
there's one person whom we cannot check on.

32
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,540
However, his fate is linked to the whole Martial World.

33
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,500
Mister Li, the chancellor of the Academy, suddenly intends to leave Tianqi.

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
As members of Baixiao Hall, the all-knowing sect, we don't even know the reason behind this!

35
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,220
We claim that we are the all-knowing sect.

36
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,160
Now, this seems like

37
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,360
a joke to me.

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,600

39
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,680
Young man.

40
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,500
You can be the Spear Deity in the future.

41
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,540
- Who are you? 
 - Me?

42
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,540
I'm Li Changsheng.

43
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,500
Li...

44
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,400
Mister Li.

45
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,820
But Mister Li, I don't have a spear with me now.

46
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,360
How did you know that my weapon was a spear?

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,140
Because I sense the spear intent in you.

48
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,580
Spear intent?

49
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,180
You must be looking for Dongjun.

50
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,100
Young people like you shouldn't overthink.

51
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,760
You're a martial artist while he's from the Marquis' Mansion.

52
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,580
You two may be worlds apart in the eyes of ordinary people.

53
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,020
However, this is the Academy.

54
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,386
Everyone here is a student.

55
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:25,700
All students are known as peers regardless of their identities.

56
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,180
The Jixia Academy welcomes you, Little Spear Deity.

57
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,260
Thank you, Mister Li.

58
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,180
Hanyi?

59
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,100
Call for your mother.

60
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,020
Wife, my dear wife.

61
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,980
I've been kneeling outside for the past two days.

62
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,900
I'm so cold. It hurts so much.

63
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,860
Stop pretending!

64
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,580
Young Master Zhuomo, you're powerful.

65
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,060
You're protected by your internal strength. Why would you be cold?

66
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,140
Since this is a punishment, I dare not utilize my internal strength.

67
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,380
You dare not?

68
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,860
Seems to me like you dare do everything.

69
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,140
The Eight Young Masters of Beili are dissolute indeed, right?

70
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,180
In the past you said Gu Jianmen led you astray.

71
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,700
But Gu Jianmen left Tianqi a long time ago.

72
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,620
Even so, it looks like you've still been led astray.

73
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,260
- That's not it. This time, it was my junior's— 
 - Shut up!

74
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,400
Your junior brother's face was as red as a monkey's butt.

75
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,780
I guess that was his first time visiting a brothel.

76
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,900
Why don't you just tell me that the ladies at Baihua Hall abducted you instead?

77
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,920
Don't you think that's too fake?

78
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,000
- Say that again? 
 - I'm done for.

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,380
Lei Mengsha. Seems like you want to kneel here forever.

80
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,480
- Get down! 
 - Wait a minute...

81
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,240
Get down!

82
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,320
Wife! Wife!

83
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,220
Darling! I was only there to enjoy the music! My beloved wife!

84
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,420
- You dare visit that place again? 
 - My beloved wife!

85
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,100
I won't do it again!

86
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,580
Hanyi, save me!

87
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,560
- Shut up! 
 - My beloved wife!

88
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,180
Father is so pitiful.

89
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,900
Mother is beating him up so badly.

90
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,300
- Darling! 
 - Get down!

91
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,820
I was really there to enjoy the music!

92
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,700
- Darling! 
 - Stay put!

93
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,060
Your father is going to die, you know? Aren't you going to help him out?

94
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,420
Mister Li, you're here.

95
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,060
Your father might die for real if I don't show up now.

96
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,690
He deserves it for going to a place like that.

97
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,140
Although you're young, you know quite a lot, don't you?

98
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,360
Mister Li, when will you teach me martial arts?

99
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,940
You've improved a lot.

100
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,520
Your father is a talent of the Lei Clan while your mother is the successor of Heart Sword.

101
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,280
Isn't it better to learn martial arts from them?

102
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,380
- Why are you trying to learn it from me? 
 - Because you're the best martial artist in the world.

103
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,280
I can only keep my father in check in the future if I learn martial arts from you.

104
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,420
You have great aspirations. Your taste is even better.

105
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,920
- Darling! Stop hitting me! 
 - That's enough.

106
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,840
- Darling, my butt is swollen! 
 - Go away!

107
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,560
I won't go there again!

108
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,320
Mother, Mister Li is here.

109
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,160
Mister Li.

110
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,380
- Master, save me. 
 - Kneel!

111
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,060
Enough already.

112
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,940
Nothing major happened, am I right?

113
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,720
Although he did visit a brothel, he didn't commit any serious mistakes.

114
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,820
Madam Lei, I know Lei'er well.

115
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,760
He's very loyal to you.

116
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,060
He's only daring enough to listen to some music there, am I right?

117
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,060
I think the reason why he went to Baihua Hall is because when he saw Baili Dongjun and that young man who uses the spear,

118
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,200
it reminded him of his past with Gu Jianmen.

119
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,146
He just did so on a whim. Am I right, Lei'er?

120
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:19,880
- That's right. 
 - Shut up!

121
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,380
- You shameless boy. 
 - Shameless.

122
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,160
- Do you dare do that again? 
 - I won't go there again.

123
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,340
In the future, if I wish to listen to some music, I'll go to Luo Xuan. He sings well.

124
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,500
Madam Lei, he has admitted his fault.

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,940
He gave you his promise as well. You should forgive him.

126
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,160
Mister Li, you're already here. I can't just beat him to death.

127
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,300
Mister Li, I assume you're not just here to rescue this useless fool.

128
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,060
I shall not interrupt your conversation.

129
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,740
Hanyi.

130
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,460
Let's go.

131
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,520
Master.

132
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,100
Master, luckily you showed up in time.

133
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,120
- My wife almost beat me to death. 
 - I didn't want to come here initially.

134
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,486
Even if you don't die now,

135
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:23,420
you will die because of your laughable aspiration in a few more years.

136
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,560
Master, you still remember it?

137
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,420
Back then, you said your aspiration lies with the world.

138
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,380
I mocked you for being a child.

139
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,100
Now, your child is learning how to curse you out.

140
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,180
You can't afford to be the same young man who approached me back then.

141
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,020
Tell me about it.

142
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,680
What does the world mean to you?

143
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,220
The world?

144
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,100
Back then I was young and impulsive.

145
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,980
I thought the world was a place where young men like us could venture and conquer.

146
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,900
What about now?

147
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,740
Now, I've finally figured it out.

148
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,700
The world is not a place for us to venture and conquer.

149
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,220
It's a place where many people are trying their best to live.

150
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,140
What about your aspiration then?

151
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,140
It still lies with the world.

152
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,360
Now, it's about protecting the world.

153
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,420
It's been many years.

154
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,480
It seems like you have changed, but it also seems like you haven't changed at all.

155
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,900
You and Jianmen are best friends.

156
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,380
Now that Jianmen is gone, you're spending time with Ruofeng.

157
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,120
But Ruofeng has a special identity. He'll leave the Academy eventually.

158
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,160
- By then, you— 
 - Master, I don't want to leave the Academy.

159
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,660
The Academy is a place just for you to study.

160
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,440
Once you grow up and are done with your studies, you have to leave the Academy.

161
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,020
Since the students are gone, there's no need for the old teacher to remain there any longer.

162
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,020
- Master, don't tell me you're leaving? 
 - That's right.

163
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,440
Mengsha, you have to leave eventually as well.

164
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,950
However, once you take that step,

165
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,280
you won't be able to return to the Lei Clan again.

166
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,400
If so, I won't.

167
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,220
You don't wish to implicate the Lei Clan.

168
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,000
That's why you disregarded the clan rules and made them kick you out deliberately.

169
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,100
You didn't want to implicate your wife and child.

170
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,240
That's why you made your daughter take her mother's surname.

171
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,940
If anything happens, at least the Sword Heart Tomb can back them up.

172
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,820
But Mengsha, those who achieve great feats have to sever their ties with the past completely.

173
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,680
Well...

174
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,800
You still have a long way to go.

175
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,480
Tell Hanyi to come to me when the time comes. I'll teach her swordsmanship.

176
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,300
Master.

177
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,300
Well... Aren't you going to come back?

178
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,080
You fool! Did you only get the point after so long?

179
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,300
You think a person like you can protect the world?

180
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,320
Listen. Not everyone has the right to protect the world.

181
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,860
If you and Ruofeng wish to acquire that right, you have to go through hardships and trials.

182
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,640
And you better not die in the middle of the process.

183
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,400
Mister Li, I won't disappoint you.

184
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
You've already disappointed me.

185
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,800
My only wish is for my disciples to travel the martial arts world freely and do whatever they like.

186
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,220
The responsibility of protecting the world is too heavy to bear.

187
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,080
It's fine as long as you don't let yourself down.

188
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,340

189
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,800
I heard that Li Changsheng intends to leave Tianqi City.

190
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,300
If Li Changsheng's not in Tianqi City,

191
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,080
although you have to pay a price for taking someone away by force,

192
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,160
it'll not be too difficult.

193
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,820
I'll head there myself.

194
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,920
You've been stubborn since you were young. Do you think you won't need help?

195
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,460
Even if you're capable, I'm afraid your beloved would have married someone else by now.

196
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,740
Master.

197
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,480
I wish to master the Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

198
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,880
I never expected you to go through so much in just six months.

199
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,440
Your journey was bumpier than mine.

200
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,840
So, how did it go last night?

201
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,700
Why are you all the same? You shouldn't learn all that nonsense from them.

202
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,240
Sikong Changfeng, don't you have a conscience? People slandered me because of you and Senior Lei.

203
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,700
I even argued with Luoxia because of that. You should cut me some slack.

204
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,260
She only caught up with me yesterday.

205
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,980
She took me for her big brother she played with when she was young.

206
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,320
Judging from your tone you sound disappointed.

207
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,980
What's there for me to be disappointed about?

208
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,660
I made acquaintances with a beauty that's hard to meet just because I played a random tune.

209
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,160
People wished they were as lucky as me. W-W-Why should I be disappointed?

210
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,760
Fine. You're not disappointed then. So, are you her brother or not?

211
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,880
How should I know? I can't recall the past.

212
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,940
Right. You told me that you lost your memories.

213
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,740
Maybe. I didn't think of it on purpose.

214
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:50,100
When I think about it, I think my life before this was all blank and empty.

215
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,140
Seems like you truly forgot everything.

216
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,120
So what? It's not like I'm depending on my past to survive.

217
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,460
Sikong Changfeng. Have you considered this?

218
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:09,140
You don't know about your background, yet you two know the same tune. What does that mean?

219
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,920
I don't know either.

220
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,220
- What are you doing? 
 - What if you truly are her brother?

221
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,260
What if she played that tune so that her brother could recognize it and show up?

222
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,500
There are plenty of customers in Baihua Hall.  Some are from Tianqi while some aren't. Some are rich while some are poor.

223
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,160
Why are you the only person who has heard that tune before? Aren't you anxious at all?

224
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,300
She's very popular, you know? Once you miss out on her, you won't get another chance.

225
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,100
But I can't remember anything. I can't remember anything, no matter what I do. Why are you panicking when I'm not?

226
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,860
Baili Dongjun, the past may be in the past, but there might still...

227
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,520
- be a future for us. 
 - Fine, then.

228
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,960
Why haven't you started brewing liquor yet? Don't tell me you forgot about the bet on the 14th day of the month?

229
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,360
Of course, I remember it. I'm trying to get inspiration here.

230
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,980
Why are you panicking when I'm not?

231
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,820
Baili Dongjun, you... This isn't about you alone, you know?

232
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,860
- My spear is there as a forfeit. 
 - All right. I got it.

233
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,200
Don't worry. Your concern is my concern. Just leave your spear to me.

234
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,080
Who's there?

235
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,060
Qixuan, it's you.

236
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,020
What are you doing here?

237
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,020
I came upon receiving your letter.

238
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,540
And we will leave this place soon.

239
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,520
Leave?

240
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,520
So...

241
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,140
That means you guys were the ones behind Ye Dingzhi's incident.

242
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,780
Yes.

243
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,540
Yuji discovered that Ye Dingzhi was a natural martial artist as well.

244
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,180
Now, it doesn't matter if we don't have Baili Dongjun with us.

245
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,260
But...

246
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,300
Young Lady, what's with all the doubts?

247
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:28,760
Could it be that your intention to restore our state has been shaken?

248
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,780
That's right.

249
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,920
My intention has been shaken...after all this time.

250
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,260
Qixuan, so what if we find a natural martial artist?

251
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,400
We can unlock Langyue, wait for Father to come out from seclusion,

252
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,500
and order the cavalries of Beique to annihilate Beili.

253
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,840
Is that it?

254
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,740
What about the people who have just settled down from the flames of war from 20 years ago?

255
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,620
 Sister Luoxia.

256
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,460
- Who's there? 
  - Sister Luoxia. Young Master told me to call for you.

257
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,100
 Sister Luoxia?

258
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,740
All right. Coming.

259
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,140
Disciple, you're here.

260
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,360
Master.

261
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,740
Look at the GO pieces.

262
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:55,120
The black pieces are unmatched. They're forcing the white pieces to retreat to a corner. They're going to win.

263
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:02,700
But it's not like there's no chance for the white pieces to make a comeback, right?

264
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,720
Master, you said so yourself that it was just a possibility.

265
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,750
The white pieces have too slim of a chance to win.

266
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,140
And the price they have to pay is too large.

267
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,300
It's more likely that they'll suffer a complete defeat.

268
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:26,060
Just now I saw a pigeon from State Xue flying by.

269
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,400
It was agile and swift.

270
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,420
It looked beautiful.

271
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,140
 Here he comes.

272
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:08,260
Disciple, do you remember the first thing I told you?

273
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,680
You... are here.

274
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,400
 Disciple.

275
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,020
Since I'm now your master, your identity and background don't matter.

276
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,340
You're still my disciple.

277
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,280
You're my first disciple. You're also my only disciple.

278
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,600
No matter what happens, I'll take care of everything.

279
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,380
Master.

280
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:20,220
Xin'er. When will Sister come back? I'm bored to death.

281
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,860
In the past, no one looked for me no matter where I went.

282
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,180
Now that she's back, it's as if we have a grand court assembly every day.

283
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,340
Different people come to her, for different matters every day.

284
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:34,320
I can't do this anymore. Xin'er, I'm exhausted.

285
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,420
Now that I'm counting the days, I think she'll return soon.

286
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,840
Second Young Lady, you should wait for a little longer.

287
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,640
 Young Lady, I, Wuxiang, have something to report to you.

288
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,280
Honorable Envoy Wuxiang. I have been feeling unwell lately.

289
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,580
You may make the decisions yourself.

290
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,620
Second Young Lady.

291
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,900
He found out?

292
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,050
Second Young Lady, no one could tell when you were passing off as Young Lady.

293
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,360
So what? You still saw through me.

294
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,420
- Honorable Envoy. 
 - Spare the formalities.

295
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,200
Second Young Lady, you're the twin sister of Young Lady.

296
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,080
And you grew up together, you two are very close.

297
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,920
If you truly wanted to pass as Young Lady it would be hard to see through.

298
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,800
If so, Honorable Envoy, how did you find out?

299
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,020
Young Lady is a reserved person while you're more active.

300
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,720
You two have different personalities.

301
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,420
Moreover, I watched over you two as you grew up.

302
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,100
It's not that easy to deceive me.

303
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,780
Second Young Lady, it must have been tough on you.

304
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:02,860
Honorable Envoy, since you knew that I was here, does this mean you know where my sister is?

305
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,180
What? Is Sister coming back soon?

306
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,760
- Is she in trouble? 
 - Second Young Lady, don't worry.

307
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,820
Young Lady is fine. It's just that...

308
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,320
It's just that... What?

309
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,380
Get to the point! You're just making me get anxious.

310
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:33,340
It's just that Young Lady might not return to Tian Wai Tian anymore.

311
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,820
She's not returning to Tian Wai Tian?

312
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,080
- What do you mean? 
 - It's just like what I've said.

313
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,380
Young Lady released the natural martial artist and gave up on restoring the state.

314
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,940
She's not returning to Tian Wai Tian.

315
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,380
She gave up on restoring the state?

316
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,300
Why would Sister give up on restoring the state?

317
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,260
I don't believe it. Xin'er, do you believe that?

318
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,900
I don't either.

319
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,460
Wuxiang, are you lying to me?

320
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,260
Are you trying to target me and my sister because of your selfish ambitions?

321
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,060
After some time, Purple Robe Marquis and White-Haired Deity will return.

322
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,340
Second Young Lady, even if you don't believe me, you should believe them, right?

323
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,420
What else do you want to tell me?

324
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,640
All this time I've been bothered by one particular thought.

325
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,540
I and those around me had once devoted our efforts to one particular goal.

326
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:51,700
But lately I've realized it might not be the right thing to do.

327
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:02,340
Speaking of the right goal, I haven't found it yet.

328
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,320
I'm confused.

329
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,580
Master, please enlighten me.

330
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,460
In life, right and wrong cannot be differentiated clearly.

331
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,340
We make different choices at different periods in our lives.

332
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,300
Once you've witnessed how vast the world is,

333
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,220
naturally your perspective will become different as well.

334
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,140
Luoxia, why are you suffering?

335
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,060
Was it because you took a path that is different from the others?

336
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,040
Or...

337
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,020
was it because you haven't found an answer yet?

338
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,700
Perhaps it's both.

339
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:58,220
In life, no one can guarantee that they will travel together with others.

340
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:04,500
Even if it's us, the Eight Young Masters of Beili, all of us are taking different paths.

341
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,620
So what?

342
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:13,400
Therefore, it depends on who you wish to travel with the most.

343
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,900
Are you still lost?

344
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,480
If so, that means you need to continue to seek the answer at the bottom of your heart.

345
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,900
Second Young Lady, you should rest early.

346
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,960
The Left and Right Guardians won't return soon.

347
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,690
Xin'er.

348
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,740
What if...

349
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,700
I'm saying what if.

350
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,320
What if Wuxiang was speaking the truth?

351
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,040
What should we do then?

352
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,120
I don't know.

353
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,740
I just think that Young Lady might be doing this for her own reasons.

354
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,560
Second Young Lady, what about you?

355
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,960
Me?

356
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,866
 The Beili Army is attacking!

357
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:53,000
 Young Lady, run! Young Lady!

358
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,980
 That's the hairpin Mother gave me before she died...

359
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,100
 - Qing'er! 
 - Give it back to me!

360
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,300
 - Qing'er! 
 - Sister!

361
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,860
 She seized the hairpin Mother gave me!

362
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,260
 That's mine!

363
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,820
 That's my home!

364
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,400
 Give it back to me!

365
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,280
 Give it back to me!

366
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,540
Second Young Lady!

367
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,340
I might...

368
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,800
hate her to her core for this.

369
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,700
My good disciple, are you admiring the moon here?

370
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,599
- Master. 
 - Can you truly see the moon behind that veil of yours?

371
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,180
Admiring the moon behind the veil is just like admiring flowers in the mist.

372
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,380
It's beautiful in its own way.

373
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,880
Tell me. Why were you looking for me?

374
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,820
Master, I heard that you were about to embark on a journey.

375
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,800
Master, will you depart alone?

376
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,820
You're much smarter than Lei'er.

377
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,700
Of course not. I'll travel with that troublesome junior of yours, Baili Dongjun.

378
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,600
If so, can you take one more person with you?

379
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,260
Do you intend to make me take your disciple as well?

380
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,460
As expected of Master!

381
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,820
As a master, not only do I have to deal with my disciples,

382
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,040
but I also have to deal with my disciple's disciple?

383
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,080
I wouldn't have taken any of you in had I known this would happen. You brats worry me to no end.

384
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,340
Young people should go and explore the world.

385
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,300
They shouldn't be stuck in Tianqi City.

386
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,664
Master, if Luoxia can travel the world with you and junior brother,

387
00:31:22,664 --> 00:31:25,820
I'm sure her horizons will be broadened.

388
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,340
You look pretty free yourself.

389
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,380
Why aren't you taking her on a journey yourself?

390
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,220
It's inconvenient for me to travel the Martial World with my looks.

391
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,420
But Master, you...

392
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,180
Thank you, Master.

393
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,420
Fine, fine.

394
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,580
Oh my.

395
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,400
You sly little fox.

396
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:19,250

397
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,620
 I smell the scent of the peach blossom.

398
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,820
 Dongjun, each type of liquor has its own character.

399
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,387
 Just like humans.

400
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:58,320
 Liquors of different characters will give different tastes.

401
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,660
 I often heard that the Qiulubai of Tianqi City has three kinds of taste.

402
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,140
 Could it be that it contains three characters?

403
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:14,180
 When you drink, what you feel will be the flavor of the liquor itself.

404
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,420
 It's not because the liquor has three characters.

405
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:22,660
 It's because your heart is guided by the liquor.

406
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,660
 Due to that, emotions start flooding into your heart.

407
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,940
 If so, Master, what does your favorite liquor taste like?

408
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,880
 It's the happiest taste...

409
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,740
 I've ever had in my life.

410
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,380
 It's also...

411
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,560
 the most regretful taste I've ever had in my life.

412
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,940
 Where can I find such liquor?

413
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,500
 It's actually covering two sides of the spectrum.

414
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,580
 You can find it.

415
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:08,140
 It's called Peach Blossom Moonfall.

416
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,300
 Peach Blossom Moonfall?

417
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:21,540
If so, could there be a type of liquor that gives out the taste of love

418
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,980
and heartlessness at the same time?

419
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,740
The most heartless one is often the most loving one.

420
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:06,040
It's comparable to seeing stars in broad daylight.

421
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,100
He's already drunk this early in the day?

422
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:59,300
Initially I thought the matter would end after Li Changsheng caused such a huge commotion

423
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:07,620
announcing to the public that he would leave Tianqi with Baili Dongjun.

424
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:14,860
I never expected all kinds of trouble to arise from this.

425
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:20,340
It's just a bottle of liquor yet it represents His Majesty's authority.

426
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,580
Baili Dongjun is disrespecting His Majesty for requesting that pot of liquor.

427
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:29,900
It's a shame that His Majesty dares not provoke Mister Li.

428
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,140
Although he's enraged, he cannot express his emotions.

429
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,400
Therefore, at this moment,

430
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:47,660
I'm sure His Majesty hopes that someone can stand up and wield that sword on his behalf.

431
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,100
I understand.

432
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,270
Your Highness, a guest has arrived.

433
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,780
The message relayed to me by the Grand Eunuch's messenger made me sweat.

434
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,280
However, it's also making me excited.

435
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,820
When will Baili Dongjun spar with Master Xie?

436
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,560
Your Highness, it's tomorrow.

437
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,280
It seems like luck is on my side.

438
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,260
Yingxian, tell me.

439
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,820
What if this young master never leaves Tianqi City alive?

440
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,980
Doesn't that mean my throne will be...

441
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,720
However, the Marquis Zhenxi possesses immense military strength.

442
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:58,980
If due to the rebellious young master's death in a brawl in Tianqi City,

443
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,260
troops are mobilized, causing unrest,

444
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,600
do you think an army like that can achieve victory?

445
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,150
Your Highness, you're wise indeed.

446
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,950

447
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,620
Sir, the odds for Baili Dongjun's victory has reached 1,500.

448
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,020
Just do the usual thing.

449
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,940
Find a random person. Bet 1,000 taels on him using his name.

450
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,240
Gold taels.

451
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,260
I understand. You're betting on Master Xie, right?

452
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,260
Come back.

453
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:51,200
Who said I was betting on Master Xie? Bet on Baili Dongjun.

454
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,300
Here, have some of this. It'll make your dumb brain smarter. Go now.

455
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,900
Yes, Sir.

456
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,300
What a familiar sight.

457
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,760
No wonder they said I made a fortune.

458
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,440
Did he get the time wrong?

459
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,560
It's been so long. I guess he got the date wrong.

460
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,540
The Eight Young Masters of Beili are here!

461
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,220
Are all eight of them here?

462
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,000
Let's go and take a look!

463
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,140
They're here!

464
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,300
They're actually here!

465
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,680
It's rare to see all of them appearing at the same time.

466
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:21,925

467
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,460
Sirs, please.

468
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,260
Master Xie.

469
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,340
Who is this?

470
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,280
This is Young Master Qingxiang, Xie Xuan.

471
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,620
So it's Young Master Qingxiang. I've long heard of your name.

472
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,360
- Greetings, Master Xie. 
 - Please.

473
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,900
Excellent.

474
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,480
Let's go upstairs.

475
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,190
Little Mister, please stay here.

476
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,780

477
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,760
Do you still remember our promise?

478
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,580
Aren't you afraid that I might practice favoritism?

479
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:06,100
Little Master, you're more trustworthy than Mister Li from the Academy.

480
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,440
All right. You should just call for me later.

481
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,180
He's looking at me!

482
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,900
Wretched fools.

483
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:36,100
Is today the day Baili Dongjun will spar with Master Xie in a liquor-brewing contest?

484
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,860
That's right, Your Majesty.

485
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,180
Which of the princes have gone there?

486
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,366
Second Prince and Ninth Prince.

487
00:41:45,366 --> 00:41:48,520
Ruofeng is Baili Dongjun's senior.

488
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,880
It makes sense for him to be there.

489
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,180
But why is Second Prince there too?

490
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:00,980
Second Prince always loves to share your burden with you, Your Majesty.

491
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,060
Zhuoqing.

492
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,900
You do live up to your reputation as my Grand Eunuch.

493
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,281

494
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:17,600

495
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:30,070

496
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:40,729
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

497
00:42:40,729 --> 00:42:48,561
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

498
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:57,921
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

499
00:42:58,972 --> 00:43:06,332
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

500
00:43:06,332 --> 00:43:09,463
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

501
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:11,862
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

502
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:16,323
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

503
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:20,752
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

504
00:43:20,752 --> 00:43:24,232
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

505
00:43:24,232 --> 00:43:27,092
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

506
00:43:27,092 --> 00:43:29,712
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

507
00:43:29,712 --> 00:43:34,132
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

508
00:43:34,132 --> 00:43:38,492
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

509
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:41,792
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

510
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:47,672
♫  I met you  ♫

511
00:44:22,832 --> 00:44:31,856
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫
