It's a spirit screen slope.

26
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,460
Will this route lead us
to the formation's core?

27
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,300
Precisely.

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,340
This Lone Void Formation

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,500
originally belongs to the military art.

30
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,100

The demonic sect
lays the Ghostly Formation,

34
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,900
but the solution to break it
is quite similar.

35
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,700
The art of Ghostly Formation
relies on concealment.

36

lies in a place that gathers abundant qi
in the mountains.

On the northwest side of the mountain,

40
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,540
there is a boundless graveyard,

What's its name?

57
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,900
Principles in life are written
into a tome of a thousand volumes.

58

So it's called the Thousand-Volume Tome.

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,460
How irritating.

190
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,220
Getting back his own wife

191
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,460
is only right and natural.

192
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,100
But why must we

193
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,220
get involved in this?

194
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,220
Well,

195
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,700
it's all because of our sect's rules

196
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,580
that forbid marriage.

197
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,220
A bunch of stubborn old geezers

198
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,340
with no sense of romance

199
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,340
and ruins others' relationships.

200
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,940
What a sin.

201
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,220
Yuzhen, don't learn from them.

202
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,980
If you ever meet a girl you like
in the future,

203
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,580
marry her

204
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,300
even if you have to fight.

205
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,420
You can't go down.

206
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,580
I'm afraid that chance is gone.

207
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,580
Yixing,

208
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,860
are you going or not?

209
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,340
Right. Yes.

210
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,460
I'm leaving.

211
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:05,860
Goodbye.

212
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,300
Yixing, take care.

213
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,820
Come back soon.

214
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,500
This mountain marks the boundary.

215
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,460
Don't think you can overstep it,
you demonic sect.

216
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,060
Like we'd ever listen to you.

217
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,180
I think

218
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,700
it is up to us.

219
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,260
I didn't expect the lands
beyond the northern borders

220
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,980
to have so many skilled martial artists.

221
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,700
Most importantly,
they came in large numbers.

222
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,380
They came batch after batch.

223
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,580
It's not that they are in large numbers,

224
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,380
but you are too soft-hearted.

225
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,620
You injure them instead of killing them.

226
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,260
They go back to heal up in a day

227
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:12,860
and then

228
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,300
attack you the next day.

229
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,620
That's why

230
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,020
they came batch after batch.

231
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,580
Who's there?

232
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,980
It's you,

233
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,860
The Dark River.

234
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,500
Exactly.

235
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,660
I wonder if we are welcome here,

236
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,660
my righteous friends.

237
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,140
They are dropping like flies.

238
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,380
I see no reason they would push us away.

239
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,220
Changhe was right.

240
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,060
You so-called righteous sects

241
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,700
are simply hypocritical.

242
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,500
They are coming for your lives,

243
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,100
so you should retaliate.

244
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,140
If not,

245
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,820
they might think

246
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,980
you are idiots.

247
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,420
You!

248
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,260
I don't think the Dark River

249
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,540
came here

250
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,220
just to tease us, right?

251
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,420
Of course not.

252
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,460
Although the Dark River

253
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,340
used to kill solely for money,

254
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,900
this time

255
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,980
our first act

256
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,060
that has nothing to do with profit.

257
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,300
It's because our Top Leader said

258
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,100
the invasion of the demonic sect
into Beili

259
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,380
wouldn't do us

260
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,580
any good

261
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:24,780
and might affect

262
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,300
our already struggling business.

263
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,460
Hence, we were sent here

264
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,220
to help you.

265
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,020
What gimmick are you up to?

266
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,580
The Dark River

267
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,260
may be an assassination organization,

268
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,180
but deep inside,

269
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,740
we value our country.

270
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,540
Su Changhe,

271
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,220
the Undertaker of the Dark River.

272
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
Su Zhe,

273
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,380
the Conical Hat Ghost of the Dark River.

274
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,100
Isn't there still one missing?

275
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,100
I remember he was

276
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,300
always inseparable from Su Changhe.

277
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,380
Do you mean him?

278
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,020
He has become the Kui.

279
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,060
Of course he's not with me.

280
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,500
But don't worry. He's coming.

281
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,420
And he's the main force.

282
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,140
The Kui of the Dark River.

283
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,900
Judging by this lineup,

284
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,020
are you planning to kill us off

285
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,060
after helping us?

286
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,700
Take it easy.

287
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,540
We won't kill our own

288
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,820
unless someone pays us to.

289
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,060
Jinxuan,

290
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,580
have today's military reports arrived?

291
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,740
Your Majesty, they just arrived.

292
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,540
Read them.

293
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

294
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,780
[Xiao Ruofeng]

295
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,460
"All towns occupied by Nanjue's army

296
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,700
have already been reclaimed
by the Langya Army.

297
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,580
Though Nanjue's army hasn't retreated,

298
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,620
they cannot achieve anything more.

299
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,540
We won."

300
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,180
The current attack from Nanjue

301
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,180
is merely a bluff from the beginning.

302
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,940
Besides, with Ruofeng
personally leading the army

303
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,460
to repel them,

304
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,700
it's an easy feat.

305
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,340
[Baili Chengfeng]

306
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,020
"The West.

307
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,740
The vicious mob in the Western Regions
has been suppressed.

308
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,220
There have been a few skirmishes
with wandering rogues,

309
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,180
but they won't develop
into a big threat.

310
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,940
We won again."

311
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,940
Sending the Pofeng Army

312
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,620
to suppress these wandering rogues

313
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,500
is indeed a waste of their talents.

314

[Lei Mengsha]

315
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,820
As for the North...

316
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,580
Keep it as short as possible.

317
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

318
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,220
"The army of the northern tribes

319
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,020
is extremely terrifying.

320
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,140
Though their numbers
are fewer than Nanjue's,

321
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,100
they are ten times

322
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,300
more ferocious.

323
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,460
They are a force to be reckoned with.

324
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,820
Fortunately,
thanks to the valiant Langya Army

325
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,780
and some great help,

326
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,500
so please rest assured, Your Majesty."

Great help?

According to the military report,

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,500
his name is Junyu.

330
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,300
He's from the Academy

331
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,860
and a disciple of Mr. Li's.

332
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,860
Mr. Li?

333
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,820
Even though
the top martial artist, Mr. Li,

334
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,700
has disappeared for so long,

335
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,460
his influence remains.

336
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,940
What about the Northwest?

337
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,980
What about that place?

338
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,220
We also received news
from the Northwest.

339
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,970
We sent martial artists

340
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,220
to keep the Northwest in check,

341
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,940
but this Wushuang City,

342
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,380
being a martial city appointed

343
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,140
by the founding Emperor,

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,740
has the responsibility
to defend the country.

345
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,860
How come the missive is so informal?

346
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,580
Your Majesty,

347
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,420
this isn't sent from Wushuang City.

348
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,020
It's from Sikong Changfeng
of Xueyue City.

349
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,420
I see. It's the Lord Vermillion Bird.

350
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,620
That explains it.

351
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,340
What does the missive say?

352
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,740
Here's what it says.

353
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,820
"The army of the demonic sect
has been intercepted,

354

Does this person

359
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,860
have the nerve to come here

360
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,100
to assassinate me alone?

361
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,620
What a joke.

You seem anxious.

368

I'm afraid it will be today.

00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,500
Lord White Tiger and Lord Azure Dragon

378
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,660
are waiting

379
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,580
at the Azure Cloud Terrace.

380
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,180
Very well.

381
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,740
Let's meet him

382
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,340
there.

383
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,260
Since he wishes to kill me,

384
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,580
let him try.

385
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,950
[Pingqing Hall]

386
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,340
He's approaching quickly.

387
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,180
The Heart Sword has a soul within.

388
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,580
Is it in fear?

389
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,940
No, it's excitement.

390
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,900
Your Majesty.

391
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,940
It's dangerous here.

392
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,260
Please hurry and leave, Your Majesty.

393
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,580
It's too late.

394
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,740
The successor of Heart Sword
from Swordheart Grave.

395
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,020
Nice sword.

396
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,260
What a great sword core.

397
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,740
That's powerful.

398
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,540
Which phase is he on now?

399
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,180
Truth be told, he's not inferior

400
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,260
to Mr. Li.

401
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,500
You know I came to kill you,

402
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,780
why didn't you hide?

403
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,260
Such audacity.

404
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,100
I have done nothing wrong,

405
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,180
so why would I be afraid
of a thief like you?

406
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,220
A thief?

407
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,900
Who is the thief

408
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,700
that stole someone else's wife?

409
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,180
Consort Xuan has long been married

410
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,500
in Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

411
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,500
It was you who fooled and abducted her.

412
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,260
How am I the thief?

413
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,340
Consort Xuan?

414
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,580
Yi Wenjun is my wife.

415
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,060
We were betrothed before,

416
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,260
and we have always been
in love with each other.

417
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,820
Xiao Ruojin,

418
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
you coerced her into marrying
into the imperial family.

419
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,340
Beili

420
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,260
has made her a sacrifice
of your power struggle.

421
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,660
You!

422
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,420
Mr. Ye,

423
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,180
I would hate to fight you.

424
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,940
But given that

425
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,740
I'm right here,

426
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,820
I can't just stand by

427
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,020
and watch you kill the Emperor.

428
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,500
So bring it on!

429
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,780
I don't want to say this,

430
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,220
but I have to.

431
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,260
Ye Dingzhi,

432
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,740
do return to the correct path!

433
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,300
Nonsense!

434
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,660
There is more

435
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,740
than just one path.

436
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,100
My path

437
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,260
is to safeguard

438
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,020
the little hut outside Gusu City.

439
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,180
Your hut is ruined!

440
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,180
But she is still around.

441
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,020
As long as she is around,

442
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,220
I can rebuild the hut.

443
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,020
Xinyue!

444
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,980
That's enough.

445
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:19,820
Ji Ruofeng,

446
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,460
you're proficient
in martial arts of all schools.

447
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,740
Ye Dingzhi

448
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,500
is so powerful now.

449
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,180
Has he attained
the Roaming Mystical Phase?

450
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,660
No.

451
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,420
Only martial artists
who follow the correct path

452
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,580
are classified into four phases
of the first stage.

453
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,980
He has strayed into the Sly Path,

454
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,220
which is beyond the four phases.

455
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,780
Judging by his power,

456
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,540
he should be in the Malevolence Phase.

457
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,500
Who else will stand in my way?

458
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,980
Transcended the suffering world of Yin
without manifestation of immortality.

459
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,180
Held no name in the Netherworld
nor among the Three Deities Mountains.

460
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,900
He's already above
the Sovereign Sky Phase.

461
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,050
In a sense,

462
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,300
it's equivalent

463
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,220
to the Roaming Mystical Phase.

464
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,660
It's just that he has deviated
into the Sly Path

465
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,380
due to his obsession.

466
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,900
He may seem powerful,

467
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,500
but he's filled with heinous qi.

468
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,940
Those I have seen
who fell into the Sly Path

469
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,340
have lost their sanity.

470
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,940
How come Ye Dingzhi

471
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,780
looks so sober?

472
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,300
He may seem so,

473
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,860
but is being trapped by his obsession.

474
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,540
Hadn't the State Preceptor

475
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,060
left Tianqi for a long journey,

476
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:16,940
his obsession

477
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,980
might have been dispelled.

478
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,380
However, that wouldn't happen.

479
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,700
Your technique

480
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,260
can suppress my internal strength.

481
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,700
I didn't know

482
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,460
that someone in Beili
practiced the Xunian Art.

483
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
You are mistaken.

484
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,220
The Xunian Art is passed down
within Beique.

485
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,860
The one that remains in Beili

486
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,420
is the Xuhuai Art.

487
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,540
Both arts originated
from the same source.

488
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,060
They mutually reinforce
and restrain each other.

489
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,260
Your zhenqi is damaged,

490
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,060
giving me the upper hand.

491
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,180
You have lost.

492
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,980
They mutually reinforce
and restrain each other?

493
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,260
It only happens

494
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,820
when our phases are equal.

495
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,500
You've only just started your ascent,

496
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,940
while I

497
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,540
am already among the clouds.

498
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:30,980
You are way too far

499
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,980
from your master, Zhuoqing,

500
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,380
who is locked away
in the Imperial Mausoleum.

501
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,220
Back then,
Yue Fengcheng and Baili Dongjun

502
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,940
inserted their internal strength
into my body,

503
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,820
I fully absorbed it.

504
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,020
Who are you

505
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,220
to think

506
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,660
you can compete
with my internal strength?

507
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,460
You stole my inner strength,

508
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,620
yet you are boasting about it.

509
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,620
Who is that?

510
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,180
Don't worry.

511
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,260
It's the grandson
of the Marquis of Zhenxi,

512
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,660
Baili Dongjun.

513
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,660
You are here.

514
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,580
Long time no see.

515
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,380
Not longer

516
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,780
than the ten years
I thought you were dead.

517
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,340
Even though

518
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,780
you weren't with me in those ten years,

519
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,860
our hearts were still together.

520
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,300
But now,

521
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,980
we are against each other.

522
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,420
So,

523
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,220
are you finally going

524
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,500
to draw your sword against me?

525
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,660
Do it, then.

526
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,300
Baili Dongjun,

527
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,540
when you followed Ruofeng

528
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,700
to Tianqi back then,

529
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,660
you were an immature lad

530
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,860
when I saw you from the rampart.

531
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,260
Now,

532
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,620
you do seem

533
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,900
like the young master
from the Marquis's mansion.

534
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,540
Do not step over this sword.

535
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,500
Leave Ye Dingzhi to me.

536
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,420
Yun,

537
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,260
mend your ways.

538
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,740
All people killed by the demonic sect

539
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,620
did nothing wrong.

540
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:53,980
Yun.

541
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,700
I don't wish to fight you.

542
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,940
When I grow up,

543
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,420
I want to
be the White Feather Sword Deity.

544
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,460
When I grow up,

545
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,140
I want to
be the Green Feather Liquor Deity.

546
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,860
When I grow up, I want to...

547
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,380
be free and fight bad folks.

548
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,140
When I grow up, I want to...

549
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,300
focus on brewing liquor

550
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,620
- and roam the martial arts world with you!
- Roam the martial arts world with you!

551
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,740
Nineteen years ago,

552
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,820
the apricot blossoms were
just as beautiful.

553
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,900
Back then, you were fond of the cool,

554
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,140
so you changed into a lighter robe.

555
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,060
Unexpectedly,

556
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,700
a late spring cold brought you down.

557
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,860
I promised that once you recovered,

558
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,260
I would take you and Wenjun

559
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,980
to watch the apricot blossoms.

560
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,740
It's a shame
that everything has changed.

561
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,060
We lost the chance.

562
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,860
This is my regret.

563
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,260
Now is the perfect time.

564
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,420
Let's go

565
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,620
and watch apricot blossoms
as promised.

566
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,620
Yun,

567
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,620
think about those innocent people.

568
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,940
Mend your ways.

569
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,180
Dongjun.

570
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,580
I want to live for myself just once.

571
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,220
I'm sorry.

572
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,620
All right.

573
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,260
If so, I will fight you
until you change your mind.

574
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,100
We have known each other for years,

575
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,380
yet we haven't

576
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,700
had a real duel.

577
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,220
I heard

578
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,580
that after you
lost all your cultivation,

579
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,340
you encountered a great opportunity.

580
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,060
Well,

581
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,540
I would like to see that.

582
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,140
What an imposing internal strength.

583
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,100
It's more powerful
than the Autumn Water Technique.

584
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,980
I created
this internal strength technique,

585
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,220
called Hanging Sky.

586
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,500
Very well.

587
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,380
Who's there?

588
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,180
Qingyang.

589
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,540
Wenjun.

590
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,900
It has been a long time.

591
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,180
I was told

592
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,980
that after I left,

593
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,060
you requested to be sent
to Muliang City.

594
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,660
Why?

595
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,860
Someone wrote me a letter.

596
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,860
Qingyang.

597
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,060
I think I heard

598
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,420
the sound of the Luminous Jade Moon.

599
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,540
It's him, isn't it?

600
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,540
Yes, it's him.

601
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,580
He's back.

602
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,460
I will take you to him.

603
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,900
To think that two young geniuses

604
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,020
show up at the same time.

605
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,660
If they didn't oppose each other,

606
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,500
the martial fortune of Beili

607
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,900
would've surpassed Nanjue's
by a hundred years.

608
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,620
The duel between them

609
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,580
may seem confusing,

610
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:34,860
but Ye Dingzhi

611
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,460
has distinctly gotten the upper hand.

612
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,300
If Baili Dongjun fails,

613
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,420
we have no choice

614
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,340
but to fight to the death.

615
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,860
No one can get away with this.

616
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,420
As of now, they are still
testing each other.

617
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,340
They haven't resorted
to their strongest moves yet.

618
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,180
The showdown between two experts
requires no more than one sword move.

619
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,300
And I'm waiting for it.

620
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,060
This liquor is named Xuyu.

621
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,980
I made it when I first entered
the martial arts world.

622
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,620
Ye Dingzhi,

623
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,700
as its name implies,

624
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,740
life and death are
as fleeting as a thought.

625
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,940
Attack and retreat
are decided by a thought.

626
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,060
The world comes into being
within a thought.

627
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,180
This sword move

628
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,540
inherits the divine aura of my master.

629
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,020
Do watch closely.

630
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,060
My sword move

631
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,540
is the final move

632
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,700
my master launched at Dongyue Lake.

633
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,540
Neither deities

634
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,020
nor demons,

635
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,820
only death can cease it.

636
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,860
I have never seen

637
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,220
such a desperate move.

638
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,020
Is this Ye Dingzhi's strongest move

639
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,340
you mentioned?

640
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,160
[No animals were harmed
during the filming of this drama.]

641
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,580
[Some animals were created
using bionic props and 3D effects.]
