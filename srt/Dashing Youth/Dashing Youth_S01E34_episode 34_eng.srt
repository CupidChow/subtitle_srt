23
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,920

24
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,600
I'm Jun Yu of the Academy. Please give me your guidance.

25
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,440
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,320
Do you think he can handle it?

27
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,940
I don't know.

28
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,300
By the way, Dongjun.

29
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,140
Have you ever heard of such a person in the Academy?

30
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,220
The Academy is so big. Besides Master, there are many other instructors.

31
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,580
Their disciples and grand disciples are all over the world. I can't recognize them all.

32
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,040
But this person is rather interesting.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,320
Do you see it?

34
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,780
Envoy Wuzuo is more powerful than ever.

35
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,540
It's like he appeared out of nowhere. I can't figure it out.

36
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,980
I can see you. Up here.

37
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,160
I've had the pleasure of seeing proper Zhuge's Qimen Dunjia Arts.

38
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,360
But to be honest, this branch of Beique's is not up to par.

39
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,640
Stop hiding. It's stuffy down there.

40
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,380
You stink.

41
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,440
I have a heart of righteousness and a fist of a gentleman.

42
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,580
As for Qimen Dunjia Arts, how strange it is and where can you hide?

43
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,540
Who exactly are you?

44
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,680
I told you my name is Jun Yu.

45
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,440
Zhuge Wucheng, you're as useless as your name suggests. 
  (TN: Wucheng means useless)

46
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,270
How did you know my name?

47
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,900
I  drank with Zhuge Qingshan, played chess with Zhuge Liuhua,

48
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,040
walked through Zhuge Luo's Eight Trigrams Formation, and slept on Zhuge Yun's real gilt bed.

49
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,700
How do you think I knew your name?

50
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,460
Junior, I want to use a sword technique but my hands are empty and I lack a good sword.

51
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,030
What? Junior?

52
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,220
Didn't you pay respect to my portrait when you were first admitted?

53
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,460
No.

54
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,380
I can't believe my old master forgot. Forget it. I won't bother with him.

55
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,540
I'm your generation's First Senior of the Academy.

56
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,780
First... First Senior?

57
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,100
You've got to be kidding me.

58
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,840
You don't believe me? You'll believe it after a spar with me.

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,020
But it's a rule left behind by Master.

60
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,820
What is the name of the sword?

61
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,100
Celestial Sword of Famous Swords Manor, Dustless.

62
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,660
Dustless? What a good name. It matches my sword technique.

63
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,000
What is the name of your sword technique?

64
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,200
Gentleman's Sword Technique.

65
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,800
What an interesting man.

66
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,740
Yes. Aren't all of us at the Academy like that?

67
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:22,400
Arrogant, carefree, unrivaled.

68
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,500
A gentleman has nine considerations.

69
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,180
Clarity in Sight. Keen Hearing. Gentle Expression. Respectful Demeanor. Sincere Speech.

70
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,720
Blood... Blood!

71
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,280
Blood!

72
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,140
It's blood!

73
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,840
This is...

74
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,160
Blood Demonic Art, a forbidden technique in Beique.

75
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,320
I can't believe Envoy Wuzuo would practice this evil art in secret.

76
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,400
Come on! Kill me!

77
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,300
So this is your Gentleman's Sword Technique? It's too slow!

78
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,280
The manners of a gentleman are indecent.

79
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,280
The sword of an evil man must be stained.

80
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,480
The anger of a gentleman is the fear of his vassals. If a gentleman is quiet, the world is at peace.

81
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,240
You have pissed off a gentleman.

82
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,980
Begone!

83
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,880
I'm the First Senior of the Academy.

84
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,940
I'm the closest person in the world to Mr. Li.

85
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,900
Envoy Wuzuo is dead.

86
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,420
A divine bird rises with the wind one day, soaring 90,000 miles upwards.

87
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:36,135
How can a man have such a magnificent heart and yet write so poetically?

88
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:43,704
Master. I really want to meet your friend, the Poetry Deity.

89
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,874
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

90
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:50,454
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

91
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:55,394
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

92
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,454
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

93
00:09:58,454 --> 00:10:00,974
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

94
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,420
It's a pity. You're quite capable.

95
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,785
But you can't scare me.

96
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,794
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

97
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,078
It's been a long time since I've fought, but my sword technique is still the best in the world.

98
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,380
First Senior, where are you going?

99
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,300
Master asked me to help you out. You're on your own the rest of the way.

100
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,660
The world is vast. Many ladies haven't met me. I have to meet them.

101
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,280
Without separation there can be no reunion.

102
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,760
Take care, both of you.

103
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,700
Aren't you traveling north?

104
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,620
Don't you want to see the wilderness and the icy mountains?

105
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,420
Wait for me! Let's just travel together.

106
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,006
I wonder why you're traveling, so far north.

107
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:12,680
You met my little sister earlier. We're after them.

108
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,980
They've taken my best friend.

109
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,340
I see.

110
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:23,480
There was a man in that carriage whose breath was very weak, as if he was seriously injured.

111
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,580
If I could have stopped that carriage would this trip have ended earlier?

112
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,300
Yes.

113
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,940
I'm sorry.

114
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,680
Senior, you said the breath of the man in the carriage was weak?

115
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,540
Yes. He was more like dying than weak.

116
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,440
They won't let Ye Dingzhi die.

117
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,293
In that case there are only two possibilities.

118
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:55,020
One is that they seriously injured Ye Dingzhi when they took him away.

119
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:00,060
I haven't seen Brother Yun in years, but his martial arts are not inferior to mine.

120
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,100
It's unlikely that he was seriously injured.

121
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
So it could be the second possibility.

122
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,180
Dongjun. Do you remember Beique's search, for innate martial artists?

123
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,660
Ye Dingzhi is another innate martial artist.

124
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,060
Are you saying Brother Yun has mastered Xunian Technique?

125
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,300
But what does that have to do with weakness?

126
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,140
If you practice on your own you won't get weak.

127
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,060
I'm afraid someone forced his power into Ye Dingzhi's body.

128
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,200
 Forced power into his body?

129
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,960
Zhong Feili, the Soul Official of Beique, looks frivolous on the surface,

130
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,140
but he's a martial maniac.

131
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,460
With a mortal body he forcibly made his way to the third level of Xunian Technique.

132
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,500
If he transfers this power to Ye Dingzhi,

133
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,840
Ye Dingzhi only needs to forge these three levels of power within the limit of his meridians.

134
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,280
And he will be able to obtain the third level of Xunian Technique that Feili has adopted.

135
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,240
Amazing. I can't believe there's such a martial art in the world that allows us to transfer power.

136
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,020
Yao'er, how long will it take us to get to Tian Wai Tian?

137
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,280
If we travel day and night, we'll arrive in about 17 days.

138
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,520
Senior, I have a favor to ask of you.

139
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,140
Please help me drive the carriage the rest of the way. I'll continue to practice Xunian Technique.

140
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,700
Although Brother Yun's three levels of power are given to him at no cost, I can't lose to him either.

141
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,686
When he reaches the third level, I must reach the third level as well.

142
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:24,586
Just leave it to me.

143
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,020
Miss, please wait here. I'll go and report to Deputy Commander Luo.

144
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,500
He'll bring Prince Xiao Yu here as soon as possible.

145
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,960
Thank you.

146
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,200
He's also the one who took Princess Consort Jingyu from Tianqi City last time.

147
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,080
He looks so ordinary.

148
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,760
But such an ordinary-looking person is the Soul Official of Tian Wai Tian.

149
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,000
Is he amazing?

150
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,020
He's a survivor of Beique.

151
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,100
Even the Bai Xiao Sect has trouble finding out about him.

152
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,980
Why do you think they're interested in Princess Consort Jingyu,

153
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,440
and why did they go to such lengths to send her away, and then bring her back again?

154
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,340
You want to get involved?

155
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,680
I wonder if he'd be involved if he were here.

156
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,380
He would.

157
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,420
If so, I'll have to do something about it.

158
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,720
But you're Lord Vermilion Bird of Tianqi City now.

159
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,080
I've stayed in this boring city for too long and I don't want to be Lord Vermilion Bird anymore.

160
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,640
Are you leaving?

161
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,940
But if you leave, what about the woman who plays the zither?

162
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,220
Well... I don't think she still likes me.

163
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,000
If she didn't like you,

164
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,320
why would she wait for you to listen to her playing the zither every day?

165
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,900
It's possible because I look like her old friend.

166
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,440
What brings him here?

167
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,780
Father.

168
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,660
You left and you shouldn't have come back for any reason.

169
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,140
Father, why won't you let me go?

170
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,060
Our family has served the Xiao Family for generations

171
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,060
and we've been in the shadows for a long time.

172
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,420
If you hadn't left you might even have had a chance to be the Empress.

173
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,980
But she doesn't want to be the Empress.

174
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,260
Lord Vermilion Bird.

175
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,790
Master Yi.

176
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,340
That's troublesome.

177
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,700
Why did you let someone tell me this?

178
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,540
I don't want to be involved.

179
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,500
I'm a general now.

180
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,780
Can't you leave me out of this kind of love affair?

181
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,780
I'm leaving. Pretend I wasn't here and that I knew nothing about it.

182
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,180
General Lei, Yi Bu was just here.

183
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,500
Let them sort it out themselves.

184
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,900
Then Sikong Changfeng went in.

185
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,700
With the relationship between the Shadow Sect and the Four Guardians of Tianqi,

186
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,760
if they fight, it will be very difficult to end.

187
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,700
Here we go again.

188
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,100
There's the Shadow Sect in Tianqi City and now there's the Four Guardians.

189
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,580
Obviously one of them must be redundant.

190
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:10,660
You shouldn't be meddling in my affairs because I'll kill you if I get the chance.

191
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:23,940
Well... Miss Yi, I'm Sikong Changfeng, Baili Dongjun's junior.

192
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:29,100
You and I never met, but I almost died for you in Tianqi back then.

193
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,760
Ye Dingzhi is half a friend of mine.

194
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,300
If I just sit by and do nothing today, my senior will cut ties with me for sure.

195
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,300
We never met, but you've already risked your life for me once.

196
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,000
You don't have to do it again.

197
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,540
This time is different.

198
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,640
This time I'm not risking my life.

199
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,930
Because I'm not the same boy who couldn't beat anyone anymore.

200
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,020
Since the founding of the country,

201
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,300
the Shadow Sect has been ordered to guard the imperial family and the ruler of Beili.

202
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,900
Even though we were the ones who helped His Majesty take the throne,

203
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,620
we're still Prince Langya's men.

204
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,820
Clear accounts even among close kin.

205
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,660
If we're not one of them, then there's always a reason.

206
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,590
Who do you think the Emperor would choose

207
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,960
if he could only choose one of us?

208
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,700
General Lei, it's still not too late to stop them.

209
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,720
If I take action this will never end.

210
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,820
So what are you going to do?

211
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,180
Sikong Changfeng, you can do it!

212
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,060
I have finally seen your Dragon Transformation.

213
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,160
It's really impressive.

214
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,380
You're getting old.

215
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,660
Is that so?

216
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,220
Instead of saying you're getting old, you just don't want to believe in your sword anymore,

217
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,900
but in something else, like power.

218
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
But your disciple, Luo Qingyang, is different.

219
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,020
Because he only believes in his sword.

220
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,500
Maybe. But there's no turning back for me.

221
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,180
How stubborn.

222
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,660
That's a nice spear.

223
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:59,680
Master said he could become a Spear Deity someday.

224
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,780
There's someone else.

225
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,640
The carriage from the palace.

226
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,940
General Lei, you've hidden your honor.

227
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,180
I'm flattered.

228
00:20:31,155 --> 00:20:34,809

229
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,580
You're just in time, Grand Eunuch.

230
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,220
It's a disgrace to Beili for Lord Vermilion Bird to fight

231
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,060
with the Shadow Sect's leader in the middle of the street.

232
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,080
Cut the nonsense.

233
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,140
Say it. What do you want?

234
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,760
Consort Xuan, His Majesty has sent me to escort you back to the palace.

235
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,900
Consort Xuan? I don't like this title.

236
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,860
I'm here to welcome you back to the palace, Your Highness.

237
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,380
I've heard that you're a martial expert in the palace who's on par with Luo Qingyang.

238
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,500
Luo Qingyang wouldn't draw his sword even if I talk until I'm blue in the face.

239
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,060
Today, you shall fight me.

240
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,780
Lord Vermilion Bird, please mind your position.

241
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,980
Don't say that. I'm not Lord Vermilion Bird.

242
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,500
I am just a wanderer in the Martial World.

243
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,680
Miss Yi, all you have to do is tell me your decision.

244
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:58,160
As long as I'm alive, no one will take you away from here today.

245
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,820
What if they fight?

246
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,860
The worst thing to do is let Ruofeng clean up the mess.

247
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,480
Your Highness.

248
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,100
Young Master Sikong, I'll never forget your favour.

249
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,040
Miss Yi, have you thought this through?

250
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,100
I've been trapped in this cage for too long.

251
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,720
I know exactly how powerful it is.

252
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,820
I was lucky to get out once.

253
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,780
But this time, I know I'll never get out of here again.

254
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,820
Young Master Sikong, that's enough.

255
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,380
You've done enough for me.

256
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,660
Life is not about enough.

257
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,480
It's about not regretting.

258
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,720
Let's go.

259
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,360
Respectfully welcome Consort Xuan back to the palace.

260
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,580
This is no fun.

261
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,420
She did it to protect you.

262
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:39,100
If she nods, even you won't be able to leave Tianqi City safely.

263
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,700
What were Miss Yi's last words just now?

264
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,680
She said, "Let's go."

265
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,960
Let's go, then.

266
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,180
Are you leaving?

267
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,280
Yes. I don't belong here.

268
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,440
Are you sure you don't want to say goodbye to her?

269
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:18,060
- No. 
 - But didn't you say that life is about not regretting?

270
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,820
Who says I will regret it?

271
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,420
After all, we're still young and the world is so vast.

272
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,300
Who knows if we'll meet again?

273
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,280
But you say you've been wandering around without a day of schooling,

274
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,300
but why do you speak so poetically sometimes?

275
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,480
Because I once met a poor scholar.

276
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,340
He loved to say such poetic things.

277
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,260
This scholar must have been so interesting that you haven't forgotten him even after all this time.

278
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,340
Yes, his name is Jun Yu.

279
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:49,420
He told me he'd travel the world, and never miss the girl who was waiting for him.

280
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,620
Horseman.

281
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,780
- Take it. 
 - Thank you.

282
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,100
My friend, see you when I see you.

283
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,880
Sikong Changfeng, Jun Yu.

284
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,540
Such an interesting fate.

285
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,300
He's left?

286
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,860
He really has left?

287
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,300
He didn't come here to say goodbye?

288
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,300
No. He went all the way to the city gate without even looking back.

289
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,980
Sikong Changfeng, you're a jerk!

290
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,830

291
00:27:00,338 --> 00:27:03,883

292
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,780
Father, you're awake.

293
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,580
Yes.

294
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,520
Where are we?

295
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,860
Tian Wai Tian.

296
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,380
- What? 
 - Where else would you want to go?

297
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,700
Tianqi, of course.

298
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,660
You want to go to Tianqi in this condition?

299
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,140
If we hadn't saved you, you'd have been killed by demonic energy.

300
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,200
- Demonic energy? 
 - You've been living too carefree in Gusu City

301
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,800
so you don't know that Yi Wenjun's husband, Prince Jingyu, has already become Emperor.

302
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,900
If she goes back, she'll be the new consort.

303
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,500
I know you want to go to her, but you're going to get yourself killed if you do so.

304
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,540
Feel your innerscape.

305
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,580
This is...

306
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,940
Earlier, you went mad and lost control of yourself.

307
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,900
I forcibly transferred my three levels of Xunian Technique to you and saved your life.

308
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,420
Now you've got my three levels of power in you.

309
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,340
This technique allows you to transfer power directly?

310
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,700
Yes. I'm not a natural martial artist.

311
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,820
Hence, this is only the third level of Xunian Technique that ordinary people can achieve.

312
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,640
But you're different. You're a natural martial artist.

313
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,180
If you practice it, you'll be able to achieve much more.

314
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,220
Why must you let me practice this technique?

315
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,420
There are countless martial experts in Beili.

316
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,100
With Mr. Li alone guarding the gate, Beique has no chance at all.

317
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:30,340
That's why we need someone who masters Xunian Technique to lead us through the gate.

318
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,460
You want to use me to destroy Beili?

319
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,580
- As I said... 
 - That's what you thought before.

320
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,300
What about now?

321
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,340
Legend has it that Demon Deity Sword Techniques are the result of a Sword Deity's sacrifice

322
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,380
to the demon god a hundred years ago.

323
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,140
Ye Dingzhi.

324
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,559
Instead of borrowing power from the demon god, why don't you become a demon yourself?

325
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,980
If you can master Xunian Technique, the Demon Deity Sword Techniques are nothing.

326
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,380
By then, no one will be able to stop you in Tianqi City.

327
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,660
Even Li Changsheng himself may not be your match.

328
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,140
You will be able to avenge your family's death, your wife will come back,

329
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,700
and all the suffering of the past will not be repeated.

330
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,600
Beili mistreats you, so does the world.

331
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,700
Do you still want to persist in this nonsense?

332
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,820
After Prince Jingyu ascended to the throne he sent many martial experts to look for you.

333
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,500
Even if they didn't find Yi Wenjun that day, what about tomorrow, the day after tomorrow?

334
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,540
She may have once wanted to live the life she dreamed of with you.

335
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,820
But you have to put yourself in her shoes.

336
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,180
She'll have to wander with you.

337
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,660
Is that what she wants?

338
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,060
Is that what your son wants?

339
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,580
So, what do you want now?

340
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,600
We'll take you to my father in Langyue.

341
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,580
He's the only one who can teach you the rest of the techniques.

342
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,000
Sure. How long will it take for us to get there?

343
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,140
Within a month.

344
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,700
Dongjun, you're awake.

345
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,400
How's it?

346
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,180
I've had a long, long dream.

347
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,340
Did you have a nightmare?

348
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,180
What did you dream about?

349
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,480
I felt like...

350
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,480
I was falling into an endless abyss,

351
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,420
with no end in sight.

352
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:40,180
I kept falling... and falling.

353
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,620
Sometimes it's as hot as hell.

354
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,260
Sometimes it's as cold as falling into an abyss.

355
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,820
I feel nothing but despair.

356
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,500
In my dreams there's a fellow traveler.

357
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,400
Then,

358
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,760
a man gave me a hand.

359
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,780
But he cut me on the hand.

360
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,300
But I broke free.

361
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,080
Who was he?

362
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,040
My best buddy.

363
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,480
Baili Dongjun.

364
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,690
Why is it so cold all of a sudden?

365
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,160
Of course it's cold, Dongjun. We are in the far north now.

366
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,020
Come on.

367
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,300
Senior, close the curtain. You want to freeze me to death?

368
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,440
When you were meditating just now your real energy was surging.

369
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,100
I was afraid your real energy wouldn't dissipate so I didn't put this on you.

370
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,360
How are you? Are you feeling better?

371
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,120
Yao'er, wouldn't you be freezing, then?

372
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,980
Let's share it.

373
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,900
Dongjun, you're so shameless.

374
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,180
Dongjun, how many levels have you reached in Xunian Technique?

375
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,700
You said every level is a step up.

376
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,700
Each level has its obstacles.

377
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,773
If I'm not mistaken, I've reached the third level.

378
00:35:19,773 --> 00:35:23,720
No more, no less. It's the third level of Xunian Technique.

379
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,340
So this is Tian Wai Tian.

380
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,760
Soul Official, take the child inside and use your internal energy to protect him from the cold.

381
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,420
Ye Dingzhi and I will go directly to Langyue to look for Father.

382
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,220
Why can't we go together?

383
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,660
Even though it's a blessed land, not everyone can go there.

384
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,640
There's an icy field even more terrifying than this one.

385
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,940
Even the bravest horse would be deterred.

386
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,380
We'll have to go there on foot.

387
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,600
Anshi, go with this uncle to a warmer room. I'll be there soon.

388
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,260
Father, be careful.

389
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,340
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

390
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,200
Your mother is still waiting for us.

391
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,320
Honorable Envoy Wuxiang.

392
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,280
Is this the current head of Tian Wai Tian?

393
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,840
I've been waiting, for your arrival for a long time.

394
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,180
I'm Ye Dingzhi.

395
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,180
Honorable Envoy Wuxiang, please take care of things outside.

396
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,720
Please take care of the child, too.

397
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,520
The journey to Langyue is fraught with danger.

398
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,600
You two must be careful.

399
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,500
Thank you.

400
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,380
- Honorable Envoy Wuxiang. 
 - Take the child and head back first.

401
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,340
I'm waiting for a few more friends here.

402
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,820
Honorable Envoy, are you going to fight in person?

403
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,440
The secret envoy has sent a message back.

404
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,560
They've already killed Wuzuo.

405
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,040
If I don't fight, will there be anyone else in Tian Wai Tian to stop them?

406
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,900
Feili, go.

407
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:29,920
Soon, the world will belong to us.

408
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,680
We're almost there.

409
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,500
They must have gone straight to Langyue.

410
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,420
The carriage can't travel there.

411
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,500
In a while, we'll have to get off and head there on foot.

412
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,180
Senior, what's wrong?

413
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:03,120
Junior, it's not that I want to stop.

414
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,580
Someone's blocking the way.

415
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,060
Your Highness, we meet again.

416
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,400
I'll tell you what I couldn't tell you last time.

417
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,580
For your lust for power, for your desire,

418
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,700
you've made the people of Tian Wai Tian, who are now finally able to live in peace, work for you.

419
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,100
How can you sleep at night?

420
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,660
In my opinion this is what will lead Beique to real destruction.

421
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,440
Your Highness, you're wrong.

422
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,940
I've never been obsessed with power in my life.

423
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:00,180
It's just that our people should be living in a warm and fertile land,

424
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,020
not a barren and cold one like this.

425
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,740
But some things are predestined.

426
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,773
If you can't let go, you'll only lose more.

427
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:13,340
Instead of letting the war start again, we should be reborn in a new home.

428
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,280
Lose?

429
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:25,140
When His Majesty is released and returns to Beili, no one will be more powerful than him in the world.

430
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:32,020
Your Highness, do you want your father to stay dormant?

431
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:47,320
If his awakening will lead Beique to destruction,

432
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,400
my answer is yes.

433
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:02,980
Another one who's fallen into evil ways. But this one is much harder to deal with.

434
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,280
Why?

435
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,740
Envoy Wuzuo fell into the evil path, just superficially strong, but easily defeated.

436
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,360
As for Honorable Envoy Wuxiang, his very heart has embraced the evil path.

437
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,540
His heart is as solid as a rock. He's determined that what he's doing is the right thing to do.

438
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,220
A man like this is really tough to deal with because he has faith.

439
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,780
And faith can often lead to greater power.

440
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,720
If you can stand up why do you need a wheelchair?

441
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:44,360
To tell you the truth, I haven't been on my feet for 20 years.

442
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,180
If we don't leave now it'll be too late.

443
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:51,900
If Honorable Envoy is willing to risk his life to stop us, Ye Dingzhi and the others must be on their way to Langyue.

444
00:41:54,220 --> 00:42:00,020
Dongjun, you'll have to walk the last part of the journey on your own I'm afraid.

445
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,440
Before you leave I have four words for you. Do not regret it.

446
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,360
I'll remember your words.

447
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,420
Thank you for everything throughout this journey.

448
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:22,080
You're the one who killed Wuzuo aren't you?

449
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,900
And I'm going to kill you next.

450
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,260
It's not a good choice for you to use your Dragon Power

451
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:34,060
to force your crippled legs to stand up in such a cold wind.

452
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:40,340
It's not a choice, but I have no choice.

453
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,373
Some people are annoying but admirable.

454
00:42:44,373 --> 00:42:48,820
You're an admirable opponent, though you're not a good person.

455
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,780
I'm flattered.

456
00:42:53,860 --> 00:43:01,200
You and I will fight to the death here then.

457
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,980
No one can get out of this icy field.

458
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,860
It's like there's no end to it.

459
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,140
Langyue is as far as we can go.

460
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:12,460
If we stop here even for a moment our blood will freeze.

461
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,320
Why did your leader choose to practice in such a place?

462
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,660
My father said that practicing in a place like this

463
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,620
would help him remember the pain of losing his country.

464
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,220
Your father’s obsession runs deep.

465
00:45:26,603 --> 00:45:31,138

466
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,240
We've arrived.

467
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,340
This door weighs a 500 kilograms. We can't open it with brute force.

468
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,460
My father put a restraint on the door to prevent us from disturbing him.

469
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,900
Except for innate martial artists pushing the door with the power of Xunian Technique,

470
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,800
the stone door can't be opened from the outside.

471
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,380
I see.

472
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,520
The person inside doesn't even know I'm here.

473
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:30,880
He won't open the door and walk out but you are eager to see him.

474
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,560
Am I the key to this?

475
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,420
Forget it.

476
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:50,300
I've come this far. There's nothing to be afraid of.

477
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:56,860
I'm determined to practice Xunian Technique.

478
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,641

479
00:47:14,641 --> 00:47:16,860

480
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:28,030

481
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:40,042
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

482
00:47:40,042 --> 00:47:47,900
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

483
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:57,120
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

484
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:05,680
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

485
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,840
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

486
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,200
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

487
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,580
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

488
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:20,100
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

489
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,580
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

490
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,540
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

491
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,060
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

492
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:33,480
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

493
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,840
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

494
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,240
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

495
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:46,920
♫  I met you  ♫

496
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:31,164
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

497
00:49:31,164 --> 00:49:39,040
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

498
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:48,020
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

499
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:56,740
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

500
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,900
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

501
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,300
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

502
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,560
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

503
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,160
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

504
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,600
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

505
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,600
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

506
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,180
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

507
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,540
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

508
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:28,960
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

509
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,340
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

510
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:37,940
♫  I met you  ♫
