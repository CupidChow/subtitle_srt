admire him very much.

189
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,740
But Father said

190
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,940
we mustn't get involved
in the conflict between parties.

191
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,220
It's not that we want to get involved.

192
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,980
It's that the political structure

193
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,540
is being reshuffled.

194
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,380
If we want to stay in power,

195
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,780
we must do something.

196
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,620
Forget it. I won't understand it anyway.

197
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,020
But Prince Langya

198
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,580
is Dongjun's senior.

199
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,220
Will he

200
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,340
also ask Dongjun to go back to Tianqi?

201
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,780
The last sentence of the letter says

202
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,700
he also sent Dongjun
the wedding invitation.

203
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,660
But it's up to Dongjun

204
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,860
and Mr. Li to decide

205
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,460
whether he'll go or not.

206
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,940
He mentioned Mr. Li?

207
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,820
It's to put our minds at ease.

208
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,340
Prince Jingyu.

209
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,980
Who is that?

210
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,860
Do you know him?

211
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,340
Prince Jingyu's name is Xiao Ruojin.

212
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,540
Do you have any guesses now?

213
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,580
Xiao Ruojin, Xiao Ruofeng.

214
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,740
Could he be...

215
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,540
Yes.

216
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,340
He's Martial Uncle Xiao's brother

217
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,500
from the same mother.

218
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,180
This wedding invitation should be

219
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,300
from Martial Uncle Xiao.

220
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,620
But it's no fun

221
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,940
traveling all the way to see someone

222
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,740
get married.

223
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,620
I don't want to go.

224
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,700
Sikong Changfeng, are you going?

225
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,820
Prince Jingyu.

226
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,500
It's not a bad name.

227
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,540
But

228
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,340
what's it got to do with me?

229
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,420
Mr. Li had anticipated this

230
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,660
before he left.

231
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,140
He said you wouldn't

232
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,020
be interested.

233
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,340
But he wanted to ask

234
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,820
whether you'd like
to go back to Tianqi City

235
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,740
to meet your old friends,

236
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,060
Martial Uncle Lei, Martial Uncle Xiao,

237
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,140
my master and others.

238
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,100
Don't you want to compete with them

239
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,380
to see

240
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,420
who's stronger?

241
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:42,820
I'm going, then.

242
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
So hasty?

243
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,860
I think Master is right.

244
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,300
It's time to see how much
our martial arts skills

245
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,540
have improved.

246
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,420
Yao, let's depart.

247
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,020
I'm not going with you.

248
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,940
I'm going back to Sky's Beyond.

249
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,980
I should give them the explanation

250
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,220
I owe them.

251
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,420
I'll go with you to Sky's Beyond.

252
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,620
Dongjun,

253
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,300
it's my own business

254
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,060
and my responsibility.

255
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,220
I should face it alone.

256
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,100
But...

257
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,500
Don't worry.

258
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,300
I'm the Princess of Beique.

259
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,460
They won't do anything to me.

260
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,300
Trust me.

261
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,580
I'll bring her back.

262
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,420
Where are you going?

263
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,220
Tianqi.

264
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,380
Are you going to snatch the bride?

265
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,260
Are you out of your mind?

266
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,300
I won't allow it.

267
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,900
Tianqi City

268
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,100
is a dangerous place.

269
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,860
If you go there now,
you're going to die.

270
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,420
Whether I die or not is my business.

271
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,660
It has nothing to do with you.

272
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,980
How does it have nothing to do with me?

273
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,060
What about my father if you die?

274
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:18,980
If you die,

275
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,380
when will Beique be restored?

276
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,220
Get out of my way.

277
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,140
No.

278
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,620
Unless you kill me.

279
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,180
No one can stop me.

280
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,300
Ye Dingzhi!

281
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,320
[Fengtian Hall]

282
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,940
[Chengtian Gate]

283
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,380
Stop there.

284
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,300
[Shadow]

285
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,780
Please.

286
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,700
Who is he?

287
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,460
His Majesty's chosen bodyguard,

288
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,860
but not yet officially appointed.

289
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,540
I've heard that His Majesty intends

290
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,820
to train him
to be the Commander of the Royal Guard.

291
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,220
He doesn't look

292
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,340
impressive.

293
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,860
No one with a Shadow token

294
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,220
is to be trifled with.

295
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,420
Master.

296
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,940
You've had the pleasure

297
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,660
of walking all over Tianqi City today.

298
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,340
With Wenjun's wedding coming up,

299
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,140
I was worried
that something might go wrong,

300
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
so I took a look

301
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,460
at the Shadow Guard posts in the city.

302
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,620
Something might go wrong?
What could possibly go wrong?

303
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,420
If you're completely loyal to me,

304
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,220
there's nothing that Ye can do.

305
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,660
You didn't tell me,

306
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,980
but I can tell.

307
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,060
I dare not.

308
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,420
As for Ye Dingzhi,

309
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,100
I think

310
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,380
the matter has been settled.

311
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,300
Settled?

312
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,140
Is that the way

313
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,700
I taught you to solve problems?

314
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,100
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,420
Ye Dingzhi is the disciple
of Rain Demon.

316
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,220
Now, Mr. Li is not

317
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,540
on guard in Tianqi City.

318
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,900
If Rain Demon tries
to break into the city,

319
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,460
no one is confident

320
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,380
that they can stop him by themselves.

321
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,420
But Rain Demon is dead.

322
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,220
So you go back and tell Wenjun

323
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,140
not to expect anyone to take her away.

324
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,340
Master.

325
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,940
Are you really that heartless?

326
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,020
Heartless?

327
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,140
That's Ye Yun.

328
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,380
Ye Yun died a long time ago.

329
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,460
Now, in my eyes,

330
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,860
he's just

331
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,380
a nobody named Ye Dingzhi.

332
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,060
Not to mention

333
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,020
the fact that the Shadow Sect
has only existed

334
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,660
in the shadows for so many years.

335
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,980
Now you've been chosen by His Majesty

336
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,060
to become a guard

337
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,580
and Wenjun

338
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,260
will be taken as a secondary consort
by Prince Jingyu.

339
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,540
We've been waiting for so many years

340
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,100
for a chance to see the light of day.

341
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,340
How can we give it up

342
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,140
because they want to be together?

343
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,980
I know

344
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,020
you fancy Wenjun.

345
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,340
If you want to take her away,

346
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,140
now,

347
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,580
I'm giving you the chance

348
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,980
to draw your sword on me...

349
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,940
and kill me.

350
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,780
I dare not.

351
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,620
A man should have

352
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,020
higher aspirations.

353
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,380
Let go of your feelings

354
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,700
and I'll let you off the hook

355
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,100
for what happened that day.

356
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,460
I asked you to come here today

357
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,580
to tell you

358
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
that after the wedding,

359
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,420
you will go to His Majesty's side

360
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,260
and do what you need to do.

361
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,740
Do you hear me?

362
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,220
I want to be the best in the world.

363
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,580
I want to be the best in the world.

364
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,580
So Wenjun can

365
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,100
marry whoever she wants.

366
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,820
Show yourself.

367
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,100
Last time, I told you

368
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,300
that if you wanted to see me,

369
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,500
just shout at any place

370
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,900
and I'd appear.

371
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,260
Did you take it seriously?

372
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,340
Why do you want to see me?

373
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
Because you're interesting.

374
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,420
Baixiao Hall

375
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,820
is interested in anyone

376
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,860
who's interesting.

377
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,420
Moreover, in 20 years,

378
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,660
you'll be one of the top three

379
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,740
in the world.

380
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,580
All right.

381
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,980
You've asked your question.

382
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,020
It's my turn.

383
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,340
Why did you want to see me?

384
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,020
Deliver something to someone

385
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,500
for me.

386
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,380
Baixiao Hall's information
is all-encompassing.

387
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,780
But we seldom

388
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,340
deliver things anymore.

389
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,300
You can name your terms.

390
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,900
I can deliver it for you

391
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,380
but you have

392
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,460
to do something for me in the future.

393
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:31,860
Sure.

394
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,660
Don't you want to ask what it is?

395
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,180
No need.

396
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,300
You're a smart person.

397
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,900
I'm sure I won't

398
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,700
and can't refuse the thing

399
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,260
you're asking me to do.

400
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,740
Deal?

401
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,660
You're truly a man of few words.

402
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,100
Deal.

403
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,300
But we have

404
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,580
a more detailed copy

405
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,340
of this thing of yours.

406
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,700
Do you believe it?

407
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,260
Do you want us to deliver ours?

408
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,860
No, just use this one.

409
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,460
All right.

410
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,780
You're the boss.

411
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,140
We'll deliver this.

412
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,060
Don't blame me for not warning you.

413
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,940
This is a capital offense.

414
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,220
You really talk a lot.

415
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,740
Since you've made

416
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,140
a pleasant deal with me,

417
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,620
I'll give you one more piece
of information.

418
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,700
Ye Dingzhi has left Nanjue

419
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,700
and is heading here.

420
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,300
If nothing unexpected happens,

421
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,500
he'll show up that day.

422
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,180
I know.

423
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,700
Even if it's a million li away,

424
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,700
he'll come.

425
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:22,030
[Tianqi]

426
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,940
Tianqi City,

427
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,380
I'm back.

428
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,260
Sir.

429
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,620
How dare you call me that?

430
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,980
Brat,

431
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,180
why do you look like

432
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,100
you've had bad luck when you see me?

433
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,780
We haven't seen each other
in half a year.

434
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,620
Have you not felt homesick?

435
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,780
I've missed my grandpa.

436
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,580
I've missed my mother.

437
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,620
And I've missed you

438
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,460
just a little bit.

439
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,100
Brat,

440
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,500
your temper has not changed,

441
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,300
but your martial skills have.

442
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,340
Let's go.

443
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,460
Now that we're both here,
let's go together.

444
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,500
Sir, where are you going?

445
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,420
I've come to Tianqi City

446
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,020
to attend Prince Jingyu's
wedding banquet.

447
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,180
Xiao Ruofeng invited me

448
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,380
to the Academy first.

449
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,260
You look like

450
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,460
you're going to the Academy, too.

451
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,700
You're attending
the wedding banquet, too?

452
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,140
Greetings, sir.

453
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,820
Are you Dongjun's friend?

454
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,940
I'm Sikong Changfeng.

455
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,100
Dongjun and I...

456
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,860
We aren't friends.

457
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,460
He's like my brother,

458
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,660
and he's my junior.

459
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,060
Let's go together, then.

460
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,580
It feels like a dream

461
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,940
to be back here again.

462
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,980
You are here, sir.

463
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,300
The Heir of Marquis of Zhenxi,
Baili Chengfeng,

464
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,300
is here to greet you, Your Highness.

465
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,660
Seniors.

466
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,460
I trust you have been well
since we last met.

467
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:55,980
Ruofeng.

468
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,260
I haven't seen you in months.

469
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,420
You've gained weight.

470
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,460
Senior Liu Yue,

471
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,020
Luoxia said she can't come back
in a while

472
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,460
and asked me to send her regards to you.

473
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,260
I've gained weight?

474
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,140
I think you've got a lot of nerve now.

475
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,100
You wrote to me saying

476
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,260
that your martial skills
have greatly improved.

477
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,020
What?

478
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,900
Would you like to compete with us?

479
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:15,820
Ruofeng.

480
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,580
Let me deal with him.

481
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,340
I've been wanting

482
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,340
to beat you up for days.

483
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:22,820
Come on.

484
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,140
Let's have a fight in the yard.

485
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,500
Let me see

486
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
what great skills

487
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,340
Master has taught you.

488
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,380
Did Master really teach you
the Double-Handed

489
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,060
Blade-Sword Technique?

490
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,900
Of course.

491
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,700
Let me show you

492
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,340
what I'm capable of.

493
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,620
Dongjun.

494
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,620
Shut it.

495
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,300
If you want to mess around,
do it after today.

496
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,660
The Heir's right.

497
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,020
Dear seniors,

498
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,380
I'll leave you to rest here.

499
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
Carriages will be here

500
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,060
in two hours.

501
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,420
I shall take my leave now.

502
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,060
My brother is still waiting for me
at the mansion.

503
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,660
As for you, sir,

504
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,700
would you like

505
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,060
to go with me to see my brother?

506
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,780
Is it convenient for Prince Jingyu?

507
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,340
Yes, it is.

508
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,620
The groom

509
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,340
doesn't need to do anything.

510
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,860
Sure.

511
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,620
Dongjun, you shall wait here.

512
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,500
When it's time,

513
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,180
come with your seniors.

514
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,020
Everyone,

515
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,340
please take care of my son.

516
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,820
Don't worry, sir.

517
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,460
I feel like

518
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,940
they're hiding something from me.

519
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,940
They're not trying to hide it from you.

520
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,580
It's just that what they're going
to talk about

521
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,260
doesn't necessarily interest you.

522
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,820
It's not a good thing anyway.

523
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:52,940
Dongjun,

524
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,220
in a few days,

525
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,900
we'll be leaving Tianqi City.

526
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,300
Seniors,

527
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,500
has something happened

528
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,580
in Tianqi City recently?

529
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,660
There hasn't been anything special

530
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,380
in the past six months.

531
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,660
It's just

532
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,900
that it's time to part.

533
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,700
It seems

534
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,140
the other young masters
have other plans.

535
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
We're fellow apprentices

536
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,740
but we're not real brothers after all.

537
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,740
Some like to fight

538
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,780
while some like to travel.

539
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,780
I can't force them to do anything.

540
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,660
What a pity.

541
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,780
Actually,

542
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,980
if I weren't

543
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,020
from the imperial family,

544
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,300
maybe

545
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,700
I would have made

546
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,580
the same decision as them.

547
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,260
To wander the world...

548
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,900
Since you mentioned me,

549
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,580
I'll be brief.

550
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,580
I was expelled

551
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,020
by my family a long time ago.

552
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,740
Now, I'm just

553
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,020
a homeless wanderer.

554
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,500
Dashing and carefree.

555
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,660
Well said.

556
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,620
But don't say that again.

557
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,180
Oh, right.

558
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,340
Before we meet my brother,

559
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,700
I have a question

560
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,420
for you.

561
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,140
Please go ahead.

562
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,860
Why did the Marquis choose us?

563
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,740
It wasn't my father who chose you.

564
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,420
It was me who chose you.

565
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,100
That's an interesting way of putting it.

566
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,500
So you mean

567
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,420
the Marquis of Zhenxi might

568
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,540
choose someone else?

569
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,580
No, that means

570
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,220
I'm in charge of everything

571
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,140
regarding the Marquis of Zhenxi.

572
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,620
Congratulations!

573
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,540
It's been a long time.

574
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,700
Congratulations, Your Highness.

575
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,860
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

576
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,780
Yun.

577
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,780
I miss you so much.

578
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,180
I want to eat beef with you
in the steppe

579
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,980
and see the Buddha statues in the south.

580
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,740
Will you be coming?

581
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,540
Wenjun.

582
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,900
Wait for me.

583
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:09,900
You're here.

584
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,220
Senior Luo,

585
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,820
are you here to stop me?

586
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,820
What are you trying to do?

587
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
A lot of people

588
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,940
know me here in Tianqi City.

589
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,620
I don't want

590
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,620
any unnecessary trouble.

591
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,660
So it's you
who Ji Ruofeng was talking about.

592
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,340
This is a map

593
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,620
of the Shadow Sect's forces
in Tianqi City.

594
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,220
Memorize it before attacking the city.

595
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,380
Only then will you have
a chance of survival.

596
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,820
Are you going
to take the bride away with me?

597
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,700
You're not afraid
of being punished by your master?

598
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,300
I've been planning this for a long time.

599
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,340
Otherwise, you wouldn't

600
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,500
have seen the scroll.

601
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,140
But this is the only chance

602
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
of success,

603
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,220
that's why I haven't done anything.

604
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,900
Even if you hadn't come,

605
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,140
I would have gone myself.

606
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,340
Put it on.

607
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,060
No need.

608
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,060
I'm a felon of the imperial court.

609
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,740
Last time, I only met those people

610
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,060
in Tianqi City in a hurry.

611
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,940
This time...

612
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,620
I'll make everyone in Tianqi City

613
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,340
remember my face.

614
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,260
Ye Yun?

615
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,500
Can he alone break into the city?

616
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,620
Sir, there's another person,

617
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,100
but his face is masked

618
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,180
and we can't identify him yet.

619
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,660
That means

620
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,140
you already have a guess.

621
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,380
Why are you afraid to say it?

622
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,660
He's... He's Senior Luo.

623
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,300
Luo Qingyang?

624
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,060
You're indeed

625
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,900
my good disciple.

626
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,260
Young Master, something bad
has happened.

627
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,740
Our spy in the Shadow Sect

628
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,100
has sent a shocking message.

629
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,180
What spy?

630
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,100
That's a friend.

631
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,980
Greetings, Young Masters.

632
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,180
Mr. Liu Yue really

633
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,420
cares about everything that happens

634
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,460
in Tianqi City.

635
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,700
Since when do you have a friend

636
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,900
in the Shadow Sect?

637
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,180
What has happened?

638
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,940
Just say it.

639
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,580
Let's see if it's worth

640
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,660
all the shouting.

641
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,820
Some people are breaking into the city

642
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,540
and heading for Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

643
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,820
The Shadow Sect has sent its men
to stop them,

644
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,060
and many have been injured.

645
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,220
Who dares to do that?

646
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,300
Ye...

647
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:09,980
Ye what?

648
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,340
It can't be Ye Dingzhi, can it?

649
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,300
Yes, it's Ye Dingzhi.

650
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,460
It's really Yun.

651
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,460
Why is he going
to Prince Jingyu's Mansion?

652
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,260
Ye's treason case

653
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,620
was obviously set up by Prince Qing.

654
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,740
It has nothing to do

655
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,700
with Prince Jingyu.

656
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,620
Even if he wants
to avenge his father's death,

657
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,100
he shouldn't go
to Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

658
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,900
Are you going to see Ye Dingzhi?

659
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,140
Sir, you already knew, didn't you?

660
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,500
Do you know what Ye Dingzhi

661
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,900
is here for?

662
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,820
To take revenge.

663
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,100
Prince Jingyu is marrying

664
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,700
the daughter
of the Shadow Sect's leader,

665
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,140
Yi Wenjun.

666
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,540
Wenjun?

667
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,940
Didn't Wenjun leave Tianqi City

668
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,420
some years ago

669
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,260
to travel around?

670
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,380
That's why we've lost contact.

671
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,700
She told me this in the letter

672
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,660
in her own handwriting.

673
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,340
It seems that the letter was written

674
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,380
by someone with an ulterior motive.

675
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,260
They are all jerks from the Shadow Sect.

676
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,540
So, are you going to help him

677
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,580
or stop him?

678
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,060
One side is the brother of your senior

679
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,020
who brought you to the Academy

680
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,060
and treats you with sincerity,

681
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,940
and the other side
is your childhood friend

682
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,900
who fought with you
through thick and thin.

683
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,100
What do you choose?

684
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,100
I just want to know

685
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,380
if Wenjun

686
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,420
likes Prince Jingyu.

687
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,140
I only know

688
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,380
that when Ye Dingzhi

689
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,580
last came to Tianqi City,

690
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,740
he met Yi Wenjun again

691
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,260
and they almost eloped.

692
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,500
Since Wenjun is still in love with Yun,

693
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,860
isn't it obvious who I'm helping?

694
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,620
So

695
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,220
you're on Ye Dingzhi's side.

696
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,620
No.

697
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,860
I'm on the side of love.

698
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:55,620
Changfeng.

699
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:56,940
Let's go if you want to.

700
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,340
Let's go.

701
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,340
It's nice to be young.

702
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,860
All it takes is

703
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,740
the simplest of reasons
to make a decision.

704
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,890
[Tianqi City Defense Map, Jixia Academy]

705
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,140
We're almost
at Prince Jingyu's Mansion, right?

706
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,260
There's still the last batch
of Shadow Guards.

707
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,820
They're one of the Shadow Sect's

708
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,900
most powerful Shadow Guards
in Tianqi City.

709
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,380
They're guarding
Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

710
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,500
They're called the Eagle's Eyes

711
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,540
and there are six of them.

712
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,580
They're not easy to deal with.

713
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,540
Apart from the Shadow Sect's guards,

714
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,100
there are other experts

715
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,660
in Prince Jingyu's Mansion, right?

716
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,020
Prince Jingyu is not skilled
in martial arts,

717
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,500
but he has a younger brother

718
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,500
named Xiao Ruofeng.

719
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,020
He is a disciple of Mr. Li
of the Academy.

720
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,580
It's him.

721
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,020
Whatever.

722
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,100
It's a matter of life and death,

723
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,820
so let's fight for it!

724
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,980
It's rare to see you speak so loudly.

725
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,860
They're coming one group after another,

726
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,180
and we're

727
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,940
just the two of us.

728
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,540
No one will come to help us.

729
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,380
Who says you have no help?

730
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,380
Dongjun,

731
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,220
what brings you here?

732
00:36:59,220 --> 00:36:59,740
Yun.

733
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,540
You should have asked me to do something

734
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,540
as fun as bride snatching with you.

735
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,900
Ye Dingzhi.

736
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,820
Who are these two?

737
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,820
I'm Baili Dongjun.

738
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,460
This is my good friend,

739
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,060
Sikong Changfeng.

740
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,140
We're here to help you.

741
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,140
Do you know

742
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,820
that the person we want to take away
is the princess consort?

743
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,540
It's not just a capital offense.

744
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,140
It will even result in the extermination

745
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,340
of your entire family.

746
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,380
Luo is right.

747
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,500
Don't give

748
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,540
those people
in the imperial court any leverage.

749
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,860
Your family will be implicated.

750
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,180
Yun, don't try to talk me out of it.

751
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Back then, I was too young

752
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,540
to help you.

753
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,340
Now, I have a sword in my hand.

754
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,820
Whatever you want to do,

755
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,020
I'll be with you.

756
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,620
I'm a nobody,

757
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,740
so I don't need a mask.

758
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,060
Their reinforcements are here.

759
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,540
Ye Dingzhi, take someone
to go with you first.

760
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,900
Leave this to me.

761
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,620
This is the strongest
Shadow Guard group,

762
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,740
as Luo Qingyang said,

763
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,340
the Eagle's Eyes.

764
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,100
That's enough for you two.

765
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,140
[Prince Jingyu's Mansion]

766
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,500
Some people are trying
to kidnap the bride.

767
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:58,940
Kidnap the bride?

768
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,700
Although Dongjun wears a mask,

769
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,580
the Dustless

770
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,260
and the Instant Kill Sword Arts

771
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,260
passed down from you

772
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,380
are really recognizable.

773
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,100
What?

774
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,020
It's Dongjun who wants
to take the bride?

775
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,060
It's not him.

776
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,740
It's General Ye's youngest son,

777
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,660
Ye Yun.

778
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,020
Dongjun is helping him.

779
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,340
Ye Yun?

780
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:40,620
Your...

781
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,100
Your swordsmanship is unique.

782
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,740
It's useless even if you wear a mask.

783
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,380
I knew I couldn't hide it from you.

784
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,500
Senior,

785
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,180
you're not going to make it.

786
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,020
I know.

787
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,580
But if I don't try,

788
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,020
I'll regret it forever.

789
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,460
Senior, run!

790
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,300
Sikong Changfeng.

791
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,500
Go to them first.

792
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,980
Leave this to me.

793
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,140
This person is hard to deal with.

794
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,420
All the Shadow Guards combined

795
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,180
would not be as strong as him.

796
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,380
I know better than anyone else

797
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,340
how difficult he is to deal with

798
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,980
because he's my master.

799
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,060
Don't worry.

800
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,980
He won't kill me.

801
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,140
Okay.

802
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,020
Is he your mate?

803
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,740
And he's leaving you behind?

804
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,700
This is supposed

805
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,620
to be my business alone.

806
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,620
Yun.

807
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,500
Leave this to me.

808
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,860
Don't worry and just go.

809
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,140
Love and brotherhood

810
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,260
are the purest

811
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,900
and most wonderful things in the world.

812
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,620
I will never let foul men

813
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,420
tarnish them.

814
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,060
However,

815
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,620
you have to remember this.

816
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,740
If something like this

817
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,660
happens to me in the future,

818
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,180
remember to draw your sword and save me

819
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,620
because

820
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,700
I don't want to let go

821
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,740
of the girl I love either.

822
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,620
All right.

823
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:12,900
I'm here.

824
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,700
Changfeng.

825
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,380
Where is Senior Luo?

826
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,420
He told me to come to you first.

827
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,140
What you just said was so good.

828
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,420
It reminded me

829
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,700
of my beloved girl, too.

830
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,940
You have a beloved girl, too?

831
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,300
Could she be...

832
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,820
Cut the crap. Let's fight.

833
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:27,660
All right.

834
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,660
Yun, leave this to us.

835
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,380
Go and save your beloved girl.

836
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,540
Dongjun.

837
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,980
As long as I don't die,

838
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,820
you and your beloved girl

839
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,020
will definitely

840
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,860
be together forever.

841
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,340
Make sure you don't die, then.
