00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,940
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,500
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost   ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,220
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,600

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,320

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,400

23
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,875

25
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,670
Langyue, as its name suggests, is indeed a blessed land.

26
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,100
There must be geothermal springs running through this cave.

27
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,310
Therefore, even if it’s freezing outside,

28
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,100
this place retains the warmth of spring.

29
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,410
Regarding what you said about your father just now, that is plain nonsense.

30
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,200
I've never entered Langyue in person.

31
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,040
I suppose Father has his own hardships.

32
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,800
Father?

33
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,920
Father?

34
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,220
Father?

35
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,980
You thought he was dead?

36
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,940
How many years has it been since you last saw him?

37
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,640
Indeed, it's been many years.

38
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,380
He might not even recognize me when he sees me now.

39
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,700
Then what should I do to wake him up?

40
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
I don't know.

41
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,540
Father must be in a meditative state right now.

42
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,460
Father.

43
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,140
It's Qing'er.

44
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,220
I'm here to visit you.

45
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,320
Stop! That's your daughter!

46
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,680
Father!

47
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,100
I'm Qing'er.

48
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,680
Qing'er?

49
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,900
Are you truly my Qing'er?

50
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,760
Yes.

51
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,140
Do you fear me?

52
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,700
No, I don't.

53
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,680
You do fear me,

54
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,460
but there's no helping it.

55
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,340
I've already taken the first step.

56
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,940
I've reached the ninth level of the Xunian Technique.

57
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,020
When the living beings of the world see me,

58
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,390
they will feel an irresistible fear from the depths of their hearts.

59
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,993
If you two hadn’t come,

60
00:06:38,993 --> 00:06:44,370
I would’ve mastered the ninth level in six months.

61
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,400
Father, Langyue is isolated from the outside world.

62
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,370
We were worried about your condition.

63
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,940
So we had no choice but to barge in.

64
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,420
I interrupted your training.

65
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,940
- I deserve to die. 
 - No.

66
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,900
You don't.

67
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,820
You're a good girl.

68
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:10,440
It's because you brought me a different gift.

69
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,260
A “gift”?

70
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,900
I never expected anyone but me to practice this technique.

71
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,300
Although you’re young, you’ve already reached the fourth level.

72
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,260
 The fourth level?

73
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,860
 Could it be that Ye Dingzhi has reached another level in such a short period?

74
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,640
Once I absorb your powers today,

75
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,700
I will no longer need to wait.

76
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,500
I can reach a new level immediately.

77
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,260
So you brought me here because of this?

78
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,220
I...

79
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,340
If that's the case, everything makes sense now.

80
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,760
You were all behind what happened to Wenjun as well, weren’t you?

81
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,820
Even if we hadn’t come for you, Xiao Ruojin would never have let you two go.

82
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,100
But don't worry.

83
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,720
Yi Wenjun won't be in danger.

84
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,780
Qing'er, you fancy him?

85
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,070
Worldly relationships are troublesome indeed.

86
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,670
Young man, if you remain obedient,

87
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,610
I can spare your life

88
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,540
for my daughter’s sake.

89
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,140
Why?

90
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,020
Just because... you're the ex-ruler of Beique?

91
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,980
"Ex-ruler?"

92
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,500
That... hurt.

93
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,600
You're pretty good.

94
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,320
If I were younger, I might not be able to beat you.

95
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,880
But now, to me, you’re

96
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,920
nothing more than an ant.

97
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,860
Is that so?

98
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,220
Xunian Technique?

99
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,160
The Immovable Lord Technique.

100
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,600
The Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

101
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,500
You're using three powerful techniques at once.

102
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,760
Aren’t you afraid your meridians might be severed?

103
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,433
Since you wish to fight, I’ll give it my all.

104
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,860
In the past, someone condensed a lifetime of his skills into 13 sword techniques.

105
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,100
He conquered Nanjue with these 13 sword techniques.

106
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,780
He used one sword technique for each expert he faced, shocking all of Nanjue.

107
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,220
That was my master, Rain Demon.

108
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,460
He observed the darkness of the world with his skills.

109
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,220
 Master, if you’re watching these 13 sword techniques from the afterlife,

110
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,380
 you’d better not say I’m putting you to shame.

111
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,560
 He's only slightly injured?

112
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,640
Seems like you're no ordinary natural martial artist.

113
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,180
The younger generation is truly formidable.

114
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,100
- What's your name? 
 - Ye Dingzhi.

115
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,920
Ye?

116
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,560
I once encountered a martial artist with extreme prowess called Ye.

117
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,060
He was originally from Beique

118
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:16,620
but in the end, he became a lackey of Beili.

119
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,480
He was not a lackey!

120
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,160
He was a great general!

121
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,640
My father, Ye Yu!

122
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,760
What? Ye Yu is your father?

123
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,380
Fine.

124
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,080
I guess that's all for today.

125
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:42,420
Let me show you the most magical part of the Xunian Technique before I send you to the afterlife.

126
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,420
From now on, I shall be the top martial artist in the world!

127
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,260
Brother Yun!

128
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,000
- Don't come any closer! 
 - Get out of the way!

129
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,520
Sister?

130
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,680
Father.

131
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,260
It's me. Yao'er.

132
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,280
Yao'er?

133
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,980
You're my daughter, Yao'er?

134
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,440
Father, please stop. It's not too late to turn back!

135
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,280
It’s been so many years since you’ve seen me, and now you’re trying to stop me?

136
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,460
Sister, this is the final step.

137
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,020
We're just one step away from completing the plot we've been harboring for 20 years.

138
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,500
All of our efforts might go down the drain because of your actions.

139
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,340
Sister, please think twice.

140
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,460
We'll be harming Father and Beique for real if we don't stop him!

141
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,200
Sister.

142
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:10,060
We shouldn't launch an unwinnable, irreversible war for a ruined kingdom!

143
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,540
Fine.

144
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,700
If you guys insist on stopping him, you need to kill me first!

145
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,440
You talk too much.

146
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,532
Now, no one can stop them.

147
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:33,660
Only a practitioner of the Xunian Technique can stop it.

148
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,440
What a coincidence.

149
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,000
It just so happens that I know this stupid technique.

150
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,340
Who are you?

151
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,180
Your son-in-law.

152
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,740
Brother Yun, I'm here.

153
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,340
Dongjun.

154
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,980
I didn't expect the world to change this drastically after 20 years of seclusion.

155
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,480
Turns out, there are three Xunian Technique practitioners in the same era.

156
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,280
Excellent. Today, I shall absorb both of your powers!

157
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,380
In your dreams!

158
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,320
Sky, grant me an ocean of water!

159
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,320
Dongjun!

160
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:54,060
Yao'er.

161
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,320
Sister, it's futile.

162
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,040
This isn't something we can stop.

163
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,880
You're all done for!

164
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,020
 Dongjun, I've already died several times.

165
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,400
 Dying now won't change anything.

166
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,680
Brother Yun.

167
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,200
Bring it on!

168
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,680
Brother Yun! Don't!

169
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,520
You'll die from this! Do you hear me?

170
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,180
You're still doing it?

171
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,200
Is this the will of the heavens?

172
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,280
If that's the case,

173
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:09,360
I'll give you the rest of my powers.

174
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,940
Yue Fengcheng, have you lost your mind?

175
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,580
Brother Yun.

176
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,940
Brother Yun!

177
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,320
Brother Yun, don't do this! Hurry and stop!

178
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,540
You'll die from this!

179
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,940
 Who...

180
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,560
 - Who's calling me?   
 - Hurry and stop! Brother Yun!

181
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,640
 It's Dongjun.

182
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,060
Brother Yun, wake up. Don't let it cloud your mind.

183
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,640
Brother Yun! Hurry and come back, Brother Yun!

184
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,280
 "Come back"? It's too late.

185
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,060
 My family members are dead. My master is dead.

186
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,300
 - My wife has been taken away as well.  
 - Brother Yun!

187
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,380
 This world was never kind to me.

188
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,980
 Therefore, I shall return the favor.

189
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,720
 Baili Dongjun, sorry for this.

190
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,280
- Father? 
 - Father!

191
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,120
Dongjun!

192
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,420
He managed to merge all three of our powers.

193
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,620
Brother Yun.

194
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,180
It's pointless.

195
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,860
He... has already gone berserk.

196
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,320
You...

197
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,540
Ye Dingzhi, stop!

198
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,780
Have to die.

199
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,220
Brother Yun. Brother Yun!

200
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,360
Please stop. Please stop!

201
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,900
Father.

202
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,620
No.

203
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,640
Dongjun... don't...

204
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,580
Brother Yun.

205
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,340
Brother Yun.

206
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:20,760
One's prime never returns, just like a morning that never repeats.

207
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,220
People say that the Honorable Envoy Wuxiang of Tian Wai Tian is a scholar.

208
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,600
No one expected this scholar to be much stronger than Envoy Wuzuo.

209
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,540
You deserve my very best.

210
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,460
You've been exhausted for a long time.

211
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,260
You should take a break before heading to the afterlife.

212
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,660
Thank you, Mister Jun.

213
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:06,940
Years ago, I was fortunate to meet Mister Li.

214
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,660
You're his eldest disciple.

215
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:14,120
Dying at your hands, I have no regrets.

216
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:22,160
However, even if I were to die here, it wouldn’t mean we’ve lost.

217
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,020
Do you really think my junior and the others can’t stop your plan?

218
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,560
Do you truly think that Yue Fengcheng can become the top martial artist in the world

219
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,980
and destroy it after mastering the ninth level of the Xunian Technique?

220
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,220
What a joke.

221
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,200
I don't argue with those who speak foolishly.

222
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,120
I don't mean to sound offensive, but how long will it take for you to die?

223
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,980
Mister Jun, sorry for disappointing you.

224
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,120
The cold wind on the icy plains is freezing my wound.

225
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,420
I might survive for two more hours.

226
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,180
But if you strike again, I won’t survive even a second longer.

227
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,800
Fine. Let's make a bet, then.

228
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,029
If Yue Fengcheng arrives here first within the next two hours,

229
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:14,960
I’ll treat your wound and let you live.

230
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,540
If the sect leader is here, it means he has mastered his divine arts.

231
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,080
Naturally, he can treat my wounds.

232
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,340
By then, I wouldn’t need your help.

233
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,340
I'll kill him first.

234
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,820
After that, I'll save you.

235
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,420
Mister Jun, you're truly confident in yourself.

236
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:43,480
What if Baili Dongjun arrives here first?

237
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,420
I'll still save you.

238
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:51,280
However, you must swear on Tian Wai Tian’s reputation that you will remain here until your death.

239
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,060
At the same time, you must give up any plans to attack Beili forever.

240
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,740
What do you think?

241
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:05,240
It seems like there's no harm in taking the bet.

242
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,780
All right. Let's make the bet, then.

243
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,880
Baili Dongjun.

244
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,080
You don't understand, do you?

245
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,740
Then I'll explain it to you.

246
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,300
When I was practicing Demon Deity Sword Techniques,

247
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,940
the seed of demon hood was already planted within me.

248
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:30,740
Although I suppressed it, it didn't vanish completely.

249
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:38,500
After Wenjun returned, I thought everything would improve.

250
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,980
But I never expected...

251
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,700
it was all part of a game.

252
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:01,260
If one isn't strong enough, you'll only end up as a pawn.

253
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,320
That's why my father was accused of treason, and his entire clan was executed.

254
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,580
That's why my wife was taken away on numerous occasions.

255
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,000
Why I could never live in peace!

256
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,710
Therefore...

257
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,820
from now on, I no longer want to be a pawn.

258
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,580
I want to be the one who controls the pawns.

259
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,060
Baili Dongjun, stop being so naive.

260
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:54,840
No one can remain silly and innocent forever.

261
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,240
The pain and suffering of the world will change you.

262
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,300
Now, I'm Ye Dingzhi.

263
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,220
I'm no longer Ye Yun.

264
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,940
If I have to keep suffering as Ye Yun,

265
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,020
I guess I've seen...

266
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,340
and endured enough of it.

267
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,200
Brother Yun...

268
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,260
Brother Yun.

269
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,640
You can stay where you are alone.

270
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,620
Dongjun!

271
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,720
Ye Dingzhi!

272
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,940
I've been cultivating here for 20 some years.

273
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:15,400
I aspired to reclaim Beique and attack Beili.

274
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:22,220
But now, my aspirations will be put to an end.

275
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,618
You're... incredible.

276
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:30,860
Now, your body possesses all three of our real energy.

277
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,180
You have enough power to rule the world.

278
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,540
You want to be the one who controls the pawns?

279
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,820
Then... lead the clans of the Northern Regions

280
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,980
and with their cavalry, trample the Central Plains.

281
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,140
You're dying by my hands.

282
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,980
Don't you hate me?

283
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,690
As heroes,

284
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:04,820
we cannot hold such simple views of love and hate.

285
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,380
What I hate most is Beili.

286
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,720
Right now, we have a common enemy.

287
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,606
Then please... inherit my dying wish.

288
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,140
Become the world's top martial artist

289
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,740
and trample Beili!

290
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,520
He's here.

291
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,860
The result of this bet is much more interesting than what I had in mind.

292
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,820
I didn’t expect that neither of us would win the bet.

293
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,220
How come?

294
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,420
How could this be?

295
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,980
He has fallen into demon hood, yet he has a human heart.

296
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,480
I think he's slightly stronger than the ninth level of the Xunian Technique.

297
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,340
Are you Ye Dingzhi?

298
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,060
I am.

299
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,620
I can't defeat you.

300
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,040
At the very least, I can't kill you.

301
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,380
I don't wish to fight you either.

302
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,600
I'm curious as to what happened within the deep icy plains.

303
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,720
Is Yue Fengcheng dead?

304
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,760
He is.

305
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,940
How did he die?

306
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,100
I absorbed all of his internal strength.

307
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,020
Initially, I wanted to kill him,

308
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,360
but Baili Dongjun begged me to spare him.

309
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,260
Therefore, I spared him.

310
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,540
However, his meridians couldn't withstand the shock.

311
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:47,020
Now... I suppose he's dead.

312
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,680
How is that possible?

313
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,280
How is that possible?

314
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,700
But you're not that lucky.

315
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,940
You must die at my hands.

316
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:24,780
I've devoted my entire life to the fruition of this plan.

317
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:30,540
In the end, everything was still in vain.

318
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,960
Your devotion to this plan has nothing to do with me.

319
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:48,420
Right now, I should be in a thatched cottage outside Gusu City.

320
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,660
That area is warm year-round.

321
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,020
It's full of plants and trees.

322
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:02,780
Not here, in this icy hell.

323
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:21,480
Even if you were to dwell in an icy hell forever,

324
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,580
it wouldn't be enough to redeem your sin.

325
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,860
Right now, you're a huge threat.

326
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,540
I know that.

327
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:55,120
Instead of worrying about me, why not worry about him?

328
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,660
I've absorbed all of his internal strength as well.

329
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,940
He'll die too if you don't transfer some of your real energy to him.

330
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,660
He traveled thousands of miles just to save you.

331
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,140
But now he's dying. Are you just leaving him there?

332
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,880
My real energy will just hasten his death.

333
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,260
I know you already have an answer to my question.

334
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,880
But I still wish to ask you this:

335
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,220
Why don't you come with us?

336
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,540
I can purify your demon hood for you.

337
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,320
No need for that.

338
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,180
In the end, we'll be taking two different paths.

339
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:51,620
If that's the case, it means a fight is unavoidable if we meet again.

340
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,060
Then we should avoid each other.

341
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,140
What about him?

342
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,060
He's your best friend.

343
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,320
I don't deserve to be his friend.

344
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,440
Master, oh, Master.

345
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,740
You were right.

346
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,380
Disappointed people

347
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,620
do litter this world of ours.

348
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,480
Soul... Soul Official! We're in trouble!

349
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,200
- What is it? 
 - An invader suddenly attacked us!

350
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,500
He's too skilled for us! No one can stop him!

351
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,340
Was it a middle-aged scholar and a youth dressed in white?

352
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,280
It's me.

353
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,700
Ye Dingzhi?

354
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:34,020
Now, you only get to utter one last sentence before your death.

355
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,700
I hope you cherish your chance.

356
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,400
Envoy Wuxiang and I plotted everything.

357
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,640
Don't kill Yue Qing!

358
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,400
My name is... Ye Dingzhi.

359
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,860
From this moment onward, I shall be your new sect leader.

360
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,860
Those who are unsatisfied with my rule shall die.

361
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,420
Tang Lianyue has left.

362
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,420
Sikong Changfeng has left as well.

363
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,220
Ji Ruofeng's stand has always been ambiguous.

364
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:56,129
Of the Four Guardians of Tianqi you painstakingly established, only Xinyue remained.

365
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:58,480
Don't you think it's a shame?

366
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,480
Senior Lei, you're still around, aren't you?

367
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,240
The successor of the Sword Heart and the legendary Lei Mengsha.

368
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,120
I have more than enough with you two alone.

369
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,660
I'm afraid external troubles will arise once internal ones subside.

370
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:20,100
I think Beique was the one behind Yi Wenjun's disappearance.

371
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,120
You're right.

372
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,960
Elder Wangyou wrote to me,

373
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,140
saying Ye Dingzhi and the child went missing from the cottage outside Gusu City.

374
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,220
Yi Wenjun has now shown up in Tianqi City.

375
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,920
What about Ye Dingzhi?

376
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,120
Are you saying that he'll...

377
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,320
I'm trying to understand what Beique gains from this.

378
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,680
As for Ye Dingzhi, I'm not worried about him invading Tianqi now.

379
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,860
I'm just afraid that he won't invade it right now.

380
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,360
I've also received some news.

381
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,260
Dongjun has left Xueyue City.

382
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,720
What a time of turmoil.

383
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,920
I hope that my hunch isn't correct.

384
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,100
Then why did you let Sikong Changfeng leave?

385
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,960
I could never make him stay. He would leave eventually.

386
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,540
Tianqi City is too small for him.

387
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,982
Only the Martial World can withstand a dashing tempest like him.

388
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,200
But don't worry, I have a contingency plan

389
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,100
I made a promise to them.

390
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,540
What promise?

391
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,260
We made a promise that as long as they hold a pass,

392
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,380
they’ll appear whenever someone needs their protection.

393
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,820
If they die...

394
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,864
Even if I die, my descendants cannot discard this Vermilion Bird Pass, huh?

395
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,120
Xiao Ruofeng does think highly of me, huh?

396
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:05,140
How could someone like me ever get married and have descendants?

397
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,300
Let's go! Time to travel the world!

398
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,700
Is he in the same state?

399
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,427
Ye Dingzhi's descent into demon hood was a huge shock to him.

400
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:42,780
It's not that he can't accept what Ye Dingzhi has done to him

401
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:48,220
He just can't accept the fact that he has lost Brother Yun.

402
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,780
Compared to that, I'm more worried...

403
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,700
About Dongjun's internal strength?

404
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,840
Dongjun's real energy was emptied in an instant.

405
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,560
I'm sure his inner state was seriously damaged.

406
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,360
We need to find an expert to reconstruct his inner state.

407
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,540
If we don't treat his condition in time,

408
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,900
I'm afraid he won't be able to practice martial arts again.

409
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,500
Martial Uncle, you're very powerful.

410
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,640
Do you have any solutions for this?

411
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,980
I don't.

412
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,480
The only expert I can think of is Master.

413
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,380
But now, Master's whereabouts are unknown.

414
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,660
No one knows where he is.

415
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,860
At the immortal mountain beyond the sea?

416
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,360
The immortal mountain beyond the sea?

417
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,040
That's right. Why didn't I think of that?

418
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,760
Then I suppose you two were there before?

419
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,100
When Dongjun and I were in Xueyue City, we traveled to many places.

420
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:51,960
We were lucky enough to visit the immortal mountain and encounter Mister Mo Yi there.

421
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,300
Mister Mo Yi?

422
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,060
I'm sure Mister Mo Yi has that kind of power.

423
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,140
Excellent!

424
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:04,980
However, I'm afraid I can't go to the immortal mountain beyond the sea with you guys.

425
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,500
But why?

426
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,480
The deities there will only see the people they wish to see.

427
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,860
Years ago, I committed a wrong deed.

428
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:19,720
Due to that, whenever I'm near the immortal mountain, the waves will engulf my boat.

429
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,420
Martial Uncle, what did you do?

430
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:27,780
Years ago, I destroyed the mountain with my sword.

431
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,800
I injured many people there and also tore down some of the temples.

432
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,820
In the end, I burned down the mountain out of rage.

433
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,640
Mo Yi and his master came from that mountain.

434
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,920
Anyway, it's all in the past now.

435
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,760
We should think of a way to persuade Dongjun to act.

436
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,260
 Brother Yun. I don't understand.

437
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,800
 I'm Ye Dingzhi.

438
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,960
 I'm no longer Ye Yun.

439
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:19,660
 If I have to keep suffering as Ye Yun,

440
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:26,766
 I guess I've seen... and endured enough of it.

441
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,000
 You can stay where you are alone.

442
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,170
Dongjun?

443
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,480
Dongjun.

444
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,960
Junior.

445
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,260
This is bad.

446
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,960
Thank you, Senior.

447
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,480
Your inner state is damaged. Don't try to regulate your breathing yourself.

448
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,360
It's pointless.

449
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:33,580
Could I lie to myself and say Brother Yun spared me if I had a sliver of internal strength left?

450
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,840
Ye Dingzhi did spare you, but...

451
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,880
Anyway, you're in a terrible condition now.

452
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,520
Just now, Yue Yao and I thought of a solution.

453
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,920
She'll join you in seeking the immortal mountain beyond the sea.

454
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,420
You both will seek Mo Yi's help to reconstruct your inner states. What do you think?

455
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,900
People say one loses their sharpness after living in Tianqi City for a long time.

456
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,980
- I guess that's true. 
 - As if!

457
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,560
What... What are you doing here?

458
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,500
You didn't utter a single word that night.

459
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,480
I... I thought you already rejected me.

460
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,600
This...

461
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,320
Don't run!

462
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,360
Don't be angry. I wanted to find you before I left the city.

463
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,620
But I was worried that you might find me annoying.

464
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,620
Feng Qiuyu, do you like me as well?

465
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,160
So that Ji fellow didn't deceive me after all?

466
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,840
What do our affairs have to do with that masked fellow?

467
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,100
Why is he making the call here?

468
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,620
No, no. You make the call here. Let's stop and talk.

469
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,960
From now on, I'll do whatever you say, okay?

470
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,400
Feng Qiuyu, don't run away from me!

471
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:48,060

472
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,521

473
00:43:53,521 --> 00:43:55,540

00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,680
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

487
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,080
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

488
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:26,060
♫  I met you  ♫

489
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:10,046
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

490
00:46:10,046 --> 00:46:17,940
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

491
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:27,300
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

492
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:35,640
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

493
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,760
♫  As if destined by fate,   ♫

494
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,160
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

495
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,520
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

496
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,120
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

497
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,460
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

498
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,560
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

499
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,040
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

500
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,400
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

501
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,820
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

502
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:11,200
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

503
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,000
♫  I met you  ♫
