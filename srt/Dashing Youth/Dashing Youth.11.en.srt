91

104
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,620

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,020
in fact,

178

when I first met you,

179
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,580
I wanted to ask

180
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,060
if we

181
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,180
had met before.

182
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,740
Is that why you chose me?

183
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,180
Don't overthink it.

184
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,620
I chose you

185
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,380
because you are handsome.

186
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,020
And good-looking people

187
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,180
are supposed

188
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,740
to team up with each other.

189
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,860
It's the law of the universe

190
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,260
since time immemorial.

191
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,180
I looked around

192
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,060
and thought you looked the most dashing.

193
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,140
While I agree with that,

194
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,660
I...

195
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,140
Mr. Ye, think about it.

196
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,300
Do think about it.

197
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,340
Mr. Ye.

198
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,220
Ye.

199
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,820
Please make way.

200
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,340
I am very flattered,

201
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,460
but I already

202
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,580
have a teammate in mind.

203
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,420
Mr. Ye.

204
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,860
Thanks. I pick...

205
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,860
- Mr. Ye.
- Ye.

206
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,380
Mr. Ye,

207
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,340
I can't believe you'd choose me.

208
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,260
Please move aside.

209
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,300
I pick you.

210
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,260
Why me?

211
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,380
Because you're handsome.

212
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,660
Fine.

213
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,740
You're charming too.

214
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,180
I overheard you

215
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:40,980
saying that good-looking people

216
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,380
are supposed to team up with each other.

217
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,700
Zhuge Yun

218
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,180
is quite handsome.

219
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,300
But unfortunately,

220
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,220
he's not one of us.

221
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,180
What do we do next?

222
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,060
I am Xiahou Mengding.

223
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,500
I'd like to join your team.

224
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,700
I am Zhao Yujia.

225
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,900
I'd like to join your team too.

226
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,020
I know you.

227
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,380
You are the one
who did the Face-Changing.

228
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,660
I can tame animals.

229
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,740
I am famous in Tianqi City.

230
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,700
I can tame animals too.

231
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,660
My skill is unrivaled.

232
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,620
Are you

233
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,980
doing this on purpose?

234
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,180
I'm just telling the truth.

235
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,540
Let's have a competition, then.

236
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,860
Taiyi Lion Secret Arts.

237
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,980
He's from Mount Wangcheng.

238
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,860
It's my first time
seeing that technique.

239
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,260
It seems like there are lots of talents

240
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,580
hide among these candidates.

241
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,860
Even an expert of the Xuan Sect

242
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,460
is here to attend the examination.

243
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,700
It seems like the Academy

244
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,660
is famous now.

245
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,060
So?

246
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,980
Do you still want to compete with me?

247
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,940
No.

248
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,260
Farewell.

249
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,660
Uhm, I can...

250
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,860
Facing-Changing is not
the only thing I know.

251
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,660
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

252
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,100
So it's you.

253
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,940
Zhao Yujia.

254
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,900
I'll leave if you're not picking me.

255
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,540
Stay.

256
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,900
I think

257
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,420
you're decently strong.

258
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,460
You must be one of us.

259
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,460
So we have

260
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,700
a team now.

261
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,420
Wait.

262
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,100
Miss, while you're pretty,

263
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,220
I'm not so sure
if I want to recruit you.

264
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,780
What's in your mind, Mr. Ye?

265
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,380
It's an important examination.

266
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,180
We must be cautious.

267
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,300
Baili,

268
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,780
test her out.

269
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,700
Me?

270
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,420
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

271
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,380
Your qinggong is exceptional.

272
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,380
You are faster than you were that day.

273
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,860
It's not the ordinary
Three Flying Swallow Moves.

274
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,140
I invented this myself.

275
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,780
It's called Drunken Slide.

276
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,460
A sword in her sleeves?

277
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,060
How ingenious.

278
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,020
The Instant Kill Sword Arts

279
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,660
sure is lethal.

280
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,700
I don't mean to kill.

281
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,740
It was just

282
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,260
to test you.

283
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,740
You had a dream?

284
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,900
I dreamed of Dongjun.

285
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,140
What did you dream of?

286
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,220
I dreamed

287
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,460
that he mastered
the Instant Kill Sword Arts,

288
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,580
and even improved upon

289
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,620
the Three Flying Swallow Moves

290
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,500
into his own moves.

291
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,940
That does

292
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,340
sound like a dream.

293
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,620
Mr. Baili,

294
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,780
have I impressed you

295
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,980
with my sleeve swordplay?

296
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,900
Like I said,

297
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,860
I was just testing you.

298
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,020
You'll have to ask him
if you pass the test or not.

299
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,060
Miss,

300
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,940
the final examination
will be a dangerous one.

301
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,660
Naturally, I want

302
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,700
strong teammates.

303
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,660
Don't take it to heart.

304
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,820
From now on,

305
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,300
we are a team.

306
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,780
The four of them actually formed a team.

307
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,060
The strong band with one another.

308
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,820
They are more likely to win now.

309
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,460
You think so?

310
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,180
I think this is even worse.

311
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,900
Master will only recruit one disciple.

312
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,420
If that team wins,

313
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,780
who do you think Master will pick?
Ye Dingzhi

314
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,300
or Baili Dongjun?

315
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,900
Master only recruits
the most interesting candidate,

316
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,740
not the strongest.

317
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,460
You

318
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,140
are an exception.

319
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,980
You're boring.

320
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,060
You're so extremely boring

321
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,820
that it becomes somehow interesting.

322
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,860
That's why Master took you in.

323
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,380
Do you think

324
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,380
you're a very interesting person?

325
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,380
I do.

326
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,700
I think Ye Dingzhi

327
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,020
is more interesting than you.

328
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,540
Quit it.

329
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,620
Time's up.

330
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,300
Have you found your teammates?

331
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,540
Well,

332
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,420
where is

333
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,340
the next arena?

334
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,580
Master.

335
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,460
Master.

336
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,420
Your next arena

337
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,540
is

338
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,260
the entire Tianqi City.

339
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,420
The entire city?

340
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,180
When does it start?

341
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,580
Now.

342
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,260
Mr. Baili here is very eager

343
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,980
to drink Qiulubai which comes out
once per month

344
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,820
after the examination.

345
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,340
How do you know?

346
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,340
I went

347
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,100
to Diaolou Tavern just now

348
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,300
and got the last pot of Qiulubai
of this month.

349
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,780
Oh, no.

350
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,460
You might not be able to enjoy it.

351
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,780
You old man,

352
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,460
I might just snatch it off your hands.

353
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,100
Mind your manner.

354
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,300
It's fine.

355
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,260
The young are bold.

356
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,860
Isn't it great?

357
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,700
All right.

358
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,700
I'll wait for your return.

359
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,340
He won't

360
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,660
let us catch a break at all.

361
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,700
As the saying goes,

362
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,540
the silk is white like snow,

363
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,620
braided it into two carps.

364
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,860
To know one's real thoughts,

365
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,140
retrieve the notes
inside the carp's tummy.

366
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,100
I...

367
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,180
In a word,
the hints are inside the fish's tummy.

368
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,340
They contain

369
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,780
the hours of Wei, Shen, You, and Xu.

370
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,460
In a moment,

371
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,980
send a representative here

372
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,820
and draw lots.

373
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,060
You will depart
on the hour that you draw.

374
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,980
Before you leave,

375
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,460
Mr. Mochen will give you

376
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,700
a pouch.

377
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,620
Oh right.

378
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,500
If one team

379
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,820
finds the final answer,

380
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,140
the golden bell on this stage

381
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,100
will toll.

382
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,980
When that happens,

383
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,460
please gather

384
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,620
in the Academy.

385
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,460
Understood?

386
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,620
Well, let's do this then.

387
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,660
Why do we depart

388
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,300
at different times?

389
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,300
Because each team

390
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,860
will be given only one pouch.

391
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,660
The hint is inside the pouch.

392
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,980
So there are four hints in total.

393
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,020
The ones who leave first

394
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,500
can act first.

395
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,380
They can either hide

396
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,460
or solve the riddle as soon as possible.

397
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,700
The ones who leave later

398
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,620
can pay attention

399
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,780
to where the ones leaving first go.

400
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,780
They can either find them

401
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,060
or wait for them.

402
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,420
If we all leave together,

403
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,380
then there's no need
to have this competition.

404
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,980
We might as well fight here.

405
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,140
The winners

406
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,580
will walk away with all the pouches

407
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,300
and find the answer.

408
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
How smart of you.

409
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,460
You sure know

410
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,180
our rules very well.

411
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,700
Enough talking.

412
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,220
Send someone up.

413
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,980
King of Gambling.

414
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,260
That will be me.

415
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,700
The ones who get the hour of Wei

416
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,260
will leave first.

417
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,420
The ones who get the hour of Xu

418
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,660
will leave after six hours.

419
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,260
The answer might have already

420
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,700
been found in six hours.

421
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,340
So the competition starts now.

422
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,780
The hour of Shen.

423
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,300
Not bad.

424
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,380
The first ones to leave

425
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,820
will be targeted.

426
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,620
Leaving at the hour of Shen
might be a better choice.

427
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,620
You live up to the name
of King of Gambling.

428
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,340
Good job.

429
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,580
You do know how to butter someone up.

430
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,700
You must be single.

431
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,980
Shut up.

432
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,980
Which team do you think
will depart first?

433
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,540
Well...

434
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,300
There.

435
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,540
The hour of Wei.

436
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,660
The hour of You.

437
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,100
The hour of Xu.

438
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,500
The first team may leave now.

439
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,460
What a formidable foe.

440
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,220
This is worrisome.

441
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,340
Why are you worried?

442
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,660
You're not sitting for the examination.

443
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,140
The winner

444
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,420
will be our junior.

445
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,740
I don't want

446
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,140
someone like him

447
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,180
to be our peers.

448
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,020
You have put up with me

449
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,500
so far.

450
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,780
I am your senior.

451
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,780
Fine, you're my senior.

452
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,700
I am.

453
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,820
Self-appointed senior.

454
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,340
Per your request, I have delivered

455
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,660
the message to Ye Dingzhi.

456
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,500
To join my wing,

457
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,700
one must pay a price.

458
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,300
Only by being responsible

459
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,540
for the death of Baili Dongjun,

460
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,340
will Ye Dingzhi be willing

461
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,660
to serve me loyally.

462
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,300
[Prince Jingyu's Mansion]

463
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,820
Ruofeng,

464
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,380
[Xiao Ruojin, Prince Jingyu of Beili]
who do you think will be your junior

465
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,620
in the examination?

466
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,740
Since when are you concerned

467
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,660
with the Academy's affairs, Ruojin?

468
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,780
Many in the imperial court

469
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,420
have vested interest

470
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,460
in the Academy.

471
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,060
I know

472
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,580
you are on the Academy's side,

473
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,060
so I never ask you about it.

474
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
However,

475
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,540
among the candidates,

476
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,700
someone

477
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,420
will work for Prince Qing.

478
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,460
Whoever that person is,

479
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,980
once recruited into the Academy,

480
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,060
they will be a member of the Academy.

481
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,900
Ruojin, you lost.

482
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,580
When it comes to weiqi,

483
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,340
I can never win you.

484
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,500
How is Wenjun?

485
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,260
I have taken her into my residence.

486
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,780
We're waiting for the day
Father mandates our marriage

487
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,340
to get betrothed.

488
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,540
[Yi Wenjun, Daughter of the Leader
of the Shadow Sect]

489
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,380
[Luo Qingyang,
Head Disciple of the Shadow Sect]

490
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,860
Qingyang,

491
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,540
it's crowded today.

492
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,740
Today is the final examination

493
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,580
of the Academy.

494
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,340
Is that so?

495
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,220
Yes.

496
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,940
They can live freely.

497
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,300
I envy them.

498
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,300
If I

499
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,660
could live like them,

500
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,820
would I also be free

501
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
and happy?

502
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,220
Wenjun.

503
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,460
It's so quiet on the street.

504
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,820
I don't see anyone here.

505
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,980
It's the final examination,

506
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,340
so they cleared everyone out.

507
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,540
Anyway,

508
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,460
the pouch says,

509
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,900
"You do not witness
the existence of Black Tortoise."

510
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,540
Black Tortoise...

511
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,780
What is Black Tortoise?

512
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,580
It wouldn't be the final examination

513
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,900
if it was an easy riddle.

514
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,580
Xuanwu...

515
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,500
Maybe Black Tortoise Parlor?

516
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,220
Black Tortoise Parlor?

517
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,220
Yes.

518
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,260
It's one of the most famous

519
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,380
sword armories in Tianqi City.

520
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,740
It's under the Academy.

521
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,420
There are sword armories in Tianqi City?

522
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,460
That's incredible.

523
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,940
How come I've never heard of it?

524
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,820
Sir,

525
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,140
you must have been living under a rock.

526
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,580
My family has strict rules.

527
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,940
Very strict.

528
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,300
Let's go.

529
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,420
Everyone has left.

530
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,580
If we don't go now, we'll be too late.

531
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,260
[Kill Baili Dongjun]

532
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,460
[Xuan, Baixiao Hall]
The four of them actually formed a team.

533
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,540
How quaint

534
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,380
and interesting.

535
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,300
More importantly, they have

536
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,020
intriguing backgrounds.

537
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,100
Any updates?

538
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,420
Yin Luoxia,

539
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,540
the daughter of the previous
King of Gambling, Yin Shunshui.

540
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,380
She is the current King of Gambling.

541
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,620
Her mother

542
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,220
is the only daughter
of Marquis of Luoyang.

543
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,140
Being unable to live

544
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,540
with the wandering gambler Yin Shunshui,

545
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,580
she left him.

546
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,700
Yin Luoxia

547
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,300
has been living with her father.

548
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,220
Half of her martial prowess

549
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,700
comes from her father.

550
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,780
The other half

551
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,420
comes from his father's
three other friends.

552
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,100
Together, they are the Four Vices

553
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,700
in the martial arts world,

554
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,540
Glutton, Drunkard,
Philanderer, and Gambler.

555
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,860
Yin Luoxia has no notoriety.

556
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,300
She hardly leaves her father

557
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,300
after they have lived in seclusion.

558
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,660
Furthermore,
she has never contacted anyone

559
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,420
from Tianqi City.

560
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,500
She's the real Yin Luoxia?

561
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,940
She was still a child

562
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,940
when she last appeared publicly.

563
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,860
But according to the information
gathered,

564
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,100
she is quite likely Yin Luoxia.

565
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,700
What about the rest?

566
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,100
Ye Dingzhi,

567
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,180
a nobody in the martial arts world.

568
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,020
In one specific record,

569
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,220
he was first spotted

570
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,100
in Nanjue.

571
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,580
He has been wandering ever since.

572
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,500
However, he should be a Beili citizen.

573
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,340
In fact, he is likely the youngest son

574
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,380
of General Ye Yu,

575
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,660
whose family was sanctioned
to death because of treason.

576
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,540
He survived by being swapped out.

577
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,740
When he was spotted in Nanjue,

578
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,300
he was following around someone else.

579
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,980
That person is his master.

580
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,060
Who is his master?

581
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,740
The strongest individual in Nanjue,

582
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,420
Rain Demon, the Sword Deity.

583
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,180
The disciple
of Nanjue's strongest individual

584
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,140
wants to be Mr. Li's disciple?

585
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,340
Looks like he aspires

586
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,740
to be
the strongest individual in the world.

587
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,060
From what did you infer his relationship

588
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,260
with Ye Yu?

589
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,860
Just his surname

590
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,180
and the timing of his appearance alone

591
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,900
are not convincing enough.

592
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,740
The case of General Ye Yu's treason

593
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,860
was an unjust case.

594
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,540
The one who sabotaged him

595
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,860
was Prince Qing,
who only obtained his title that year.

596
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,900
Ye Dingzhi and Prince Qing

597
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,220
were seen talking briefly.

598
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,460
Therefore, he must be Ye Dingzhi.

599
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,260
However, this is yet to be confirmed.

600
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,460
What about Zhao Yujia?

601
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,700
Nothing on him.

602
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,780
Nothing?

603
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,180
In that case,

604
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,460
there are only two explanations.

605
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,060
He either appears out of nowhere

606
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,900
or...

607
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,220
He's using a pseudonym.

608
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,740
Zhao Yujia

609
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,420
is an expert in mystic arts.

610
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,740
While we failed to identify him,

611
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,740
we found

612
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,900
the best mystic artist,

613
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,140
also the Chief of Mount Wangcheng,

614
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,540
Lyu Suzhen. His youngest disciple

615
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,220
is Zhao Yuzhen.

616
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,220
It was alleged that he was

617
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,460
a rare prodigy in Mount Wangcheng.

618
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,220
He has never left it

619
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,700
after he entered the mountain.

620
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,260
So you're saying that Zhao Yujia

621
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,860
might be Zhao Yuzhen?

622
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,940
How interesting.

623
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,300
Zhao Yujia is also recommended

624
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,380
by someone.

625
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,100
You're bringing it up now,

626
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,940
which means

627
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,580
the one recommending him
must be someone very important.

628
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,660
Like Xiao Ruofeng?

629
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,220
Zhao Yujia is recommended

630
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,540
by Mr. Li himself.

631
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,060
Oh?

632
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,140
This is intriguing.

633
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,660
And Zhuge Yun?

634
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,980
The settlement of the Zhuge Family

635
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,100
is still unknown.

636
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,500
However, evidence seems to suggest

637
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,300
that the Zhuge Family
has been wiped out.

638
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,700
But perhaps

639
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,140
some of them

640
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,060
survived.

641
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,180
We wanted to ask

642
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,980
the Elder of the Academy

643
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,100
who has recommended Zhuge Yun.

644
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,140
However...

645
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,100
What's it?

646
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,380
He is dead.

647
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,260
Dead?

648
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:07,940
Yes,

649
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,980
killed by Zhuge Yun.

650
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,700
He was killed

651
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,260
on the way to the region
that is out of the North.

652
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,300
But the Academy

653
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,420
hasn't received the news yet,

654
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,780
so they are not aware of the situation.

655
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:15,820
And I was only

656
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,460
informed of this moments ago.

657
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,300
Relay this to Xiao Ruofeng.

658
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,180
Noted.

659
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,820
The region...

660
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,060
that is out of the North.

661
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,660
Zhuge...

662
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,540
Right.

663
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,500
Anything else you want to add?

664
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,620
This information is very important.

665
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,900
I'll need extra money for it.

666
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,060
Lord Wuzuo.

667
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,460
They are tricky foes.

668
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,820
I'm here.

669
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,300
What are you afraid of?

670
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,460
Then the other Lord...

671
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,020
I have arranged accordingly.

672
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,940
Wucheng.

673
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,020
[Zhuge Wucai, Zhuge Wucheng,
Twin Lords Wuzuo, Sky's Beyond]

674
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,180
Please deal

675
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,300
with those pesky candidates now.

676
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,300
Qixuan.

677
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,660
You'll come with me
to find Young Lady and the others.

678
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,260
Zhuge Yun.

679
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,220
We're teammates.

680
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,660
We should help each other!

681
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,380
Why?

682
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,540
Who... Who exactly are you?

683
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,300
Isn't the Zhuge Family

684
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,180
known for its chivalry?

685
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,180
How...

686
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,980
How come you're this cruel?

687
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,180
[Black Tortoise Parlor]

688
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,820
Is there

689
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,460
anything what we're looking for
in there?

690
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,900
Let's check it out.

691
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,740
This is suspicious.

692
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,900
Please exercise caution.

693
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,460
Don't stray too far from me.

694
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,860
Be careful.

695
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,780
Be vigilant.

696
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,140
Hold on.

697
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,780
It's the coiled thread
from Honglu Temple.

698
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,740
Coiled thread is made from thin iron.

699
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,060
It's so thin
that eyes cannot discern it.

700
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,100
There aren't many weapons

701
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,500
as discreet and sharp as this one here.

702
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,380
Why are you standing there?

703
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,380
It's not as sharp as you said.

704
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,260
You're using a Celestial Level Sword.

705
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,140
And this

706
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,180
is the most common coiled thread.

707
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,740
Is there any other type
of coiled thread?

708
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,100
You'll have to ask

709
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,260
Mr. Xia from Honglu Temple.

710
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,340
Let's go.

711
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,420
So this is the Sword Tower.

712
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,780
How splendid.

713
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,100
That is
a real Celestial Level Sword, right?

714
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,900
I'm afraid only a deity can wield it.

715
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,420
Are the swords not worth

716
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,340
anything at all?

717
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,740
No one guards them.

718
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,980
Are they not afraid these swords
might be stolen?

719
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,820
They might pay with their lives.

720
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,900
We're already here.

721
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,660
What do we do next?

722
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,420
Our hint is just a line of a poem.

723
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,100
What are you staring at?

724
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,580
The jade on the sword hilt

725
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,260
looks like an eye.

726
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,860
Did you see that?

727
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,180
Or am I hallucinating?

728
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:03,860
You're right.

729
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,780
I saw that too.

730
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,700
The jade on the hilt

731
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,460
just blinked like a normal eye.

732
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,220
Why don't I slice it

733
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,380
to see what's inside?

734
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,540
Kiddo.

735
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,180
That sword is worth a fortune.

736
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,100
If you destroy it,

737
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,420
you have to pay for it

738
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,420
even if you become

739
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
the disciple of the Academy.

740
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,060
Who's there?

741
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,460
I am Xinyang,

742
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,580
the sword of a Sword Deity.

743
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,860
I am the sword of Fufeng Fairy.

744
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,900
I am Mingyue.

745
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,900
I am Qixiao.

746
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,380
I am the master of the Sword Tower.

747
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,740
All swords return to me.
I'll command all swords!

748
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,060
All swords return to me.
I'll command all swords!

749
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,780
Just a trick of the eye.

750
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,100
Show yourself!

751
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,260
You have not seen the thousand swords
of Xuanwu.

752
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,300
How can you challenge all the demons?

753
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,060
It's that poem.

754
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,260
We're at the right place.

755
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,380
No,

756
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,460
you're at the wrong place.

757
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,020
Two pupils?

758
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,340
It's said that the servant
of the Yellow Emperor,

759
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,620
Cangjie, has four eyes.

760
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,060
So someone

761
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
with four eyes exists in this world.

762
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,220
A mortal with four eyes
is half a step away from godhood.

763
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,340
A sage with four eyes
can rule the Heaven.

764
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,300
Who are you?

765
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,580
I am your judgment.

766
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,700
You're

767
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,740
here.

768
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,900
If you want the final answer,

769
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,500
you'll have to go through me.

770
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,780
You work for the Academy?

771
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,100
Like I said,

772
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,980
all swords return to me

773
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,700
and I'll command all swords!

774
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,380
What gibberish.

775
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,100
Careful.

776
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,500
Our enemy lurks in the dark

777
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,140
while we're in the open.

778
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,300
It's pitch-black in the hall.

779
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,740
We can't see him

780
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,220
and he can't see us.

781
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,380
Those with two pupils

782
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,900
see light with one

783
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,740
and see darkness with another.

784
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,860
He has full vision

785
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,660
at the moment.

786
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,380
And we are the blind ones here.

787
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,700
I've practiced locating someone
with sounds for years,

788
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,460
but I can't

789
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,540
locate him at all.

790
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,260
That's right.

791
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,860
He seems to be everywhere.

792
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,740
We have no time.

793
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,500
If this place

794
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,780
has nothing to do with the final answer,

795
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,780
let's not stay here.

796
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,620
Let's leave.

797
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,580
Oh, no.

798
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,900
We can't get out of here.

799
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,660
I have an idea.

800
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,580
That costs a fortune, you said?

801
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,500
Then I'll

802
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,380
shatter it.

803
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,540
Insolence!

804
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,260
Run!

805
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,170
[No animals were harmed
during the filming of this drama.]

806
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,580
