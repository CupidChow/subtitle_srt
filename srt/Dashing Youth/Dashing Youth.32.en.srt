Let's do it here.

25
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,500
Are you sure?

26
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,220
You are under my phase.

27
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,460
I can kill you within six palms attack.

28
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,660
Really?

29
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,700
If so, I will kill you
with a phase higher.

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,220
How cocky.

31
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,460
Lend me your sword.

32
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,660
I was touched by an immortal

33
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,420

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,260

59
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,340
keep talking

60
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,260
about phases?

61
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,660

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,260

63
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,100
If yours is higher,

64
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,940
I should surrender

65
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,780

You entered the palace at six,

75
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
with discontentment.

76
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,220

practicing
to become the greatest martial artist.

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,780

I will.

93
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,060
Very well.

94
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,820
I'm not going to kill you,

95
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,380
but you are

96
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,420
in the Halfway Immortal Mystery Phase,

97
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,660
which is too high.

98
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,700
Why don't you lower a phase?

99
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,460
Master.

100
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,340
Remember to remind your master

101
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,940
to read that letter carefully.

102
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,660
It's very important.

103
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,100
Understood.

104
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,420
Master, let's leave.

105
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,660
Are you letting them go like that?

106
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,180
These two

107
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,900
might be a threat to reckon with.

108
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,940
Aren't you a scholar?

109
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,460
Scholars should be merciful.

110
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,980
How can you simply kill?

111
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,260
That's what monks do.

112
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,260

113
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,620

115
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,420
Don't kill.

116
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,620
If you want to kill,

117
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,980
do it by yourself

118
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,500
after I leave.

119
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,100
Little Master,

120
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,900
that's all I can do for you.

121
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,580
I'm leaving.

122
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,740
There were two of them,

123
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,500
but they made a formidable pair.

124
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,660
How does that fool

125
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,300
manage to hire

126
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,820

128
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,500

129
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:59,550
[No need to thank me.
By a righteous lackey killer.]

130
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,540
Mister, you are a young talent

131
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,100
with advanced martial skills.

132
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,940
And I'm impressed by that.

133
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,660
But that's enough for today.

134
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,780
Jinxian.

135
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,140
Want to leave?

136
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,100
Have you asked me about that?

137
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,980
I might still have some strength left

138
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,900
to fight desperately.

139
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,940
You can't be sure of that.

140
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,820
Even if you are strong,

141
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,740
I'm afraid you might not stand a chance

142
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,700
if we join hands.

143
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,060
Rather than having both sides suffer,

144
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,620
why don't we each take a step back?

145
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,140
Next time we meet,

146
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,940
will it still be with drawn swords?

147
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,220
I hope not.

148
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,420
Who's there?

149
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,460
Who are you?

150
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,860
I'm Nangong Chunshui.

151
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,460
I came here to see the successor
to the Heart Sword

152
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,700
and her daughter.

153
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,980
Why do you want to see my daughter?

154
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,740
To be frank,

155
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,380
your daughter and I

156
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,460

157
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,180
She's now my disciple.

158
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,100
Nonsense!

159
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,340

168
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,660
Call me Master.

Uh...

170
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,300
I have disappointed you, Master.

171
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,020
I lost.

172
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,780
I will accept my punishment.

173
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,300
Please punish me, Master.

174
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,500
I will accept my punishment, too.

175
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,580
There is no need for that.

176
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,220
That Bali Dongjun,

177
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,860
leave him alone from now on.

178
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,220
I will explain it

179
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,980
to His Majesty myself.

180
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,460
Go back and cure your injuries.

This time...

182
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,900
I have miscalculated.

183
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,940

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,660
I am

378
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,220
the Second Senior in Jixia Academy,

379
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,980
Mr. Li's direct disciple,

380
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,940
Mr. Zhuomo,

381
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,580
Lei

382
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,180
Meng

383
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,660
sha.

384
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,500
Mr. Li's direct disciple, huh?

385
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,020
Jeez, you and your whining.

386
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,300
Prince Langya is nothing.

387
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,740
Beat him up if you are not convinced.

388
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,940
Why are you complaining here?

389
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,740
Wait.

390
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,100
You are Master, right?

391
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:00,820
Gosh.

392
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,300
Why are you wearing a mask

393
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,220
to freak me out?

394
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,260
Master,

395
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,940
my daughter is over there.

396
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,740
Please do me a favor.

397
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:15,980
Get lost.

398
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,980
Listen up.

399
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,060
If you want to stay here,

400
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,180
you had better make a name

401
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,020
in Beili

402
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,020
and Tianqi City.

403
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,660
Thinking of going back to Lei Fortress?

404
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,340
If Lei dares take you in,

405
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,900
I will crack his head open.

406
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,500
All right, Master.

407
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,740
Get lost, then.

408
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,740
All right.

409
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,820
Father.

410
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,180
Hanyi, let's go home.

411
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,020
Hanyi is my second disciple now.

412
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,060
She will be with me from now on.

413
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,940
My goodness.

414
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,340
In just the blink of an eye,

415
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,060
you are in the same generation as me.

416
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,180
Hanyi,

417
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,060
you must take care of yourself

418
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,100
out there.

419
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,460
Do learn martial arts skills

420
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,460
from your master.

421
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,500
Don't slack off.

422
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,740
Work hard, all right?

423
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,020
You must stay away

424
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,100
from good-looking boys.

425
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,980
Do not

426
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,780
hold boys' hands.

427
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,060
Promise me.

428
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,260
All right, all right.

429
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,900
Mother is waiting for you at home.

430
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,500
I'm in a hurry now.

431
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,420
All right.

432
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,780
I'm leaving.

433
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,540
Second Senior.

434
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,940
Take care.

435
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,060
Take care, my foot.

436
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,100
Don't always say scary words.

437
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,060
You sound like

438
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
we won't meet again.

439
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,180
Hanyi,

440
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,580
do not hold boys' hands.

441
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,060
Just go already.

442
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,300
I'm leaving.

443
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,420
Come here.

444
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,100
By the way, Master,

445
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,340
where is Ruofeng?

446
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,260
I haven't had a chance

447
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,260
to bid him goodbye.

448
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,260
Well,

449
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,220
he's not in Tianqi City at the moment.

450
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,300
A few days ago,

451
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,660
I sent him off somewhere.

452
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,420
I see.

453
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,660
Fine,

454
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,100
I will meet him

455
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,020
when he comes back.

456
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,260
Come back?

457
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
No, he's not coming back.

458
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,340
Let's say goodbye here.

459
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,660
What was that supposed to mean?

460
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,860
It's time to leave.

461
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,380
Madam Luo.

462
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,340
Madam Luo.

463
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,420
All right.

464
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,220
I'm going on a long journey.

465
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,940
I will take Hanyi with me.

466
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,580
Once she completes her cultivation,

467
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,780
she will return to Xueyue City.

468
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,980
As for us,

469
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,060
I'm afraid

470
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,100
we won't meet again in this lifetime.

471
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,220
Master.

472
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,140
I used to think

473
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,850
that life

474
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,540
doesn't need to be sentimental.

475
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,580
Whether or not we have a last farewell

476
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,660
wouldn't make any difference.

477
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,940
But since I have come here

478
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,660
for the matter
of the Marquis of Zhen's Mansion,

479
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,460
we might as well meet up.

480
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,140
I have nothing

481
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,940
to leave for you all

482
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,020
but four words.

483
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:43,980
Lend me your sword.

484
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,420
It's almost 200 years.

485
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,540
Xiao Yi,

486
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,060
I still remember the four words

487
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,620
Li Xuan left us.

488
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,620
Now, I will give them

489
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,460
to my disciples.

490
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,620
Finally, you have come this far

491
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,700
and conquered the country.

492
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,180
Now, I rather think

493
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,540
that's not much fun.

494
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,860
[Pingqing Hall]
Go back, then.

495
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,860
Go back to the martial arts world
with me.

496
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,420
Li Xuan

497
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,500
left us with four words.

498
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,620
Do you remember them?

499
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,060
Of course I do.

500
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,020
Instead,

501
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,700
I always think

502
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,900
you have already forgotten them.

503
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,780
No, I haven't.

504
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,420
But I only hope

505
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,020
that the moment

506
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,540
after I breach the city gate
with my sword,

507
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,500
all the youth

508
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,060
will hold these four words
in their hearts.

509
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,500
Now, sword and blade techniques

510
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,540
are no longer his concern.

511
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,300
[Act From Your Heart]
A casual wave of his hand

512
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,940
makes a peerless strike.

513
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,300
Well, let's set off.

514
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,140
Master,

515
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,340
I will not forget that.

516
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,340
Young man, nice skills.

517
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,940
What's your name?

518
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
Sikong Changfeng.

519
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,220
You want to defeat me

520
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,580
to make a name for yourself?

521
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,180
That's my plan.

522
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,700
I'm not prepared to yield just yet.

523
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,460
If you defeat the King of Spear,

524
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,620
you will become the next King of Spear.

525
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,260
There are many Kings of Spear.

526
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,860
But you

527
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,940
have the potential
to become a Spear Deity.

528
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,140
Sikong Changfeng,

529
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,180
Mr. Li sent me here

530
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,420
with a question.

531
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,940
Will you

532
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,020
go to Tianqi with me?

533
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,620
A proper visit to Tianqi.

534
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,660
Master.

535
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,500
Since I'm back,

536
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,620
leave the matter
of the Marquis of Zhexi's Mansion to me.

537
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,220
I'm also aware
that you are preparing to establish

538
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,260
the Internal Guard Office of Tianqi,

539
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,780
and you need four experts.

540
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,100
I just took a disciple in.

541
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,660
Perhaps he could be of help.

542
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,500
Master,

543
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,500
isn't your last disciple

544
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,700
Dongjun?

545
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,740
Not him.

546
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,180
It's a young Spear Deity.

547
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,100
When Dongjun assisted you
in breaking through to a new phase

548
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,340
with Seven Starry Nights,
you met him.

549
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,620
My dear disciple,

550
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,340
this may be the last time

551
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,420
I can help you.

552
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,060
Go to him

553
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,140
and tell him I sent you.

554
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,180
If so, I shall come with you.

555
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:50,980
Wenjun!

556
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,060
Wenjun, I'm back.

557
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,300
Yun.

558
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,940
Yun, mealtime!

559
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,860
They smell wonderful.

560
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,620
How did the trip to Tianqi go?

561
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,340
Good. Don't worry.

562
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,020
By the way,

563
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,500
did you manage to meet Dongjun?

564
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,940
Speaking of which,
I haven't seen him

565
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,100
over the past decade.

566
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,460
I'm a wanted criminal now.

567
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,020
Given the sensitive situation,

568
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,020
I didn't want to land him in trouble,

569
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,900
so I didn't meet him.

570
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,340
Once everything is over,

571
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,220
I will write to him

572
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,420
and invite him over.

573
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,780
All right.

574
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:20,620
Come.

575
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,660
Here, try this.

576
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,540
Delicious.

577
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:29,980
Have some more.

578
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,100
I'm Wang Rensun of Heavenly Mountain Sect.

579
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,700
I came to request an audience

580
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,860
with Elder Wangyou.

581
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,380
I'm Wang Rensun of Heaven Mountain Sect.

582
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,980
I came to request an audience

583
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,220
with Elder Wangyou.

584
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,460
I'm Wang Rensun of Heaven Mountain Sect.

585
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,100
I came to request an audience

586
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,180
with Elder Wangyou.

587
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,020
I'm Wang Rensun of Heaven Mountain Sect.

588
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,700
I came to request an audience

589
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,940
with Elder Wangyou.

590
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,860
Mr. Wang of Heaven Mountain Sect,

591
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,540
what brings you to Elder Wangyou?

592
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,060
Here's the thing.

593
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,780
I couldn't overcome the bottleneck

594
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,780
in my cultivation.

595
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,860
I was told

596
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,700
Elder Wangyou practiced
the Six Arcane Arts

597
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,540
and is in a profound phase.

598
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,900
So I would like to ask him

599
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,820
for guidance.

600
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,380
You were shouting just now.

601
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,540
People might mistake you

602
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,540
for stirring up trouble here.

603
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,100
No, don't take me wrong.

604
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,580
I meant no disrespect at all.

605
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,380
Wait.

606
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,620
Could this be why

607
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,580
Elder Wangyou's unwilling

608
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,660
to meet me?

609
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,620
Elder Wangyou isn't ignoring you.

610
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,300
He's probably out

611
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,620
traveling with other hermits,

612
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,980
so he's not in right now.

613
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:43,940
Uh...

614
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,780
What should I do?

615
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:48,740
Don't worry.

616
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,340
He didn't travel far.

617
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,780
Normally, he will return in a few days.

618
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,970
Wang, if you don't mind,

619
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,620
come in for a drink and rest.

620
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,220
Of course I don't.

621
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,180
I hope

622
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,100
you won't find me a disturbance.

623
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,780
May I ask for your name?

624
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,020
Ye Dingzhi.

625
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,300
Wang Rensun of Heaven Mountain Sect.

626
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:10,900
Please.

627
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:11,940
Please.

628
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,820
In the 18th year of Taihe's era,

629
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,020
Emperor Tai'an of Beili
fell gravely ill.

630
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,780
The struggle vying for the throne
escalated.

631
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,980
Many court officials were assassinated
by their enemies

632
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,180
due to the political strife.

633
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,380
Tianqi City was besieged by bloodshed,

634
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,540
and everyone was on edge.

635
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,020
This period came to be known
as the Six Princes’ Struggle for Power.

636
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,180
To fend off

637
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,180
these mysterious assassins,

638
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,100
[Xiao Ruofeng]
Xiao Ruofeng, Prince Langya;

639
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,370
[Lin Xinyue]
Li Xinyue, the successor

640
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,140
of the Heart-Thrusting Sword;

641
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,940
[Ji Ruofeng]
Ri Ruofeng, Wuji Pole;

642
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,460
[Tang Lianyue]
Tang Lianyue of the Tang Clan;

643
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,660
[Sikong Changfeng]
and Sikong Changfeng of Xueyue City

644
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,020
established
the Internal Guard Office of Tianqi.

645
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,300
They joined forces

646
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,220
to restore peace

647
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,060
to Tianqi City

648
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,820
after a brief period of turmoil.

649
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,300
These four people were then known

650
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,420
as the Four Guardians of Tianqi.

651
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,300
Just as the chaos began to subside,

652
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,500
Emperor Tai'an suddenly fell gravely ill
and was sinking fast.

653
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,020
[Qing]

654
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,140
The six princes

655
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,580
under the lead of Prince Qing

656
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,020
conspired and initiated a coup.

657
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,980
[Pingqing Hall]
They fought their way to Pingqing Hall

658
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,540
and demanded the throne
from Emperor Tai'an.

659
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,820
Xiao Ruofeng led
the Four Guardians of Tianqi

660
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,500
and Tiger Army to quell the coup

661
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,940
and arrest Prince Qing alive.

662
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,100
This way.

663
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,500
Be careful.

664
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,500
All right.

665
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:52,090
[Pingqing Hall]

666
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,060
Prince Langya.

667
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:58,900
How is it?

668
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,620
The remnants have been arrested

669
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,260
and sent
for interrogation.

670
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,100
Some of the princes involved
in the rebellion

671
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,340
have been executed,

672
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,580
while the survivors

673
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,460
are under guard.

674
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,220
What else

675
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,860
do you want to say?

676
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,420
The winner dominates,
while the loser collapses.

677
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,660
It should be this way.

678
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,940
I have nothing more to say.

679
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,540
Take him away.

680
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,140
Yes, Your Highness.

681
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,460
Yingxian!

682
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,500
Protect His Highness!

683
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,100
Do it.

684
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,620
Your Highness,
let's meet in our next lives.

685
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,180
Give him a proper burial.

686
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,020
An imperial edict has arrived!

687
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,580
By the Mandate of Heaven
and the Emperor decrees...

688
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,790
[The throne shall be given
to the Ninth Prince, Xiao Ruofeng]

689
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,340
The throne shall be given

690
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,380
to the Third Prince,

691
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,580
Xiao Ruojin.

692
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,540
Sir,

693
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,540
why didn't Master

694
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,580
ascend to the throne?

695
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,460
Because

696
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,940
he never wanted that.

697
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,940
The one who wants
to ascend to the throne

698
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,100
is never him.

699
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,020
Your Highness,

700
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,340
why not be a dragon
if you can reach the sky?

701
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,100
You know we will assist you.

702
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,060
Xiaoying,

703
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,540
did you know?

704
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,860
When I was little,

705
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,180
my mother was out of favor.

706
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,980
My mother, my brother, and I

707
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,140
had a tough time.

708
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,140
I remember one winter

709
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,180
when there was a heavy snowfall.

710
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,220
Even when I think of it now,

711
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,180
I still feel

712
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,260
the biting cold.

713
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,020
I was little

714
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,940
and weak back then,

715
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,820
and I couldn't endure
such a harsh winter.

716
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,380
Just as I was dying,

717
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,900
my mother's maidservant

718
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,140
called for an imperial physician

719
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,820
with her life.

720
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,420
When the imperial physician
saw my condition,

721
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,740
he knew that my family was not favored.

722
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,220
So he refused to treat me.

723
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,340
I remember

724
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,980
that my brother

725
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,020
was kneeling in the snow

726
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,340
and kowtowing to the imperial physician,

727
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,700
begging him to save me.

728
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,580
Afterward, the snow stopped.

729
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,740
I was saved,

730
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,540
but my brother changed.

731
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,590
If

732
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,580
he was

733
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,140
a gentle and humble prince,

734
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,540
from then on,

735
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,380
he has become

736
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,540
a monarch holding a sharp blade.

737
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,380
It isn't my wish to become a prince.

738
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,540
If I could,

739
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,500
I would

740
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,940
also want to be
like my seniors and juniors

741
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,420
who roam freely

742
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,900
as a martial artist.

743
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,660
But my brother is different.

744
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,940
He has learned

745
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,460
how to become a monarch since little.

746
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,900
He has ambition,

747
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,140
and is not

748
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,820
as sentimental as I am.

749
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,500
In the future,

750
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,460
he will

751
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,740
be a good emperor.

752
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,100
The new year has arrived.

753
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:14,540
I wonder
how it will differ from the old.

754
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,980
In the late winter
of the 18th year of Taihe's era,

755
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,580
Emperor Tai'an passed away.

756
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,580
The throne was passed
to the Third Prince, Xiao Ruojin.

757
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,820
In the following spring,

758
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,540
the new Emperor changed the era's name
to Minghe

759
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,060
and conferred the title of Consort Xuan

760
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,540
on the secondary consort,
Yi Wenjun.

761
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,500
Is the conferment of Consort Xuan

762
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,100
meant to hide the secret?

763
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,620
Do you think

764
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,660
that if people found out

765
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,660
my beloved consort
wasn't in the palace,

766
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,620
would I

767
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,340
become the laughingstock of the world?

768
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,740
It seems Ruojin hasn't given up

769
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,140
on finding her over these years.

770
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,460
Consort Xuan

771
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,500
has been away from the palace

772
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,020
for way too long.

773
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,200
[No animals were harmed
during the filming of this drama.]

774
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,620

using bionic props and 3D effects.]
