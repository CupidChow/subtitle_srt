00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,300
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,990
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8

♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,410
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,200
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13

♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,500

21
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,820

22
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,360

23
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,140
Miss. If I've calculated right,

25
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,540
the White-Haired Deity and Marquis Purple Robe should have arrived at Tian Wai Tian.

26
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,440
If Second Miss sees them but not you, she'll be angry.

27
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,380
I asked them to leave first because I wanted to visit lands that once belonged to Beique.

28
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sure Qing'er won't be mad once she hears the reason.

29
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,640
Young Miss, there's a house there.

30
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,060

31
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,080
 Come in.

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,040
Sir, Xichu's Sword Song has appeared and the natural martial artist has been found.

33
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,320
After the Sword Deity fell, his body was hung above the city wall.

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,960
I saw it with my own eyes.

35
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,360
Only Scholar Deity can pass down Xichu's Sword Song now.

36
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,960
The Scholarly Deity...

37
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,360
The Art of Drugs...

38
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,160
The revival of our country is around the corner.

39
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,320

40
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,840
Miss, the person they worship is Beique's Emperor Gouchen.

41
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,580
They are our subjects.

42
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,380
Just now... I saw the dates on your memorial tablet.

43
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,160
Did your spouse and father-in-law pass away 15 years ago?

44
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:07,700
My husband and my father-in-law died in the battle between Beique and Beili 15 years ago.

45
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,500
 Have you ever thought maybe Beique would be rebuilt one day?

46
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,100
 Even if Beique is rebuilt, so what?

47
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:25,360
My husband and my son can never come back.

48
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,460
When another war begins,

49
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:38,600
how many more women will lose their husbands and children?

50
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,460
 Then why should we rebuild the country?

51
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,140
Miss, what's on your mind?

52
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,820
If we travel north for another 20 li, we'll arrive at the former capital, right?

53
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,820
Every Lantern Festival would be illuminated with lanterns.

54
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:09,120
I used to think that was the most beautiful scene in the mortal world.

55
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:17,660
But it seems like regardless of whether it's the capital of a nation,

56
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:25,644
or if it's still run by the same person, if there are decades of peace,

57
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:31,880
it will continue to be illuminated by lanterns during the Lantern Festival.

58
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,220
Life is short.

59
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,300
Perhaps the survivors of Beique

60
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:55,600
don't need to rebuild Beique, but rather, peaceful moments like tonight.

61
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,020
 Xichu's Sword Song's Cosmic Path.

62
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,480
 Everyone respects and avoids it.

63
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,640
 Find the Sly Path so that it can be of my use.

64
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,640
 But if it endangers the Baili Family, retreat.

65
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,740
Father, oh, Father.

66
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,020
I'd love to witness the Cosmic Path myself.

67
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,931
Father sent some news?

68
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,640
He said that beneath the Cosmic Path lays the Sly Path.

69
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,660
Common people can have the Cosmic Path.

70
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,700
The Sly Path is for the Wen Family.

71
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,166
What is the Sly Path?

72
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:47,286
I've only heard of it, but not seen it.

73
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:50,686
It's said to be something regarding Xichu's Art of Drugs.

74
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:54,286
If it exists, even the deities and ghosts fear it.

75
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:56,866
What if we can't find it?

76
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:58,746
I wonder about that too.

77
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:05,086
If we can't find it, will you help the Baili Family or the Wen Family?

78
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:11,086
I'll ask my son then.

79
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:14,326
I'll help whoever he wants me to help.

80
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:17,566
Don't worry.

81
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:22,526
Father said that if it endangers the Baili Family, we back off.

82
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:27,346
He told you to back off, but not to assist.

83
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:33,466
It means he's noticed it's different this time.

84
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:39,583
But Father can only represent himself. Not me.

85
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:43,183
I don't care about the Baili Family, but I won't let anyone harm you,

86
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:45,703
not to mention my nephew!

87
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:47,503
Unless...

88
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:51,223
I'm dead.

89
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:59,543

90
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:27,563
I wonder how Sikong Changfeng is doing now.

91
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:44,263

92
00:09:10,323 --> 00:09:13,863

93
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:50,763
Thank you, Senior.

94
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:53,247
Don't rush to thank me.

95
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:55,963
I didn't say I'd save you.

96
00:09:57,403 --> 00:10:01,003
Tell me. Did Wen Hujiu ask you to come here?

97
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:04,483
Did he say that when I saw the poison in you,

98
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:08,563
I'd do my best to cure you to prove that I was better than him?

99
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:11,543
And once I fed you the antidote and your previous injuries flared up,

100
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:14,123
I'd think it was another one of his tricks

101
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:17,483
and still do my very best to save you.

102
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,263
 Oh, no.

103
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,083
 Senior Wen told me that the Medicine King would save me,

104
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,783
 but he didn't tell me what to do if he saw through the plan.

105
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:31,463
Only one person can put five poisons in a body. No one else can do it.

106
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:35,263
Only he would try such a childish trick.

107
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:41,783
Don't move.

108
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:46,583
If you won't save me, then I won't stay.

109
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,663
I didn't say I wouldn't save you.

110
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:51,643
However, I have one condition.

111
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:53,603
What is it?

112
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:58,123
In reality, you should have been dead.

113
00:10:58,123 --> 00:10:59,843
What's kept you alive?

114
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:03,143
Has a famous physician treated you?

115
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,783
I have no money for a physician.

116
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:13,263
I saw a book about herbs, gathered some and ingested them randomly.

117
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:15,823
How quaint.

118
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:18,903
You might really have a talent for medicine.

119
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:25,143
Good. I need an apprentice to test my herbs and to serve me.

120
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:29,763
He may follow my steps after I pass away and become a medicine king.

121
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:35,603
You're too old to be an apprentice, but there's really no one else around here.

122
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:37,683
I'll just have to make do.

123
00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:39,663
Farewell.

124
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:42,303
Fine, fine. Just six months.

125
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:46,483
Keep me company for six months and I'll save you.

126
00:11:47,543 --> 00:11:50,763
- Just six months? 
 - Yes.

127
00:11:50,763 --> 00:11:56,383
Maybe after six months, you'll want to stay.

128
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:04,643
All right.

129
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,263
What's the matter?

130
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,243
Sir, it's Young Master Zhuomo.

131
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,763
Heading to Qiandong City, Feng Feng?

132
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:30,443
I knew that with your temperament, you would rush here non-stop at once.

133
00:12:30,443 --> 00:12:34,043
And with my reasoning, I knew you'd pass by here.

134
00:12:34,043 --> 00:12:36,843
What do you think? Isn't my prediction correct?

135
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,703
Compliment me.

136
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,103
Father.

137
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:59,483
I have news from Tianqi City.

138
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:04,163
It's about Little Master from the Academy.

139
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,820
My dear father.

140
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,443
The sun hasn't even come out yet. What are you doing?

141
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:32,143
Your uncle told me that you wanted to learn swordsmanship.

142
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:34,983
So get up and practice.

143
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,260
You little brat. He even falls asleep here.

144
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,540
How rude.

145
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,060
Hold onto your sword properly. A good swordsman doesn't leave it laying around randomly.

146
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,300
You're going to teach me swordsmanship?

147
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,920
Isn't it obvious?

148
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,180
I don't want you to teach me.

149
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,940
What? You don't think I'm good enough?

150
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,440
Look. What do you think of this sword?

151
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,420
A Celestial Level sword is naturally among the best.

152
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,040
Naturally...

153
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,000
If I have the best sword, I must be tutored by the greatest swordsman.

154
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,940
I heard the strongest individual is Mister Li from Jixia Academy in Tianqi City.

155
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,310
Since I can't head to Tianqi City,

156
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,900
just find me someone of his caliber.

157
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,060
What a brat.

158
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,160
Like I said, a good swordsman doesn't leave it laying around randomly.

159
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,800
Give it back.

160
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,740
There you go. Now, use it.

161
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,500
Sure.

162
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,500
That's how you wield a sword?

163
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,460
- Again. 
 - Why bother?

164
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,320
Learn how to draw it first.

165
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,800
There you go.

166
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,800
This is how you draw a sword.

167
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,700
This is the unsheathing technique of my Instant Kill Sword Arts.

168
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,880
I could only master the basics of the sword technique my master taught me.

169
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,760
Yet I remember something he told me.

170
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,020
You must have a reason to draw your sword, and to sheathe it when you have completed your mission.

171
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,000
The sword wave must be fast like lightning, yet silent.

172
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,700
Always know why you draw your sword.

173
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,260
From now on, you'll be confined to this yard.

174
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,580
When your unsheathing technique is strong enough to slice this scarecrow in half,

175
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,780
you can leave here.

176
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,940
It's just unsheathing.

177
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,820
But that looked cool.

178
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,600

179
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,240
I don't understand. Why must we wear these outfits?

180
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,900
Because Master said that white best suits a refined gentleman.

181
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,680
And this is what a disciple of the Academy should look like.

182
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,080
Unlike you, I hate white.

183
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,880
The point is it's too much trouble to wash it. Plus if it's stained,

184
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,900
isn't it the opposite of looking like a refined gentleman like Master said?

185
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,800
Master knew you would complain, so he told me to tell you that this was a ritual.

186
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,900

187
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:56,480
You and Marquis forced Dongjun to practice swordsmanship in the backyard to avoid someone, didn't you?

188
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,240
Little Master from the Academy.

189
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,720
Little Master isn't that person's only identity.

190
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,700
But a mere backyard cannot possibly hold Dongjun captive.

191
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,920
What if he really cuts the scarecrow in half with one slash?

192
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:23,390
Talented as he may be, he can't possible master the basics of the unsheathing skill in a few days.

193
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,660
Without any internal strength as a foundation,

194
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,420
even a month won't be long enough.

195
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,380
What if... he has internal strength?

196
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,400
Hujiu, that's impossible.

197
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,460
Sir.

198
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,060
What's the urgency?

199
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,200
Envoys from the Academy are here.

200
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,180
It must be Baili Chengfeng, the son of Marquis Zhenxi.

201
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,400
He's Baili Dongjun's father?

202
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,420
He's a powerful one.

203
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,820
Heir Apparent.

204
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,880
Greetings, Little Master.

205
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,320
 Internal strength?

206
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,200
 Why does Dongjun have internal strength?

207
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,800
 He doesn't seem to be aware of it.

208
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,290
Secretly, under everyone's eyes,

209
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:56,010
using liquor brewing as a cover-up

210
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,640
for cultivating internal energy...

211
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,440
Perhaps this is the Sly Path Father mentioned.

212
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,780
Xiao Baili.

213
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,880
How long can you hide it?

214
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,900
How's that? Not bad, right?

215
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,820
But Young Master, this scarecrow...

216
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,900
is still the same.

217
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,040
Impossible.

218
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,200
Why is it unaffected at all?

219
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,820
That shouldn't be.

220
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,280
I used all my strength.

221
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,300
What stupid sword is this? A Celestial Level sword?

222
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,500
It can't even slash through a scarecrow.

223
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,100
I'm done.

224
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,920
Young Master, you can't leave now.

225
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,100
After the last time, your father has begun to suspect me.

226
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,740
If I release you again, he'll think we conspired and we'll be found out.

227
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,180
Fine. I'll stay. Ask my grandfather to rescue me.

228
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,940
But he already dropped by this morning.

229
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,220
Grandfather was here?

230
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:11,200
He looked at you from outside and said "not bad," before going to the camp.

231
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,740
They even bought off Grandfather. Great. How infuriating!

232
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,260
Rui'er, tell me, what's the best way to leave this backyard?

233
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,740
Knock me out and forcibly get out. Or...

234
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,420
master the unsheathing skill.

235
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
Young Master...

236
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,260
It's just unsheathing a sword.

237
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,900
I'll do it!

238
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,360
This is...

239
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,260
Me? I'm also a disciple of the Academy.

240
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,340
However, I'm not an envoy.

241
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,220
I came to Qiandong City to meet a friend and catch up.

242
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,460
Heir Apparent, just pretend that I'm not here.

243
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,300
This senior brother of mine comes from the Martial World.

244
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,340
Please don't mind his manner of speech.

245
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,700
So you too, are a disciple of Mister Li.

246
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,100
Stop. Please don't be scared by that old man's reputation.

247
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,400
He's just an ordinary and fussy old man.

248
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,300
Do you know how fussy he is? I hate wearing this thing.

249
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,900
But what can I do? It's the Academy's rule.

250
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,200
Heir Apparent, please, please don't be offended.

251
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,100
Of course, not.

252
00:25:24,143 --> 00:25:29,163
May I know how many people you wish to take from Qiandong City?

253
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:36,683
What if...

254
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
it's just one individual?

255
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,900
The Academy sure has strict requirements.

256
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:54,000
You came all the way to Qiandong City to recruit only one person?

257
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You're mistaken.

258
00:25:57,903 --> 00:25:59,663
Am I?

259
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:06,400
Tell me, Heir Apparent. How many cities do we have in Beili?

260
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,400
163 in total.

261
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,300
The least amount of disciples recruited in a year was one,

262
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,700
the most in a year was six.

263
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,800
In this vast world, who knows how many people want to join us.

264
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,600
Forget about the world.

265
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:27,500
In Tianqi City alone, many prestigious families and wandering martial artists come to join us.

266
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:35,300
Therefore, to take one person from Qiandong City is already quite a lot,

267
00:26:36,383 --> 00:26:39,383
not too few. Too many, even.

268
00:26:40,063 --> 00:26:42,643
What if that person isn't here?

269
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,600
You might have to come with me to Tianqi City then.

270
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,700
My master speaks highly of your talent, it's just... you're a bit old.

271
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,600
I'm done. I'm so tired.

272
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:13,103
We'll do it another day.

273
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,423
Another day.

274
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,300
 Bravo!

275
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,000
Rui'er, bring me my liquor.

276
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:56,943
 The Marquis is back!

277
00:28:04,023 --> 00:28:05,510
Marquis Zhenxi.

278
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,240
Take a seat.

279
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:19,200
You came all the way to my mansion, yet you're still veiled.

280
00:28:19,223 --> 00:28:23,223
What? You don't want me to see your faces?

281
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,700
I only came to visit on behalf of the Academy.

282
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,600
I heard from my son, the purpose of your visit.

283
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,300
My Pofeng Army has many talented individuals indeed.

284
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:54,400
I shall bring them here later for you to choose from.

285
00:28:56,183 --> 00:28:57,703
It's not urgent.

286
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:01,943
Why isn't Young Master Baili here?

287
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:07,223
My grandson is a naughty one.

288
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:10,063
He left the city two days ago.

289
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:13,463
Little Master, pay him no attention.

290
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,900
Don't say anything. Listen to me.

291
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,400
It's not that I don't know how to unsheathe my sword.

292
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,100
I just don't want to. Got it?

293
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:35,663
Cheers!

294
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,900
Sword... Sword...

295
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,400
W-Where's my sword?

296
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,800
Sword...

297
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,300
Young Master, why don't you rest today? I'll tell your father.

298
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,300
- No need to... 
 - No!

299
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,800
The timing is just perfect.

300
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:09,700
I feel so full of energy right now!

301
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:54,783
Little Master, the guest chamber is this way.

302
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,000
Can you sense some formidable internal strength?

303
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,600
♫  The spring breeze blows past the tavern, swaying the window  ♫

304
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,200
♫  The echos of hoofbeats under the eaves stops for me  ♫

305
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,400
♫  Amidst love and hate, only my fighting spirit remains eternal  ♫

306
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,400
♫  The hot blood boils, making it's mark on the skies above  ♫

307
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,800
It's just... unsheathing a sword.

308
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,800
♫  The spring breeze blows through the window, the echos of hoofbeats stop  ♫

309
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,200
♫  Only my fighting spirit remains eternal, the hot blood boils  ♫

310
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,600
♫  The spring breeze blows through the window, the echos of hoofbeats stop  ♫

311
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,900
♫  Only my fighting spirit remains eternal, making it's mark on the skies above  ♫

312
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,300
♫  The spring breeze blows through the window, the echos of hoofbeats stop  ♫

313
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,700
♫  Only my fighting spirit remains eternal, the hot blood boils  ♫

314
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,000
♫  The spring breeze blows through the window, the echos of hoofbeats stop  ♫

315
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,400
♫  Only my fighting spirit remains eternal, making it's mark on the skies above  ♫

316
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,546
We finally meet.

317
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,300
Have we met before? Who are you?

318
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,200
My surname is Xiao.

319
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,400
I am Baili Dong...

320
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,800
Dong...

321
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,500
Jun...

322
00:33:03,186 --> 00:33:04,906
I know.

323
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:11,326
As for the Academy, I think I already have my answer.

324
00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:19,066
Heir Apparent, that slash from the young master was exquisite.

325
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,800
I still failed to prevent it in the end.

326
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:39,500
You should have known from the beginning that this couldn't be hidden.

327
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,400
It's only been 10 days.

328
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,100
How did Dongjun make so much progress with his swordsmanship?

329
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:53,700
It's like you said, his body houses the internal strength of a powerful fighter.

330
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,700
- Rui'er. 
 - Yes, Heir Apparent?

331
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,100
What did Dongjun do before he unsheathed the sword?

332
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,200
He didn't do anything except to drink.

333
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,100
He drank for several hours, and even finished all the liquor he had hidden in his room.

334
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:11,700
Just like that time at Famous Swords Manor, he drank a lot there.

335
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:18,800
It seems like when he's tipsy, the power inside his body will appear.

336
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,000
It's all that person's doing.

337
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,300

338
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,200
Since I've completed my duty as Little Master,

339
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,100
it's time for me to complete the task Royal Father gave me.

340
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,000
I'll come with you.

341
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,500
You should stay and keep a close watch on our future junior in case they try to hide him.

342
00:34:52,783 --> 00:34:57,303
I couldn't do anything. They still discovered Dongjun.

343
00:34:58,703 --> 00:35:02,243
He only took a look and left?

344
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:12,023
Sirs, Young Master Xiao left the mansion and headed toward that courtyard.

345
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:17,403
He's on the move.

346
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:24,183
He did say that he came on behalf of the Academy.

347
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:32,063
That means His Majesty isn't holding me accountable for Xichu's Scholarly Deity.

348
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:38,343
He only sent his most trustworthy son to secretly deal with Scholarly Deity.

349
00:35:40,743 --> 00:35:43,543
Chengfeng, once they are at the courtyard,

350
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:48,303
dispatch more men to block all entrances and exits.

351
00:35:48,303 --> 00:35:52,063
Irrelevant personnel are not to enter or leave.

352
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,603
 Quickly.

353
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:53,106
Jixia? You're here on behalf of the Academy?

354
00:36:53,106 --> 00:36:56,066
I'd love to represent the Academy.

355
00:36:56,066 --> 00:37:01,380
Unfortunately, I'm here on behalf of the Imperial Court.

356
00:37:02,026 --> 00:37:05,286
So what do you want?

357
00:37:05,286 --> 00:37:07,606
You're the remnant of Xichu.

358
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:12,986
You must be detained and charged by the Court of Justice.

359
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:18,846
Anyone could've done this, such as the local prefecture, the Court of Justice,

360
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:20,966
or even the Crown Prince's Shadow Guard.

361
00:37:20,966 --> 00:37:24,806
Why you, a member of the Academy?

362
00:37:24,806 --> 00:37:29,446
You must have a unique identity.

363
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:31,246
Your surname is Xiao.

364
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:35,566
He asked you to come here to earn some merits

365
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:39,686
and to earn the achievement of detaining a Xichu remnant like me.

366
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:44,586
Sir, you are indeed as powerful as my master.

367
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:52,006
Among the princes, which one are you?

368
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:53,246
The ninth one.

369
00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:56,526
As a swordsman, I have nothing but respect for you.

370
00:37:56,526 --> 00:38:02,406
However, this has nothing to do with me taking you from here.

371
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:06,006
You think... you can take me with you?

372
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:08,146
I would like to try.

373
00:38:08,146 --> 00:38:13,826
Oh right. My name is Xiao Ruofeng.

374
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:22,306
I see. Xiao Ruofeng.

375
00:39:06,726 --> 00:39:08,346
Is that all you've got?

376
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:13,446
Is this the sword technique taught to you by your master?

377
00:39:13,446 --> 00:39:15,606
My master possesses a sword technique.

378
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:17,766
He calls it the Second-best sword technique.

379
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:23,266
I cannot master it, nor am I strong enough to grasp it.

380
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:27,926
However... I also have my own sword technique.

381
00:39:28,886 --> 00:39:33,226
I call it the Third-best sword technique.

382
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,726
Great. What a good name.

383
00:39:47,726 --> 00:39:52,646
Then, try my sword now.

384
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:28,226
Uncle, what are you doing here?

385
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,346
Sleep well?

386
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:35,486
How are you, Xiao Dongjun?

387
00:40:35,486 --> 00:40:39,170
Brother Lei. You're here too?

388
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,906
Wait.

389
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,926
Before I fell asleep, did I meet someone?

390
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:49,026
He told me his surname was Xiao. Was I dreaming?

391
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:51,286
He's the Ninth Prince, Xiao Ruofeng.

392
00:40:51,286 --> 00:40:54,166
Also the Little Master from the Academy.

393
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,686
He came for my master.

394
00:40:57,686 --> 00:41:03,246
How smart of you. But he is also here for you.

395
00:41:03,246 --> 00:41:05,526
I need to see my master now!

396
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:09,466
You finally admitted that you have a master.

397
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:14,246
I need to save him. Even if it means I'll die, I have to go.

398
00:41:14,246 --> 00:41:17,826
Uncle, I'll give you 10 pots of First Plum Blossom. Let me go.

399
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:21,426
And 20 pots of Frosty Pine, 30 pots of Mirrored Moon, plus this Dustless.

400
00:41:21,426 --> 00:41:23,126
You can have them all.

401
00:41:26,046 --> 00:41:28,086
I don't need your sword.

402
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:31,846
But as for all that liquor you mentioned, not a single one can be missing.

403
00:41:31,846 --> 00:41:33,646
- Let's go. 
 - Hey, hey.

404
00:41:34,586 --> 00:41:36,386
Young Master Zhuomo.

405
00:41:38,126 --> 00:41:40,446
Are you stopping us?

406
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:44,966
 If I'm not mistaken, he's in the Carefree Phase of Heaven.

407
00:41:44,966 --> 00:41:47,386
 I won't be able to take him out.

408
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,246
I'll just tag along.

409
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:41,706

410
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:46,306
Crushing Palm.

411
00:42:46,306 --> 00:42:48,706
That's right!

412
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,986
You two, cover our backs!

413
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:20,066
You think you can take me away like this?

414
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:33,406
A spar with you has shown me the wide gap between us.

415
00:43:33,406 --> 00:43:35,286
Forgive my arrogance.

416
00:43:35,286 --> 00:43:40,946
Young men should be arrogant and fearless.

417
00:43:42,626 --> 00:43:44,526
You have potential.

418
00:43:44,526 --> 00:43:46,726
I won't kill you.

419
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:49,806
I'm not long for this world.

420
00:43:49,806 --> 00:43:54,066
Thus, I'm no threat to Beili.

421
00:43:54,066 --> 00:44:01,646
My biggest wish is to pass down my swordsmanship to my disciple.

422
00:44:01,646 --> 00:44:05,046
Then Beili will continue to hunt you down

423
00:44:05,046 --> 00:44:10,386
because your disciple carries the surname Baili.

424
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:11,986
Who's there?

425
00:44:25,206 --> 00:44:26,540
Wufa.

426
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,040
Wutian.

427
00:44:31,746 --> 00:44:33,117

428
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:35,186

429
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:47,300

430
