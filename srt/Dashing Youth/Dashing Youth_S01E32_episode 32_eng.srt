00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:15,890

2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Holding onto life and death in the face of danger  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,940
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,500
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,433
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:08,220
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,820
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,540
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost   ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,320
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,400

21
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,320

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,140

23
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,030

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,820

25
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,550

26
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,240
Let's do it here.

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,500
Are you sure?

28
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,660
You are under my phase. I can kill you within six palms attack.

29
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,660
Is that so?

30
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,900
If so, I will kill you with a higher phase.

31
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,520
How cocky.

32
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,760
Lend me your sword.

33
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,340
I was touched by an immortal and granted the gift of longevity.

34
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,240
But who are you to touch my head?

35
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,540
Go die!

36
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,920
A skilled fighter hides his weapon and waits for the right chance.

37
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,500
As still as a mountain and as agile as the thunder.

38
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,460
As expected of the head of Shanqian Academy.

39
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,560
I think that's enough, Zhuoqing.

40
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,920
Master!

41
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,900
Master.

42
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,620
I suppose our duel should be the most vigorous one in nearly 30 years.

43
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,940
Who on earth are you?

44
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,620
Didn't I tell you?

45
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,760
My name is Nangong Chunshui, an elegant scholar.

46
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,160
Impossible. My phase...

47
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,020
How boring.

48
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,420
Why do you people keep talking about phases?

49
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,260
Should we announce our phases before a fight?

50
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,140
If yours is higher, I should surrender and let you win?

51
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,680
That's not how it works, is it?

52
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,900
Your disciple has great composure.

53
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,340
He does justice to the Wind and Snow Sword.

54
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,880
You...

55
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,140
You are Li Changsheng?

56
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,340
How many times do I have to repeat it?

57
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,120
I'm Nangong Chunshui. You just won't remember.

58
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,900
You entered the palace at the age of six with discontentment.

59
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,220
Hence, you spent 30 years practicing to become the greatest martial artist.

60
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,020
You could have dominated the world with your skills.

61
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,900
However, you met me.

62
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,100
Poor thing.

63
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,020
I can kill you with the snap of my fingers.

64
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,580
But no, I won't kill you.

65
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,540
It's to give some face to that ruddy Emperor Tai'an.

66
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,820
I left you a letter. Head back and read it carefully.

67
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,920
You must... read it carefully.

68
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,420
I will.

69
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,460
Very well.

70
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,620
I'm not going to kill you, but you are halfway in the Mental Phase of the Unknown,

71
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,500
which is too high.

72
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,800
Why don't you lower a phase?

73
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,560
Master.

74
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,500
Remember to remind your master to read that letter carefully.

75
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,860
It's very important.

76
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,200
Understood.

77
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,620
Master, let's leave.

78
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,500
Are you letting them go like that?

79
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,000
These two might be a threat to be reckoned with.

80
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,300
Aren't you a scholar?

81
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,460
Scholars should be merciful. How can you simply kill?

82
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,300
That's what monks do.

83
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,180
We scholars can claim countless lives with our words in the court.

84
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,660
Don't kill.

85
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,600
If you want to kill, do it by yourself after I leave.

86
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,380
Little Master, that's all I can do for you.

87
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,580
I'm leaving.

88
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,010
There were two of them

89
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,600
but they made a formidable pair.

90
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,620
How does that fool manage to hire such powerful helpers?

91
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,400
Prince Qing, you are looking for me aren't you?

92
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:59,750

93
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,860
Young Master, you are a young talent with advanced martial skills.

94
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,060
And I'm impressed by that.

95
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,460
But that's enough for today.

96
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,880
Jin Xian.

97
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,220
You want to leave?

98
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,760
Have you asked me about that?

99
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,840
I might still have some strength left to fight desperately.

100
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,560
You can't be sure of that.

101
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,320
Even if you are strong,

102
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm afraid you might not stand a chance if we join hands.

103
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,790
Rather than having both sides suffer, why don't we each take a step back?

104
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:03,140
Next time we meet will it still be with drawn swords?

105
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,420
I hope not.

106
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,520
Who's there?

107
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,460
Who are you?

108
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,500
I'm Nangong Chunshui.

109
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,540
I came here to see the successor to the Heart Sword and her daughter.

110
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,820
Why do you want to see my daughter?

111
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,680
To be frank, your daughter and I have a deal.

112
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,600
She's now my disciple.

113
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,200
Nonsense!

114
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,460
I'm telling the truth. Why don't you believe me?

115
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,100
- Mother. 
 - Hanyi, go back inside.

116
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,260
Hanyi?

117
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,220
Long time no see.

118
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,460
Grandfather Li?

119
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,460
Why do you look younger, Grandfather Li?

120
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,540
What Grandfather Li?

121
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,660
Call me Master.

122
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,500
I...

123
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,220
I have disappointed you, Master.

124
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,020
I lost.

125
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,840
I will accept my punishment.

126
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,200
Please punish me, Master.

127
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,600
I will accept my punishment too.

128
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,680
There is no need for that.

129
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:12,100
Leave Bali Dongjun alone from now on.

130
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,880
I will explain it to His Majesty myself.

131
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,760
Go back and cure your injuries.

132
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
This time...

133
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,800
I have miscalculated.

134
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,940
So you need not blame yourselves.

135
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,880
♫  In our youthful wildness, we travel the world with ease  ♫ 
 ♫  Seeking a ray of light in the shadows  ♫

136

138
00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:54,160
Perfect timing.

139
00:12:56,628 --> 00:13:02,008
♫  We face a future full of danger alone, but we wield our swords with righteousness and courage  ♫

140
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,526
The rain came just in time.

148
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,340
You traveled for miles to help him.

149
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,134
Don't you want to meet him?

150
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,180
No.

151
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,280
I'm a wanted criminal now.

152
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,600
The matter of the Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion has just been settled.

153
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,180
It's best not to drag him into more trouble.

154
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,660
We will meet in due course.

155
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,700
Yao'er. Master.

156
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,000
And Second Senior's daughter?

157
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,460
Why did you come back without telling us?

158
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,320
If Mister Li hadn't returned, who would help you resolve the biggest challenge?

159
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,900
You are dense. It's time to leave.

160
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,049
- But my grandfather... 
 - Your grandfather has already returned to Qiandong City.

161
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:40,300
After handling Grand Eunuch Zhuoqing, Mister Li went to the relay station.

162
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,500
The Marquis left under the protection of the Pofang Army upon learning that you were safe.

163
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,980
Don't worry.

164
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,860
No worries.

165
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,100
It's time to go back to Xueyue City.

166
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,260
Don't forget that you are one of the city lords now.

167
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,420
What about Changfeng? Isn't he a city lord as well?

168
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,940
Well, he has something else to attend to.

169
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,580
The matter in Tianqi City should be put to an end now.

170
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,960
After returning to Xueyue City, stay away from court affairs

171
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,960
and only be a simple martial artist. How about it?

172
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,920
Certainly.

173
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
Your family's marquisate is a hereditary title.

174
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,580
You will become a marquis.

175
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,040
It holds great power above the people.

176
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,280
Are you sure you want to quit?

177
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,560
I never wish for wars. I came here for the sake of Grandfather.

178
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,320
Since this is over, well, let's go back to the Martial World.

179
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,860
Very well.

180
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,900
Admiring the blossoms over a drink with friends is a wonderful time, one that can never be returned to after years.

181
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,420
Let's go back to the Martial World.

182
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,480
Let's go.

183
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:24,220

184
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,160
State Preceptor.

185
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,580
Is my plan somewhat naive?

186
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,780
I wouldn't say your plan is naive.

187
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,540
It's all for the sake of Beili.

188
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:46,720
However, what you have seen is only a few decades.

189
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,220
What Li Changsheng has seen is a few hundred years, right?

190
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:01,420
Mister Li is probably the guardian of Beili.

191
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,460
Whether he has groomed the peerless Prince Langya

192
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,780
or taken Baili Dongjun as his disciple,

193
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,260
it's all part of his strategy to protect the nation.

194
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,100
Do some people really live for hundreds of years?

195
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:24,320
In sects with secret martial skills, some indeed become deities.

196
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,540
However, living for a hundred years isn't easy.

197
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:35,100
Living for hundreds of years would demand a price beyond what ordinary people can endure.

198
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:42,440
Naturally, they have to bear the responsibilities that ordinary people cannot bear.

199
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,840
Now I understand.

200
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,420

201
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,653

202
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,240
I, Sikong Changfeng, the disciple of Xueyue City,

203
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,240
would like to challenge Liu Xiaochen, the King of Spear, to a duel.

204
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,420
I, Sikong Changfeng, the disciple of Xueyue City,

205
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,600
would like to challenge Liu Xiaochen, the King of Spear, to a duel.

206
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,780

207
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,320
Are you Liu Xiaochen, the King of Spear?

208
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,540
You want to challenge me to a spear duel?

209
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,160
Please show me your skills.

210
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:23,713

211
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,140
Master, you haven't told me why you brought Second Senior's daughter along?

212
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,660
Let me reintroduce her to you.

213
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,100
This is your first junior sister.

214
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,900
Throughout my life, I have only taken three disciples.

215
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,880
No wonder Changfeng is the third city lord of Xueyue City.

216
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,580
Turns out the second city lord is here.

217
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,480
Senior.

218
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,540
Good girl.

219
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,160
This is my spouse.

220
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,120
Ignore him. My name is Yue Yao.

221
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,300
Sister Yue Yao.

222
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,860
This darned Xiao Ruofeng.

223
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,020
Is he really my junior?

224
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,660
Wait. Now, there's also another Dongba.

225
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,020
He's also my junior, right?

226
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,960
Who am I? I'm their senior.

227
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,260
They summoned me to chase after a runaway bride.

228
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,820
Oh, come on. Even the government office wouldn't give a fig about that.

229
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,700
And also that Ye Dingzhi. He's the son of General Ye Yu, whom I admire the most.

230
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,540
I doubt I can catch him.

231
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,660
They throw all the difficult tasks at me. I'm done with it.

232
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,300
At worst, I will quit being a general.

233
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,820
Maybe I should go home and apologize to my wife.

234
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:48,460
Why do I suddenly find that having this fellow as my second senior is an embarrassment?

235
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,640
Lei'er.

236
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,100
Second Senior.

237
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,480
Xiao Dongba? What are you doing here?

238
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,660
Hanyi, why are you here, too? It's so far from home.

239
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,500
Who are you?

240
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,640
I'm your master.

241
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,740
Just anyone can talk down to me when I'm down on my luck, huh?

242
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,980
I left Tianqi City for a few days and you, little bloke, are acting tough against me.

243
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,420
I am the Second Senior in Jixia Academy,

244
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,660
Mister Li's direct disciple, Young Master Zhuomo, Lei Mengsha.

245
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,060
Mister Li's direct disciple, huh?

246
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,260
Jeez, you and your whining.

247
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,180
Prince Langya is nothing. Beat him up if you are not convinced.

248
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,040
Why are you complaining here?

249
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,740
Wait.

250
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,460
You are Master, right?

251
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,420
Gosh. Why are you wearing a mask to freak me out?

252
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,020
Master, my daughter is over there.

253
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,840
Please do me a favor.

254
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,880
Get lost.

255
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,300
Listen up. If you want to stay here, you had better make a name in Beili and Tianqi City.

256
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,980
Thinking of going back to Lei Fortress?

257
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,780
If old man Lei dares to take you in, I will crack his head open.

258
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,600
All right, Master.

259
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,200
- Get lost, then. 
 - All right.

260
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,600
Father.

261
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,400
Hanyi, let's go home.

262
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,740
Hanyi is my second disciple now.

263
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,820
She will be with me from now on.

264
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:49,320
My goodness. In just the blink of an eye, you are in the same generation as me.

265
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Hanyi, you must take care of yourself out there.

266
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,800
Do learn martial arts skills from your master.

267
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,600
Don't slack off. Work hard, all right?

268
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,100
You must stay away from good-looking boys.

269
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,400
Do not hold boys' hands.

270
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,300
Promise me.

271
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
All right, all right.

272
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,100
Mother is waiting for you at home.

273
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,500
I'm in a hurry now.

274
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,520
All right.

275
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,880
I'm leaving.

276
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,640
Second Senior.

277
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,200
Take care.

278
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,500
Take care, my foot. Don't always say scary words.

279
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,000
You sound like we won't meet again.

280
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Hanyi, do not hold boys' hands.

281
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,000
Just go already.

282
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,300
I'm leaving.

283
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,520
Come here.

284
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,200
By the way, Master, where is Ruofeng?

285
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,500
I haven't had a chance to bid him goodbye.

286
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,600
Well, he's not in Tianqi City at the moment.

287
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,500
A few days ago, I sent him off somewhere.

288
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,800
I see.

289
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,600
Fine, I will meet him when he comes back.

290
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,700
Come back? No, he's not coming back.

291
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,600
Let's say goodbye here.

292
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
What was that supposed to mean?

293
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,600
It's time to leave.

294
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,800
Madam Luo.

295
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,500
Madam Luo.

296
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,300
All right. I'm going on a long journey.

297
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
I will take Hanyi with me.

298
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,000
Once she completes her cultivation, she will return to Xueyue City.

299
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,900
As for us,

300
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,500
I'm afraid we won't meet again in this lifetime.

301
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,200
Master.

302
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I used to think that life doesn't need to be sentimental.

303
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,500
Whether or not we have a last farewell wouldn't make any difference.

304
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,100
But since I had come here for the matter of the Marquis Zhen's Mansion,

305
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,200
we might as well meet up.

306
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,300
I have nothing to leave for you all but four words.

307
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,400
Lend me your sword.

308
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,000
It's almost 200 years.

309
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,600
Xiao Yi, I still remember the four words Li Xuan left us.

310
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,000
Now, I will give them to my disciples.

311
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,900
 Finally, you have come this far and conquered the country.

312
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,900
 Now I think that's not much fun.

313
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,400
 Go back, then.

314
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,800
 Go back to the Martial World with me.

315
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,000
 Li Xuan left us with four words. Do you remember them?

316
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,200
 Of course I do.

317
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,100
 Instead, I always think you have already forgotten them.

318
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,900
 No I haven't.

319
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,340
 But I only hope that the moment after I breach the city gate with my sword,

320
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,860
 all the youth will hold these four words in their hearts.

321
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,400
Now, sword and blade techniques are no longer his concern.

322
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,000
A casual wave of his hand makes a peerless strike.

323
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,100
Well, let's set off.

324
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,060
Master,

325
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,540
I will not forget that.

326
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,000
Young man, nice skills.

327
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,800
What's your name?

328
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,700
Sikong Changfeng.

329
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,300
You want to defeat me to make a name for yourself?

330
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,100
That's my plan.

331
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,600
I'm not prepared to yield just yet.

332
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,800
If you defeat the King of Spear, you will become the next King of Spear.

333
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,200
There are many Kings of Spear.

334
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,000
But you have the potential to become a Spear Deity.

335
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Sikong Changfeng, Mister Li sent me here with a question.

336
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Will you go to Tianqi with me?

337
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,400
A proper visit to Tianqi.

338
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,560
 Master.

339
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,720
 Since I'm back, leave the matter of the Marquis Zhexi's Mansion to me.

340
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,400
 I'm also aware that you are preparing to establish the Internal Guard Office of Tianqi

341
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,000
 and you need four experts.

342
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 I just took a disciple in. Perhaps he could be of help.

343
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Master, isn't your last disciple Dongjun?

344
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Not him.

345
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,600
 It's a young Spear Deity.

346
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,700
 When Dongjun assisted you in breaking through to a new phase with Seven Starry Nights,

347
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,600
 you met him.

348
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:15,000
 My dear disciple, this may be the last time I can help you.

349
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Go to him and tell him I sent you.

350
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,080
I shall come with you.

351
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,220
Wenjun!

352
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,860
Wenjun, I'm back.

353
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,100
Brother Yun.

354
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,840
Brother Yun, mealtime!

355
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
They smell wonderful.

356
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,200
How did the trip to Tianqi go?

357
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Good. Don't worry.

358
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,300
By the way, did you manage to meet Dongjun?

359
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,400
Speaking of which, I haven't seen him during the past decade.

360
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm a wanted criminal now.

361
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,500
Given the sensitive situation I didn't want to land him in trouble, so I didn't meet him.

362
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,300
Once everything is over, I will write to him and invite him over.

363
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,600
All right.

364
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,700
Come.

365
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,560
Here, try this.

366
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,440
Delicious.

367
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,300
- Have some more. 
 - I'm Wang Rensun of Heavenly Mountain Sect.

368
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,900
I came to request an audience with Elder Wang You.

369
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,400
I'm Wang Rensun of Heaven Mountain Sect.

370
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,200
I came to request an audience with Elder Wang You.

371
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,700
I'm Wang Rensun of Heaven Mountain Sect.

372
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,100
I came to request an audience with Elder Wang You.

373
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,200
I'm Wang Rensun of Heaven Mountain Sect.

374
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,900
I came to request an audience with Elder Wang You.

375
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Mister Wang of Heaven Mountain Sect, what brings you to Elder Wang You?

376
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,900
Here's the thing. I couldn't overcome the bottleneck in my cultivation.

377
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,800
I was told Elder Wang You practiced the Six Secret Methods Arts and is in a high phase.

378
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,800
So I would like to ask him for guidance.

379
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
You were shouting just now.

380
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,100
People might mistake you for stirring up trouble here.

381
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,700
No, don't take me wrong. I meant no disrespect at all.

382
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,200
Wait.

383
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,700
Could this be why Elder Wang You is unwilling to meet me?

384
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,000
Elder Wang You isn't ignoring you.

385
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,500
He's probably out traveling with other hermits so he's not in right now.

386
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,000
Then...

387
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,500
- What should I do? 
 - No worries. He isn't far away.

388
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,800
Normally, he will return in a few days.

389
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,000
Brother Wang, if you don't mind, come in for a drink and rest.

390
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,700
Of course I don't. I hope you won't find me a disturbance.

391
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,300
May I ask for your name?

392
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,100
Ye Dingzhi.

393
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,500
- Wang Rensun of Heaven Mountain Sect. 
 - Please.

394
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,000
Please.

395
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,100
 In the 18th year of Taihe's era, Emperor Tai'an of Beili fell gravely ill.

396
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,600
 The struggle vying for the throne escalated.

397
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,800
 Many court officials were assassinated by their enemies due to the political strife.

398
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,800
 Tianqi City was besieged by bloodshed and everyone was on edge.

399
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,400
 This period came to be known as the Six Princes' Struggle for Power.

400
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,100
 To fend off these mysterious assassins, Xiao Ruofeng - Prince Langya,

401
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,500
 Li Xinyue -  Successor of the Heart Sword,

402
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,000
 Ji Ruofeng - Wuji Staff

403
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,800
 Tang Lianyue of the Tang Clan,

404
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,700
 and Sikong Changfeng of Xueyue City

405
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,800
 established the Internal Guard Office of Tianqi.

406
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:59,300
 They joined forces to restore peace to Tianqi City after a brief period of turmoil.

407
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:04,600
 These four people were then known as the Four Guardians of Tianqi.

408
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
 Just as the chaos began to subside,

409
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,900
 Emperor Tai'an suddenly fell gravely ill and was fading fast.

410
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,000
 The six princes, under the lead of Prince Qing, conspired and initiated a coup.

411
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,700
 They fought their way to Pingqing Hall and demanded the throne from Emperor Tai'an.

412
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,600
 Xiao Ruofeng led the Four Guardians of Tianqi and Tiger Army to quell the coup

413
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,800
 and arrest Prince Qing alive.

414
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,200
This way.

415
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,300
- Be careful. 
 - All right.

416
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:49,340

417
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,820
- Prince Langya. 
 - How is it?

418
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,960
The remnants have been arrested and sent for interrogation.

419
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:10,600
Some of the princes involved in the rebellion have been executed, while the survivors are under guard.

420
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,320
What else do you want to say?

421
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,320
The winner dominates while the loser collapses.

422
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,400
It should be this way.

423
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,940
I have nothing more to say.

424
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,040
- Take him away. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

425
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,460
Yingxian!

426
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,400
Protect His Highness!

427
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,300
Do it.

428
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,820
Your Highness, let's meet in our next lives.

429
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,640
Give him a proper burial.

430
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,820
An imperial edict has arrived!

431
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,380
By the Mandate of Heaven and the Emperor decrees...

432
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,992

433
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,920

434
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:33,680
The throne shall be given to the Third Prince, Xiao Ruojin.

435
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,720
Commander, why didn't Master ascend to the throne?

436
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,520
Because he never wanted that.

437
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,860
The one who wants to ascend to the throne has never been him.

438
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,500
 Your Highness, why not be a dragon if you can reach the sky?

439
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,200
 You know we will assist you.

440
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,320
 Xiaoying, did you know...

441
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:37,180
 When I was little, my mother was out of favor.

442
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,500
 My mother, my brother, and I had a tough time.

443
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:48,100
 I remember one winter when there was a heavy snowfall.

444
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:55,260
 Even when I think of it now, I still feel the biting cold.

445
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:03,720
 I was little and weak back then and I couldn't endure such a harsh winter.

446
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,380
 Just as I was dying,

447
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:15,660
 my mother's maidservant called for an imperial physician with her life.

448
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:21,040
 When the imperial physician saw my condition, he knew that my family was not favored.

449
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,220
 So, he refused to treat me.

450
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:32,020
 I remember that my brother was kneeling in the snow

451
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,240
 and kowtowing to the imperial physician,

452
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,700
 begging him to save me.

453
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,840
 Afterward, the snow stopped.

454
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,493
 I was saved, but my brother changed.

455
00:39:51,493 --> 00:39:58,140
 If he was a gentle and humble prince,

456
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:07,440
 from then on, he had become a monarch holding a sharp blade.

457
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,140
 It wasn't my wish to become a prince.

458
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:23,700
 If I could I would want to be like my seniors and juniors who roam freely as martial artists.

459
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,560
 But my brother is different.

460
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,640
 He has learned how to become a monarch since youth.

461
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,820
 He has ambition and is not as sentimental as I am.

462
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:54,640
 In the future he will be a good emperor.

463
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,540
The new year has arrived.

464
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:15,440
I wonder how it will differ from the old.

465
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,740
 In the late winter of the 18th year of Taihe's era, Emperor Tai'an passed away.

466
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,760
 The throne was passed to the Third Prince, Xiao Ruojin.

467
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,780
 In the following spring, the new Emperor changed the era's name to Ming De

468
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,540
 and conferred the title of Consort Xuan on the secondary consort, Yi Wenjun.

469
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:56,100
Is the conferment of Consort Xuan meant to hide the secret?

470
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,520
Do you think...

471
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:15,482
that if people found out my beloved consort wasn't in the palace,

472
00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:21,120
I would become the laughingstock of the world?

473
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,240
 It seems Brother hasn't given up on finding her after all these years.

474
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,410
Consort Xuan has been away from the palace

475
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,820
for way too long.

476
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,201

477
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:41,520

478
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:53,000

479
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:04,600
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

480
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:12,400
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

481
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:22,000
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

482
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:30,140
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

483
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,460
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure.  ♫

484
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,820
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

485
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:40,060
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

486
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,582
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

487
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:48,040
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

488
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,100
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

489
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,620
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

490
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:58,040
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

491
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,400
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

492
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,800
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

493
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:11,280
♫  I met you  ♫

494
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:55,700
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

495
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:03,500
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

496
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:12,900
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

497
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:21,220
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

498
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,480
♫  As if destined by fate,   ♫

499
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,950
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

500
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:31,265
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

501
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:35,740
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

502
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,180
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

503
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,280
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

504
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,660
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

505
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,120
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

506
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:53,440
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

507
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,920
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

508
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:02,120
♫  I met you  ♫
