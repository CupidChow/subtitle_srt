you have a letter.

36
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,700
You're buying information
from Baixiao Hall?

37
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,460
Yes.

38
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,260
It cost me a pretty penny.

escaped without me.

We're only at the Sturdy Phase.

62
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,940

130

That's right.

One of them

However,

167
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,500
given Mr. Lyu's ties

168
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,740
with Mr. Li,

169
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,380
Mr. Li already knew about it.

170

It's no surprise.

171

177
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,140
We found a team

are dead.

181
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,580
All dead?

182
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,380
What about Zhuge Yun?

183
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,300
Is he dead?

184
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,820
Yes.

185
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,180
If Zhuge Yun is dead...

186
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,060
So we've got it all wrong?

187
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,460
Baixiao Hall's tip is seldom wrong.

188
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,540
Let's go check it out.

189
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,820
Zhuge Yun?

190
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,980
Of the Zhuge Family?

191
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,780
I'll come with you.

192
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,860
Three of the candidates
died horrendously.

193
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,580
When we discovered them,

194
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,340
they were nearly unrecognizable.

195
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,780
We've sent messengers

196
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,980
to inform their families.

197
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,260
What kind of monster
would do such a thing?

198
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,100
What grudge did he have

199
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,940
against them?

200
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,700
Why did he

201
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,620
kill the innocent?

202
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,340
Zhuge Yun died in a different manner.

203
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,180
There are fewer wounds on his body.

204
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,540
This way.

205
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,740
He's dead.

206
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,300
I got it.

207
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,380
The culprit

208
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,420
must have special feelings

209
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,500
for the Zhuge Family.

210
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,380
Why else would Zhuge Yun

211
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,660
receive a more merciful death

212
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,420
than the others?

213
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,460
Now is not the time

214
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,740
for your nonsense.

215
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,820
Get the coroner at once.

216
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,540
Is he really

217
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,780
Zhuge Yun?

218
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,340
That's...

219
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,820
That's not Zhuge Yun.

220
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,060
And he is no martial artist.

221
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,940
A scapegoat.

222
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,420
Didn't you guys

223
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,740
notice anything suspicious
about Zhuge Yun?

224
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:22,860
No.

225
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,020
We had doubts

226
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,940
about his identity,

227
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,220
but what he used

228
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,900
is undoubtedly Qimen Dunjia Arts.

229
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,660
I think

230
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,820
I know who he is.

231
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,780
But

232
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
if I'm right,

233
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,660
then things are going to get
very complicated.

234
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,860
Interesting.

235
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,460
You don't get to decide

236
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,340
whether we'll show up.

237
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,700
It's indeed Lord Wuzuo.

238
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,140
And this time,

239
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,140
both Twin Lords Wuzuo have come.

240
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,580
Zhuge Yun?

241
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,540
No.

242
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,180
A young man like Zhuge Yun

243
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,580
could not possibly

244
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,860
emanate that kind of energy.

245
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,940
Who are you?

246
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,140
It's none of your business.

247
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,460
You're not our target.

248
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,980
Keep healing him.

249
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,620
I'll take care of this.

250
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,140
All right.

251
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,660
A nobody like you?

252
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,180
You're out

253
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,860
of your depth.

254
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,740
A nobody?

255
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,340
This is...

256
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,540
Between creation and destruction

257
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,580
lies a calamity.

258
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,060
Before the world is formed

259
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,620
lies infinite calamity.

260
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,500
It's called
the Infinite Sword technique.

261
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
You're not Zhao Yujia.

262
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,380
You can impersonate Zhuge Yun

263
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,820
but I can't impersonate Zhao Yujia?

264
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,780
That's right, I'm not him.

265
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,340
I'm the head disciple

266
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,780
of Lyu Suzhen of Mount Wangcheng,

267
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,380
Wang

268
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,140
Yi

269
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,860
xing.

270
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,900
[Yueluo, 32nd Division
of Tianqi Royal Academy]

271
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,820
Your future disciple

272
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,060
is up against a strong foe.

273
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,620
He could die at any second

274
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,860
yet you're sitting here drinking

275
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,180
and yawning?

276
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,500
First of all, this is Tianqi City.

277
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,620
Martial artists are a dime a dozen

278
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,700
and capable martial artists
are everywhere.

279
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,060
There's always

280
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,540
someone stronger.

281
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,860
And

282
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,540
I'm the strongest of them all.

283
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,620
I

284
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,380
am number one!

285
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,340
What's taking the candidates so long?

286
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,100
I'm tired.

287
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,420
Their opponent

288
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,820
is no ordinary man.

289
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,700
There's no such thing
as an ordinary opponent.

290
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,540
There are two kinds of enemies,

291
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,540
those

292
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,660
who wants to kill you,

293
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,980
and those whom you want to kill.

294
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,540
In the latter case,

295
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,860
one should train hard

296
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,780
and strike swiftly.

297
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,420
In the former case,

298
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,620
just hang in there

299
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,180
and hope you don't die.

300
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,100
Based on Ruofeng's message,

301
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,740
have you guessed who those people are?

302
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,740
There was an empire

303
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,060
once retreated
and stood on the defensive

304
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,380
in a place outside here.

305
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,260
That empire...

306
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,580
Its ruler believed
in the Shengtian Religion.

307
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,500
It was a theocratic empire.

308
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,660
I met that ruler back then.

309
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,500
He had

310
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,180
five formidable bodyguards.

311
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,940
They are Wufa, Wutian,

312
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,020
Wuxiang, Wuzuo.

313
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,140
Even today,

314
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,940
their powers

315
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,940
are unmatched.

316
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,860
There are five guards,

317
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,740
but you only mentioned four of them.

318
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,300
Yes.

319
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,940
Do you know why?

320
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,940
Just as I thought.

321
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,420
Every time you appear,

322
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,060
there's always trouble.

323
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,820
Zhuge Yun.

324
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,380
Wait there!

325
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,620
Why didn't you tell me

326
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,220
Lords Wuzuo were coming?

327
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,620
Don't you

328
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,860
want to win?

329
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,900
Now that Wuzuo have merged,

330
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,220
they'll be dead for sure.

331
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
Pretend to be hurt by me.

332
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,340
Let's wait and see what happens.

333
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,660
Warriors aligned,

334
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,380
formation ready, press forth.

335
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,860
Six-word Mantra.

336
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Interesting.

337
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,700
Attack!

338
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,540
It's the Immovable Lord technique.

339
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,020
Channels a menacing projection
that strikes fear

340
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,220
in gods and demons alike,

341
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,980
that's the Immovable Lord technique.

342
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,580
Expanding every ounce of energy

343
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,620
within your body

344
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,780
to land a killing blow.

345
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,140
It is the most reckless

346
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,140
and

347
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,940
self-destructive moves.

348
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,860
Can you really channel
the Immovable Lord?

349
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,740
I

350
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,180
don't

351
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,380
believe it.

352
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,740
Then

353
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,300
I'll make you believe it.

354
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,540
Impressive.

355
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,380
All right, Ye Dingzhi,

356
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,260
you can stop now.

357
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,500
The Academy

358
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,740
should be aware of this
with such big noise.

359
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,220
Save some strength
and wait for them to come.

360
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,220
Stop?

361
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,500
Oh, no.

362
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,220
He's lost it.

363
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,300
Seems like your Immovable Lord technique

364
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,860
is a little half-baked.

365
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,100
Then don't blame me

366
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,740
for annihilating you.

367
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,420
How dare you hurt my companion?

368
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,060
Do you think you can act brazenly

369
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,260
just because I'm injured?

370
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,540
Now,

371
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,100
it's time for me

372
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,940

520
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,260

523
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,980

524
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,020

526
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,780

528
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,540

529
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,980
The corpse stays here.

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,460
Do you understand?

531
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,180
Are we supposed

532
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,380

533
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,820

534
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,100
Zhuge Yun was too fast.

535
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,220
I forgot to steal his.

536
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,940
Don't worry, I've got it covered.

537
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,660
You stole it

538
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,060

539
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,820

540
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,180
Watch your mouth.

541
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:06,900
Wait a minute.

542
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,060

543
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,180
one pouch.

544
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,780
How come Zhuge Yun's team had three?

545
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,900
That wasn't Zhuge Yun.

546
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,420
They must have

547
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,580
scratched those pouches

548
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,140

must be dead by now.

551
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,260
Never mind.

552
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,820
Let's not dwell on it.

553
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,740
At least

554
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,580

555
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,220
right?

556
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,980
If you ran off

with the pouches

558
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,860
instead of telling us,

559
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,580

A poem.

566
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,140
The Vermilion Bird weeps

567
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,340
You do not witness
the existence of Black Tortoise.

Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise.

571
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,860
Each holy beast presides
over a direction.

572
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,660
This is the law by which
the Emperor's buildings are constructed.

573
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,820
This poem is about the Four Beasts.

574
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,620
Therein lies the answer.

575
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,060
Azure Dragon, White Tiger,

576
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,420
Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise.

577
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,700
We have three of them.

578
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,340
What about the Azure Dragon?

579
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,060
I've got it.

580
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,060
The answer lies in the Azure Dragon.

581
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,700
"Whose rise is the moon waiting for?"

582
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,700
We must go to the place

583
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,020
where the dragon rises.

584
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,180
The place where the dragon rises?

585
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,060
Qinglong Gate.

586
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,780
Tianqi City has four gates,

587
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,580
with one in each direction.

588
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,340
Qinglong Gate
is right outside the palace.

589
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,860
However,

590
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,580
there are two paths to Qinglong Gate.

591
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,420
Which one should we take?

592
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
Qinglong Gate.

593
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,540
The left path leads to salvation
and the right path leads to death.

594
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:52,700
Young Lady,

595
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,780
lure Baili Dongjun to the right path.

596
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,020
Run!

597
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,180
Baili Dongjun!

598
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,100
You guys should have escaped

599
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,220
without me.

600
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,060
The left path.

601
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,820
You guys go left

602
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,020
and I'll go right.

603
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,100
Let's split up.

604
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,900
We can't let a lady

605
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,980
venture out alone.

606
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,580
I'll go right.

607
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,460
Why don't we...

608
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,100
No.

609
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:25,940
Why not?

610
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,380
Those people...

611
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,900
We have no idea

612
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
where they came from.

613
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,980
They might set up an ambush.

614
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,620
You guys are injured.

615
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,100
I'm still fine.

616
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,060
I'll go right.

617
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,980
Miss, why don't you and Dongjun go left?

618
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,540
Ye Dingzhi and I will go right.

619
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,500
Don't worry.

620
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,940
Even in our current state,

621
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,020
there aren't many people

622
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,300
who can defeat us.

623
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,100
I...

624
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,300
Exactly.

625
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,740
Well...

626
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,620
All right.

627
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,180
Let's go.

628
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,380
See you later.

629
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,100
We should get going too.

630
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,220
It's almost dawn.

631
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:14,980
But...

632
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,980
Why can't we all stick together?

633
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,540
Yin Luoxia seems fishy?

634
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,660
It's only a suspicion.

635
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,740
Before the examination,

636
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,580
I saw her once

637
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,260
at Penglai Pavilion.

638
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,220
At that time,

639
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,300
she looked different.

640
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,580
But

641
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,700
I suppose she decided

642
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,980
to take our side.

643
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:51,860
Ye Dingzhi.

644
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,940
You knew the left path
was the right way.

645
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,260
Why did you choose to go right?

646
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,860
Let me ask you.

647
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,680
By the time the people waiting
on the right path

648
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,500
realized something's amiss,

649
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,780
will they be able to go
to the left path in time?

650
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,260
I wouldn't count on it.

651
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,500
What about Yin Luoxia?

652
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,300
Why not let her take this path?

653
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,260
She betrayed her organization.

654
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,500
She might

655
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,260
meet her end here.

656
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,660
I didn't know

657
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,820
you were such a caring person.

658
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,300
Thanks for the compliment.

659
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,460
I'm handsome and kind.

660
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,020
I couldn't bear

661
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,180
to let our savior die,

662
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,100
that's all.

663
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,620
Right,

664
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,380
since you're Lyu Suzhen's disciple,

665
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,500
why are you taking

666
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,260
the examination?

667
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,260
I was asked to do so.

668
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,260
What about you?

669
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,060
Immovable Lord technique.

670
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,500
You must be the Rain Demon's disciple.

671
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,180
What?

672
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,980
Not content

673
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,020
with being number one in Nanjue?

674
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,940
No.

675
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,540
I want

676
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,180
to visit this city
which is full of talents

677
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,420
and pay respects to Mr. Li.

678
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,780
Full of talents?

679
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,460
It's more like brutally competitive,

680
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,140
am I right?

681
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,300
How long does it usually take
to get from here

682
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,180
to Qinglong Gate?

683
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,780
An hour.

684
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,660
Then we'll keep him busy

685
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,540
for an hour.

686
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,220
I wonder who will

687
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,100
reach there first?

688
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,740
Besides, who will be the disciple?

689
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,020
Are we going to fight?

690
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,860
Baili Dongjun,

691
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,500
how long until we get there?

692
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,620
An hour.

693
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,060
We're too slow.

694
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,500
At this rate,

695
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,260
you'll fail your friend

696
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,860
who risked his life for you.

697
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,420
The first one who gets there
will be the disciple, okay?

698
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,940
You're being unfair.

699
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,700
When it comes to qinggong, I never lose.

700
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:11,940
Are you okay?

701
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,940
I'm taking damage
from the Immovable Lord.

702
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,340
My internal strength

703
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,460
is still recovering.

704
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,700
You expanded
all your internal strength just now.

705
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,020
But your meridians

706
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,180
are still intact.

707
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,500
Such strong meridians...

708
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,660
You're an innate martial artist, too?

709
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,060
What are you talking about?

710
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,220
He's saying
that you're an innate martial artist.

711
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,260
Do you know what it means?

712
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,740
Why don't you...

713
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,060
come with me?

714
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,380
Run.

715
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,260
Wang.

716
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,860
Who are you people?

717
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,580
She...

718
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,220
He looks familiar.

719
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,580
Well...

720
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,100
We...

721
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,060
I'm sorry.

722
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,020
Our servants

723
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,460
tried to run away.

724
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,220
I'm here to reclaim them.

725
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,860
What kind of servants

726
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,660
dress like that?

727
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,060
And there won't be a housekeeper

728
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,860
who has such strong martial arts skills.

729
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,500
Miss, you're asking

730
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,540
too many questions.

731
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,540
You look tired.
Why don't you take a rest?

732
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,020
Off you go.

733
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,660
What did you say?

734
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,540
I said,

735
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,660
leave.

736
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,100
If you insist on saving him,

737
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,860
I'll have to kill you.

738
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,220
We'll see

739
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,580
about that.

740
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,060
That insignia.

741
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,940
You're a Shadow Sect member.

742
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,740
What is this place?

743
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,580
The lord's mansion.

744
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,980
Leave

745
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
or die.

746
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,740
Good job, senior.

747
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,500
You scared him away.

748
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,380
No.

749
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,380
He's very strong.

750
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,980
I'm not sure if I would win.

751
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,660
What scared him away

752
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,540
was your identity.

753
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,340
Wenjun,

754
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,980
you're getting yourself

755
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,700
into big trouble.

756
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:18,820
It's okay.

757
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,340
Senior,

758
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,100
don't tell anyone

759
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,180
about this.

760
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:25,980
Sure.

761
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,540
Are they here yet?

762
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,260
Master.

763
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,060
- Master.
- Master.

764
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,140
We're here.

765
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,140
Those who came

766
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,060
to seek discipleship

767
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,460
used to be more decent

768
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,620
and presentable.

769
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,700
Look at you two.

770
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,340
Far worse.

771
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,660
They did not

772
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,140
have to deal with assassins.

773
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,500
Which one of you

774
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,340
is going to be my disciple?

775
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,380
My name is Yin Luoxia.

776
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,540
It was

777
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,340
due to their protection

778
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,620
that I made it this far.

779
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,060
I don't deserve to be your disciple.

780
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:30,820
Miss Yin...

781
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,140
Baili Dongjun,

782
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,260
this is where I leave you.

783
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,340
Farewell.

784
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,460
Would you be interested
in becoming my disciple?

785
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,580
May I ask why, sir?

786
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,020
Because you're pretty

787
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,140
and shrewd.

788
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,060
I only teach those

789
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,980
with whom I have an affinity.

790
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,620
Why?

791
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,260
My skills

792
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,580
belong to me.

793
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,060
I decide who gets them.

794
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,540
How's that for a reason?

795
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,460
Besides,

796
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,020
your style

797
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,100
is quite compatible with mine,

798
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,580
so there's that.

799
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,260
But I...

800
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,700
Isn't that great, Miss Yin?

801
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,860
Are you kidding me?

802
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,860
Liu Yue, are you really
going to take on disciples?

803
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,740
I'm your senior yet I haven't
accepted any disciples.

804
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,340
By right,

805
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,860
I should have a disciple first.

806
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,820
If you want, you can get one.

807
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,500
But your wife will probably

808
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,540
bury you alive in the Swordheart Grave.

809
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,540
If you're not willing,

810
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,580
I won't force you.

811
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:38,700
No.

812
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,660
It's not that I'm not willing.

813
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,980
Your generosity

814
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
is much appreciated.

815
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,340
It's just that...

816
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,540
I can't bring

817
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,620
Baili Dongjun back now.

818
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,500
Perhaps I should join the Academy first

819
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,620
and plan my next move.

820
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,980
I'm sorry, Liu Yue.

821
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,740
Greetings, Master.

822
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,940
That wasn't so hard, was it?

823
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,020
Hey, kid. What about you?

824
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,220
Me?

825
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,500
Not now.

826
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,700
I'm waiting for someone.

827
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,300
Waiting for someone?

828
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,580
Wang Yixing is Lyu Suzhen's disciple.

829
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,340
He won't take me as his master.

830
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,900
I know that.

831
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,260
But there's still Ye Dingzhi.

832
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,940
He'll be here any moment.

833
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,020
I've heard that name

834
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,100
many times.

835
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,940
Ye Dingzhi...

836
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,380
He sounds really strong.

837
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,460
Stronger than me.

838
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,140
If I choose him,

839
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,900
what will happen to you?

840
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,220
What will happen to me?

841
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,660
I'll

842
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,540
get laughed at

843
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,340
as I ride my horse

844
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,100
back to Qiandong City.

845
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,500
Since you are here first,

846
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,780
I'll give you a chance.

847
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,380
Let me ask you.

848
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,620
If both of you

849
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,700
were right in front of me,

850
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,740
who would I choose?

851
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,100
You should choose us both.

852
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,020
Why?

853
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,660
Because we're both

854
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,420
excellent candidates.

855
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,500
You'll regret

856
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,740
if you reject either of us.

857
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,780
Let me tell you something.

858
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:31,900
People always regret

859
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,500
when they are rejected

860
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,660
by me,

861
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,860
but I never regret

862
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,380
for rejecting someone.

863
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,300
During the preliminary examination,

864
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,380
I made a jug of liquor.

865
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,420
Ye Dingzhi

866
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,620
roasted a lamb leg.

867
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,020
So?

868
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,460
Don't you get it?

869
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,140
Wouldn't it be great

870
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,300
to enjoy meat and liquor

871
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,580
together?

872
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,220
That's true.

873
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,140
That would be

874
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,340
amazing indeed.

875
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,260
I'm the liquor

876
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,380
and Ye Dingzhi is the meat.

877
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,540
Together, we'll be

878
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,140
the best disciples you've ever had.

879
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,100
Good point.

880
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,500
Fine, I'll wait here with you.

881
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,100
I have a feeling

882
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,580
that your title as Eloquent Zhuomo

883
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,940
will soon be stolen

884
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,140
by Baili Dongjun.

885
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,220
Baili Dongjun,

886
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,860
why do you wish to become my disciple?

887
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,940
Good question.

888
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,500
Let me think.

889
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,020
You're only starting

890
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,700
to think

891
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,900
about this question?

892
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,780
When I was little,

893
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,860
I promised someone

894
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,660
we'd see the world

895
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,460
together.

896
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,740
Besides this Academy,

897
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,660
no one could challenge

898
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,020
my father and my grandfather.

899
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,500
Besides, Xiao Ruofeng advised me

900
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,780
to take you as my master,

901
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,580
telling me you are
the best martial artist,

902
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,900
and how amazing

903
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,980
and legendary you are.

904
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,140
So,

905
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,860
even before I came here,

906
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,300
I had thought of myself

907
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,220
as the last disciple

908
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,420
and not

909
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,260
a candidate.

910
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,620
Now, if you ask me

911
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,780
if I want to be your disciple,

912
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:12,660
I think

913
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,180
I'd say yes.

914
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,340
Despite not knowing me all that well?

915
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,100
I used to have a master.

916
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,260
He was the best one

917
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,140
I had ever seen.

918
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,900
Before he died, he told me

919
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,140
to make a jug of Peach Blossom Moonfall

920
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,980
and hang it at the peak of Tianqi City.

921
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,860
He also told me

922
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,580
there was no one stronger than him

923
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,340
besides you, Mr. Li.

924
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,140
So if I were to

925
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,580
have another master,

926
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:56,820
it could only be

927
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,540
you.

928
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,660
Or else it would be

929
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,780
an insult to him.

930
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,260
Sounds like it is you who chose me,

931
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,220
not the other way around.

932
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,300
That's right.

933
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,700
You won't regret training me.

934
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,500
Why?

935
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,540
Because one day,

936
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,260
I'll be famous.

937
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,620
What do you mean

938
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,580
by "famous"?

939
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,780
As famous as your father

940
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,660
and your grandfather?

941
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:20,660
No.

942
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,940
As famous
as the Eight Young Masters of Beili?

943
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,460
No.

944
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,380
No?

945
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,140
How famous do you want to be?

946
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,260
As famous as me?

947
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:33,580
Yes.

948
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:34,740
I like your answer!

949
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:35,860
Whether

950
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,100
Ye Dingzhi makes the cut

951
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,060
or not,

952
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,300
I'm definitely accepting you
as my disciple.

953
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:41,700
All right.

954
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,540
