1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,880

2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Holding onto life and death in the face of danger  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,800
♫  I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,940
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,960
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,500
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,820
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,540
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost   ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,320
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,700

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,320

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,570

23
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,840
Your Highness, don't look at me like that.

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,840
I'm afraid I might fall for you.

26
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,740
Your Highness?

27
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,060
Are you the one whom Ye Dingzhi holds dear,
Yi Wenjun?

28
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,720
Nice to meet you, Miss Yue Yao.

29
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,360
Brother Yun told me that you're the girl Dongjun likes.

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,540
You truly are pretty.

31
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,180
Miss Yi, you're beautiful as well.

32
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,180
Yes.

33
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,300
The kind that... brings disaster to the country.

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,780
Wenjun.

35
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,540
If I had asked around for your whereabouts when I was in Tianqi City back then,

36
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,220
perhaps things wouldn't have ended up this way.

37
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,020
Don't blame yourself.

38
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,120
Dongjun, you've already done enough.

39
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,460
Junior, now is not the time.

40
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,320
I'm heading home.

41
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,500
Let's bid farewell here.

42
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,500
Let me escort you back.

43
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,220
There are too many people who shouldn't be there.

44
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,120
Dongjun, you shouldn't go there either.

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,740
The place you should go to is either the bustling and prosperous Qiandong City

46
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,840
or the romantic Xueyue City.

47
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,600
You've already done more than enough for us.

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,200
If you take this step,

49
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,820
you'll turn everyone against you.

50
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,880
Brother Yun wouldn't wish to see this.

51
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,640
Neither would I.

52
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,200
But Brother Yun cannot die.

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,240
If only I had

54
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,960
convinced him not to take me away, things would be all right.

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,750
If only I had been more determined

56
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,940
when I was in the grass hut.

57
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,980
But there are no ifs.

58
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,040
For everything that has happened, I'm to blame.

59
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,900
- Your Highness, here's some advice— 
 - Senior.

60
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,060
If he calls me that again, kill him.

61
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,860
All right.

62
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,000
How ironic.

63
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,040
The one who eventually kills me is you.

64
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,980
Just like how...

65
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,880
I killed myself when I was still Ye Xiaofan.

66
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,460
Why did you become the head of the demonic sect?

67
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,280
Why did you start the war?

68
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,540
Why?!

69
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,660
Throughout my life,

70
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,980
I seem to have been losing everything I once had.

71
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,440
I can't take this anymore.

72
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,080
Go!

73
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,080
Go.

74
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,540
Head to Nanjue and never come back!

75
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,480
I'll stop them, so go now.

76
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,200
What are you laughing about?

77
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,580
I just feel like it.

78
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:48,030
All of you are so funny.

79
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,700
Forget it.

80
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:57,040
Old Ye, I shouldn’t have left you alone in the prince’s mansion.

81
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,440
You're still a silly boy.

82
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,060
It's not funny now, right?

83
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,220
Take him away with you.

84
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,580
I believe I’m more eloquent than Her Highness

85
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,540
and Yi Wenjun.

86
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,300
Why did you listen to her instead of me?

87
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,760
Because he trusts Yi Wenjun, not you.

88
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,760
You have a point.

89
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,760
 Killing intent. They are going after Brother Yun.

90
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,400
No.

91
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,960
I won't listen to anyone.

92
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,900
It looks like Dongjun has made up his mind.

93
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,980
It's useless.

94
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,460
The ending they desire

95
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,320
is nothing more than a shattered dream, after all

96
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,070
♫  The wind passes through the window frame  ♫

97
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,310
♫  The rain falls gently in the Martial World  ♫

98
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:53,060
♫  The stars change in the misty waves  ♫

99
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:57,070
♫  How many people in the world  ♫

100
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,790
♫  really understand your intentions?  ♫

101
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,720
You're here.

102
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Yes, I'm here.

103
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,420
♫  Wandering freely wherever I please  ♫

104
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,920
I've missed you so much.

105
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
I didn't mean to...

106
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,150
♫  Oh, what feelings  ♫

107
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,519
I know.

108
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,140
If, back then, I had waited a little longer for you...

109
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,660
waited for you to come back and ask me...

110
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,360
It's fine.

111
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
I'm back.

112
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,684
I'm back now.

113
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:49,018
♫  In the wilderness, searching for a melody as sorrow flows in  ♫

114
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:52,320
♫  In the wilderness, searching for a melody as sorrow flows in  ♫

115
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,020
♫  A dream from youth awakens  ♫

116
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,080
How wonderful.

117
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,410
Over the years,

118
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,724
I have imagined our reunion so many times.

119
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,110
But none of them...

120
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,940
compare to this moment with you standing right before me now.

121
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,452
Nothing could be more wonderful than this.

122
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:27,585
♫  These tender feelings have flown far away with the wind  ♫

123
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:31,195
♫  Oh, what feelings  ♫

124
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:37,204
♫  The bold horse prances, kicking up dust  ♫

125
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:43,988
♫  When I start to recall the past again  ♫

126
00:11:43,988 --> 00:11:47,281
♫  Will I still be part of the story?  ♫

127
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:52,544
♫  But how can a hero not roam the lands?  ♫

128
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:57,053
♫  Silently keeping my old love deep in my heart, swallowing the farewell  ♫

129
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:59,490
♫  Silently keeping my old love deep in my heart, swallowing the farewell  ♫

130
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,130
♫  Facing the never ending trials in the martial world  ♫

131
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,100
Wenjun.

132
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,190
I've missed you so much.

133
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,700
Who's there?

134
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,960
Brother Yun, I'm here.

135
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,180
The last time we gathered

136
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,440
was when we listened to the tale of the White Feather Sword Deity.

137
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,120
 Heroes are born in times of turmoil.

138
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,120
 Traveling proudly with a sword and pressing ahead.

139
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,240
 Speaking of which, the White Feather Sword Deity...

140
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,160
 Who in the world can block my blow?

141
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,540
 When he said that, both of your eyes were glowing.

142
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,780
 When I’m 20 and you’re 18, we’ll leave Tianqi together.

143
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,720
 One of us will head north, and the other will head south. We'll travel the Martial World alone.

144
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,820
 By the time we become deities, that's when we'll meet again.

145
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,380
 If you want to be the Sword Deity, I won't compete with you.

146
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,700
 The White Feather Sword Deity's best friend is the Liquor Deity.

147
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,200
 Then, I'll be the Liquor Deity!

148
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,260
 Great. We'll travel the Martial World as the Sword and Liquor Deity!

149
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,820
 Travel the Martial World with a sword and liquor!

150
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,880
Heroes are born in times of turmoil.

151
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,460
 Traveling proudly with a sword and pressing ahead.

152
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,440
 Every individual eventually turns to bones.

153
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,420
 Think of youthful memories with a sigh.

154
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,240
 As the legend goes, the White Feather Sword Deity of the previous dynasty

155
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,680
wielded his sword to cut through the plaque of Tianqi,

156
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,600
 crushing numerous armored armies before leaving the city with his disciple.

157
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:11,860
Seeing his beloved woman and the friend who deserves his lifelong trust at the same time,

158
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,040
the demonic energy in Ye Dingzhi has finally dispelled.

159
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,360
His obsession is finally broken.

160
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,600
He's no longer in the Malevolence Phase.

161
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,680
Isn't that good?

162
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,160
Yes, it is.

163
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,240
But since his obsession is broken, it means he has returned to the Ye Dingzhi he once was.

164
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,040
If the previous Ye Dingzhi finds out what he has done

165
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,140
and the situation his friend and beloved woman are facing,

166
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,800
he won't have a second option.

167
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,140
The path in the martial arts world is long.

168
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,740
Still, there's an end to it.

169
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,400
So long as the dream within stays alive, it'll still reignite one day.

170
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,260
This shall be the end of the tale of the White Feather Sword Deity.

171
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,160
Who will be the next Sword Deity?

172
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,660
I really wish I could turn back time.

173
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,540
- Brother Yun! 
 - Brother Yun!

174
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,960
- Brother Yun! 
 - Brother Yun!

175
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,100
I thought he was a spent force.

176
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,240
I didn't expect his remaining power to be so abundant.

177
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,640
He is dissipating his power.

178
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,844
He's dispersed all of his internal strength.

179
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:25,640
A thought is caught between good and evil.

180
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,400
No matter what, Ye Dingzhi is someone who deserves respect.

181
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,320
Brother Yun!

182
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,380
- Wenjun. 
 - Brother Yun.

183
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,480
After you left, I always feared I would never see you again.

184
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,860
This feeling had been gnawing at me, slowly taking hold.

185
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,840
Brother Yun.

186
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,180
So, I decided to fight with all I had...

187
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,980
to get you out of that place again.

188
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,760
Brother Yun, let's leave this place. Let's go, all right?

189
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,340
But there's something... I must tell you.

190
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:21,300
I never doubted that you would stay with me.

191
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:31,420
Throughout my life, I've never blamed you.

192
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,700
I know.

193
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,940
Dongjun.

194
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:46,660
My child, Anshi, and those who came with me from the ice field,

195
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,020
I’m entrusting them to you.

196
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,180
Brother Yun. Brother Yun...

197
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,320
This life of mine...

198
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,180
should...

199
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,280
be returned to the world.

200
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,290
No!

201
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,880

♫  By the window  ♫

250
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,920
The workings of all phenomena

251
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,720
boil down to the law of cause and effect.

252
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,020
Fate unfolds and concludes in due course.

253
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,580
It's nothing more than this.

254
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,900
 In the late spring of the eighth year of the Mingde era,

255
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,740
 the head of the demonic sect, Ye Dingzhi, died outside Gusu City.

256
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,940
 Seven martial artists joined forces in this battle.

257
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,940
 After Ye Dingzhi's passing, the eldest daughter of the former head disappeared,

258
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,460
 while the youngest took her own life in prison.

259
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,340
 Consequently, the demonic sect became leaderless.

260
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,860
 Thus, the curtain closed on its conquest of the East.

261
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,900
 Simultaneously, in the battle between the South and North, Xiao Ruofeng, Prince Langya,

262
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,180
 and Lei Mengsha, the Chief General, succeeded on their battlegrounds.

263
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,340
 Aside from them, the remaining young masters retired from the Martial World.

264
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,340
 In the early summer of the eighth year of the Mingde era,

265
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,700
 Prince Langya revealed the suspicion in General Dingyuan's treason case

266
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,620
 and overturned it, shocking the imperial court.

267
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,460
 The people mourned the aggrieved General Dingyuan

268
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,820
 and appreciated the benevolent Prince Langya.

269
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,590
 The whole nation united in harmony, and for Beili,

270
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,700
 it ushered in a time of peace and prosperity.

271
00:24:27,188 --> 00:24:31,689

272
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,800
Wenjun.

273
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,380
I suppose I should address you as Sister-in-law.

274
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:59,540
I didn’t expect we would meet again in such a situation, 20 years later.

275
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,660
I wonder what your plans are.

276
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:12,300
The one I worry about most right now is Anshi.

277
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,300
Anshi should be with those in Tian Wai Tian.

278
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,740
Now that Brother Yun is gone, Tian Wai Tian is probably in chaos.

279
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,500
Ye Anshi's identity is sensitive.

280
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,400
I'm afraid he might be in trouble.

281
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,180
Indeed.

282
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,000
I want to look for him.

283
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,240
Given your identity, it's better not to show up before them.

284
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,400
Leave it to me.

285
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,680
You shouldn't have left in the first place.

286
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,120
Baili Dongjun.

287
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,300
Brother Yun didn't blame you.

288
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,820
But I do.

289
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,280
He liked you so much, after all.

290
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,220
Goodbye, Wenjun.

291
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,400
I'll bring your child back to you.

292
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,460
I'll also send those from the ice fields back to their homes.

293
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,980
Everything will be fine.

294
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,860
It's just that...

295
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,380
Brother Yun will never come back.

296
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,220
Yes.

297
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,860
He will never come back.

298
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,940
Grand Eunuch Jinxuan.

299
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,740
Your Highness, perhaps you should listen to my advice.

300
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:43,080
First, the young prince is still in the palace.

301
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,160
Second...

302
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,500
for your other child to live safely,

303
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,900
I'm afraid Baili Dongjun alone may not be enough.

304
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,140
Your Highness, please.

305
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,740
Wenjun!

306
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,480
Wenjun!

307
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,340
The head of the demonic sect is dead.

308
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,740
Surrender his son.

309
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,880
Such audacity.

310
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,580
- Baili Dongjun? 
 -  Baili Dongjun?

311
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,380
Before this sword is pulled out, the demonic sect must not leave the mountain,

312
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,540
and Beili must not go up the mountain.

313
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,980
If anyone disagrees, try me.

314
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,720
Can he be so arrogant after defeating Ye Dingzhi?

315
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,920
That's right. He can be as arrogant as he wants after defeating Ye Dingzhi.

316
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,560
If not, you can try saying that louder.

317
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,419
Is this Brother Yun's child?

318
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:37,580
My name is Ye Anshi.

319
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:43,240
May I know if my father is really dead?

320
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,240
White-Haired Deity.

321
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,120
Come with me.

322
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,340
Yuji.

323
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,600
Baili Dongjun, where's our chief?

324
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,540
He's dead.

325
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,440
Did...

326
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,965
Did you kill him?

327
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,960
What do you think?

328
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,200
Let's negotiate.

329
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,160
Negotiate?

330
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,760
Do we even stand a chance for that?

331
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,500
There is if I say so.

332
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,360
I suppose you know your current situation better than I do.

333
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,920
If this continues, it will serve no purpose other than to sacrifice more lives.

334
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,380
Return to the lands beyond the northern border.

335
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:54,840
At least you can still safeguard your home.

336
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,780
On what condition?

337
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,540
- One person. 
 - You want Young Master?

338
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,360
The chief just passed away, and you want to trade his son for our lives?

339
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,330
Yuji and I chose to follow Ye Dingzhi

340
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,480
because we truly admired him.

341
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,620
Naturally, we'll accept his son.

342
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,800
We'll never betray the Chief and Young Master.

343
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,100
This is our belief.

344
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:27,340
If I ever defy it, I would rather die.

345
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,580
If Ye Anshi follows you back to Tian Wai Tian, what will happen to him?

346
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,480
When your conquest started, Ye Dingzhi was a hero to you all.

347
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,120
But what will happen after his death?

348
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,140
His child is only five.

349
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,020
If he follows you back to the lands beyond the northern borders,

350
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,860
will he become a weapon in a power struggle,

351
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,020
or a subject on whom people vent their anger due to this failure?

352
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,970
Tell me, after returning to the lands beyond the northern borders,

353
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,961
how many years will you and Marquis Purple Robe need to rebuild Tian Wai Tian?

354
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:04,398
And how long before they all pledge their lifelong loyalty to Ye Anshi, as you two have?

355
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,040
Six years.

356
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,880
At least six years.

357
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,400
Twelve years.

358
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,400
I'll give you twelve years.

359
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,800
Today, I, Baili Donjun, make a pact with you.

360
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Within twelve years from today,

361
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,400
no sects from beyond the northern borders shall step into Beili.

362
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Ye Dingzhi's son, Ye Anshi, will be held in Beili.

363
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,300
Until the period is up, he shall not leave.

364
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:56,962
Will you accept this?

365
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,400
I don't believe in Beili,

366
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,300
but I believe in you.

367
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,200
For the next twelve years, with your dedicated tutelage,

368
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,200
I believe Young Master won't let us down.

369
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,500
I'm not qualified to teach him.

370
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,700
He has a better master.

371
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,500
Who is it?

372
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,800
An old acquaintance.

373
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,200
This blade will serve as the token.

374
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,500
Assemble all your members remaining in Beili.

375
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,400
Have them store their blades and leave immediately.

376
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:43,800
If there's any trace of them in Beili after 15 days, I'll kill them myself.

377
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,960
This...

378
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,600
Young Master Baili, this decision...

379
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,300
This decision is made by Xueyue City.

380
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,200
Lei Fortress, Wen Family, Tang Sect, Heavenly Mountain Sect, Mount Wangcheng,

381
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,000
and Dark River have all agreed to it.

382
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,600
Are there any objections?

383
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,800
No, not at all.

384
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,280
Uncle Zi, I don't want to leave.

385
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Good boy, don't be afraid.

386
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,400
Child.

387
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,200
Do you still remember your home?

388
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
No.

389
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,700
You weren't there when your father left.

390
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,600
Now, I'll take you to pay your respects to him, all right?

391
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,300
Does that mean I can never return here after that?

392
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,560
The word "return" means a lot.

393
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,820
Wherever your home is, that's where you should return to.

394
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,400
Uncle Mo.

395
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,100
Come here.

396
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,100
Be good and listen to Uncle Baili.

397
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,400
Wait for us to come get you.

398
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,800
You'll be 17 then.

399
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,200
At that time, we'll bring everyone from Tian Wai Tian

400
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,000
to welcome you to the lands beyond the northern borders.

401
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,900
On that day,

402
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,300
you will be our true Young Master.

403
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,480
Twelve years. That's a long time, right?

404
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,200
It'll pass quickly.

405
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,100
Close your eyes, and when you open them again, twelve years will have passed.

406
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,100
Life is fleeting, after all.

407
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,900

408
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,820
Third City Lord.

409
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,640
Third City Lord.

410
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,800
What do you want from me?

411
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,800
- Why won't you let me out? 
 - Because only you can govern this city.

412
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,200
Why do I have to do everything here?

413
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,500
Because you're a married man.

414
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,100
So what if I'm married?

415
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,800
So what if I have a family?

416
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,500
I was born free, and I’ll leave free. Nothing can constrain me.

417
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,900
So, are you saying it's your family's fault?

418
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,900
My dear, what brings you here?

419
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,300
It’s only been a short while, but I’ve already missed you so much.

420
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,320
What did you just say?

421
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,000
Nothing. I was talking nonsense.

422
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,300
I'll deal with you when we get home.

423
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Watch your step, my dear.

424
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,700
Are we leaving just like this?

425
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,700
You just got back.

426
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,700
We'd better slip off before they notice us.

427
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,400
- Where are we going, then? 
 - Back to Qiandong City.

428
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,100
Why Qiandong City?

429
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,600
I thought you were going to roam the Martial World.

430
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Why is home your first leg of the journey?

431
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,100
Because I want to marry you.

432
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,700
Naturally, I have to go home and hold a wedding ceremony.

00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,500
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

483
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,400
♫  I met you  ♫

484
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:06,400
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

485
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:14,200
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

486
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:23,600
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

487
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:31,800
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

488
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,100
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

489
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,600
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

490
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,800
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

491
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,400
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

492
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,800
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

493
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,800
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

494
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,400
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

495
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,800
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

496
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,300
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

497
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,600
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

498
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,300
♫  I met you  ♫
