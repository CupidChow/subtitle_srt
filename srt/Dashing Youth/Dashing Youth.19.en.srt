26

the Xiao Family's
imperial sword technique,

27
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,060
the Lieguo Sword Technique?

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,900
I'm afraid not.

29
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,420
He's not good

30
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,380
at the Lieguo Sword Technique.

31
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,020
I do know a sword technique

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,020
called the second-best sword technique,

33
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,300
and its my own creation.

34
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,980
Back then, I was thinking

35
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,900
that if I claimed to be second best,

36
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,540
no one would claim to be the best.

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,020
But, he still couldn't

38
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,900
master that as well.

39
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,300
So he went back home

40
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,540
and created another sword technique,

41
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,620
the third-best sword technique.

42
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,460
That's right.

43
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,460
The third-best sword technique.

44
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,460
Out of all the best sword techniques,

45
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,060
Mine is second only to Mr. Li's,

46
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,620
so my sword technique is called
the third-best sword technique.

47
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,820
You call it
the third-best sword technique?

48
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,260
Nice.

49
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,540

58
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,500
you called my name loudly just now

59
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,060
to ask me

60
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,980
to help you, right?

61
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,580

62
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,380
to escape with Master!

63
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,900

can kill you.

150 years ago,

97
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,980
I was the one

98
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,940

110
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,980

112
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,500

174
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,460
is pretty impressive too.

175
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,060
As for the one standing behind there,

176
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,980
forget about him.

177
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,460
He's too special.

178
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,700
I understand.

179
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,300
Alright, you may also leave now.

180
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,980
There's somewhere I need to go.

181
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,860
I'll write you a letter.

182
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,300
If you want to,

183
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,220
you can join us.

184
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,220
Who knows, we can have

185
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,460
a round of drinks.

186

187
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,460
Was there any truth

188
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,500
in what you said earlier?

189
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Why do I feel

190
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,700
that this might be

191
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,420
the last time I see you?

192
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,460
Are you an idiot?

193
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,300
When have I ever deceived you?

194
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,180
You just don't trust me.

195
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,620
I told you

196
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,980
that I drank with the Poetry Deity,

197
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,620
and you

198
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,860
turned your backs and rolled your eyes.

199
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,220
You think I didn't notice?

200
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,220
Okay.

201
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,580
I hope that this time,

202
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,460
you're not bluffing us.

203
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,820
Farewell.

204
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,300
Baili Dongjun.

205
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,220
Master.

206
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,340
Master, don't move.

207
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,820
You don't move.

208
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,780
Help me back to the carriage.

209
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:30,940
Yes, Master.

210
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,060
Carry me on your back.

211
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,380
Martial Uncle Baili,

212
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,380
why has Mr. Li turned young?

213
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,100
Let's get back to the carriage first.

214
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,020
What happened to him?

215
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,740
Ji Ruofeng was right.

216
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,860
I am losing

217
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,340
all my internal strength.

218
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,700
Too bad he came late

219
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:12,980
and couldn't witness

220
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,420
such a magnificent sight.

221
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,980
Now, even you can easily

222
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,300
kill me,

223
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,500
the best martial artist in the world.

224
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,820
What exactly is going on?

225
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,900
What's going on?

226
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,980
You'll know someday.

227
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,260
Don't worry about me.

228
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,860
I'm just feeling a little weak.

229
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,260
I'm not dying.

230
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,300
Now,

231
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,700
I just want to get some sleep.

232
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,260
Master,

233
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,300
don't sleep.

234
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,740
You'd never wake up, then.

235
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,020
Right now, all I want

236
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,460
is to get a good sleep.

237
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,020
Master, believe me.

238
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,020
You can't fall asleep.

239
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,380
Believe me.

240
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,180
This is not the first time.

241
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,060
Just head westward

242
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,180
and I'll be awake in the morning.

243
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,660
Please do me this favor.

244
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,900
Master.

245
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,780
Master.

246
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,940
[Nanjue]

247
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,860
Have you heard?

248
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,780
The Rain Demon and his disciple

249
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,860
have been traveling
around almost half of Nanjue.

250
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,580
That demon

251
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,220
seems to be heading

252
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,420
to Dongyue Lake

253
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,980
to challenge some sword deity.

254
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,940
I heard lots of martial arts masters

255
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,540
have been there.

256
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,900
Back then the Poetry Deity could kill
one man within every ten steps he took

257
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,060
with no trace to be found
for a thousand li.

258
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,420
Now, the Rain Demon

259
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,620
keeps his sword sheathed,

260
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,660
traveling far just to fight.

261
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,580
I wonder

262
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,820
if he'll become a future legend.

263
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,620
How literary of you.

264
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,700
But, I did hear

265
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,540
that the Rain Demon

266
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,420
has been countering attacks
throughout his journey,

267
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,700
but has never killed
any of his assailants.

268
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,740
Only fighting, and not killing?

269
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,180
Has that demon truly changed?

270
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,220
Come on.

271
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,020
Master, you hear that?

272
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,140
You're stirring

273
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,340
quite a lot of commotion.

274
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,820
All that's left is to put a flag on you

275
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,300
that says, "The Rain Demon is here".

276
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,380
But, Master,

277
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,460
if this keeps up,

278
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,340
are you sure we won't die of exhaustion

279
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,380
before we reach Dongyue Lake?

280
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,020
Before you kill someone,
you need to sharpen your sword.

281
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,620
What is it?

282
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,180
It's that old geezer, Chen.

283
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,300
It's the Rain Demon.

284
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,140
Ye, go hide in the woods.

285
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,180
I'm going to fight him.

286
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,620
Is he powerful?

287
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,340
He is known as Elder Tianxuan,
Nanjue's martial arts master.

288
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,820
It would be so easy for him to kill you.

289
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,300
He's still no match for you, then.

290
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,300
It'd be much easier for you to do that.

291
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,660
Rain Demon.

292
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,660
It's been seven years

293
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,820
since we last met.

294
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,620
You are a martial arts master

295
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,540
and I am a demonic sword deity.

296
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,020
If fighting is the only thing we can do,

297
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,700
we might as well not meet.

298
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,620
Heed my advice.

299
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,340
Turn back.

300
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,900
Who do you think you are?

301
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,140
Who are you to persuade me?

302
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,580
Would Li Changsheng heed your advice?

303
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,460
I even dare to fight Li Changsheng.

304
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,700
Who do you think you are

305
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,420
to give me advice?

306
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,180
You've been winning fights,
but not killing.

307
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,740
You rely on natural forces

308
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,540
like water, flowers

309
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,420
and leaves to fight,

310
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,860
but you haven't been using your sword.

311
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,100
You're storing your sword qi,
aren't you?

312
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,940
When you have enough sword qi

313
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,700
and murderous intent,

314
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,500
one single blow from your sword

315
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,940
would be enough
to turn the world upside down.

316
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,580
Do you think

317
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,140
that you're clever

318
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,500
and that you can see things

319
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,020
other people can't see?

320
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,180
If I attack you,

321
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,660
can you guarantee
that you won't have to unsheathe

322
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,780
your Mystic Wind Sword?

323
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,740
If you unsheathe your sword now,

324
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,380
all the sword qi

325
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,420
that you've been storing

326
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,740
would go to waste.

327
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,460
You old geezer.

328
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,260
You haven't been wasting

329
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,780
all these years of living after all.

330
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,300
All these years,

331
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,020
Beili has been relying on Mr. Li

332
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,140
to dominate Nanjue.

333
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,340
It's true that Nanjue's martial arts

334
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,380
can't compare to Beili's.

335
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,940
If you

336
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,860
insist on battling Yan Lingxia,

337
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,500
no matter who wins,

338
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,500
both of you are bound to take damage.

339
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,980
Nanjue's martial arts
will be in a precarious position.

340
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,060
Thus,

341
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,060
heed my advice.

342
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,740
Turn back.

343
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,780
You're using Nanjue
as an excuse to stop me?

344
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,420
Nanjue means nothing to me.

345
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,540
Anyone who stops me

346
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,980
will die in my hands.

347
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,180
If you attack me,
I will unsheathe my sword.

348
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,540
And when I unsheathe my sword,

349
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,060
you will die.

350
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,180
Why?

351
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:54,820
Scared?

352
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,860
Don't think that being old

353
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,420
gives you the moral high ground

354
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,460
to talk me down.

355
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,540
People like you

356
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,460
shouldn't even be alive by now.

357
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,300
So

358
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,700
you're going against the odds?

359
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,860
Just for the title

360
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,980
of the best martial artist in the world?

361
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,140
Starting from today,

362
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Elder Tianxuan

363
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,460
is nothing more than an old geezer.

364
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,900
Good morning, Mr. Li.

365
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,380
Morning.

366
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,380
Yesterday,

367
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,740
I was still the best martial artist
in the world.

368
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,220
And today, I can't even

369
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
pluck a fruit from the tree branch.

370
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,340
That smells great.

371
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,980
Master, you're awake?

372
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,580
Are you training?

373
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,020
These fruits smell so nice.

374
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,780
What a sweet scent.

375
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,300
Martial Uncle Baili, what are you doing?

376
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,500
Having some fruits.

377
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,180
Time for breakfast.

378
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,620
Time for breakfast, Master.

379
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,700
What?

380
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,060
You're eating

381
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,900
without me?

382
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,980
Here, Master.

383
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,100
It's too dry.

384
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,820
I can't swallow that.

385
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,820
Dongjun,

386
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,620
wouldn't you say
that the fruits on the trees

387
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,780
taste absolutely delectable?

388
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,940
You've been peeking at me?

389
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,620
You can only ask one question.

390
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,060
Are you sure that's your question?

391
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,060
Of course, I've prepared some for you.

392
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,540
That's more like it.

393
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,700
What do you want to ask?

394
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,700
Master.

395
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,940
Are you really a deity?

396
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,340
What deity?

397
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,540
Someone who travels
through Heaven and Earth

398
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,300
and can live forever.

399
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,780
I may be good at qinggong,

400
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,460
but I could never leap
across a mountain.

401
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,820
No matter how strong
my internal strength is,

402
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,620
I can only

403
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,140
send a river crashing at most.

404
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,100
As for swordsmanship,

405
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,780
I guess I'm one

406
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,380
of the best swordsmen.

407
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,180
But, if you want me

408
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,500
to kill ten thousand people in one go,

409
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
my sword would've
already snapped in half.

410
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,420
And that's not good enough
to be a deity?

411
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,940
If that doesn't make you a deity,

412
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,540
what about you regaining youth?

413
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,460
You're over 180 years old.

414
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,460
Which normal person

415
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,580
could live that long?

416
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,100
Besides, you got younger

417
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,100
suddenly,

418
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,860
and now you look even younger than I am.

419
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,340
Other than the white hair.

420
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,500
Fine.

421
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,420
I'll talk about it.

422
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,140
Actually, it wasn't a big deal.

423
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,780
When I was young,

424
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,980
I went to Huanglong Mountain

425
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,140
and learned a formidable skill.

426
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,900
It wasn't

427
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,620
an easy skill to master,

428
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,020
and it went by the name

429
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,980
Chun.

430
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,700
Chun?

431
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,660
The Chun is an ancient tree

432
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,820
which has a spring and autumn

433
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,340
each of eight thousand years' duration.

434
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,460
What Zhuangzi wrote in Wandering at Ease

435
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,860
is the meaning of Chun.

436
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,060
Once you master the art of Chun,

437
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,620
you can regain youth every 30 years.

438
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:49,820
And during the year

439
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,300
you become young again,

440
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,140
you will lose all your powers,

441
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,500
and you need to train all over again.

442
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,740
If I were still in Tianqi now,

443
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,220
my secret would have been exposed.

444
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,220
There are too many eyes
and too much gossip

445
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,180
in Tianqi,

446
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,180
so I had to leave.

447
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,500
That's why I...

448
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,580
That's why you got me

449
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,660
and Luoxia

450
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,180
to follow you

451
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,220
so we could protect you.

452
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,100
Looks like

453
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,700
you're not that useless after all.

454
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,140
But, Mr. Li,

455
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,020
why us?

456
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,220
Yes.

457
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,700
Out of all your disciples,

458
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,780
we're the weakest

459
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,100
and least experienced.

460
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,380
Ji Ruofeng was right.

461
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,220
Since the cycle restarts every 30 years,

462
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,820
then I have to use

463
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,780
a new identity every 30 years.

464
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,820
If they keep

465
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,980
staying by my side,

466
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,420
then I could only remain
as Li Changsheng

467
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,500
because we've spent
so much time together.

468
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,900
And there are too many things

469
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,460
that we can't let go.

470
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,980
I don't want that to happen.

471
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,900
So I brought you along.

472
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,740
As for you,

473
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,540
it was your master who came to beg me.

474
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,500
Someone like your master

475
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,740
would actually beg me

476
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,780
for a mere disciple.

477
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,460
Interesting.

478
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,780
Speaking of which,

479
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660
both of you should stop

480
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,900
calling me Mr. Li.

481
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,740
Why?

482
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,700
Because

483
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,460
the 30 years that belonged
to Li Changsheng

484
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,340
have ended.

485
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,020
Tell me,

486
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,620
what kind of name

487
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,780
should I get for my next life?

488
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,180
Maybe a surname

489
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,660
with two syllables like yours.

490
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,060
Maybe Yuchi.

491
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,260
Or Ouyang,

492
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,940
Shangguan, Sima?

493
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,940
Sima...

494
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,820
Nangong?

495
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,460
What?

496
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,460
I just thought

497
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,780
that the surname Nangong suits you now.

498
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
Nangong?

499
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:02,820
Very well!

500
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,660
Nangong.

501
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,380
And what will your first name be?

502
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,700
Mr. Li may have run the Academy,

503
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,260
but he doesn't

504
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,660
look like a scholar at all.

505
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,060
He can be wild and unrestrained.

506
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,620
This life,

507
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,340
I want to be a genteel scholar,

508
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,300
flowing gracefully
like the spring water.

509
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,220
As gentle as the spring water.

510
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,300
Chunshui...
[*Spring water]

511
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,180
Chunshui.

512
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,220
Nangong Chunshui.

513
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,300
It's settled, then.

514
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,500
Nangong Chunshui.

515
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,580
That's it?

516
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,580
Giving yourself a name
shouldn't take much effort.

517
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,740
From now on,

518
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,740
just call me Nangong

519
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,260
or Chunshui.

520
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,340
Either one will do.

521
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,580
If anyone asks,

522
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,820
just tell them

523
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,580
that I'm a friend that you met

524
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,580
during your travels,

525
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,780
understand?

526
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,940
- Yes.
- Yes.

527
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,420
Great.

528
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,060
By the way, Mas...

529
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,140
Nangong Chunshui.

530
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,660
Chunshui.

531
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,860
Where are we

532
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
heading next?

533
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,300
There is a city

534
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,100
known for its romance

535
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,220
and beauty.

536
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,460
[Xueyue City]
Here it is, Xueyue City.

537
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,220
- Xueyue City?
- Xueyue City?

538
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:34,980
That's right.

539
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,140
It's surrounded by a pleasant breeze,
bountiful flowers,

540
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,620
snowy mountains,
and bathed in moonlight.

541
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,420
To get to Xueyue City,

542
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,780
we need to go through Dengtian Pavilion.

543
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,060
Beyond the pavilion
is nothing but a mortal world.

544
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,900
But once you reach
the top of the pavilion,

545
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,500
you will witness

546
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,540
what beauty truly means.

547
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,740
It will be a long journey.

548
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,180
We can take this opportunity
to travel around the world.

549
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,220
Chunshui,

550
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,740
does Xueyue City really exist?

551
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,100
Are you just

552
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,340
making it up?

553
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,020
I've never heard of it.

554
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,860
There are many things
that you've never heard of.

555
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,380
Anything can happen
in this wild and wide world.

556
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,900
Even the Emperor of Beili

557
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,500
doesn't even know

558
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,900
how many cities

559
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,060
there are in this world,

560
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,780
let alone you.

561
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,940
As for that sword technique
your master taught you,

562
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,060
Sword Dance Amidst the Mist and Clouds,

563
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,420
I taught him that

564
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,420
when he just became my disciple.

565
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,380
Now that he has taught you that,

566
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,820
I see that it suits you.

567
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,380
Keep practicing.

568
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,020
Ask me if you have any questions.

569
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,660
Thank you, Chunshui.

570
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,340
By the way,

571
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,660
forget about what your master does

572
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,980
when showing up.

573
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,900
That is embarrassing.

574
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,540
Oh my.

575
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,260
Yes.

576
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:55,980
Then, don't tell

577
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,980
my master.

578
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:57,980
Don't worry.

579
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,380
As for you...

580
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,980
What about me?

581
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,780
Are you still trying

582
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,100
to teach me martial arts,

583
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,620
given your current state?

584
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,980
I may have lost my powers,

585
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,660
but the techniques

586
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,820
are imprinted in my mind.

587
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,340
As for you,

588
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,060
you have
such incredible internal strength,

589
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,380
peerless swordsmanship,

590
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,220
and a body

591
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,340
strengthened by medicinal liquor,

592
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,660
but why are you

593
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,060
still so weak?

594
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,460
Teach me if you must,

595
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,740
but don't insult me.

596
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,940
Think about it.

597
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,540
If someone

598
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,060
can't walk,

599
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,980
yet he knows how to fly.

600
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,660
How high and far

601
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,900
do you think he can fly?

602
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,260
Take this.

603
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,940
What's this?

604
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,740

Are you sure

613
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,420
this is a manual
of peerless martial arts?

614
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,180
Isn't this

615
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,580
a random cheap book from the roadside?

616
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,460
I had a friend

617
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,500
who only learned

618
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,100
from this random cheap book
bought from the roadside.

619
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,220
That sword technique looks dumb.

620
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,860
Why are you still practicing it?

621
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,940
Because I'm poor

622
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,860
and all I could afford

623
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,740
was that manual.

624
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,540
How long have you been practicing?

625
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,540
I've been practicing since five,

626
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,660
so it's been 17 years.

627
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,620
I have to say this, though.

628
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,100
Even the most mediocre sword technique

629
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,740
can reveal its true essence

630
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,140
once you practice it thousands of times.

631
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,140
As they say, even tiny grains of sand
can form a majestic tower

632
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,460
and water constantly
dripping wears holes in stone.

633
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,100
Even tiny grains of sand
can form a majestic tower.

634
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,220
and water constantly
dripping wears holes in stone?

635
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,820
Why does that sound

636
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,060
so self-delusional?

637
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,180
By the way,

638
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,140
what happened to him afterward?

639
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,620
He must have been

640
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,340
a nobody for life.

641
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,780
A nobody?

642
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,180
That friend of mine

643
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
created a peerless sword technique

644
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,260
based on these mediocre

645
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,300
sword techniques.

646
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,660
He named his sword technique

647
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,140
Lieguo.

648
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,740
Lieguo?

649
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,580
Isn't that the Xiao Family's

650
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,460
inherited sword technique?

651
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,180
Exactly.

652
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,940
That friend of mine

653
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,260
was the man

654
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,580
who wielded
the ultimate sword, Tianzhan,

655
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,540
had thousands of soldiers
under his command,

656
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,940
subsequently building his own empire

657
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,060

making this story up?

00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,100
Believe it or not, it's your choice.

663

What he's

664
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,180

665
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,620
your Western Chu's Sword Song

666
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,020
but there are

many other incredible sword techniques.

668
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,020
In fact, some of them are too delicate

669
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,380
to the point that it's hard
to unleash its power.

into the most magnificent technique.

677
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:56,940

Luoxia.

684
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,820
What are you thinking?

685
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,500
You seem engrossed.

686
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,940
Nothing.

687
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,060
Maybe I'm just tired.

688
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,820
You're tired?

689
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,540
Chunshui,

690
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
we're going to take a break

691
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,100
at the creek ahead.

692
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,220

Chunshui.

697
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,260
I...

698
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,540
I'm going to get some wild fruits.

699
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,260
Why don't I go instead?

700
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,140
You shouldn't be

701
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,020
doing such work.

702
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:32,860
Martial Uncle Baili,

703
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,660
you're more powerful than me,

704
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,260
so it's better that you stay

705
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,220
and guard Chunshui.

706
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Well,

707
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,660
thank you.

708
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,060
Come back soon.

709
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:43,580
Alright.

710
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,220
Why don't I

711
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,460
create my own sword technique?

712
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,180
It'd be better
than this mediocre sword technique.

713
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,860
I've told you countless times.

714
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,980
This is not a mediocre sword technique.

715
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,060
Someone once turned it

716
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,940
into a sword technique
worthy of a sword deity.

717
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,060
He had practiced for 19 years

718
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,020
before he became famous.

719
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,420
I don't have that much time to wait.

720
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,980
I'd be almost 40 by then.

721
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,180
What's the point?

722
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,660
Are you

723
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,700
so desperate to become famous?

724
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,420
Of course.

725
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,900
I made a promise.

726
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,660
She said

727
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,860
she would come and find me

728
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,940
when I became famous.

729
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,180
So

730
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,180
I can't make her wait.

731
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,980
Women.

732
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,380
She is not an ordinary woman.

733
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,180
She's the prettiest lady in my heart.

734
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,220
Of course,

735
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,340
I've only met her twice,

736
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,340
so I wouldn't say we're in love.

737
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,460
But I believe

738
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,180
that when I become famous

739
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,740
and meet her again,

740
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,100
that will be the true beginning

741
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,460
of our story.

742
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,740
What if you realize

743
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,660
that she's not a good person?

744
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,660
What do you mean by that?

745
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,620
I mean,

746
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,260
what if the girl you fancy

747
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,380
and the way you met

748
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,740
were actually staged,

749
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,580
and what you presume
as love at first sight

750
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,980
may have been her plan

751
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,940
all along?

752
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,060
You must be joking.

753
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,700
Even if she could arrange our encounter,

754
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,220
how could she predict
my feelings for her?

755
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,060
Only I

756
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,220
can decide

757
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,260
whether I can

758
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,140
fall in love with someone
at first sight.

759
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,900
What if you are on the different sides

760
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,740
and the general public
sees her as an evil person?

761
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,180
I would love only her,

762
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,900
not the general public

763
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,660
or her position.

764
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,700
Well said.

765
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,660
But what if she's an atrocious demon

766
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,460
who kills the innocent?

767
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,340
I can accept your previous presumptions,

768
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,060
but not the last one.

769
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,340
That's because the girl I fancy

770
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,460
would never

771
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,780
be like what you described.

772
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,060
Are you that certain?

773
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,740
That's because she has a pure gaze

774
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,700
nestled between her elegant brows.

775
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,580
I read

776
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,140
that one's looks
reflects one's personality.

777
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,540
That's why...

778
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,340
she would never be like that.

779
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,900
19 Embroidery Sword Techniques.

780
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,300
I've finished practicing

781
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,580
all 19 moves.

782
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,900
Li Changsheng.

783
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,100
You've taken in a nice disciple.

784
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,340
Qing.

785
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,780
Yao.

786
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
Why have you come here?

787
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,940
I came to meet you.

788
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,140
Yao.

789
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,220
Is that man with you

790
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,100
Baili Dongjun, who made you give up

791
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,980
on restoring our nation?

792
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:28,580
Qing.

793
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,700
I have never given up
on restoring our nation,

794
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,380
or even let Baili Dongjun make me

795
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,420
- give up...
- I understand.

796
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,300
I understand.

797
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,220
You're just trying

798
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,260
to avoid another battle.

799
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,980
I know about that.

800
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,020
- Qing...
- Yao.

801
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,580
I do understand everything.

802
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,380
Yao, let's not talk about that.

803
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,820
I've heard

804
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,900
that you're traveling
with the best martial artist,

805
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,980
Li Changsheng.

806
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,580
I'd love to see him in person.

807
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,900
Where is he?

808
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,580
He...

809
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,220
He has something to attend to,

810
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,220
so he's gone somewhere else.

811
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,940
I see.

812
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,020
Yao,

813
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,180
is it inconvenient for you

814
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,980
to separate from your group?

815
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,260
Head back now.

816
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,980
I need to go, too.

817
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,460
Yao, I'm leaving.

818
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,540
Qing.

819
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,380
I still

820
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,540
owe everyone an explanation.

821
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,580
Once I settle everything here,

822
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,460
I will accept my punishment
at Sky's Beyond.

823
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,980
Have you found the other path

824
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,660
that you mentioned before?

825
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,060
I am somehow

826
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,380
aware of it.

827
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,500
That's good.

828
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,300
Whether I get to join

829
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,900
your journey or not,

830
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,940
I hope that all your wishes

831
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,860
can be fulfilled.

832
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,860
Also,

833
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,780
no matter what happens,

834
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,300
I will

835
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,940
never harm you, not even a bit.

836
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,900
Second Young Lady, did you come here

837
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,060
just to meet

838
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,140
your sister?

839
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,500
Of course not.

840
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,740
Even if Yue Yao can't take
Baili Dongjun back,

841
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,420
it's fine.

842
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:08,940
I will...

843
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,820
definitely take Ye Dingzhi back.

844
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,810

during the filming of this drama.]
