However, you now carry
the worries of middle age,

Most liquors offer a single flavor,

180

It carries no earthly flavors.

Is Dongjun's liquor

189
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,620
truly that extraordinary?

190
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,860
That's too much exaggeration,
young man.

191

Serve your liquor.

192
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,380

205
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,020

215

Never.

How good is it?

228
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,500
It feels like

229
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,940
I've returned to my youth

230
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,700
which was full of romantic dreams.

231
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,380
Before those romantic settings,

232
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,140
I was filled with confidence

233
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,660
and determination to achieve my goals.

234
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,260
Is it really that incredible?

235
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,260
This liquor...

236
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,180
You brought me to Tianqi

237
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,660
and showed me

238
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,940
the vastness of the world.

239
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,300
I have no way to repay your kindness.

240
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,980
The taste of your liquor is comparable

241
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,820
to the other two.

242
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,420
But

243
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,700
I've added

244
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,980
something special for you.

245
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,180
Why is

246
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,220
Ruofeng's head steaming?

247
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,340
That's not steam.

248
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,180
It's zhenqi.

249
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,100
Zhenqi?

250
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,780
Zhenqi is a form of qi.

251
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,340
Logically,

252
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,580
it is supposed to be invisible

253
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,580
and

254
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,340
we can only feel it

255
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,140
when it's flowing in our bodies.

256
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,700
I've never heard

257
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,700
of it being visible to the naked eye.

258
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,140
When all sanmei zhenqi are perfected,

259
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,900
the heart refined
through countless trials is now pure.

260
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,340
Achieving such refined zhenqi

261
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,620
that it becomes visible

262
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,540
is extremely rare.

263
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,260
But it doesn't mean there's none.

264
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,980
Usually, it happens

265
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,380
when one breaks through a phase.

266
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,180
He's having a breakthrough?

267
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,580

270

with no method to advance.

271
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,140
Your liquor had helped me with that.

worldly pleasures?

in the celestial palace.

So I'll give you some Qiulubai.

376
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:38,980
Thank you.

377
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,540
We will definitely meet again

378
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,820
because when that time comes,

379
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,380
I will have made a name for myself
across the world.

380
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,820
All right. So will I.

381
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,100
Farewell.

382
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,020
Farewell.

383
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,460
Come on. We have to go now.

384
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,380
Spear Deity,

385
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,220
see you.

386
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,460
Across the distant horizon,

387
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,780
we will meet again!

388
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,900
It's truly the scent of peach blossoms.

389
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,660
Luoxia, smell it.

390
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,380
Not bad.

391
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,060
Master,

392
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,540
where is the highest place

393
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,140
in Tianqi City?

394
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,260
The Royal Academy 32nd Division,

395
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,380
Immortal's Guidance Pavilion.

396
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,100
All right. Let's go there.

397
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,620
As you command, Dongjun.

398
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,540
If Heaven didn't love liquor,

399
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,380
the immortal would not reside there.

400
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,340
If Earth didn't cherish liquor,

401
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,020
there would be no spring
of liquor on Earth.

402
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,580
Since both Heaven and Earth love liquor,

403
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,620
it is fitting that liquor is revered.

404
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,820
The purest liquor surpasses
even the divine,

405
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,020
while the murkier types
are like wise men.

406
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,740
Since the sages and saints
have partaken,

407
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,980
they have become wandering immortals.

408
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,020
One walks the great path
with a cup of liquor

409
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,660
toasting to the land and mountains.

410
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,940
Yet, understanding the joys of liquor,

411
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,940
it is difficult to explain
to the sober ones.

412
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,340
Mr. Li, this horse is fast.

413
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,580
This is Liefeng.

414
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,100
My Liefeng?

415
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,380
Impossible.

416
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,780
My horse is red.

417
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,500
Master, your horse is white.

418
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,420
I painted it myself.

419
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,660
Master.

420
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,540
A white-clad, white-haired person
on a white horse.

421
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,340
That's the true appearance
of an immortal.

422
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,860
I'm a fallen immortal,

423
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,220
how can I bow to the mortal world?

424
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,940
Mr. Li's demeanor is indeed

425
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,180
as enchanting as ever.

426
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,380
Try this.

427
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,620
Does it look good on me?

428
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,060
Yes, it does.

429
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,740
Are you tired?

430
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,180
Not at all.

431
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,740
Look at all this sweat.

432
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,420
Thank you, my dear.

433
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,220
Yan, slow down.

434
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,340
- Mother.
- What did you see?

435
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,420
Father.

436
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,340
Soft candy. It looks delicious.

437
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,140
All right. Do you want this one?

438
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,900
So

439
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,740
this is

440
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,180
what Beili's Tianqi City truly is.

441
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,580
A city of unparalleled glory

442
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,100
and splendor.

443
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,700
It's the greatest city in the world.

444
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,900
I used to think

445
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,980
it was just a city,

446
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,060
and leaving it wouldn't matter much.

447
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,140
But now, it seems there are still

448
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,860
many places left

449
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,100
to explore.

450
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,300
What do you think?

451
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,580
Luoxia.

452
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,820
Why... Why are you crying?

453
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,580
I wasn't.

454
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,980
If you really don't want to leave,

455
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,980
I can come back with you.

456
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,300
That's right.

457
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,140
We're not saying we won't return.

458
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,500
Next time we come back,

459
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,580
I'll have the Emperor himself come out

460
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,420
to greet you.

461
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,460
Dongjun, we've arrived.

462
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,700
Look.

463
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,060
That's the Immortal's Guidance Pavilion.

464
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,700
During major festivals,

465
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,900
they hang

466
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,060
the Xiao Family's divine bird flag.

467
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,580
The wind makes the flag flutter

468
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,740
almost as if
it could tear through the sky.

469
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,180
That's the highest point

470
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,140
in Tianqi City.

471
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,900

Go to Tianqi City for me.

475
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,900
Brew a jug of Peach Blossom Moonfall

00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,220

How is it?

496
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,420
After Mr. Li took

497
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,460
Marquis Zhenxi's only grandson,
Baili Dongjun,

498
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,660
for a ride around Tianqi City,

499
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,140
they left the city.

500
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,940
Anything else?

501
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,060
The head of Shanjian Academy, Chen Ru,

502
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,540
visited the Jixia Academy

503
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,420
and claimed

504
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,900
to be the new chancellor.

505
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,820
Appointing officials
is a matter of the court.

506
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,780
How can someone self-appoint
as an official?

507
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,820
What else?

508
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,860
Your Majesty, that's all.

509
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,300
Since he left,

510
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,180
so be it.

511
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,660
What about Chen Ru?

512
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,340
Does the Court of Judicial Review

513
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,220
also handle appointments too?

514
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,060
No.

515
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,380
Just appoint him as the chancellor.

516
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,460
Second Young Lady.

517
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,500
Where's Yao?

518
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:47,900
Why didn't she come back

519
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,740
with you?

520
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,660
She is delayed by some engagement
on the way back.

521
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,380
Lord Wuxiang said

522
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,940
that you found
an innate martial artist.

523
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,820
But you released him.

524
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,780
Baili Dongjun

525
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,300
is the young master
of the Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion.

526
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Rushing to capture him was risky enough,

527
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,740
especially

528
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,940
now he's become

529
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,980
Mr. Li's disciple.

530
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,100
So...

531
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,220
So his name is Baili Dongjun.

532
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:26,940
Why stop?

533
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,540
Keep going.

534
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,260
We found

535
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,340
a more suitable candidate.

536
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,500
His name is Ye Dingzhi.

537
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,460
You've been away from Nanjue
for many years.

538
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,140
You must know

539
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,700
a lot has happened.

540
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,660
Master,

541
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,020
you were defeated
by the female swordsman, Yan Lingxia.

542
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,140
The title of the top martial artist
in Nanjue has changed hands.

543
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,620
Many people believed you were dead.

544
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,900
Yet,

545
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,860
you suddenly appeared in Tianqi City

546
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,140
and publicly declared your whereabouts

547
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,980
by challenging Mr. Li.

548
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,540
You want to learn
the Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

549
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,860
I don't agree.

550
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,620
When I couldn't defeat Li Changsheng,

551
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,860
I studied
the Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

552
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,740
Within a year,

553
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,540
my power increased by 60%.

554
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,700
But I still couldn't defeat him.

555
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,700
If you want to surpass me,

556
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,820
don't follow my old path.

557
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,620
Master...

558
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,020
Swordsman, Lingyun.

559
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,060
That's me.

560
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,420
It's said that
after battling Yan Lingxia,

561
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,180
your phase has plummeted.

562
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,340
It was a devastating fall.

563
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,060
So, did you return

564
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,860
because you're in the former phase now?

565
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,740
Even if I've returned
to my previous phase,

566
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,820
it's merely to seek another defeat.

567
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,180
I've long admired you.

568
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,980
Today, I, Lingyun,

569
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,820
also wish to challenge you.

570
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,940
If you win?

571
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,180
I will fight Yan Lingxia

572
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,940
on your behalf

573
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,420
and reclaim the title
of Nanjue's top martial artist.

574
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,060
If you lose?

575
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,980
I'm prepared to die.

576
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,420
Let's go.

577
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,020
Ye,

578
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,740
did you learn that sword move
from earlier?

579
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,060
I saw nine-tenths of it clearly.

580
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,580
Not bad.

581
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,140
I've poured all my life's cultivation

582
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,740
into the thirteen sword strikes.

583
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,060
But

584
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,260
we'll face many challengers like this

585
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,220
on our journey.

586
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,980
Each time, I'll only use one strike.

587
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,220
You must observe it carefully.

588
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,380
Yes, Master.

589
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,980
Except for the final strike.

590
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,500
You're not allowed

591
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,540
to watch that one.

592
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,700
Master,

593
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,940
why did my master, the Scholarly Deity,

594
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,180
ask me to brew

595
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,140
that bottle of liquor

596
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,500
and hang it at the highest point
in Tianqi City?

597
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,820
I didn't get a chance to ask him.

598
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,580
You should ask him yourself.

599
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,020
How would I know?

600
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,380
You don't?

601
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,900
Just kidding.

602
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,020
Of course, I know.

603
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,820
I know everything.

604
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,820
Master.

605
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,500
It's something romantic.

606
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,460
Back then, your master fell in love

607
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,660
with a woman.

608
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,340
After they parted ways,

609
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,580
your master owed her

610
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,660
a jar of Peach Blossom Moonfall.

611
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,460
If I hang it there,

612
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,660
can that woman see it?

613
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,540
Yes, she can

614
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,540
because that woman is

615
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,540
the owner

616
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,740
of the Royal Academy 32nd Division.

617
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,220
Your master promised her

618
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,220
that he would bring this jar of liquor

619
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,900
to her personally

620
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,700
once it was brewed

621
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,020
and marry her.

622
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,460
But if he didn't come

623
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,700
or if someone else hung

624
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,740
the liquor

625
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,620
at the Immortal's Guidance Pavilion,

626
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,980
it would mean he's already dead

627
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,740
and she should stop waiting for him.

628
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,180
She waited for many years,

629
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,980
hoping that one day

630
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,260
your master would appear

631
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,580
and marry her.

632
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,420
But as the years went by,

633
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,460
he never showed up.

634
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,580
Perhaps she waited too long

635
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,100
and what she really wished was

636
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,700
that this liquor would never appear

637
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
on that high platform.

638
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,020
Doesn't this mean

639
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,780
she would find out

640
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,180
that the man she loves
is no longer alive?

641
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,900
It seems

642
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,340
I have broken my master's wife's heart.

643
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,620
You should know

644
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,620
she would be very pleased

645
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,740
if she heard you address her that way.

646
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,740
It's you.

647
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,020
Yes, it's me.

648
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,180
What brings you here?

649
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,580
To see me off?

650
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:46,620
Be careful.

651
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,260
This person seems to be here
with ill intentions.

652
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,820
Ji Ruofeng,

653
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,700
you're more clever

654
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,140
and stubborn than I imagined.

655
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,420
I want to know the truth.

656
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:55,860
So today

657
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,260
I must find out here.

658
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,460
Perhaps you could simply tell me

659
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,700
the answer.

660
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,500
I don't have the answer

661
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,340
you want.

662
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,380
If you keep talking, I'll beat you up.

663
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,420
Ji Ruofeng.

664
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,620
You may have taught me martial arts
for a few days.

665
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,940
But gratitude is another issue.

666
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,180
If you insist on stopping us,

667
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,340
don't blame me for being rude.

668
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,220
Who would dare

669
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,700
get in Mr. Li's way?

670
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,140
Unless Mr. Li has lost

671
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,900
his martial skills.

672
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,820
What nonsense are you talking about?

673
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,180
How so?

674
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,380
To understand, one must start

675
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,980
with Mr. Li's sudden departure
from Tianqi City.

676
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,300
What's so strange about that?

677
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,420
Everyone knows

678
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,900
I, Li Changsheng, act on impulse

679
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
and do as I please.

680
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,380
If I want to leave, I will leave.

681
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,020
Is it really just a matter of impulse?

682
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,620
Mr. Li, you once claimed
to have traveled with the Poetry Deity

683
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,140
and shook the heavens with your sword.

684
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,540
But the Poetry Deity has been dead
for over a century.

685
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,460
Why are you still around?

686
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,580
I can't believe
some people believe that.

687
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,740
In the past hundred years,

688
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,700
countless sword deities have emerged.

689
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,220
But why

690
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,140
do you single out the Poetry Deity?

691
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,580
Was the Poetry Deity truly
that legendary?

692
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,660
Or

693
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,420
is Li Changsheng not legendary enough

694
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,580
and he needs to fabricate

695
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,900
some ethereal story

696
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,700
to add a legend

697
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,820
to his name?

698
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,180
If

699
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,780
Li Changsheng
and the Poetry Deity have a past

700
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,860
and it's not a fabrication,

701
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,340
then how long has
Li Changsheng truly lived?

702
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,900
The Baixiao Hall investigated

703
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,460
your experience

704
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,420
after your sword made you famous,

705
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,820
which amounts to only thirty years.

706
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:27,980
By this logic,

707
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,540
the previous
Li Changsheng must not have been

708
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,780
the real Li Changsheng.

709
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,820
If you were to leave Tianqi today,

710
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,900
Li Changsheng would likely cease
to exist.

711
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,460
Is that so?

712
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,700
You are indeed more clever
than I imagined.

713
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,620
Since you are leaving Tianqi,

714
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,500
there must be

715
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,780
a reason why you can't stay.

716
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,940
So I'm guessing

717
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,300
it's not that you don't want

718
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,340
to keep being Li Changsheng,

719
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,220
but rather, you cannot.

720
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,140
Why not?

721
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,500
Because you have lost
your martial skills.

722
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,380
Mr. Li, will you tell me

723
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,260
the answer now?

724
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:04,780
Ji Ruofeng,

725
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,140
I don't know

726
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,660
if my master has truly lost his skills.

727
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,940
But you're certainly
not sensible at all.

728
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,940
I taught you
the Autumn Water Technique.

729
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,580
Do you have confidence
in defeating me?

730
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,780
Don't be overconfident.

731
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,380
My master now

732
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,260
is Li Changsheng.

733
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,860
Besides, the Scholarly Deity taught me

734
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,620
the Western Chu's Sword Song.

735
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,580
Aren't you worried

736
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,500
about ruining your bright future here?

737
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,300
Chief Ji, you're joking.

738
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:31,860
My bright future is

739
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,820
right behind me.

740
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:33,940
If I backed off,

741
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,140
my future would indeed be ruined.

742
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,220
Dongjun,

743
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,460
you never fail to come up
with clever lines.
