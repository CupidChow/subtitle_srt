00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:16,060

2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,300
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,840
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,400
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,340
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,820
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,640
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,620
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,960
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,820
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,600

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,320

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,282

23
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:53,320

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,700

25
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,010

26
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,920

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,420
I thought you hated occasions like this.

28
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,860
I assumed you wouldn't appear after the preliminary exam.

29
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,400
You'll know why soon.

30
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,020
Senior Lei. Who do you think will impress everyone in the final exam?

31
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,480
Ye Dingzhi? Yin Luoxia? Or that expert in Qimen Dunjia?

32
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,900
Why are you not on the list?

33
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,820
If not, I can't make my choice.

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,900
You're indeed a good friend of mine.

35
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,260
Let me rephrase it.

36
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,700
Who do you think will impress everyone in the final exam?

37
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,860
Ye Dingzhi? Yin Luoxia? Me? Or that expert in Qimen Dunjia?

38
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,180
- Ye Dingzhi. 
 - What's wrong with you?

39
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,060
I'm just telling the truth.

40
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,600
You want to impress everyone?

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,460
You're not capable enough.

42
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,020

43
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,440
You two are early today.

44
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,880

45
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,500
Without me it sure is awkward between you two.

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
It must be true that you have nothing to talk about.

47
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,780
Of course. They stood next to each other for almost an hour and exchanged one line.

48
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,840
That's normal. Worry not.

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,460
Just let me host the event later.

50
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,200
They're so boring.

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,280
If you ask them to explain the rules, the candidates will die from nerves.

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,340
But it's different with me.

53
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,980
Of course. You'll blabber from day until night.

54
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,340
They'll get sleepy instead of nervous.

55
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,640
That's right.

56
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,200
All right. All 16 of you are candidates for the final examination.

57
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,220
According to our rules, you will be divided into teams of four.

58
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,540
There will be a total of four teams. Each team will be given a hint.

59
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,940
Use the hint to find the object.

60
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,340
Whichever team finds it first will be recruited into the Academy

61
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,700
and Master will pick one among the four team winners as his last disciple.

62
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,540
That one will be our junior.

63
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,460
But of course, finding the object with one hint will not be easy.

64
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,540
If you can collect all four hints, the answer will be obvious.

65
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:41,620
Defeating other teams and snatching their hints is crucial to winning.

66
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,640
How do we form a team?

67
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,580
- By drawing lots? 
 - Pick your own teammates.

68
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,140
We pick? But we don't know each other.

69
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,220
How about we form a team?

70
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,780
Are you sure you don't know each other after all this time?

71
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,540
Who's good with sword techniques?

72
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,260
Who's good with toxins?

73
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,980
Who's good with lightness techniques?

74
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,620
Who's the strongest foe?

75
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,900
Haven't you done your research?

76
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,004
As for your name, origin, and other information,

77
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:09,980
no matter if it's traceable or not, don't you have an idea about those?

78
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,980
All of you are smart so don't play dumb here.

79
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,260
Instead of making a fuss, you'd better select your ideal teammates as soon as possible.

80
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,720
After all, there's no time to waste.

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,100
Zhuomo. You gave them too many tips.

82
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,880
You have an hour and it begins now.

83
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,060
- Make way. 
 - Make way.

84
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,260
- Brother Ye. 
 - Brother Ye.

85
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,100
Move.

86
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,180
Move aside.

87
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,940
- Let's team up. 
 - Yes, let's team up.

88
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,620
- Can I join? 
 - Ye Dingzhi is pretty popular.

89
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,780
Several days ago, Ye Dingzhi stopped an armed fight in the city.

90
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,780
His martial prowess is known throughout the city.

91
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,260
And you aren't aware of it?

92
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,940
Is that so?

93
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,040
Miss.

94
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,380
Would you like to team up with me?

95
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,340
 It's him.

96
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,420
 While I have never seen his face before,

97
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,180
 this person knows Qimen Dunjia and carries a similar scent.

98
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,620
 It must be him.

99
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,860
 If he's here, things will be troublesome.

100
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,700
Why? Do you have another plan, Miss?

101
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,420
If I say yes, will you oppose it?

102
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,920
Of course not.

103
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,720
I hope we are striving toward the same goal and hope to see you at the destination.

104
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,580
 Now it's troublesome.

105
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,720
It seems your friend is more popular than you.

106
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,700
In that case, why don't we team up?

107
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,020
Us?

108
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:38,080
Miss, when I first met you I wanted to ask if we had met before.

109
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,040
Is that why you chose me?

110
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,700
Don't overthink it. I chose you because you are handsome.

111
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,060
And good-looking people are supposed to team up with each other.

112
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,380
It's the law of the universe since time immemorial.

113
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,380
I looked around...

114
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,060
and thought you looked the most dashing.

115
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,260
- While I agree with that, I... 
 - Young Master Ye, think about it.

116
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,540
Do think about it.

117
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,580
- Young Master Ye. 
 - Brother Ye.

118
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,000
Please make way.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,780
I am very flattered but I already have a teammate in mind.

120
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,980
- Young Master Ye. 
 - Thanks. I pick...

121
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,060
- Young Master Ye. 
 - Brother Ye.

122
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,640
Young Master Ye, I can't believe you'd choose me.

123
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,260
Please move aside.

124
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,300
I pick you.

125
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,460
Why me?

126
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,580
Because you're handsome.

127
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,840
Fine. You're charming too.

128
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,660
I overheard you saying that good-looking people are supposed to team up with each other.

129
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,380
Zhuge Yun is quite handsome.

130
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,120
But unfortunately, he's not one of us.

131
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,180
What do we do next?

132
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,740
I am Xiahou Mengding. I'd like to join your team.

133
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,040
I am Zhao Yujia. I'd like to join your team too.

134
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,380
I know you. You are the one who did the Face-Changing.

135
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,460
I can tame animals. I am famous in Tianqi City.

136
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,820
I can tame animals too. My skill is unrivaled.

137
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,060
Are you doing this on purpose?

138
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,360
I'm just telling the truth.

139
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,440
Let's have a competition then.

140
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,760
Taiyi Lion Secret Arts.

141
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,700
He's from Mount Wangcheng.

142
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,920
It's my first time seeing that technique.

143
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,880
It seems there are a lot of talents hiding among these candidates.

144
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,500
Even an expert of the Xuan Sect is here to attend the exam.

145
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,660
It seems like the Academy is famous now.

146
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,140
So? Do you still want to compete with me?

147
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,260
No. Farewell.

148
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,760
Well, can I...

149
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,160
Facing-Changing is not my only skill.

150
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,360
- Farewell. 
 - Farewell.

151
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,380
So it's you.

152
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,240
Zhao Yujia.

153
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,860
I'll leave if you're not picking me.

154
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,500
Stay. I think you're decently strong.

155
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,380
You must be one of us.

156
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,820
So we now have a team.

157
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,420
Wait. Miss, while you're pretty, I'm not so sure if I want to recruit you.

158
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,420
What's on your mind, Young Master Ye?

159
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,620
It's an important exam. We must be cautious.

160
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,780
- Baili, test her martial arts skills. 
 - Me?

161
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,620
- Hurry up. 
 - Fine.

162
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,720
Your lightness technique is exceptional.

163
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,580
You're faster than you were that day.

164
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,060
It's not the ordinary Three Flying Swallow Moves.

165
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,880
I invented this myself. It's called Drunken Slide.

166
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,130

167
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,860
A sword up her sleeve? How ingenious.

168
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,500
The Instant Kill Sword Arts sure is lethal.

169
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,740
I don't mean to kill. It was just...

170
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,060
to test you.

171
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,840
You had a dream?

172
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,180
I dreamed of Dongjun.

173
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,180
What did you dream of?

174
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,100
I dreamed he mastered the Instant Kill Sword Arts

175
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,260
and even improved upon the Three Flying Swallow Moves with his own moves.

176
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,440
That does sound like a dream.

177
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,080
Young Master Baili, have I impressed you with my sleeve swordplay?

178
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,140
Like I said, I was just testing you.

179
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,480
You'll have to ask him if you pass the test or not.

180
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,000
Miss, the final exam will be a dangerous one. Naturally, I want strong teammates.

181
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,560
Don't take it to heart.

182
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,300
From now on we are a team.

183
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,950
The four of them actually formed a team. The strong bond with one another.

184
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,560
They are more likely to win now.

185
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,420
Do you think so? I think this is worse.

186
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,460
Master will only recruit one disciple.

187
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,120
If that team wins, who do you think Master will pick? Ye Dingzhi

188
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,290
or Baili Dongjun?

189
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,720
Master only recruits the most interesting candidate not the strongest.

190
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,800
You're an exception.

191
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,380
You're boring.

192
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,860
You're so extremely boring that it somehow becomes interesting.

193
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,480
That's why Master took you in.

194
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,380
Do you think you're a very interesting person?

195
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,040
I do.

196
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,020
I think Ye Dingzhi is more interesting than you.

197
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,640
Quit it.

198
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,580
Time's up.

199
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,200
Have you found your teammates?

200
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,340
Where is the next arena?

201
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,560
- Master. 
 - Master.

202
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,100
Your next arena is... the entirety of Tianqi City.

203
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,920
The entire city?

204
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,820
- When does it start? 
 - Now.

205
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,260
Young Master Baili is eager to drink Qiulubai, which comes out once per month,

206
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,120
after the examination.

207
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,580
How did you know?

208
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,280
I went to Diaolou Tavern just now

209
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,200
and got the last pot of Qiulubai for this month.

210
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,560
Oh, no. You might not be able to enjoy it.

211
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,800
You old man, I might just snatch it from your hands.

212
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,500
Mind your manners.

213
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,660
It's fine. The young are bold.

214
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,960
Isn't it great?

215
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,700
All right. I'll await your return.

216
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,760
He won't let us catch a break at all.

217
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,840
As the saying goes, the silk is white as snow,

218
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,320
braided into two carp.

219
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,380
To know one's real thoughts,

220
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,340
retrieve the notes inside the carp's tummy.

221
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,000
I...

222
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,580
The hints are inside the fish's tummy.

223
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,920
They contain the hours of Wei, Shen, You, and Xu.

224
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,120
In a moment, send a member and draw lots. You will depart on the hour that you've drawn.

225
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,200
Before you leave, Young Master Mochen will give you a pouch.

226
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,800
Oh, right. When one team finds the final answer,

227
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,280
the golden bell on this stage will toll.

228
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,180
When that happens, please gather at the Academy. Understood?

229
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,820
Well, let's do this then.

230
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,300
Why do we depart at different times?

231
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,180
Because each team will be given only one pouch.

232
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,060
The hint is inside the pouch. So there are four hints in total.

233
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,580
The ones who leave first can act first.

234
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,580
They can either hide or solve the riddle as soon as possible.

235
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,860
The teams who leave later can watch where the ones before them go.

236
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,180
They can either find them or wait for them.

237
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,740
If we all leave together there's no need to have this competition.

238
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,400
We might as well fight here.

239
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,900
The winners will walk away with all the pouches and find the answer.

240
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,280
Not a bad candidate.

241
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,060
You know our rules very well.

242
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,120
Enough talking. Send someone up.

243
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,260
King of Gambling.

244
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,260
That will be me.

245
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,460
The ones who get the hour of Wei will leave first.

246
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,120
The ones who get the hour of Xu will leave after six hours.

247
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,140
The answer might have already been found in six hours.

248
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,240
So the competition starts now.

249
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,700
The hour of Shen.

250
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,020
Not bad. The first ones to leave will be targeted.

251
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,860
Leaving at the hour of Shen might be a better choice.

252
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,340
You live up to the name of King of Gambling. Good job.

253
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,880
You do know how to butter someone up.

254
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,250
You must be single.

255
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,060
Shut up.

256
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,340
Which team do you think will depart first?

257
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,580
Well...

258
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,100
There.

259
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,740
The hour of Wei.

260
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,400
The hour of You.

261
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,200
The hour of Xu.

262
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,500
The first team may leave now.

263
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,680
What a formidable foe.

264
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,320
This is worrisome.

265
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,580
Why are you worried?

266
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,660
You're not sitting for the exam.

267
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,940
The winner will be our junior.

268
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,660
I don't want someone like him to be our peer.

269
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,000
You've put up with me so far.

270
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,280
I am your senior.

271
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,740
- Fine, you're my senior. 
 - I am.

272
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,620
Self-appointed senior.

273
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,660
As requested, I have delivered the message to Ye Dingzhi.

274
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,500
To join my wing one must pay a price.

275
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,940
Only by being responsible for the death of Baili Dongjun,

276
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,560
will Ye Dingzhi be willing to serve me loyally?

277
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,520

278
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,660
Brother,

279
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,120
who do you think will be your junior

280
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,340
from the exam?

281
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,460
Since when are you concerned with the Academy's affairs, Elder Brother?

282
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,020
Many in the imperial court have a vested interest in the Academy.

283
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:32,060
I know you are on the Academy's side so I never ask you about it.

284
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,690
However, among the candidates...

285
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,420
someone will work for Prince Qing.

286
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,260
Whoever that person is, once recruited, they will become a member of the Academy.

287
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,700
Elder Brother, you lost.

288
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,340
When it comes to GO, I can never win against you.

289
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,700
How is sister-in-law?

290
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,900
I have taken her into my residence.

291
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,240
We're waiting for the day Father mandates our marriage to get betrothed.

292
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,440

293
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,380

294
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,440
Senior Brother, it's so lively outside today.

295
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,720
Today is the final exam of the Academy.

296
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,120
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

297
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,180
They can live freely. I envy them.

298
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,690
If I could live like them

299
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,560
would I also be free and happy?

300
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,320
Junior Sister.

301
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,760
It's so quiet on the street. I don't see anyone here.

302
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,300
It's the final exam so the streets have been cleared.

303
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:06,460
Anyway, the pouch says, "You do not witness the existence of Black Tortoise."

304
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,260
Black Tortoise...

305
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,420
What is a Black Tortoise?

306
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,660
It wouldn't be the final exam if it was an easy riddle.

307
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,090
Black Tortoise?

308
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,580

309
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,220
Maybe Black Tortoise Parlor?

310
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,500
Black Tortoise Parlor?

311
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,620
Yes. It's one of the most famous sword armories in Tianqi City.

312
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,260
It's under the Academy.

313
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,660
There are sword armories in Tianqi City?

314
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,120
That's incredible. Why have I never heard of it?

315
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,240
Young Master, you must have been living under a rock.

316
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,680
My family has strict rules.

317
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,460
Very strict.

318
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,560
Let's go. Everyone else has left.

319
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,680
If we don't go now, we'll be too late.

320
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,360

321
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,600
The four of them actually formed a team.

322
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,580
How quaint and interesting.

323
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,920
More importantly, they have intriguing backgrounds.

324
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,000
Are there any updates?

325
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,100
Yin Luoxia, the daughter of the previous King of Gambling, Yin Shunshui.

326
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,820
She is the current King of Gambling.

327
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,620
Her mother is the only daughter of Marquis Luoyang.

328
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,040
Being unable to live with the wandering gambler Yin Shunshui, she left him.

329
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,460
Yin Luoxia has been living with her father.

330
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,100
Half of her martial prowess comes from her father.

331
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,860
The other half comes from his father's three friends.

332
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,820
Together they are the Four Vices in the Martial Arts world.

333
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,500
Glutton, Drunkard, Philanderer, and Gambler.

334
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,020
Yin Luoxia has no notoriety.

335
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,380
She rarely leaves her father since living in seclusion.

336
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,260
Furthermore, she has never contacted anyone from Tianqi City.

337
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,060
Is she the real Yin Luoxia?

338
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,060
She was still a child when she last appeared publicly.

339
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,900
But according to the information gathered, she is quite likely Yin Luoxia.

340
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,340
What about the others?

341
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,620
Ye Dingzhi, a nobody in the Martial Arts world.

342
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,320
In one record he was first spotted in Nanjue.

343
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,660
He has been wandering ever since.

344
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,020
However, he should be a Beili citizen.

345
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,380
In fact he is likely the youngest son of General Ye Yu,

346
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,020
whose family was sanctioned to death because of treason.

347
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,060
He survived by being swapped out.

348
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,380
When he was spotted in Nanjue, he was following someone around.

349
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,420
That person is his master.

350
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,460
Who is his master?

351
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,320
The greatest master in Nanjue, the sword deity, Rain Demon.

352
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,500
The disciple of Nanjue's strongest master wants to be Mr. Li's disciple.

353
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,160
Looks like he aspires to be the strongest individual in the world.

354
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,560
From what did you infer his relationship with Ye Yu?

355
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,120
Just his surname and the timing of his appearance alone are not convincing enough.

356
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,100
The case of General Ye Yu's treason was unjust.

357
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,240
The one who sabotaged him was Prince Qing, who only obtained his title that year.

358
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,560
Ye Dingzhi and Prince Qing were seen talking briefly.

359
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,520
Therefore he must be Ye Dingzhi.

360
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,540
However, this is yet to be confirmed.

361
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,560
What about Zhao Yujia?

362
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,060
Nothing on him.

363
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,440
Nothing?

364
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,820
In that case, there are only two explanations.

365
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,040
He either appears out of nowhere or...

366
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,700
He's using a pseudonym.

367
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,460
Zhao Yujia is an expert in mystic arts.

368
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,020
While we failed to identify him, we found the best mystic artist,

369
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:13,100
also the Chief of Mount Wangcheng, Lu Suzhen. His youngest disciple is Zhao Yuzhen.

370
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,780
It was alleged that he was a rare prodigy in Mount Wangcheng.

371
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,800
He has never left after he entered the mountain.

372
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,660
So you're saying that Zhao Yujia might be Zhao Yuzhen?

373
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,060
How interesting.

374
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,400
Zhao Yujia is also recommended by someone.

375
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,245
You're just now bringing it up

376
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:37,500
which means the one recommending him must be someone very important.

377
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,840
Like Xiao Ruofeng?

378
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,540
Zhao Yujia is recommended by Mr. Li himself.

379
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,680
Oh?

380
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,760
This is intriguing.

381
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,840
And Zhuge Yun?

382
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,260
The settlement of the Zhuge Family is still unknown.

383
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,560
However, evidence likely suggests the Zhuge Family has been wiped out.

384
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,040
But perhaps some of them survived.

385
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,300
We wanted to ask the Elder of the Academy who has recommended Zhuge Yun.

386
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,260
- However... 
 - What is it?

387
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,320
- He is dead.  
 - Dead?

388
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,220
Yes, killed by Zhuge Yun.

389
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,580
He was killed on the way to the region that is out of the North.

390
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,080
But the Academy hasn't received the news yet so they're not aware of the situation.

391
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,460
I was only informed of this moments ago.

392
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,660
Relay this to Xiao Ruofeng.

393
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,080
Noted.

394
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,960
The region... that is out of the North.

395
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,560
Zhuge...

396
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,840
Right.

397
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,040
Anything else you want to add?

398
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,780
This information is very important.

399
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,800
I'll need extra money for it.

400
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,060
Lord Wuzuo.

401
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,360
They are tricky foes.

402
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,100
I'm here. What are you afraid of?

403
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,860
Then the other Lord...

404
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,020
I have arranged accordingly.

405
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,520
Old Second. Please deal with those pesky candidates now.

406
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,200
Qixuan...

407
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,560
You'll come with me to find Young Lady and the others.

408
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,340
Zhuge Yun. We're teammates.

409
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,900
We should help each other!

410
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,280
Why?

411
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Who... Who exactly are you?!

412
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,380
Isn't the Zhuge Family known for its chivalry?

413
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,880
How... How come you're this cruel?

414
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,920

415
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,100
Is there anything that we're looking for in there?

416
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,480
Let's check it out.

417
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,000
This is suspicious. Please exercise caution.

418
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,460
Don't stray too far from me.

419
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,660
Be careful.

420
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,580
Be vigilant.

421
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,940
Hold on.

422
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,580
It's the coiled thread from Honglu Temple.

423
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,000
Coiled thread is made from thin iron.

424
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,600
It's so thin that the eye cannot detect it.

425
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,300
There aren't many weapons as discreet and sharp as this one here.

426
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,180
Why are you standing there?

427
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,100
It's not as sharp as you said.

428
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,400
You're using a Celestial Level Sword.

429
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,300
And this is the most common coiled thread.

430
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,600
Is there any other type of coiled thread?

431
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,400
You'll have to ask Master Xia from Honglu Temple.

432
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,440
Let's go.

433
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,520
So this is the Sword Tower.

434
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,980
How splendid.

435
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,200
That is a real Celestial Level Sword, right?

436
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm afraid only a deity can wield it.

437
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,700
Are the swords not worth anything at all?

438
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,700
No one guards them. Are they not afraid the swords might be stolen?

439
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,600
They might pay with their lives.

440
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,000
We're already here. What do we do next?

441
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,500
Our hint is just one line of a poem.

442
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,900
What are you staring at?

443
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,460
The jade on the sword hilt looks like an eye.

444
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,200
Did you see that? Or am I hallucinating?

445
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,700
You're right. I saw it too.

446
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,500
The jade on the hilt just blinked like a normal eye.

447
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,380
Why don't I slice it to see what's inside?

448
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,220
 Kiddo. That sword is worth a fortune.

449
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,500
 If you destroy it, you have to pay for it even if you become a disciple of the Academy.

450
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,200
- Who's there? 
  - I am Xinyang, the sword of a Sword Deity.

451
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,000
 I am the sword of Fufeng Fairy.

452
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,200
 - I am Mingyue. 
 - I am Qixiao.

453
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,400
 I am the master of the Sword Tower.

454
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,800
 All swords return to me. I'll command all swords!

455
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,000
 All swords return to me. I'll command all swords!

456
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,980
Just a trick of the eye.

457
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,900
Show yourself!

458
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,520
You have not seen the thousand swords of Black Tortoise.

459
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,400
How can you challenge all the demons?

460
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,680
It's that poem. We're at the right place.

461
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,360
No. You're at the wrong place.

462
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,920
Two pupils?

463
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,220
It's said the servant of the Yellow Emperor, Cangjie, has four eyes.

464
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,880
So someone with four eyes exists in this world.

465
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,680
A mortal with four eyes is half a step away from becoming a god.

466
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,560
A sage with four eyes can rule the Heavens.

467
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,040
Who are you?

468
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,820
I am your judgment.

469
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,040
You're here.

470
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,620
If you want the final answer, you'll have to go through me.

471
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,220
You work for the Academy?

472
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:45,980
Like I said, all swords return to me and I'll command all swords!

473
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,380
What gibberish.

474
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,120
Careful. Our enemy lurks in the dark while we're in the open.

475
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,780
It's pitch-black in the hall.

476
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,400
We can't see him and he can't see us.

477
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,180
those with two pupils perceive light with one and darkness with the other.

478
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,880
He has full vision at the moment.

479
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,280
And we are the blind ones here.

480
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,600
I've practiced locating someone with sound for years but I can't find him.

481
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,800
That's right. He seems to be everywhere.

482
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,800
We have no time. If this place has nothing to do with the final answer, let's not stay here.

483
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,700
Let's leave.

484
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,800
Oh no. We can't get out of here.

485
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,600
I have an idea.

486
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,600
That costs a fortune you said?

487
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,200
Then I'll shatter it.

488
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,540
Insolence!

489
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,460
Run!

490
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,200

491
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,400

492
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:39,500

493
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:49,300
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

494
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:58,600
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

495
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:07,900
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

496
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:16,400
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

497
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,400
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

498
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,800
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

499
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,100
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

500
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,700
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

501
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,180
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

502
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,200
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

503
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,700
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

504
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,200
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

505
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,600
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

506
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,700
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

507
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:57,600
♫  I met you  ♫

508
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,800
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

509
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:49,600
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

510
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:58,800
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

511
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:07,400
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

512
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,600
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

513
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,000
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

514
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,500
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

515
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,700
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

516
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,200
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

517
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,200
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

518
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,800
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

519
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,200
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

520
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,700
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

521
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,000
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

522
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,100
♫  I met you  ♫
