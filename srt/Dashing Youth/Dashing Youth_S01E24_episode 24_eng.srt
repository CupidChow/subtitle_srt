00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:16,600

00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,900
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,400
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,340
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12

♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,720
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,820
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,700

21
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,120

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,230

23
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,000

24
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,200
Be careful, you two!

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,940
Yes, up a bit. Up a bit!

26
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,660
Be careful! All right, come on down.

27
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,345
You, go to the backyard.

28
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:02,440
- Do you hear me? 
 - Okay.

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,020
Hurry up now.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,180

31
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,780
Brother.

32
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,500
Ruofeng.

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,700
I haven't congratulated you on fulfilling your wish of marrying Wenjun.

34
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,940
Ruofeng, you've come just in time.

35
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,180
I've got something for you to do.

36
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,620
Brother, just say it.

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,660
There are a lot of things that need to be done for the wedding.

38
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,380
I have too much on my plate

39
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,460
so, I'm going to need you to sort out the guest list, for me.

40
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,040
No problem. Don't worry about it, Brother.

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,437
All right.

42
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,140
Come and take a look.

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,060
The Shadow Sect and the imperial family are linked by marriage.

44
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,460
This has never happened since the founding of Beili.

45
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,080
But when Jin asked me to grant him the marriage, I consented.

46
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,640
Why do you think I did so?

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,540
How can I guess your thoughts, Your Highness?

48
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,540
You've been following me for decades.

49
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,220
How could I not know the type of person you are?

50
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,860
You've always been a deep thinker.

51
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,140
Don't give me that kind of answer.

52
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,020
Just speak freely.

53
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,000
The Shadow Sect was established by General Yi,

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,040
to protect the imperial city.

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,098
From the name alone

56
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:49,120
you can tell this is a good weapon for the imperial family destined to live in the shadows.

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,460
General Yi was dedicated to serving his country and did not seek fame.

58
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,160
His loyalty is admirable.

59
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,060
Generation after generation, how many generations can it last?

60
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,360
So far, at least, they haven't had any thoughts of rebellion.

61
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,260
Yes, they have.

62
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,000
Otherwise, how could I become the Emperor?

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,300
The Shadow Sect is no longer a pure guardian of the Xiao Family.

64
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,180
In the past I chose them.

65
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,840
And now, Jin has chosen them.

66
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:40,540
Collusion for personal gain is a capital offense.

67
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:47,220
Apart from the founding ancestor, which prince doesn't have his own followers?

68
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,420
Since Jin has chosen this path

69
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,600
then I'll... push him to take this step.

70
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,000
As long as he doesn't go too far.

71
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,380
What about Prince Qing?

72
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,980
Old two?

73
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,660
Quite ruthless.

74
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,140
No prince is without ambition.

75
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,220
I allow him to be ambitious.

76
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,840
But he doesn't seem to be making much of a fuss these days.

77
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:29,920
But no matter what may happen in the end, Jin'er may kill him.

78
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,640
But Feng'er will not.

79
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,480
Your Majesty, you seem to be particularly fond of Prince Langya.

80
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,120
Are you trying to guess my thoughts?

81
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,800
I dare not.

82
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,620
 Senior, I'm sorry.

83
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,000
 Drugging you is the last thing I would ever do.

84
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,260
 The six-month deadline is approaching.

85
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,660
 I can't stand by and watch Brother Yun die.

86
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,490

87
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,620
Father.

88
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,180
If you go back now, I'll let you off the hook.

89
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,040
No.

90
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,707
It's not easy for you to master your martial arts skills, so I won't disable you.

91
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:21,620
But you won't be able to use your skills for six months.

92
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:49,325

93
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,260
What's bothering you now?

94
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,220
A wedding invitation from Tianqi City.

95
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,000
Prince Jingyu invited us to the wedding of his second consort.

96
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,140
It's just a prince getting a consort, plus a second one.

97
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,200
Is it worth us making the trip?

98
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,060
It wasn't.

99
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,860
But I heard that his second consort is the daughter of the Shadow Sect's leader.

100
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,960
You mean the Shadow Sect that guards the Xiao Family?

101
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,980
They're marrying into the imperial family?

102
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,860
It's unprecedented.

103
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:56,940
However, I remember their daughter was betrothed to Yun of the Ye Family.

104
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,300
Yes.

105
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,860
It's an arranged betrothal of minors.

106
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,660
I feel bad for General Ye's family.

107
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,860
Putting that aside,

108
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:19,020
Sect Master Yi saved my life on an expedition when he wasn't yet a sect leader.

109
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,260
Now that his only daughter is getting married and he's invited me to the ceremony,

110
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,860
I don't like to refuse.

111
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,500
But General Ye is dead and Mister Li is gone.

112
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,380
As the son of the Marquis Zhenxi

113
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,200
it's too dangerous for you to go to Tianqi City alone.

114
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,860
Someone was afraid I wouldn't go

115
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,740
so he slipped a letter into the wedding invitation asking me to present myself

116
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,552
saying he had something important to discuss.

117
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:52,660
This person is an old friend of mine.

118
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,520
Ninth Prince?

119
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,540
Now he's moved into his own mansion.

120
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,740
He's known as Prince Langya. He's Prince Jingyu's younger brother.

121
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,500
These days in the imperial court

122
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,620
there's the eldest son's faction, Prince Qing's faction, and Prince Langya's faction.

123
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,200
Three factions.

124
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,760
And Prince Langya's faction is the most righteous of all.

125
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,940
The last time I saw him in Qiandong City,

126
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,020
there were some little disagreements between us

127
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,620
but I still admire him very much.

128
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,920
But Father said we mustn't get involved in political disputes.

129
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,320
It's not that we want to get involved.

130
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,920
It's that the political structure is being reshuffled.

131
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,860
If we want to stay in power we must do something.

132
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,740
Forget it. I can't understand it either.

133
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,340
But Prince Langya is Dongjun's senior.

134
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,520
Will he also ask Dongjun to go back to Tianqi?

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,160
The last sentence of the letter said he also sent Dongjun a wedding invitation.

136
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,640
But it's up to Dongjun and Mister Li to decide whether they'll go or not.

137
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,120
He mentioned Mister Li too?

138
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,100
It's to put our minds at ease.

139
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,700
Prince Jingyu. Who's that? Do you know him?

140
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,760
Prince Jingyu's name is Xiao Ruojin. Can you guess now?

141
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,980
Xiao Ruojin, Xiao Ruofeng.

142
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,520
- Is he... 
 - Yes.

143
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,300
He's Martial Uncle Xiao's brother from the same mother.

144
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,300
This wedding invitation should be from Martial Uncle Xiao.

145
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,220
But it's no fun traveling all that way to see someone get married. I don't want to go.

146
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,980
Sikong Changfeng, are you going?

147
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,840
Prince Jingyu. It's not a bad name.

148
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,520
But what's it got to do with me?

149
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Mister Li had anticipated this before he left. He said you wouldn't be interested.

150
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,320
But he did want to ask whether you'd like to go back to Tianqi City and meet your old friends,

151
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,660
Martial Uncle Lei, Martial Uncle Xiao, my master, and others?

152
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,600
Don't you want to compete with them to see who's gotten stronger?

153
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,000
Then let's go.

154
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,140
- So hasty? 
 - I think Master is right.

155
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,820
It's time to see how much our martial arts skills have improved.

156
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,300
Yao'er, let's depart.

157
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:03,720
I'm not going with you. I'm going back to Tian Wai Tian.

158
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,500
I should give them the explanation I owe them.

159
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,920
I'll go with you to Tian Wai Tian.

160
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,726
Dongjun, it's my own business and my responsibility.

161
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:19,440
- I should face it alone. 
 - But...

162
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,860
Don't worry. I'm the Princess of Beique.

163
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,460
They won't do anything to me. Trust me.

164
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,660
I'll bring her back.

165
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,500
- Where are you going? 
 - Tianqi.

166
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,540
To kidnap the bride?

167
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,600
Are you out of your mind? I won't allow it.

168
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,180
Tianqi City is a dangerous place. If you go there now you're going to die!

169
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,980
Whether I die or not is my business. It has nothing to do with you.

170
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,440
How does it have nothing to do with me? If you die, what happens to my father?

171
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,580
If you die, when will Beique be restored?

172
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,720
- Get out of my way. 
 - No. Unless you kill me!

173
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,280
No one can stop me.

174
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,500
Ye Dingzhi!

175
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,925

176
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,940

177
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,780
Stop there.

178
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,500

179
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,880
Please.

180
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:17,420
- Who is he? 
 - His Majesty's chosen bodyguard, but not yet officially appointed.

181
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,360
I've heard His Majesty intends to train him to be Commander of the Royal Guard.

182
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,740
He doesn't look impressive.

183
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,320
No one with a Shadow token is to be trifled with.

184
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,620
Master.

185
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,140
You've had the pleasure of walking all over Tianqi City today.

186
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,470
With Junior Sister's wedding approaching, I was worried that something might go wrong

187
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,460
so I took a look at the Shadow Guard posts in the city.

188
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,140
Something going wrong? What could possibly go wrong?

189
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,180
If you're completely loyal to me, there's nothing that Ye brat can do.

190
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,220
You didn't tell me, but I still know.

191
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,420
I dare not. As for Ye Dingzhi, I think the matter has been settled.

192
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,900
Settled? Is that the way I taught you to solve problems?

193
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,300
I'm sorry.

194
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,060
Ye Dingzhi is the disciple of Rain Demon.

195
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,220
Now Mister Li isn't on guard in Tianqi City.

196
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,660
If Rain Demon tries to break into the city, no one is confident that they can stop him by themselves.

197
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,060
But Rain Demon is dead.

198
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,340
So you go back and tell the girl not to expect someone to take her away.

199
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,140
Master. Are you really that heartless?

200
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,320
Heartless?

201
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,340
But that's Ye Yun.

202
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,020
Ye Yun died a long time ago.

203
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,140
Now, in my eyes, he's just a nobody named Ye Dingzhi.

204
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,060
Not to mention the the Shadow Sect has existed in the shadows for many years.

205
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,500
Now you've been chosen by His Majesty to become a guard

206
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,120
and your junior sister will be taken as a second consort by Prince Jingyu.

207
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,460
We've been waiting years for a chance to see the light of day.

208
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,340
How can we give it up because of love?

209
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,120
I know you like her.

210
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,540
If you want to take her away,

211
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:12,080
I can give you a chance right now to draw your sword...

212
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,240
and kill me.

213
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
I dare not.

214
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,900
A man should have higher aspirations.

215
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,220
Let go of your feelings and I'll disregard what happened that day.

216
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,900
I asked you here today to tell you that after the wedding

217
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,860
you'll go to His Majesty's side and do what needs to be done.

218
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,940
Do you hear me?

219
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,420
I want to be the best in the world.

220
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,780
I want to be the best in the world.

221
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,200
 Then my junior sister can marry whomever she wants.

222
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,020
Show yourself.

223
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,560
Last time I told you that if you wanted to see me, just shout anywhere and I'd appear.

224
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,580
Did you take it seriously?

225
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,600
- Why do you want to see me? 
 - Because you're interesting.

226
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,180
Baixiao Hall is interested in anyone who's interesting.

227
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:07,140
Moreover, in 20 years you'll be one of the top three in the world.

228
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,300
All right. You've asked your question. It's my turn.

229
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,620
Why did you want to see me?

230
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,660
Deliver something to someone for me.

231
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,300
Baixiao Hall's information is all-encompassing. We seldom deliver things anymore.

232
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,400
You can name your terms.

233
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,600
I can deliver it for you

234
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,540
- but you have to do something for me in the future. 
 - Sure.

235
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,180
- Don't you want to ask what it is? 
 - No need.

236
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:42,380
You're a smart person. I'm sure I won't and can't refuse the thing you'll ask me to do.

237
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,840
Deal?

238
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,260
You're truly a man of few words.

239
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,200
Deal.

240
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,720
But we have a more detailed copy of this thing of yours. Do you believe it?

241
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,060
- Do you want us to deliver ours? 
 - No, just use this one.

242
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:15,220
All right. You're the boss. We'll deliver this one.

243
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,580
Don't blame me for not warning you. This is a capital offense.

244
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,320
You sure talk a lot.

245
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,920
Since you've made a pleasant deal with me, I'll give you one more piece of information.

246
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,460
Ye Dingzhi has already left Nanjue and is heading here.

247
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,600
If nothing unexpected happens, he'll definitely show up that day.

248
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,280
I know.

249
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,900
Even if it's a million miles away...

250
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,800
he'll still come.

251
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:22,138

252
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,580
Tianqi City, I'm back!

253
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,360
Sir.

254
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,720
How dare you call me that?

255
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,240
Brat, why do you look like you've had bad luck when you see me?

256
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,080
We haven't seen each other for half a year.

257
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,420
You haven't felt homesick at all?

258
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,100
I've missed my grandpa.

259
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,900
I've missed my mother.

260
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,660
And I've missed you just a little bit.

261
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,300
Brat, your temper hasn't changed, but your martial skills have.

262
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,100
Let's go. Now that we've met, let's go together.

263
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,600
Sir, where are you going?

264
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,240
I've come to Tianqi City to attend Prince Jingyu's wedding banquet.

265
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,960
Xiao Ruofeng invited me to the Academy first.

266
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,500
You look like you're going to the Academy too.

267
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,800
You're attending the wedding banquet?

268
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,240
Greetings, Sir.

269
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,940
Are you Dongjun's friend?

270
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,660
- I'm Sikong Changfeng. Dongjun and I... 
 - We aren't friends.

271
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,460
He's my brother.

272
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,760
And my junior.

273
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,060
Let's go together then.

274
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,740
It feels like a dream to be back here again.

275
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,220
You're here, Sir.

276
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,100
The Heir of Marquis of Zhenxi, Baili Chengfeng, is here to greet you, Your Highness.

277
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,460
Seniors. I trust you have been well!

278
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,460
Little Senior Brother, I haven't seen you in months.

279
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,780
You've gained weight.

280
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,220
Senior Liu Yue, Luoxia said she can't come back yet

281
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,260
and asked me to send her regards to you.

282
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,100
I've gained weight? I think you've got a lot of nerve.

283
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,580
You wrote to me saying that your martial skills have greatly improved.

284
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,260
What? Would you like to compete with us?

285
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,860
Old Seven, let me deal with him.

286
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,380
I've been wanting to beat you up for days.

287
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,300
Come on. Let's have a fight in the yard.

288
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,440
Let me see what great skills Master has taught you.

289
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,120
Did Master really teach you the Double-Handed Blade-Sword Technique?

290
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,140
Of course. Let me show you what I'm capable of.

291
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,202
Dongjun. Settle down.

292
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:47,540
If you want to mess around, do it after today.

293
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,340
The Heir's right.

294
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,820
Dear Seniors, I'll leave you to rest here.

295
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,380
The carriages will be here in two hours.

296
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,460
I shall take my leave now. My brother is still waiting for me at the mansion.

297
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:04,960
As for you, Sir, would you like to go with me to see my brother?

298
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,200
Is it convenient for Prince Jingyu?

299
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,300
Yes, it is. The groom doesn't need to do anything.

300
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,660
Alright. Dongjun, you shall wait here.

301
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,180
When it's time, come with your seniors.

302
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,860
Everyone, please take care of my son.

303
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,920
Don't worry, Sir.

304
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,840
I feel like they're hiding something from me.

305
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,420
They're not trying to hide it from you.

306
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:49,660
It's just that what they're saying doesn't necessarily interest you.

307
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,420
It's not a good thing anyway.

308
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,800
Dongjun, in a few days we'll be leaving Tianqi City.

309
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,480
Seniors, did something happen in Tianqi City recently?

310
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,800
There hasn't been anything special in the past six months.

311
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,700
It's just that it's time to part.

312
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,240
It seems the other young masters have other plans.

313
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,180
We're fellow disciples but we're not real brothers after all.

314
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,900
Some like to fight while some like to travel.

315
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,880
I can't force them to do anything.

316
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,860
What a pity.

317
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,581
Actually, if I weren't from the imperial family,

318
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:46,666
perhaps I would've made the same decision.

319
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,100
To wander—

320
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,020
Since it comes to me, I'll be brief.

321
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,246
I was expelled by my family a long time ago.

322
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:57,060
Now I'm just a homeless wanderer.

323
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,600
Dashing and carefree.

324
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,620
Well said. But don't say it again.

325
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:14,266
Oh, right. Before we meet my brother, I have a question for you.

326
00:28:14,266 --> 00:28:16,500
Please go ahead.

327
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,860
Why did the Marquis choose us?

328
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,920
It wasn't my father who chose you.

329
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,240
It was me who chose you.

330
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,760
That's an interesting way of putting it.

331
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,640
So you mean the Marquis Zhenxi might have chosen someone else?

332
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:45,810
No, that means I'm in charge of everything

333
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,140
regarding the Marquis of Zhenxi.

334
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,860
Congratulations!

335
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,780
- It's been a long time. 
 - Congratulations, Your Highness.

336
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,080
 Congratulations!

337
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,180
 Brother Yun, I miss you so much.

338
00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:00,680
 I want to eat beef with you in the steppe and see the Buddha statues in the south.

339
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,740
 Will you come?

340
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,100
 Wenjun. Wait for me.

341
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,300
You're here.

342
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,620
Senior Luo, are you here to stop me?

343
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,880
- What are you trying to do? 
 - A lot of people know me here in Tianqi City.

344
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,420
I don't want any unnecessary trouble.

345
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,560
So it's you Ji Ruofeng was talking about.

346
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,720
 This is a map of the Shadow Sect's forces in Tianqi City.

347
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,100
 Memorize it before invading the city. Only then will you have a chance of survival.

348
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,520
Are you going to kidnap the bride with me?

349
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,980
You're not afraid of being punished by your master?

350
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,560
I've been planning this for a long time.

351
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,840
Otherwise you wouldn't have seen this scroll.

352
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,120
But this is the only chance of success, that's why I haven't done anything.

353
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,040
Even if you hadn't come, I would have gone myself.

354
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,440
Put it on.

355
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,460
No need.

356
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm a felon of the imperial court already.

357
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,920
Last time I barely met those people in Tianqi City.

358
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:39,440
This time... I'll make everyone in Tianqi City remembers my face.

359
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:57,100
Ye Yun? Can he break into the city alone?

360
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:03,680
Sir, there's another person but his face is masked and we can't identify him yet.

361
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,300
That means you already have a guess.

362
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,580
Why are you afraid to say it?

363
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,660
It's... It's Senior Luo.

364
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,500
Luo Qingyang?

365
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,540
You're indeed my good disciple.

366
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,620
Young Master, something bad has happened.

367
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,980
Our spy in the Shadow Sect has sent over a shocking message.

368
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,360
What spy? That's a friend.

369
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,980
G-Greetings, Young Masters.

370
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:50,280
Mister Liu Yue really cares about everything that happens in Tianqi City.

371
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,260
Since when do you have a friend in the Shadow Sect?

372
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,060
What has happened? Just say it.

373
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,820
Let's see if it's worth all the shouting.

374
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,740
Some people are breaking into the city and heading for Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

375
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,320
The Shadow Sect has sent men to stop them and many have already been injured.

376
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Who would dare?

377
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
Ye... Ye...

378
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,940
Ye what? It can't be Ye Dingzhi, can it?

379
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,400
Yes, right, it's Ye Dingzhi!

380
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,560
It's really Brother Yun.

381
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,000
Why is he going to Prince Jingyu's Mansion?

382
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,800
Ye's treason case was obviously set up by Prince Qing.

383
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,920
It has nothing to do with Prince Jingyu.

384
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,900
Even if he wants to avenge his father's death, he shouldn't go to Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

385
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,700

386
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,900
Are you going to see Ye Dingzhi?

387
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,840
Sir, you already knew didn't you?

388
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,200
Do you know why Ye Dingzhi is here?

389
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,880
To get revenge.

390
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,800
Prince Jingyu is marrying the daughter of the Shadow Sect's leader, Yi Wenjun.

391
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,640
Wenjun?

392
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,000
Didn't Wenjun leave Tianqi City some years ago to travel?

393
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,180
That's why we've lost contact.

394
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,060
She told me this in her own handwriting in a letter.

395
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,600
It seems that the letter was written by someone with an ulterior motive.

396
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,360
Those bastards at the Shadow Sect.

397
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,800
So are you going to help him or stop him?

398
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,220
One side is the brother of your senior who brought you to the Academy and treats you with sincerity,

399
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,360
and the other side is your childhood friend who fought with you through thick and thin.

400
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:35,195
- What will you choose? 
 - I just want to know whether Wenjun likes Prince Jingyu.

401
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:41,100
I only know that when Ye Dingzhi last came to Tianqi City he met Yi Wenjun again

402
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,360
and they almost eloped.

403
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,920
Since Wenjun is still in love with Brother Yun, isn't it obvious who I'm helping?

404
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,120
Sure enough, you're on Ye Dingzhi's side.

405
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,080
No. I'm on the side of love.

406
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,240
Changfeng!

407
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
- Let's go if you want to. 
 - Let's go.

408
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,960
It's nice to be young.

409
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,393
All it takes is the simplest of reasons to make a decision.

410
00:36:07,393 --> 00:36:10,591

411
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,240
We're almost at Prince Jingyu's Mansion, right?

412
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,600
There's still the last batch of Shadow Guards.

413
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,260
They're one of the Shadow Sect's most powerful guards in Tianqi City.

414
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,700
They're guarding Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

415
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,840
They're called the Eagle's Eyes and there are six of them.

416
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,680
They're not easy to deal with.

417
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,080
Apart from the Shadow Sect's guards,

418
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,480
there are other experts in Prince Jingyu's Mansion, right?

419
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,520
Prince Jingyu isn't skilled in martial arts

420
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,640
but he has a younger brother named Xiao Ruofeng.

421
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,520
A disciple of the Academy's Mister Li.

422
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,060
It's him.

423
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,600
Forget all that!

424
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,620
It's a matter of life and death so let's fight for it!

425
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,560
It's rare to see you speak so loudly.

426
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,360
They're coming one group after another and we're just the two of us.

427
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,280
No one will come to help us.

428
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,480
Who says you have no help?

429
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,240
Dongjun, what brings you here?

430
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,130
Brother Yun. You should have asked me along to do something as fun as bride snatching.

431
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,840
Ye Dingzhi, who are these two?

432
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,260
I'm Baili Dongjun. This is my good friend, Sikong Changfeng.

433
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,360
We're here to help you.

434
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,020
Do you know that the person we want to kidnap is the princess consort?

435
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,140
It's not just a capital offense.

436
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,460
It's a serious offense that will result in the extermination of your entire family.

437
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,980
Brother Luo is right.

438
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,040
Don't give those people in the imperial court leverage to implicate your family.

439
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,060
Brother Yun, don't try to talk me out of it. Back then I was too young to help you.

440
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,640
Now I have a sword in my hand.

441
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,940
Whatever you want to do, I'll be there with you.

442
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,660
I'm a nobody so I don't need a mask.

443
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,080
Their reinforcements are here.

444
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,460
Ye Dingzhi, take someone with you and go first.

445
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,820
Leave this to me.

446
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,260
Luo Qingyang said this is the strongest Shadow Guard, the Eagle's Eyes.

447
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,020
The two of you can stop here.

448
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,666

449
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,100
Some people are trying to kidnap the bride.

450
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,020
Kidnap the bride?

451
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,077
Although Dongjun wears a mask,

452
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:09,500
Dustless and the Instant Kill Sword Arts passed down from you are recognizable.

453
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,220
What?

454
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,100
It's Dongjun who wants to take the bride?

455
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,980
It's not him.

456
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,380
It's General Ye's youngest son, Ye Yun.

457
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,260
Junior is helping him.

458
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,060
Ye Yun?

459
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,460
Your...

460
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,300
Your swordsmanship is unique.

461
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,860
It's useless even if you wear a mask.

462
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,700
I can't hide it from you.

463
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,340
- Senior, you're not going to make it. 
 - I know.

464
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,740
But if I don't try, I'll regret it forever.

465
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,280
Senior, run!

466
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,160
Sikong Changfeng, go find them first.

467
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,820
Leave this to me.

468
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,540
This person's hard to deal with.

469
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,300
Everyone in the Shadow Guard combined wouldn't be as strong as him.

470
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,760
I know better than anyone else how difficult he is to deal with

471
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,900
because he's my master.

472
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,860
Don't worry. He won't kill me.

473
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,360
Okay.

474
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,380
He's your partner?

475
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,900
Leaving you behind just like that?

476
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,940
This was supposed to be my business alone.

477
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,920
Brother Yun, leave this to me.

478
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,700
Don't worry, just go.

479
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:53,260
Love and brotherhood are the purest and most wonderful things in the world.

480
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,440
I will never let foul men tarnish them.

481
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,040
However, you have to remember one thing.

482
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
If something like this happens to me in the future,

483
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,938
remember to draw your sword and save me

484
00:41:04,938 --> 00:41:10,060
because I don't want to let go of the girl I love either.

485
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,640
All right.

486
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,100
I'm here!

487
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,420
Changfeng. Where's Senior Luo?

488
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,880
He told me to come find you first.

489
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,500
What you just said was good.

490
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,780
It reminded me of my beloved too.

491
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,580
You have a beloved too?

492
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,100
- Could it be... 
 - Cut the crap. Let's fight.

493
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,140
All right. Brother Yun, leave this to us.

494
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,980
Go and save your beloved.

495
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,060
Dongjun.

496
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:38,980
As long as I don't die, you and your beloved will definitely be together forever.

497
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,060
Make sure you won't die then.

498
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,041

499
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,760

500
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:04,970

501
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:16,350
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

502
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:24,080
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

503
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:33,740
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

504
00:42:34,716 --> 00:42:41,960
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

505
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,037
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

506
00:42:45,037 --> 00:42:47,435
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

507
00:42:47,435 --> 00:42:51,720
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

508
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,380
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

509
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,760
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

510
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,620
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

511
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,240
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

512
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,660
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

513
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:14,120
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

514
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,420
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

515
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:23,300
♫  I met you  ♫

516
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:07,388
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

517
00:44:07,388 --> 00:44:15,260
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

518
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:24,795
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

519
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:33,060
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

520
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,120
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

521
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,520
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

522
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,868
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

530
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:14,260
♫  I met you  ♫
