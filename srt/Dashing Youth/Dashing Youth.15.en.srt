00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,380
And,

189
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,140
fate has led us

190
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,540
to encounter each other again.

191
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,780
We became

192
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,420
good friends who together went
through life-or-death experiences.

193
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,740
Don't you think

194
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,180
my long-lost best friend

195
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,060
has returned

196
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,620
is something

197
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,780
worth celebrating?

198
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,860
But you're still young.

199
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,260
How can you say
that he is your best friend for life?

200
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,900
Yes.

201
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,140
I know it.

202
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
From the past to the present,

203
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,660
to the future,

204
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,340
and to the time

205
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,500
I die,

206
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,260
he'll surely be

207
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,900
my best friend for life.

208
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,540
Maybe I'll encounter

209
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,900
other friends after this.

210
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,980
Maybe they know me well

211
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,220
and are my bosom friends.

212
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,180
But none of them can be my best friend.

213
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,540
If so, in your terms,

214
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,940
what's a best friend?

215
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,500
To me,

216
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,060
encountering the person

217
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,340
whom you can never forget
at the best moment,

218
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,540
that can be defined as my best friend.

219
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,820
After that,

220
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,380
no matter where the others come from,

221
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,220
they are not as close to me

222
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,300
as him.

223
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,900
But...

224
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,620
But now, I think

225
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,180
he's in some trouble.

226
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,700
But it's fine.

227
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,100
I'm no longer the past me.

228
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,060
I'm very powerful now.

229
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,340
I'll surely protect him.

230
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,740
What happened in the past
won't happen again.

231
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,260
I'll make sure it doesn't happen.

232
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,700
It's nice

233
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,420
to be your best friend.

234
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,740
You're still alive.

235
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:35,940
Excellent.

236
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,740
Senior Luo.

237
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,620
Wenjun, she...

238
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,700
As you can see,

239
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,940
she doesn't like Prince Jingyu.

240
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,100
But she needs to be married to him

241
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,860
in six months.

242
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,420
Ye Yun.

243
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,020
If only you showed up

244
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,260
just a little sooner.

245
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
It's not too late now.

246
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,300
Senior Luo.

247
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,260
It's never too late

248
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,940
as long as I'm back.

249
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,780
Lei'er, are you saying

250
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,700
that Ye Dingzhi

251
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,020
is at the side chamber
of Prince Jingyu's Mansion?

252
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,260
Master, you must be drunk.

253
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,140
I already clearly explained it
to you last night.

254
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,580
How could that be?

255
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,220
Although Ruojin

256
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,460
never liked Prince Qing,

257
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,940
he once promised me

258
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,420
that he wouldn't drag the Academy down.

259
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,140
This should have nothing
to do with Ruojin.

260
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,300
Why don't I ask him directly?

261
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,340
No need for that.

262
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,140
Since we hope

263
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,900
that he can have

264
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,060
a safe place to hide,

265
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,580
and since that place is safe,

266
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,060
there's no need for us
to go through additional trouble.

267
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,860
You're right, Master.

268
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,500
However,

269
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,660
it's inappropriate

270
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,700
for him

271
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,420
to stay there for long.

272
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,900
According to what I know,

273
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,180
besides Senior Luo

274
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,740
from the Shadow Sect,

275
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,260
my future sister-in-law

276
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,460
is also at that side chamber.

277
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,900
Don't worry.

278
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,500
Since we all know

279
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,340
where he is,

280
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,740
I'll bring him back.

281
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,140
You can stay out of this.

282
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,740
Dongba,

283
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,340
have a good rest for the next few days.

284
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,460
I'll take you to meet your friend

285
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,140
in a few more days.

286
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,260
After that, I'll see him off.

287
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,380
Why are you trying to send him away?

288
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,580
I haven't gotten
to catch up with him yet.

289
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,340
Catch up with him?

290
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,980
You can catch up with him

291
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,780
in Nanjue.

292
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,620
Everyone is trying to arrest him now.

293
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,980
Which do you think is more important?
His life?

294
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,300
Or you catching up with him?

295
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,420
Dumb boy.

296
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,900
Of course, it's...

297
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,660
Fine.

298
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,580
You had to cook for me

299
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,820
for the past few days.

300
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,580
Today, you can try my cooking.

301
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,420
I have a nickname.

302
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,220
I know.

303
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,340
The Steppe's God of Cooking.

304
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,180
You actually remember?

305
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,340
Yun, I remember every word you said.

306
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,740
Hurry and try it.

307
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,060
It's delicious.

308
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,820
If so, you should eat up.

309
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,900
The beef here isn't nice.

310
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,940
The meat of cattle raised on the steppe

311
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,020
is the best.

312
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,100
It's a shame that I can't try it.

313
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,980
You can try it if you want to.

314
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,980
You can try everything you want.

315
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,740
If you wish to try that,

316
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,260
you can visit the steppe.

317
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,860
If you wish to pray to Buddha statues
in the Buddhist States,

318
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,220
you can head to the Buddhist States.

319
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,820
If you wish to try
the herbal tea of Nanjue,

320
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,020
you can head to Nanjue.

321
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,580
If you want to travel east by boat,

322
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,780
you can head
to the largest port in the east

323
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,020
and set sail.

324
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,260
The world is vast.

325
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,020
It's not like Tianqi,
which is just a cage.

326
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,380
Yun.

327
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,260
I...

328
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,620
I can't visit those places.

329
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,740
You can visit those places.

330
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,580
It's because I'll take you there.

331
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,300
No.

332
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,500
What's wrong,

333
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,060
Wenjun?

334
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,180
Yun.

335
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,060
Ye Yun, listen to me.

336
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,180
Five years ago,

337
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,300
Prince Jingyu took a liking to me.

338
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,820
Since then,

339
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,300
I've been trapped in this cage.

340
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,780
Back then, I was still writing

341
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,260
to Dongjun.

342
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,660
Initially, I wanted
to tell him about it.

343
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,660
But Father

344
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,260
tampered with my letters.

345
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,700
He lied to Dongjun

346
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,540
that I left Tianqi

347
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,620
and was traveling the world.

348
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,100
My marriage

349
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,940
became a marriage alliance

350
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,500
between Prince Jingyu
and the Shadow Sect.

351
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,020
They have set up layers of defenses

352
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,020
to keep an eye on me.

353
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,660
And Senior Luo...

354
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,020
is the first layer of defense.

355
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,900
I wasn't willing to submit to fate.

356
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,580
I tried to escape this place

357
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,820
using all kinds of methods.

358
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,820
When you appeared suddenly that day,

359
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,900
I thought there was a hope.

360
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,180
If so, why are you...

361
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,660
I know you're very powerful.

362
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,900
I got to know your temperament

363
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,020
during our interactions.

364
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,260
If I do request you

365
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,660
to take me with you,

366
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,180
I'm sure you'll definitely agree to it.

367
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,340
And everything

368
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,340
can go according to my plan.

369
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
That is

370
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,020
if you weren't Ye Yun.

371
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,580
But you are.

372
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,580
You're the person
I love with all my heart.

373
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,900
That's why I cannot implicate you.

374
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,340
Just leave.

375
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,780
Leave Tianqi now.

376
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,740
I'm not leaving.

377
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,300
It's either we leave together,
or we stay here together.

378
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,260
The weather today is great.

379
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,260
It's appropriate for a trip,

380
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,700
especially a long trip

381
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,580
that we'll never return from.

382
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,900
You two won't be able to leave.

383
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,020
Senior Luo.

384
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,220
Even if I do let you two leave,

385
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,220
you won't be able
to leave Tianqi City.

386
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,780
Wenjun.

387
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,020
You know this too.

388
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,820
If so, Senior Luo...

389
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,660
Pardon me for the offense.

390
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,220
Have you lost your mind?

391
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,940
You haven't recovered yet!

392
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,780
I think I've lost my mind as well.

393
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,020
But I have no choice.

394
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,580
Young man,

395
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,940
you should take care of your body.

396
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,020
Why are you acting like your master?

397
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,700
You shouldn't risk your life
just to win.

398
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,260
Mr. Li.

399
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,020
Very well.

400
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,260
Although your master, Yi,

401
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,260
is a useless fool,

402
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,020
you're pretty good.

403
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,700
Mr. Li, may I know

404
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,060
what brings you here?

405
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,300
I'm here to take him away.

406
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,260
I'm not leaving.

407
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,260
You really enjoy being here together
with this beauty, aren't you?

408
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,460
Your master has already

409
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,820
arrived at Tianqi City
and launched an attack in advance.

410
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,820
Are you sure you can still stay here

411
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,700
in peace?

412
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,900
Luckily, I didn't take you
as my disciple.

413
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,300
If not, I'll be so angry because of you.

414
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,500
But I...

415
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,740
But what?

416
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,060
Do you wish to take her with you?

417
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,500
But you might not even be able

418
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,740
to defeat this man in front of you.

419
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,260
Even if you do defeat him,

420
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,180
you still have to go through

421
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,740
Shadow Sect's Four Bodyguards in Tianqi.

422
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,340
And also her father,

423
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,260
Yi Bu, the sect leader of Shadow Sect.

424
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,820
Do you think you can defeat all of them?

425
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,260
Listen.

426
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,500
In Tianqi City,

427
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,100
there's only one way for you

428
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,780
to take her with you on your own.

429
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,900
What way?

430
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,740
What way?

431
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,660
Sir, can you please tell me?

432
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,780
That is for me to take action.

433
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,540
Sir, do you mean...

434
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,220
You can keep on dreaming.

435
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,700
Naturally, I'm not going to take action.

436
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,020
What I meant was,

437
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,660
if you wish to achieve your wish,

438
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,180
you have to make yourself

439
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,820
stronger

440
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,060
until you become the strongest.

441
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,500
Beauty,

442
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,100
don't you agree?

443
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,500
Sir, you do have a point.

444
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,660
You're an exquisite beauty indeed.

445
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,300
You're really beautiful.

446
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,900
I think I won't be able
to resist my urge

447
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,820
to take you with me in advance

448
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,260
had I been 100 years younger.

449
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,900
You do have a good taste.

450
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,820
Enough already.

451
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,100
I promised your master

452
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,020
that I would leave Tianqi
with you in three days.

453
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,260
Let's depart.

454
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,580
But I...

455
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,540
Yun.

456
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,780
You should hurry and leave.

457
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,260
Six months.

458
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,020
Wait for me for six months.

459
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,460
I will be back.

460
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,060
Okay.

461
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,060
Sir, wait.

462
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,900
What? You still can't bear

463
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,100
to part with that beautiful lady?

464
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,380
Actually,

465
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,420
I came to Tianqi
because I had something to accomplish.

466
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,260
I don't wish to leave

467
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,860
without accomplishing it.

468
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,580
Do you intend to kill Prince Qing?

469
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,940
Sir, you know about it?

470
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,420
Right.

471
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,660
You're Mr. Li, who knows
everything about everything.

472
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,020
You're just being stupid.

473
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,700
I'm not.

474
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,180
Don't refute me yet.

475
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,380
Back then, General Ye's subordinates

476
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,500
risked their lives to rescue you.

477
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,100
And now you intend to kill Prince Qing?

478
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,220
With what identity?

479
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,700
As one of the remaining rebels?

480
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,180
Or as an escaped criminal of Beili?

481
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,940
If so, Prince Qing

482
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,420
will die an honorable death.

483
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,780
He punished the rebels of the Ye Family

484
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,340
to uphold justice.

485
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,460
However, someone
sought revenge against him

486
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,580
and he died for the sake of the state.

487
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,740
What should I do, then?

488
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,260
Prince Qing should be killed.

489
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,380
However, you shouldn't be
the one killing him.

490
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,380
You should let
people of the world kill him.

491
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,420
If you kill him easily,

492
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,900
General Ye

493
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,660
will never have his name cleared.

494
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,660
But don't worry.

495
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,140
Regarding the case
of the General's Mansion,

496
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,340
Ruofeng has been

497
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,580
investigating it in secret
all these years.

498
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,100
He's gathering evidence that could
prove your family's innocence.

499
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,420
However, this is a major case.

500
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,700
It has deep implications.

501
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,140
We still need time.

502
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,660
I understand now.

503
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,500
My father

504
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,580
and my whole mansion

505
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,180
must have their reputation cleared.

506
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,340
We must make the people

507
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,620
turn on Prince Qing.

508
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,860
All right.

509
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,660
I trust you and Little Master.

510
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,980
Smart boy.

511
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,620
All right now.

512
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,770
I'll take you to your friend.

513
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,620
Although they're gone,

514
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,940
you still have a friend left
in this world.

515
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,540
When an old friend leaves,

516
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,060
one should offer
willow branches as a farewell.

517
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,140
Firstly, it's a sign
of their reluctance to part.

518
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,180
Secondly, it's to remember the bond.

519
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,660
I should forget it.

520
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,860
This is too embarrassing.

521
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,860
Yun.

522
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,460
Dongjun.

523
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,220
Dongjun!

524
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,300
Yun.

525
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,260
You're alive.

526
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,340
This is great.

527
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,540
So you shouldn't look so upset

528
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,700
whenever you mention my name.

529
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,060
If one should die, you should die first.

530
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,660
If not, we can die together.

531
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:00,940
When gentlemen part ways,

532
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,300
a brief chat is enough.

533
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,460
Don't be so long-winded.

534
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,540
Stop nagging each other.

535
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,580
Dongjun, I know

536
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,060
how much I mean to you.

537
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,100
Dongjun.

538
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,940
That's all for now.

539
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,940
Now that we're parting ways,

540
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,140
I don't know when we'll meet again.

541
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,500
I hope that I am already the Sword Deity

542
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,100
and you're the Liquor Deity

543
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,220
when we meet again.

544
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,980
When we meet again,

545
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,420
I'm sure we're still the same us.

546
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,620
How sentimental.

547
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:40,860
See you.

548
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,860
Yun, wait.

549
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,140
This is for you.

550
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,820
A willow branch as a sign of farewell?

551
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,740
I've only read about this
in the books, you know?

552
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,620
Yun.

553
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,580
Take care.

554
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:18,900
Dongjun.

555
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,580
Take care.

556
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,740
You'll get yourself

557
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,420
another sworn friend soon.

558
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,140
I've got one.

559
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,540
However,

560
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,500
I think he's almost dead.

561
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,740
It's been a long time

562
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,740
since I received his letter.

563
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,100
Who was jinxing me?

564
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,460
Seems like you don't pay much attention

565
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,780
to that friend of yours.

566
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,220
Master, you're pretty dumb too.

567
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,260
I was just joking with you.

568
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,180
That friend of mine is very lucky.

569
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,220
He won't die that easily.

570
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Did you just call me dumb?

571
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,380
Let's go.

572
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,180
Master,

573
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,340
what took you so long?

574
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,100
It's a long story.

575
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,740
I'll summarize it for you.

576
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,060
Even heroes have a weakness
for the charms of a beautiful woman.

577
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,460
What does that mean?

578
00:33:59,340 --> 00:33:59,780
Dongba,

579
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,300
do you have a girl you fancy?

580
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,100
I do.

581
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,540
We promised to meet each other again.

582
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,300
When?

583
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,180
When I make a name for myself.

584
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,940
Why do you fancy her?

585
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,620
Because I fell for her at first glance.

586
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,020
But you don't know about her age,

587
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,380
her personality,

588
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,180
or her background.

589
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,100
You just fell for her at first glance?

590
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,940
It's not that complicated

591
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,900
to fall for a person.

592
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,220
Isn't love at first sight
more than enough?

593
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,180
She's the first girl

594
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,460
I truly fancy.

595
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,260
Even if I do encounter

596
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,620
other people in the future,

597
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,860
I'll tell myself

598
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,060
that I already have someone I fancy.

599
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,180
You're right.

600
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,780
I actually can't refute your words.

601
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,460
Master, what about you?

602
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,540
Do you have a girl you fancy?

603
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:40,980
I do.

604
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,660
Where is she?

605
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,500
All of them are dead.

606
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,260
It's because I've lived for too long.

607
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,020
That's why all of them are dead.

608
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,180
Wait.

609
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,420
Them?

610
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,220
That's right.

611
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,100
When my first wife

612
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,580
passed away,

613
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,020
I swore

614
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,420
that I would never marry another person.

615
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,460
But after that,

616
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,900
I thought to myself
that since so many ladies

617
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,820
were in love with me,

618
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,340
I would be letting them down

619
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,100
if I didn't appreciate their love.

620
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,660
There are many stories about them.

621
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,900
It breaks my heart
when I think about them.

622
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,700
It breaks my heart indeed.

If so,

749
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,740
where's my master?

750
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,420
Even Luoxia has moved

751
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,300
to Senior Liu Yue's residence

752
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,100
to learn martial arts from him.

753
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:50,980
But my master?

754
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,100
He's busy

755
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,780
with everything

756
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,420
except for teaching me martial arts.

757
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:55,980
Although

758
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,500
you're getting yourself a master
in order to learn martial arts,

759
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,900
Master didn't say

760
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,300
that he was going to teach you, right?

761
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,180
Disciples have to learn
the skills by themselves.

762
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,900
If so, what's the use
of getting myself a master, then?

763
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,140
Of course

764
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,460
it's for you to say his name

765
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,660
and terrify your foes

766
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,860
when you're being bullied

767
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:13,780
outside.

768
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,540
This is so boring!

769
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,860
I'll bring you somewhere

770
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,820
that's not boring, then.

771
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,500
Dongba?
