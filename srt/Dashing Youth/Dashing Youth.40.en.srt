you shouldn't go there either.

The place you should be

56
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,020
is the bustling

more than enough for us.

If you take this step,

63
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,660
you will turn against everyone.

64

65

71
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,780

Qingyang,

78
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,420
if he ever calls me that again,

79
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,860
kill him.

80
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,660
All right.

81
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,700
How ironic.

82
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,900
The one who eventually kills me

83
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,140
is you.

84
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,700

85
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,700

98
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,380

105
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,340

instead of me?

115
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,220

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,740
When you two

189
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,460
heard this just now,

190
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,740
your eyes were shining.

191
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,300
When I turn 20

192
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,340
and you 18,

193
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,620
let's leave Tianqi.

194
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,540
One of us will head north
and the other south,

195
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,220
venturing into
the martial arts world separately.

196
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,100
Once we both become deities,

197
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,700
we will meet again.

198
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,580
You want to be a Deity Sword,

199
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,020
so I won't compete with you.

200
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,580
The good friend
of the White Feather Sword Deity

201
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,420
is the Liquor Deity.

202
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,820
If so, I will be a Liquor Deity.

203
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,820
Well, then.

204
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,900
We will carry our liquor and sword

205
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,060
to roam the martial arts world!

206
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,820
Let's carry liquor and swords
to roam the martial arts world!

207
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,780
Heroes are born in times of turmoil.

208
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,260
Travel proudly with a sword
and press ahead.

209
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,540
Every individual
eventually becomes bones.

210
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,220
Think of youthful memories with a sigh.

211
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,980
As the legend goes, the White Feather
Sword Deity of the previous dynasty

212
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,580
wielded his sword

213
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,500
to cut through the plaque of Tianqi

214
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,460
and crush numerous armored armies

215
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,620
before leaving the city
with his disciple.

216
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,620
Seeing

217
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,020
his beloved woman

218
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,380
and the friend

219
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,860
who deserves his lifelong trust
at the same time,

220
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,260
the demonic energy in Ye Dingzhi

221
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,260
gradually dispels.

222
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,260
His obsession is finally broken.

223
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,500
He's no longer in the Malevolence Phase.

224
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,860
Isn't that good?

225
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,620
Yes, it is.

226
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,900
But since his obsession is broken,

227
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,020
it means

228
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,620
he has returned
to the previous Ye Dingzhi.

229
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,460
If the previous Ye Dingzhi

230
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,860
finds out what he has done

231
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,260
and the situation his friend

232
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,100
and beloved woman

233
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,260
are facing,

234
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,500
he won't have a second option.

235
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,140
The path in the martial arts world
is long.

236
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,740
Still, there is an end to it.

237
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,780
So long as the dream within stays alive,

238
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,260
it will reignite one day.

239
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,860
This shall be the end of the tale
of the White Feather Sword Deity.

240
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,980
Who

241
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,860
will be the next Sword Deity?

242
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,660
I wish I could turn back time.

243
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,140
- Yun!
- Yun!

244
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,740
Yun!

245
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,100
Yun!

246
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,460
I thought he was a spent force.

247
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,780
I didn't expect

248
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,020
his remaining power to be this abundant.

249
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,500
He is dissipating his power.

250
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,460
He's dispersed

251
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,740
all of his internal strength.

252
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,260
A thought is caught
between good and evil.

253
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,340
Whatever it has been,

254
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,300
Ye Dingzhi

255
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,300
deserves respect.

256
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,780
Yun!

257
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,100
Wenjun.

258

Yun.

259
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,340
After you left,

260
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,340
I always feared

261
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,660
that I would never see you again.

262
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,500
This feeling had been gnawing

263
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,740
and slowly taking hold of me.

264
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
Yun.

265
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,260
So I decided to fight all I had

266
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,460
to get you out

267
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,900
of that place again.

268
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,740
Yun,

269
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,500
let's leave this place.

270
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,300
Let's leave here, all right?

271
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,820
But there is something

272
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,100
I must tell you.

273
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,700
I never doubted

274
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,180
that you would stay for me.

275
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
All through my life,

276
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,500
I have never blamed you.

277
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,780

the head of the demonic sect,
Ye Dingzhi,

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,980
Xiao Ruofeng, Prince Langya,

377
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,660
and Lei Mengsha, the Chief General,

378
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,740
succeeded on their battlegrounds.

379
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,220
Aside from them,

380
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,740
the remaining young masters
retired to the martial arts world.

381
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,260
In the early summer
of the eighth year of Mingde's era,

382
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,740
Prince Langya proved the suspicions

383
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
of wronged treason
against General Dingyuan

384
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,780
and reopened the case,

385
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,340
which shocked the imperial court.

386
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,900
The people were in grief

387
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,460
over the aggrieved General Dingyuan

388
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,660
and appreciated
the benign Prince Langya.

389
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,540
The whole nation united in harmony

390
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,500
and ushered in
a peaceful and prosperous time

391
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,540
for the Beili Dynasty.

392
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,760
[Tomb of Ye Dingzhi]

393
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,780
Wenjun.

394
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,260
I suppose I should

395
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,500
call you Sister-in-law.

396
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,380
I didn't expect

397
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,580
we would meet again

398
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,820
in such a situation

399
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,620
20 years later.

400
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,540
I wonder

401
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,740
what your plan is.

402
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,740
The one I worry about the most

403
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,700
is Anshi.

404
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,020
Anshi should be

405
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,700
with those of Sky's Beyond.

406
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,620
Now that Yun is gone,

407
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,940
Sky's Beyond is probably in a mess.

408
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,220
Ye Anshi's identity is sensitive.

409
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,380
I'm afraid he might be in trouble.

410
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,260
Indeed.

411
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,460
I want to look for him.

412
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,900
Given your identity,

413
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,660
it's better not

414
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,820
to show up before them.

415
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,300
Leave it to me.

416
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,580
You shouldn't have left
in the first place.

417
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,020
Baili Dongjun.

418
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,300
Yun didn't blame you.

419
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,780
But

420
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,820
I do.

421
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,180
He liked you so much, after all.

422
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,220
See you, Wenjun.

423
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,620
I will bring Yun and your child

424
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,300
back.

425
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,060
I will also send those from the icefield

426
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,300
back to their homes.

427
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,780
Everything will be fine.

428
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,660
It's just that...

429
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,380
Yun will never come back.

430
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,020
Yes.

431
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,860
He will never come back.

432
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,940
Grand Eunuch Jinxuan.

433
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,180
Your Highness, maybe you should

434
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,740
heed my advice.

435
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,420
The prince is now in the palace,

436
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,340
that's one thing.

437
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,260
Second,

438
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,180
for your other child

439
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,740
to live safely,

440
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,340
I'm afraid Baili Dongjun alone

441
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,900
may not be enough.

442
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,940
Your Highness,

443
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,140
please.

444
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,540
Wenjun.

445
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,380
Wenjun!

446
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,140
The head of the demonic sect is dead.

447
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,740
Surrender his son.

448
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,980
Such audacity.

449
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,340
Baili Dongjun?

450
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,540
Baili Dongjun?

451
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,140
Before this sword is pulled out,

452
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,940
the demonic sect
mustn't leave the mountain,

453
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,140
and Beili mustn't go up the mountain.

454
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,700
If anyone disagrees,

455
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,380
try me.

456
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,300
Can he be so arrogant

457
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,540
after defeating

458
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
Ye Dingzhi?

459
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,540
That's right.

460
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,860
He can be as arrogant as he wants

461
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,700
after defeating Ye Dingzhi.

462
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,580
If not,

463
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,460
you can try and say that louder.

464
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,780
Is this Yun's child?

465
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,380
My name is Ye Anshi.

466
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,540
May I know

467
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,140
if my father is dead?

468
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,940
White-Haired Deity.

469
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,020
Come with me.

470
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,340
Yuji.

471
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,300
Baili Dongjun,

472
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,060
where

473
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,700
is our chief?

474
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,340
He's dead.

475
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,540
Did...

476
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,620
Did you kill him?

477
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,860
What do you think?

478
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,300
Let's negotiate.

479
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,060
Negotiate?

480
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,540
Do we even stand a chance for that?

481
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,860
You do.

482
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,620
I suppose you know better than I do

483
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,740
about your current condition.

484
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,260
If this goes on,

485
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,220
it's meaningless

486
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,020
other than more lives being sacrificed.

487
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,780
Return to the lands
beyond the northern borders.

488
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,380
At least

489
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,940
you still

490
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,140
can safeguard your home.

491
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,780
On what condition?

492
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,300
One person.

493
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,020
You want Young Master?

494
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,940
Chief just passed away

495
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,260
and you want to trade his son

496
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,460
for our lives?

497
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,340
Yuji and I chose to follow Ye Dingzhi

498
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,780
because we truly admired him.

499
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,260
Naturally, we accept his son.

500
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,740
We will never

501
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,500
betray Chief and Young Master.

502
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,220
This is our belief.

503
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,300
If I ever defy it,

504
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,140
I would rather die.

505
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,060
If Ye Anshi

506
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,500
follows you back to Sky's Beyond,

507
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,940
what will happen to him?

508
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,020
When your conquest started,

509
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,940
Ye Dingzhi was a hero to you all.

510
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,620
But what will happen after his death?

511
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,780
His child is only five.

512
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,540
If he follows you back to
the lands beyond the northern borders.,

513
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,060
will he become

514
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,300
a weapon used in power struggle

515
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,540
or a subject

516
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,020
on whom people vent their anger
due to this failure?

517
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,060
Just tell me,

518
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,780
how many years

519
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,060
do you and Marquis Purple Robe need

520
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,380
to rebuild Sky's Beyond

521
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,500
and make all of them

522
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,260
pledge their lifelong loyalty
to Ye Anshi

523
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,340
like both of you do

524
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,380
after returning to the lands
beyond the northern borders?

525
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,140
Six years.

526
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,780
At least six years.

527
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,500
Twelve years.

528
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,340
I will give you twelve years.

529
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,860
Today, I will

530
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,100
make a pact with you.

531
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,220
Within twelve years

532
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,580
from today,

533
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,020
no sects from the lands
beyond the northern borders

534
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,460
shall step into Beili.

535
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,140
Ye Dingzhi's son, Ye Anshi,

536
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,700
will be held in Beili.

537
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,300
Until the period is up,

538
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,300
he shall not leave.

539
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,140
Will you accept this?

540
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,300
I don't believe in Beili,

541
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,620
but I believe in you.

542
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,620
For the coming twelve years,

543
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,300
with your dedicated tutelage,

544
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,020
I believe

545
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,340
Young Master

546
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,700
will not let us down.

547
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,620
I'm not qualified to teach him.

548
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,820
He has a better master.

549
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,460
Who is it?

550
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,700
An old acquaintance.

551
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,660
This blade will serve as the token.

552
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,060
Assemble

553
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,460
all your members remaining in Beili.

554
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,660
Have them keep

555
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,380
their blades

556
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,100
and leave immediately.

557
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
If there is any trace of them in Beili

558
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,620
after fifteen days,

559
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,980
I will kill them myself.

560
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,060
Uh...

561
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,340
Mr. Baili,

562
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,620
well, this decision...

563
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,220
This decision

564
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,380
is made by Xueyue City.

565
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,460
Lei Fortress, Wen Family, Tang Clan,

566
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,220
Heavenly Mountain Sect, Mount Wangcheng,

567
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,500
and the Dark River agreed to it.

568
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,940
Any objections?

569
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,980
No, not at all.

570
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,380
Mr. Zi, I don't want to leave.

571
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,460
Good boy, don't be afraid.

572
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,420
Boy.

573
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,660
Do you still remember your home?

574
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,060
No.

575
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,180
You weren't there

576
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,180
when your father left.

577
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,380
Now, I will take you

578
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,500
to pay your respects to him,

579
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,820
all right?

580
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,740
Does that mean

581
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,020
I can never return here after that?

582
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,460
The word "return" means a lot.

583
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,900
Wherever your home is,

584
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,820
that's where you should return to.

585
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,620
Mr. Mo.

586
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,020
Come on.

587
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,100
Be good and listen to Mr. Baili.

588
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,060
Wait for us to fetch you back.

589
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,580
You will be 17.

590
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,580
By then,

591
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,580
we will bring

592
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,940
everyone from Sky's Beyond

593
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:26,710
to welcome you

594
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,060
at the lands
beyond the northern borders.

595
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,900
On that day,

596
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,980
you shall be

597
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,380
our true Young Master.

598
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,860
Twelve years.

599
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,380
It's long, right?

600
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,340
Very soon.

601
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,900
When you close your eyes
and open them again,

602
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,700
it will be twelve years later.

603
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,020
Life is fleeting, after all.

604
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,980
[One month later]

605
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,020
Third City Lord.

606
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,740
Third City Lord.

607
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,140
What do you want from me?

608
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,020
Why won't you let me out?

609
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,700
Because only you can govern this city.

610
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,620
Why do I

611
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,260
have to do everything here?

612
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,740
Because you are a married man.

613
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,660
So what if I'm married?

614
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,420
So what if I have a family?

615
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,660
I was born clean,

616
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,380
and I will leave clean.

617
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,460
Nothing can constrain me.

618
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,460
So,

619
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,580
are you saying it's your family's fault?

620
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,980
My dear, what brings you here?

621
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,060
It has only been a short while.

622
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,460
But I've already missed you so much.

623
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,420
What did you just say?

624
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,940
Nothing.

625
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,580
I was talking nonsense.

626
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,260
I will deal with you when we get home.

627
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:47,980
Watch your step, my dear.

628
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,900
Are we leaving just like this?

629
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,020
You just got back.

630
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,180
We'd better slip off

631
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,980
before they notice us.

632
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,900
Where are we going, then?

633
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,940
Back to Qiandong City.

634
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,700
Why Qiandong City?

635
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,500
I thought

636
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,140
you were going to roam
the martial arts world.

637
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,060
Why is home your first leg
of the journey?

638
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,780
Because I want to marry you.

639
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,380
Naturally, I have to go home

640
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,860
