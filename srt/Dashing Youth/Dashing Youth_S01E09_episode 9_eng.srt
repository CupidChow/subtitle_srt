1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:15,890

2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,840
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,500
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,540
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,220
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,820
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,540
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,420
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,800

21
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,920

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,640

23
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:51,970

24
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,720
Brother Yun.

25
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,540
Why are you here?

26
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,220
Didn't I say we'd meet again tonight?

27
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,960
Didn't I also say I'm busy tonight?

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,900
And how did you know I was here?

29
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,140
You and Ye Yun are like siblings.

30
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,660
The first thing you would do upon returning to Tianqi is visit him.

31
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,180
Did Master tell you these things?

32
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,980
Do you believe me now?

33
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,980
I'm here, entrusted by Scholarly Deity, to help you.

34
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,660
Do you have any other reason?

35
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,220
I heard the liquor you brew is excellent.

36
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,180
I'll teach you internal strength and you'll give me fine liquor.

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,820
How about that?

38
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,700
It's a deal.

39
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,140
Brother Yun.

40
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,500
I'm leaving now.

41
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,640
Father.

42
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,780
Mother.

43
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,960
I've failed as a son.

44
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,380
I've only now come to visit you.

45
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,800
In the past, I told you...

46
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,580
I didn't want to become a general.

47
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,960
I wanted to be a swordsman who freely roams the Martial World.

48
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,100
Now...

49
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,500
I'm halfway there.

50
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,910
I didn't bring anything good

51
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,940
to see you today.

52
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,340
Let me show you some swordplay.

53
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,160
Father.

54
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,500
Mother.

55
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,310
Wait for me...

56
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:27,720
to clear your grievances.

57
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,740
Come on.

58
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,580
Pick a jar.

59
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,800
One is not enough.

60
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,640
You...

61
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,740
♫  The rain from the mountains comes and the wind blows hard ♫

62
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,260
♫  The red candle moves and the shadows flicker ♫

63
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,060
♫  Everyone's an enemy, gracefully and ready to fly ♫

64
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,260
♫  The world is in chaos, there's instability, Heaven and Earth gather  ♫

65
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,060
♫  Whistling a long song while traveling  ♫

66
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,980
♫  Anticipating impetuous and wild, seemingly unruly  ♫

67
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,940
♫  The youth are pleased  ♫

68
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,240
♫  Who can distinguish from kindness and hatred  ♫

69
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,860
What... What martial art is this?

70
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,980
This is the internal strength you're about to learn.

71
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,551
It's called the Falling Flowers and Flowing Water. 
  (TN: lit. to be utterly defeated)

72
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,420
Falling Flowers and Flowing Water?

73
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,300
♫  The heart is like algae floating on the waves  ♫

74
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
♫  I'm all alone  ♫

75
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,780
♫  The obsession can't be returned  ♫

76
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,460
It seems this person is the one who snuck into the Academy in broad daylight.

77
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,900
Such splendid skills.

78
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,300
How can you still appreciate his martial arts?

79
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,460
Baili Dongjun was targeted by various people as soon as he entered the city.

80
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,060
No, I have to check on him.

81
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,060
It's indeed good liquor.

82
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,160
It's a pity to waste a couple of drops.

83
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,200
It's a hidden weapon. Old Seven, let's go and deal with him.

84
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,340
What hidden weapon?

85
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,140
It's just a drop of liquor.

86
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,380
Rest assured, this person means no harm.

87
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,200
He just greeted us a moment ago.

88
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,620
What does that mean? Do...

89
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,100
Do you know him?

90
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,230
Wait, why didn't you tell me that you know him?

91
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,920
Who is he?

92
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,680
I brought Baili Dongjun here.

93
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,900
- Why are you more anxious than me? 
 - I was—

94
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,240
He is the Chief of Baixiao Hall, Ji Ruofeng.

95
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,960
He's an old acquaintance of Scholarly Deity's.

96
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,600
He's willing to teach Baili Dongjun Scholarly Deity's Autumn Water Technique.

97
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,800
Did you think I'd ask Dongjun to learn the Lei Clan's clumsy internal strength technique?

98
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,340
- I-I... 
 - Then he wouldn't pass the Academy's exam in 10 years.

99
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,000
Am I...

100
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,980
Am I clumsy?

101
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,940
From now on you'll give me five jars of liquor for every visit.

102
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,900
- How about that? 
 - Don't overdo it.

103
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,100
You can brew more when the liquor runs out.

104
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,600
But if you fail the Academy exam, there won't be another chance.

105
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,560
It seems the liquor I brew is really too good.

106
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,100
Come on. Although there isn't much time left,

107
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,820
it shouldn't be a big problem for you.

108
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,660
Young Master, there are only three days left until the preliminary exam.

109
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,900
Have you finished writing the exam questions?

110
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,680
Didn't you already say the exam is in three days?

111
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,460
Why are you in such a hurry?

112
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,140
I'm not in a hurry. Why would I be in a hurry?

113
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,780
- I just think that maybe we... 
 - Why?

114
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,660
Everyone is afraid to ask me directly so they pressure you instead?

115
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,340
Am I right?

116
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,780
It's really exhausting for anyone when they ask three or four times a day.

117
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,400
In previous years, there were hints given seven days before the preliminary exam.

118
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,540
Are you really going to wait until the last day to announce it this time?

119
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,160
Isn't it normal procedure to announce it on the last day?

120
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,740
Why? Has the Academy become shameless now?

121
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,720
Is leaking exam questions in advance an unspoken rule now?

122
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,800
Liuyue, the preliminary exam doesn't determine the final result.

123
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,060
There's still a final examination after the preliminary exam.

124
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,140
The finals, which involve teams competing against one another,  have remained unchanged for decades.

125
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,240
That is where the candidates true strengths are tested.

126
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,580
The preliminary exam is just for the young men to bring home some good omens.

127
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,400
Don't take it so seriously, Liuyue.

128
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,980
Young Master Zhuomo is right.

129
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,740
With Young Master Liuyue's talent,

130
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,040
even if the exam questions were disclosed in advance,

131
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,000
- it would still be pointless if the candidates have no abilities. 
 - That's right.

132
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,980
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

133
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,020
- Do you still want to play? 
 - No.

134
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,300
I can't win against you anyway.

135
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,680
I was just wondering...

136
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,880
why you would suddenly come to play GO with me today and humiliate yourself.

137
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,680
It turns out you also came for the exam questions.

138
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,080
Well, I brought a friend here who is preparing for the exam.

139
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,800
Besides, I could find out the questions 10 days in advance in previous years.

140
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,040
Who knew you would be the chief examiner this time?

141
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,220
Excellent, really excellent.

142
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,260
That's why I'm visiting you personally.

143
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,200
- What if I insist on announcing the questions on the last day? 
 - Fine.

144
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,240
It seems you'll be the chief examiner every year from now on.

145
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,120
- Are you threatening me? 
 - Yes, I'm threatening you. So what?

146
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,480
You do know I'm very talkative.

147
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,320
I'll go to Master every day and sway him.

148
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,900
I'll tell him you are an excellent chief examiner.

149
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,240
I'll keep persuading him until he gets annoyed and agrees to make you the chief examiner every year.

150
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,660
- Fine. 
 - Year after year.

151
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,900
I surrender.

152
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,100

153
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,860
Beyond civil and military.

154
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,620
That's right. It's Beyond Civil and Military.

155
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,740
Major exams in the world are divided into civil and military categories.

156
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,400
But there are so many interesting things beyond these two categories.

157
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,660
So I won't test civil or military subjects.

158
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,540
So long as this topic has something that impresses me,

159
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,740
I'll let them pass the preliminary exam.

160
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,500
This is worse than saying nothing.

161
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,860
But what exactly is tested if it has nothing to do with civil or military subjects?

162
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,940
You need to know that our academy not only seeks people who excel in both these skills,

163
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,880
but also those who are interesting.

164
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,580
My topic is to test the candidates themselves.

165
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,760
Liuyue. You're giving me special treatment here.

166
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,120
Don't pin that on me.

167
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,200
What I said was from the bottom of my heart, and has nothing to do with your friend.

168
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,940
I got it.

169
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:12,140
By the way, how is that young man doing?

170
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:17,200
I have no idea. I haven't seen him in days.

171
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,320
That feels great. Having internal strength sure makes a big difference.

172
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,640
Is Lei Mengsha at the Academy today?

173
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,820
How would I know Young Master Zhuomo's whereabouts?

174
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,220
Where are your manners?

175
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,020
What's up? Do you need something from me today?

176
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,780
I have good news for you.

177
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,080
- What a coincidence. I have good news for you too. 
 - Really? You go first.

178
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,980
Listen.

179
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,540
The topic for the preliminary exam is out.

180
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,500
It is? What's the topic?

181
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Four words.

182
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,660
Beyond Civil and Military.

183
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,220
What's wrong? Are you so happy you're stunned? That expression...

184
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,240
Wait. With your mediocre civil and military skills, Beyond Civil and Military" is quite a good topic.

185
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,680
Beyond Civil and Military?

186
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,220
I've been practicing martial arts for days and now you say Beyond Civil and Military is the topic?

187
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,140
This is so irritating!

188
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,760
This is ridiculous. Beyond Civil and Military isn't testing civil or military skills. How's this an examination?

189
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,680
Then what do you think is being tested?

190
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,280
Maybe whoever looks the best gets into the final exam?

191
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,060
You make a good point. Young Master Liuyue is said to be extraordinarily handsome.

192
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,420
Maybe it really is whoever looks the best meets the requirements.

193
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,920
That young man is very handsome.

194
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,160
If he takes the exam, he will surely pass.

195
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,800
He indeed has an extraordinary presence.

196
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,600
- Thank you for the compliments. 
 - You're most welcome.

197
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,580
Beyond Civil and Military. That's pretty interesting.

198
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,680

199
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,760
Welcome, Miss. Winter will be here soon. Our shop just received a new selection of fabrics.

200
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,100
Owner, make me a set of clothes.

201
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,780
It's urgent. I want them within three days.

202
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,340
Sure.

203
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,880

204
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:54,630

205
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,170

206
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,360
That's enough.

207
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,840
Young Master Liuyue, you always do things in your own way.

208
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,280
This is the first time I've heard of holding the academy's exam in a gambling house.

209
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,320
The so-called exam is actually no different from gambling.

210
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,160
Please elaborate.

211
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,060
Many people have studied hard for ten years for this exam.

212
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,400
It might be the moment for them to create the best performance

213
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,280
or perhaps perform badly with no chance of redemption.

214
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,800
Gambling is the same.

215
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,540
Until you sit at the gambling table no one knows what will happen.

216
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,080
Once you're at the table, the game has just begun.

217
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,280
Well said!

218
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,960
Unless you're cheating.

219
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,680
Why? Someone dares to cheat at Qianjin Gambling House?

220
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,960
Of course not.

221
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,920
That's why we're holding the exam here today.

222
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,580
Young Master Liuyue. You are indeed extraordinary.

223
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,140
Marvelous, truly marvelous.

224
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,020
Even my golden tooth is in awe of you.

225
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,600
Where's Second Master? Wasn't he the one who agreed to lend us this place?

226
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,060
He went to listen to a song. I don't know why he likes listening to songs so much.

227
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,280
He wasn't interested at all in the academy exam.

228
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,940
He only agreed to let you use the place because Young Master Liuyue traded a piece of an old music score with him.

229
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:51,140
Hosting the academy exam here means Qianjin Gambling House loses 10,000 taels of silver a day.

230
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,140
I don't mind.

231
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,320
Master Tu, your losses will be compensated by the Academy tomorrow.

232
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,820
The Academy is really generous.

233
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,440
Excellent. Generous. How nice.

234
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,100
 We can do this!

235
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,380
 We can do this!

236
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,540
 We can do this!

237
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,180
I, Young Master Baili Dongjun, am here.

238
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,300
Who... Who is this?

239
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,980
Who's this?

240
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,900
- Drunk again? 
 - Who's—

241
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,280
You are the expert from Swords Forest. You are—

242
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,560
- Ye Dingzhi. 
 - That's right. You're Ye Dingzhi.

243
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,020
I was drunk that day but I remember your sword technique was good. And you're quite interesting.

244
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,380
I wanted to befriend you but my uncle took me away before I could say anything.

245
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,840
It's not too late now.

246
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,460
You're right.

247
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,510
- Are you here to take the academy exam too? 
 - Of course.

248
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,460

249
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,700
Candidates! Enter immediately!

250
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,460

251
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,020
- You'll pass! 
 - You can do it!

252
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,500
Let's go.

253
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,200
I'm fully prepared this time.

254
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,620
- Are you nervous? 
 - Not really.

255
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,820
Just relax.

256
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,820
It's my first time here.

257
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,940
Could this be the betting odds that Lei Mengsha told me about?

258
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,100
What's this?

259
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,180
I know this. This is a bet set by Qianjin Gambling House.

260
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,700
It's to see who will win first place today.

261
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,260
What does this mean?

262
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,220
What does the "one thousand" next to my name mean?

263
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,790

264
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,680
Does it mean the larger the number, the stronger you are?

265
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:32,100
What are you thinking? The larger the number, the fewer people bet on you. And your odds are higher.

266
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,660
If someone bets one tael of silver on you and you win first place, he will win a 1,000 taels.

267
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,900
But the chances are slim. No one would want to take that risk.

268
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,520
Unlike me, I'm a popular choice with many people betting on me.

269
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,020
So my odds are not...

270
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,870

271
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,540

272
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,140
Wait, it's also 1,000?

273
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,480
You can't even catch a peach thrown by a student from Affiliated Academy.

274
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,220
Your odds could be nothing but 1,000.

275
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,520
The odds at Qianjin House are determined by the number of bets being placed.

276
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,220
I hope you won't mind, Young Master Liuyue.

277
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,740
How could Young Master care about such trivial matters?

278
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,500
Let's go.

279
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,200
Let's begin.

280
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,980
The academy exam is about to begin.

281
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,440
The Beyond Civil and Military exam invites all of you to showcase talents

282
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,760
that are astonishing beyond the realms of arts and martial prowess.

283
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,280
The exam will last 12 hours.

284
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,880
Within these 12 hours, when you feel ready, inform us on what you intend to present.

285
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,920
We will dispatch corresponding examiners to assess you.

286
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,600
If you pass the test you'll proceed to the final examination.

287
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,120
Each candidate is accompanied by an assistant.

288
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,200
You can request your assistant fetch the necessary items you need

289
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,600
to showcase your talent that are outside Qianjin House

290
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,700
Any objections?

291
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,720
Everyone had been informed of this.

292
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
Why are you still asking if there are objections?

293
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,700
It is already futile to object.

294
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,880
This silly boy.

295
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,720
Yes, it's futile.

296
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,700
Let's begin.

297
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,540
Let the exam begin!

298
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,640
It feels like we'll be immediately executed on the spot.

299
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,680
- Assistant. 
 - Assistant.

300
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,300
Assistant.

301
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,920
Assistant.

302
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,920
What can I do for you, Young Master?

303
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,540
Go to Sanlu Inn and find Lei Mengsha. Bring my large parcel to me.

304
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:18,220
- Who are you looking for? 
 - Lei Mengsha, who speaks a lot of nonsense. Go.

305
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,380
What are you planning to do?

306
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,860
You will know soon enough.

307
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,120

308
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,180
Your Highness, the assistants are on the move.

309
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:51,625
I wonder if anyone among them Is capable of helping me ascend the throne.

310
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,840
The Academy is holding the examination today?

311
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

312
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,980
Baili Luochen's grandson, Baili Dongjun, is among the exam candidates.

313
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,840
Why is he in Tianqi City?

314
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,040
It was the Ninth Prince who brought him to Tianqi City.

315
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,440
Is it possible the Ninth Prince also...

316
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,880
You're overthinking it like Old Nine.

317
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,240
I know my son well.

318
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,600
He likely brought Baili Dongjun to Tianqi simply because he admired him.

319
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,340
He wouldn't give that boy a hard time.

320
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:42,140
On the contrary, if Baili Dongjun was in trouble, he'd risk his life to save him.

321
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,360
I'm curious about that.

322
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,640
I've always heard Baili Luochen's only grandson is a notorious playboy.

323
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,780
But unexpectedly he suddenly mastered the Xichu's Sword Song.

324
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,200
And I wonder how he caught the eye of Old Nine.

325
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,060
Your Majesty, you seem to appreciate the Ninth Prince a lot.

326
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,300
You spoke too much.

327
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,120
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

328
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,720
Which other princes have gone to the Academy's exam?

329
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,580
Prince Qing.

330
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,820
Old Second?

331
00:26:20,858 --> 00:26:22,680
Never mind him.

332
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:30,160
These little games they play aren't worth my concern.

333
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,770

334
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,220
Examiner, I wish to present my talent.

335
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,520
So soon?

336
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,200
What's your name? What are you submitting?

337
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,400
I'm Duan Baiyi from Baiyi Sect.

338
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,320
I've studied GO since childhood.

339
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,760
What I intend to present for Beyond Civil and Military is my skill in GO.

340
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,020
Very well.

341
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,660
Please enlighten me, Young Master.

342
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,600
You? You want to play with me?

343
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,160
- How long have you studied GO? 
 - How long have you studied?

344
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,600
Since I was seven, that makes it 17 years.

345
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,600
I started learning at three. That makes it seven years.

346
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,240
That's not a big gap. Let's begin.

347
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
I'm undefeated when I play with black pieces.

348
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,200
You start first.

349
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,720
Sure.

350
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,700
He said he was good at playing GO?

351
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,100
He can't even win against a maidservant.

352
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,680
Being able to persist for so long against Lingsu

353
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,040
while Lingsu is the one playing with the black pieces shows more than just proficiency.

354
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,300
After more than 10 years of hard practice...

355
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,600
I have actually lost to...

356
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,020
a maidservant.

357
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,900
It appears to be a game of GO.

358
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,580
But in reality, it reveals the heart.

359
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,320
Being overly aggressive, the long blade easily breaks.

360
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,360
Your GO skills are excellent.

361
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,780
But you lost to Lingsu, perhaps, because you haven't lost in a long time.

362
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,340
I, on the other hand, lose every day.

363
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,320
Losing today might not be a bad thing.

364
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,000
I, Duan Baiyi, will remember your teaching.

365
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,560
Whose exam assistant is this?

366
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,220
Whose exam assistant is this?

367
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,820
Is he planning to sleep during the preliminary exam?

368
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,460
Thank you.

369
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,780
So it's him.

370
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,400
If he doesn't know anything, sleeping is the best option.

371
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,720
What? Are you really planning to sleep here?

372
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,120
Yes. But why are you as ignorant as they are?

373
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,620
Do you really believe that?

374
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,500
I was just joking.

375
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,960
What did you prepare?

376
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,540
It's arriving right now.

377
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,560
What... What's that?

378
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,340
Freshly slaughtered lamb leg from Beiman. It's still fresh.

379
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,360
This is what I prepared.

380
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,640
Interesting.

381
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,980
Can you tell me what you're planning to do now?

382
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,080
Brew liquor.

383
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,700
Brew liquor?

384
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:55,020
I have no special skills except for brewing liquor, which I learned in childhood.

385
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:00,200
Since this is Beyond Civil and Military, naturally I have to bring out my best skill.

386
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,700
But isn't aged liquor better?

387
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,920
Can you brew good liquor within 12 hours?

388
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,760
That's what you don't know.

389
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,640
Aged liquor has its brewing method.

390
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,420
Freshly brewed liquor also has its brewing method.

391
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,140
There are thousands of liquors in this world.

392
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,300
Each has its own flavor and it's not necessarily better the more it ages.

393
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,860
It's about whether you can drink the one you like.

394
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,060
Don't just look at me. The lamb leg you prepared is still on the table.

395
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,220
I'm on it.

396
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,620
This person is good.

397
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:14,600
This knife skill looks ordinary but the subtleties reveal true mastery.

398
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,640
He can be called a real master.

399
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,160
Send him an invitation after the exam.

400
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,180
What about the young man chosen by Ninth Prince?

401
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,880
You mean the one brought back by Xiao Ruofeng?

402
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,320
Father sent him to Qiandong City and he brought back this person.

403
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,080
What do you think this person's background is?

404
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,540
Who in the entire court can sway those from the Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion?

405
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:53,220
Moreover, Marquis Zhenxi is the biggest obstacle

406
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,040
to my ascension to the throne.

407
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,500
Not bad.

408
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,280
- Are you done with yours? 
 - Yes.

409
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,100
After this, every half hour I need to change the hot water bottle.

410
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,800
This is my secret technique.

411
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,000
When my lamb is roasted, we don't have to worry about dinner anymore.

412
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,500
Lamb paired with wine.

413
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,200
Just imagine how wonderful it will be.

414
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,000
That will depend on how good your lamb tastes.

415
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,100
But you're right about something.

416
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,900
I think we might rank last.

417
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,500
What difference does it make to rank first or last?

418
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
It's fine as long as we get in.

419
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,100
Who says it doesn't matter?

420
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,200
Winning first place means you're the best.

421
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,800
Examiner, I want to present my talent.

422
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,100
Who are you? What do you want to be tested on?

423
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,300
I'm a wanderer in the Martial World. I don't belong to any sect.

424
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm Yan Feifei.

425
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,400
As for the topic, come down and I'll show you.

426
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,000
What do you want to be tested on?

427
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,100
This.

428
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
You stole my token.

429
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,100
Her lightness technique is quite impressive.

430
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,500
Your lightness technique is also amazing.

431
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,300
Stealing sounds so bad.

432
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,400
I call this Sleight of Hand.

433
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,500
In my gambling house, there's even someone who's this flexible.

434
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:57,000
Judging by her skill, she must be the disciple of the Godly Thief, Kong Ling'er.

435
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,400
Give it back to me.

436
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,400
May I ask if this qualifies me to pass the preliminary exam?

437
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,200
Since you want to showcase the art of Sleight of Hand,

438
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,900
I won't be the one to test you.

439
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,100
Sanqin.

440
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,500
I'm Sanqin. You have three chances to steal one thing from me.

441
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,200
How do I know if you have anything on you?

442
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,600
You'll have to figure that out with your skills.

443
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,160
- Is this lightness technique? 
 - Three Steps Cicada Pursuit.

444
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,200
If that's the case, does this still count as Beyond Civil and Military?

445
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,400
Does lightness technique count as martial arts?

446
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,080
I remember reading a novel titled "The Moon."

447
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,600
In it, a swordsman said to a lightness technique expert that lightness technique is not the same as martial arts.

448
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,300
Coincidentally, I read that too.

449
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,600
But later, the lightness technique expert replied to him...

450
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,200
But speed defines the distance between you and me.

451
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,300
Three Flying Swallow Moves?

452
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,400
- Be more careful. 
 - My apologies.

453
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,800
How did I do?

454
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,800
Candidate Yan Feifei has passed the preliminary exam.

455
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,500
Thank you.

456
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,600
- Also... 
 - Examiner.

457
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,200
I want to display my skills too.

458
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,000
Who are you and what do you want to show?

459
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,900
I'm Yin Luoxia. What I want to test is...

460
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,700
 - Thank you for the compliments. 
 - You're welcome.

461
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,600
 Interesting. This person has changed her identity.

462
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,500
What? Is she that beautiful?

463
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,400
You look mesmerized.

464
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,200
It's not that.

465
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,200
Why do her eyes look so familiar?

466
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,900
Why does everyone look familiar to you?

467
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,800
Back in Swords Forest, didn't you find me familiar-looking too?

468
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,200
You've used this trick many times to get close to people, huh?

469
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,100
Don't speak nonsense.

470
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,000
It's impossible. She feels completely different from Miss Fairy.

471
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,900
Let's have a bet.

472
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,500

473
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,260

474
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:55,000

475
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:06,700
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

476
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:14,500
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

477
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:23,900
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

478
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,400
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

479
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,400
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

480
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,800
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

481
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,300
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

482
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,700
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

483
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,100
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

484
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,200
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

485
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,700
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

486
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,100
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

487
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,500
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

488
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,800
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

489
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,500
♫  I met you  ♫

490
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:57,800
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

491
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:05,600
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

492
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:15,100
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

493
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:23,200
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

494
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,500
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

495
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,900
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

496
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,300
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

497
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,900
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

498
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,200
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

499
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,400
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

500
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,800
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

501
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,200
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

502
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,600
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

503
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,000
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

504
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
♫  I met you  ♫
