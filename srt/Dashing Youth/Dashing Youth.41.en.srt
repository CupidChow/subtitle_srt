1
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,480
Who could've thought

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,160
that Mr. Li,

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,870
whose departure stirred up Tianqi,

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,160
is hiding here, drinking?

5
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,280
It has been 30 years.

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,600
Yes, 30 years.

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,920
So, did you come to bid farewell?

8
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,070
Given your character,

9
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,470
by the time

10
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,200
we meet again,

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,150
even if I were still alive,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,390
I would already be an old woman.

13
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,670
I don't like you,

14
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,790
and you don't like me.

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,030
It won't make a difference

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,390
whether you are an old woman

17
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,640
or a pretty lady.

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,480
I won't travel far.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,200
You can carry your guqin

20
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,710
and visit me anytime.

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,870
I will prepare the best liquor for you.

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,710
You're the one who drinks

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,280
not me.

24
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,790
Where's his disciple?

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,310
How is he doing

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,590
right now?

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,310
His disciple?

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,950
He's also my disciple now.

29
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,040
That brat

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,430
has an exceptional talent.

31
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,070
By the time he returns to Tianqi,

32
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,590
he will surely make
the top three in the world.

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,040
Why not the number one?

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,510
Because I have many other disciples.

35
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,230
None of them

36
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,680
are easy to deal with.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,790
I'm leaving.

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,950
Frankly, I always think

39
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,840
that I'm a heartless person.

40
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,560
Because my life is too long,

41
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,840
while yours is too short.

42
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,030
Somehow, I have been
saying goodbyes these days.

43
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,120
The place I'm going isn't far.

44
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,680
It's spring all year round.

45
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,150
I will serve the best liquor.

46
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,150
All right.

47
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,280
The older he gets,
the more naggy he becomes.
