00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,800
♫  I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13

♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,600

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,520

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,540

23
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,100
Father.

25
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,980
Why are you up?

26
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,660
Father.

27
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,180
It's been a long time since I saw you.

28
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,780
You look so lonely.

29
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,420
Can I keep you company?

30
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,780
Uncle Mo said that if you have friends, you won't be alone.

31
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,020
He and Uncle Zi are friends.

32
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,040
Father, where is your friend?

33
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,920
Can we invite him over to stay?

34
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,740
Friend?

35
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
I don't have any friends.

36
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,940
I used to have one.

37
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,000
But I hope...

38
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,160
he no longer thinks of me as a friend.

39
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,380
- Chief. 
 - Chief.

40
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,580
- Xiao Anshi, I'll put you to bed tonight, okay? 
 - Okay.

41
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,540
What's the rush?

42
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,080
Chief, someone sent by Beili has arrived at the border,

43
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,220
and he seems unusual.

44
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,480
Is it...

45
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:37,480
him?

46
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,080
No, it's not him. It's someone else.

47
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,180
Someone you know, Chief.

48
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,020
I just don't get it.

49
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,180
These people are so weak,

50
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,100
yet they still aim to kill the chief of the demonic sect.

51
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,340
Don't you think so, my friend?

52
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,860
Ye Dingzhi.

53
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,120
Sikong Changfeng.

54
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,280
Upon reflection, this is only the third time we've met.

55
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,540
Anyway, in the Martial World, strangers meet by chance.

56
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,120
Three encounters make close friends.

57
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,060
Yes, we were friends.

58
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,740
But... I don't have any now.

59
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,440
You're better than those old geezers down there.

60
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,340
You'll only know if I'm better after a fight.

61
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,680
All right.

62
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,380
This is the legendary Xunian Technique.

63
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,180
I also have a technique on which I seek your guidance.

64
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,000
It's a dragon indeed.

65
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,040
Dragon Transformation!

66
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,900
Rise.

67
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,680
What a dominating martial art.

68
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,720
You don’t need weapons or fists,

69
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,680
you just rely on your internal strength and real energy to fight the enemy.

70
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,340
- You've broadened my horizons. 
 - You're even stronger than the Baili Dongjun I knew back then.

71
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,400
It's a pity Ji Ruofeng is too lazy. He hasn’t issued the Martial Ranking in years.

72
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,040
Otherwise, I’d like to know who’s stronger between Baili Dongjun and me.

73
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:39,920
Anyway, aren’t you being too indifferent when talking about our friend?

74
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,400
Aren't you afraid he's dead?

75
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,960
He's not.

76
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,640
Well, why are you so sure?

77
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,380
Because I'm the one who hurt him.

78
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,280
His martial arts skills are completely crippled, but his life isn't in danger.

79
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,320
However, without martial arts, he won't get involved in this fight.

80
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,120
So... he won't die.

81
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,980
That makes sense.

82
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,260
- Do you still want to fight me? 
 - I didn't finish my sentence just now.

83
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,150
Even though you're stronger than the Baili Dongjun of the past,

84
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,420
alone...

85
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,340
you're still no match for me.

86
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,440
This is the Ninth Level of the Xunian Technique.

87
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,860
I've heard that only Master himself can defeat it.

88
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,510
It's a pity that Mister Li won't be coming

89
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,480
as he's as disappointed in Beili as I am.

90
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,280
We're all disappointed in Beili!

91
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,180
I can't believe the former Lord Vermilion Bird of Tianqi City

92
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,200
would say something like this as well.

93
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,330
The day I became Lord Vermilion Bird,

94
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,900
I thought we'd change Beili through our efforts.

95
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,445
But when the brother of the man we protected ascended the throne,

96
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:21,280
I realized it was just another cycle.

97
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,740
So I left Tianqi and returned to Xueyue.

98
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,140
However...

99
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,640
that can't be the reason for destroying Beili.

100
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,302
Only by destroying can we rebuild.

101
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:46,040
To rebuild, how many must bleed?!

102
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,260
I've already bled!

103
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,380
They should pay the price as well.

104
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,580
All right, let's go.

105
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,660
 These are all the fish we just caught this morning.

106
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,400
Stop right there.

107
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,480
- It's fresh. Come and pick one. 
 - What are you people doing here?

108
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,540
Langya? Sorry for the offense.

109
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,280
Let's go.

110
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,040
Senior, what's going on here?

111
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,720
I don’t remember it being like this before we left the island.

112
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,100
Our war with Nanjue has begun.

113
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,460
Of course, it’s going to be stricter than ever.

114
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,320

115
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,920
Second Senior, Little Senior.

116
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,920
I've brought him here.

117
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,400
The war is tense. Make it brief.

118
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,760
Especially you.

119
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,120
Liu Yue, I'm still your senior.

120
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,260
Can you show some respect?

121
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,800
Dongjun.

122
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,480
When we last parted in Tianqi City, I promised we'd meet again.

123
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,640
When I spoke to the soldiers in the army,

124
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,760
they said people like us, who march into battle, shouldn't utter such words.

125
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,820
Saying such words is like raising a banner,

126
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,000
one that will eventually stand over my grave.

127
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,800
But I don't believe that.

128
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,160
Now look,

129
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,000
I said we'd meet again, and we did.

130
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,680
And you’ve become a great martial artist on the Top-Rank List,

131
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,760
while I’ve risen to be a famous general in Beili.

132
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,120
I think this kind of reunion is a good one.

133
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,620
Have I matured a lot?

134
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,220
Yes.

135
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,700
All right.

136
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,460
We don't have much time. Just say what you need to say.

137
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,620
I'm surprised to see you two here.

138
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,200
Where are you going?

139
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,080
We were going to the border of Nanjue.

140
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,640
We then got word from Senior Liu Yue that you'd be stopping at Dongji Sea City,

141
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,500
so we came here to meet you.

142
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,860
It's been a long time.

143
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,580
We really should have a drink.

144
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,000
Next time.

145
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,140
You've come all this way to see me, so you must have something important to say.

146
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,420
Yes.

147
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,800
It's no accident that Nanjue is violating our borders.

148
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,880
Now, the demonic sect is rampant in the west,

149
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,280
and the northern tribes are eyeing us like predators.

150
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,320
Beili is now truly surrounded on all sides.

151
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,560
Your father is guarding the west, we'll go to the south soon.

152
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,440
But some people can't be stopped by an army.

153
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,480
Dongjun, I want to ask you a favor.

154
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,680
He's my best friend.

155
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,020
Do you trust me that much?

156
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,897
It's because he's your best friend

157
00:13:56,897 --> 00:14:02,020
that I'm sure you'll never let him make another mistake.

158
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,060
Dongjun, I need a promise from you.

159
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,440
Sure.

160
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,560
Call me Big Brother, and I'll give you that promise.

161
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,220
You're still so disrespectful to me.

162
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,540
Big Brother.

163
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:35,202

♫  Seeking a ray of light in the shadows  ♫

165
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:42,802
♫  You and I wander side by side, exploring the vast world  ♫

166
00:14:42,802 --> 00:14:44,887
You need to call me Big Brother, too.

167
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,980
I really do need to call you Big Brother.

168
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,040
I thought you were dead, and I couldn't sleep at all.

169
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,640
Your mother poisoned me before you left for Tianqi City.

170
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,040
If you die, I'll die too.

171
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,680
Call me Elder Brother, and I'll give you the antidote.

172
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,540
- Elder Brother. 
 - Yes?

173
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,000
You really believed her?

174
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,760
After all these years, you would have died already.

175
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,740
My mother lied to you, my little brother, Lei Mengsha.

176
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,852
Goodbye.

177

♫  Unafraid and fearless, we explore the world together with the open hearts  ♫

178
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:22,460
In the end, I'll say the same thing.

179
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,260
I look forward to the day we meet again.

180
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,940
I won't die on the battlefields of Nanjue.

181
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:38,162
♫  As our dark hair turns white, the time passes, we journey through the mortal world together  ♫

183
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:50,768
I, Mister Li's disciple from the Academy, Baili Dongjun, will fulfill my mission.

184
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:56,408
♫  Exploring the vast world  ♫ 
 ♫  Facing the uncertainty of life and death  ♫

00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:59,888
♫  Our hearts may bleed on a cold moonlit night by the window   ♫

186
00:15:59,888 --> 00:16:01,498
 Brother Yun.

187
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,713
 Wait for me.

188
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,740
 I will bring you back.

189
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,800
I've heard that two months ago an army of 100,000 soldiers from Nanjue

190
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,860
captured ten of our cities in less than seven days.

191
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,660
Luckily, Prince Langya arrived in time,

192
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,860
or they would’ve gone all the way north to take the imperial city.

193
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,860
This really makes one worry.

194
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Makes one worry.

195
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,860
Nan'an City is so far from the north and the imperial city.

196
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,660
Commander General, why do you have to worry?

197
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,780
Everyone bears responsibility for the survival of the nation.

198
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,560
We must always be ready to fight on the battlefield!

199
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,780
Today, I'm writing to request the Governor-General's approval

200
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,660
to lead 10,000 troops to Nanjue to set an example for the world!

201
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,820
There are only 600 soldiers under the command of the Commander General in Nan'an,

202
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,540
and they're all city garrison soldiers.

203
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,440
Who has the guts to talk about the General?

204
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,920
I'm Xie Xuan, a scholar passing through Nan'an City, and I'm trapped here by the rain.

205
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,420
What did you mean? Are you saying that the Nan'an soldiers are incapable?

206
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,300
What I meant to say is that it's not your soldiers who are incapable,

207
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,800
it's you who's incapable.

208
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,540
How bold you are!

209
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,560
How dare a humble scholar like you provoke the Commander General?

210
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,980
If he's incapable, then what? You are?

211
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,120
Scholar, I know you people see yourselves as being above others.

212
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:48,240
But leading an army in battle isn't the same as simply talking about it.

213
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,480
For example, do you know how to use a sword?

214
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,260
I've read a lot of sword manuals.

215
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,260
I've also read Sun Tzu's Art of War.

216
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,720
Some of the best sword manuals ever written.

217
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,060
Scholar, if you know how to use a sword, I'll spare you today.

218
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,980
Otherwise, you will be punished severely.

219
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,800
My martial uncle once said that one day I’d hold a sword too.

220
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Although I scoffed at it, I can't help but wonder what kind of sword it would be

221
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,180
if I ever truly held one.

222
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,120
I didn't expect it to be such a mediocre sword.

223
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,000
It's even a bit tacky.

224
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,460
But it's for the best.

225
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:47,580
The world is never short of famous swords, only of renowned swordsmen.

226
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,420
Sir, it seems to have stopped raining for a moment.

227
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,780
Your sword hasn't been used in too long. It can't even hold a bit of sword qi.

228
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,700
Sword... Sword...

229
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,120
Sword... Sword Deity.

230
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,240
Sword Deity.

231
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,880
One swing and I'm the Sword Deity?

232
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,260
Unfortunately, you don't have a say in that.

233
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,640
Chaos is like rain. No one can hide from it when it falls,

234
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,540
so we have to get involved.

235
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,680
 Winter of the seventh year of the Mingde's era.

236
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,320
 Nanjue moves north, the northern tribes approach the border

237
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,640
 and the western regions are in turmoil.

238
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,160
 In the spring of the following year, the demonic sect set out east to invade the Central Plains.

239
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,640
 Xiao Ruofeng, Prince Langya, lead an army to the south to fight against Nanjue.

240
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,120
 A disciple of the Tang Clan in Shu, Tang Lianyue, was taken under his wing.

241
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,840
 Chief General, Lei Mengsha, rerouted his troops to the north to defend the country.

242
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,280
 Liu Yue, Qingge, and Mochen of the Eight Young Masters went to help.

243
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,620
 The son of the Marquis Zhenxi, Baili Chengfeng, is guarding the West Gate of the country.

244
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,800
 What's more, Baili Dongjun returned to Xueyue City as the head of righteousness

245
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,480
 and led the Central Plains martial artists to fight the demonic sect.

246
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,620
It's freezing here.

247
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,780
Here, have some hot soup to warm yourself up.

248
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,200
I feel better now.

249
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,440
Look at you.

250
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,520
Already on the Top-Rank List,

251
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,960
why don't you resist the cold with your real energy?

252
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,560
That's no fun.

253
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,040
Through the four seasons, in cold and heat, we must truly experience it all.

254
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,400
That's what it means to truly live.

255
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,880
It's the Spring Festival today.

256
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,800
Sikong Changfeng has been fighting all over the place these months,

257
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,560
and he hasn’t even had time to see me.

258
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,940
He said he’d come to see me today.

259
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,100
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

260
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,900
I'm here!

261
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,900
What a coincidence.

262
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,430
A hot bowl of mutton soup on a day like this is perfect.

263
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:03,740
Sikong Changfeng, after years apart, is this how you show respect to your senior?

264
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,400
Baili Dongjun, it’s been a few years. Have you switched from hot liquor to hot soup?

265
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,100
I'll leave you two to it. I'm going to check if the dumplings are ready.

266
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,420
I’ve got the liquor you wanted.

267
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,580
It's the Spring Festival. I've prepared a few extra pots.

268
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,400
Let's drink to our hearts' content.

269
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,740
I want the best kind then.

270
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,700
Do you have Seven Starry Nights? I haven't had it in years.

271
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,380
- I've been craving it every day. 
 - You're asking for too much.

272
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,760
Fine. I'll treat you to it when we get back to Xueyue City.

273
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,540
All right.

274
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,100
Why did you paint it black?

275
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,417
What style is that?

276
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:54,400
You've ruined the Silver-Moon Spear.

277
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,920
What are you talking about?

278
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,900
It’s a gift from a Xueyue elder. It’s dark gold to begin with.

279
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,740
It's a good spear.

280
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,060
But it doesn't look much better than the Silver-Moon Spear.

281
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,300
Why did you switch from a spear you were familiar with?

282
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,180
Haven't you heard about my fight with Ye Dingzhi?

283
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,760
Of course, I have.

284
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,020
The Third City Lord of Xueyue City, Sikong Changfeng, fought with the chief of the demonic sect.

285
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,540
He was slightly outmatched and withdrew in one piece.

286
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,980
I was slightly outmatched?

287
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,900
Are you teasing me?

288
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,660
But that's not the end of the story.

289
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,000
I got away unscathed, but my spear broke.

290
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,120
That day, I used my strongest move, Dragon Transformation,

291
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,420
but Ye Dingzhi broke my spear with just one move.

292
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,860
I even spat out a lot of blood.

293
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,860
Thanks to the bond I formed with him when I went with you to snatch the bride for him,

294
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,600
I didn't die there.

295
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,460
Is he that strong now?

296
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,700
Let me put it this way.

297
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,880
There’s only one person I’ve seen in my life who’s stronger than him.

298
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,660
Master?

299
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,120
Yes.

300
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:16,180
But the feeling when Master exerted all his power is different from Ye Dingzhi’s.

301
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,240
It's strange.

302
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,020
I can't describe it.

303
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,140
Stop overthinking it.

304
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,460
You'll find out when you test him with your sword.

305
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,580
Junior, why are you suddenly dressed as a man? You even lowered your voice on purpose.

306
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,320
Next time, at least put on a veil or something, like Senior Liu Yue.

307
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,500
After so many years apart, you make fun of me as soon as we meet.

308
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,720
If I had known, I wouldn't have come.

309
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,220
I'd rather teach a few more villains of the demonic sect a lesson.

310
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,960
I wouldn't dare mock you.

311
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,660
Sit down.

312
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,220
Why are you suddenly dressed as a man?

313
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,040
Because this way... I look even more menacing.

314
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,220
All right.

315
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,460
our sword is the third most powerful in the Record of Famous Swords, the Iron-Horse Glacier Sword.

316
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,900
Holding this, even a three-year-old would exude a killing intent that others can't ignore.

317
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,480
- I heard you were at Dongji Sea City before coming here. 
 - Yes.

318
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,000
I saw your father.

319
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,420
He's still talking a lot of rubbish.

320
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,340
Don't worry about him.

321
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,480
What's there to worry about?

322
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,380
I wasn't asking about him.

323
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,160
Come on.

324
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,560
Pour the liquor. Come on.

325
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,740
Come on. Here's to you.

326
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,420
Here's to you.

327
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,340
Nice. You're a good drinker.

328
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,740
- Let's drink more. 
 - Come on.

329
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,460
Here.

330
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,280
 Nice.

331
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,540
Who's playing the flute at this hour?

332
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,920
It sounds pleasant and not hostile.

333
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,420
Let's just enjoy it.

334
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,220
Good liquor and flute playing, how wonderful.

335
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,380
Sikong Changfeng, I heard you were getting married before I left for the immortal mountain.

336
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,700
Did you get my letter and wait for my return?

337
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,660
I did...

338
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:31,700
Senior, you were late with the letter.

339
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,760
He just got the beautiful woman and was so anxious.

340
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,022
- Li Hanyi. 
 - He was already married when your letter arrived.

341
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:40,820
- Li Hanyi. 
 - He's already got a daughter too.

342
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,700
Don't drink anymore. Stop drinking.

343
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,220
Such a disloyal friend.

344
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,380
Don't be like this.

345
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,980
If I don't drink this fine liquor, who will? We can't waste it.

346
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,340
Don't be mad.

347
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,100
Of course, someone will drink it.

348
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,620
The guest outside, care for a drink?

349
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,000
I don't dare to enter without being invited.

350
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,260
Since the guest didn't give their name, how could the host dare extend an invitation?

351
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,780
My name is very common.

352
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:16,780
Even if I tell you, none of you inside have ever heard of me.

353
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,360
He doesn't look like someone from the demonic sect.

354
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,900
How can you tell I'm not from the demonic sect without seeing me?

355
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,300
Because the aura on you is too ordinary.

356
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,380
And those of the demonic sect always claim to be extraordinary.

357
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,820
The host has permitted it. Come on in.

358
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,320
Yes.

359
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,220
I'm Ye Xiaofan.

360
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,340
I wonder why you're here.

361
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,940
I, though of humble abilities, aspire to join Xueyue City to fight against the demonic invasion.

362
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,940
It's not easy to join Xueyue City.

363
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,220
Second Junior, test him.

364
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,180
I've been waiting for a long time.

365
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,140
It's not good for a woman to be so cold.

366
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,660
Indeed. Only the warmest man in the world can subdue her.

367
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,540
You're not bad.

368
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,400
It's not over yet.

369
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,040
This technique...

370
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,900
You said your surname is Ye.

371
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,360
- My surname wasn't Ye at first. 
 - But where did you get the surname Ye from?

372
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:55,460
A lazy man in our village who used to sleep in a tree all day.

373
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:02,020
One day, when bandits came to our village, he broke a branch from the tree where he slept

374
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,980
and jumped down to beat them away.

375
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,980
From that day on, he became the man all the girls wanted to marry,

376
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,700
and many children wanted to learn martial arts from him.

377
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,100
But he... only taught me.

378
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:26,000
However, I've never called him Master

379
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,340
because I want him to be my brother-in-law one day.

380
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,560
His name is Ye Xiaofan.

381
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,320
So, why are you called Ye Xiaofan now?

382
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,980
He later left the village.

383
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,300
I asked him where I could find him.

384
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,300
 Ye Xiaofan, don't go yet!

385
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,880
 How will I find you later?

386
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,660
He said...

387
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,540
 When I become famous, and you enter the Martial World,

388
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,660
 tell everyone your name is Ye Xiaofan, and I'll come to you!

389
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,280
I call myself Ye Xiaofan, so he'll come looking for me.

390
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,460
If you're called Ye Xiaofan, what about him then?

391
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,540
He said he was going to fight his way into Tianqi with his sword,

392
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,040
and from then on, would be called Ye Dingzhi.

393
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,180
Ye Dingzhi?

394
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,680
You're the disciple of the chief of the demonic sect.

395
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,940
- Young Lady. 
 - Young Lady.

396
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,560
Am I... still your Young Lady now?

397
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,580
You're always our Young Lady.

398
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:24,300
Even if the Chief dared to touch you, I would draw my sword.

399
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:45,240
But why did you, who once stood beside me, decide to draw your sword against Beili?

400
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:56,140
The Chief saved Yuji's life, for one thing.

401
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,260
Secondly, Yuji and I have always felt

402
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:04,290
that Envoy Wuxiang couldn't lead us to truly defeat Beili,

403
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,100
which is why we hesitated in our previous actions.

404
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,080
But the Chief is different.

405
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,900
In just two years, he's integrated the 32 sects outside the region.

406
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,860
You also know that the 32 sects outside the region

407
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,620
were independent during the time of Beique.

408
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:29,160
It was impossible to integrate them, but the Chief did it.

409
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,720
He's worth following for the rest of our lives.

410
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,080
Are all men like this?

411
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:57,840
They believe in strength and power and want to carve their own heroic path.

412
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,400
My father,

413
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,160
Envoy Wuxiang,

414
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,040
and even you two.

415
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,200
After all, everyone wants something better

416
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,520
and not to stay in this land of bitter cold forever.

417
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:23,400
We came here intending to bring you back.

418
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:30,900
But before we could say that, it now seems impossible.

419
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,280
I don't want to see any war,

420
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:43,680
even if I admit that Ye Dingzhi can lead the people of Beique back to the continent.

421
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,180
We've always known how you feel.

422
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:52,720
But everyone in the world has their own selfish desires.

423
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,500
I have my selfish desires, Qixuan has his, and so do the 32 sects outside the region.

424
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,800
Young Lady, you too have a selfish desire.

425
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,060
What is my selfish desire?

426
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:15,480
Your selfish desire is called Baili Dongjun.

427
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,000
Hanyi.

428
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,260
The Brother Ye I know wouldn't become the chief of the demonic sect.

429
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,540
He must have his reasons.

430
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,780
I want to join you to ask him what those reasons are.

431
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:44,920
I heard that an unidentified swordsman warded off an attack by the demonic sect this afternoon.

432
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,000
It was you, wasn't it?

433
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:53,460
Yes, I warded them all off and told them my name, Ye Xiaofan.

434
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,500
I'm waiting for him to come to me.

435
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,660
Okay.

436
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,540
From now on, you're Ye Xiaofan of Xueyue City.

437
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,300
Senior!

438
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:09,020
I only left for a little bit. How come there are so many guests now?

439
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,540
Yao'er, you're finally back. I'm starving.

440
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,700
It's the Spring Festival. I went to see two old friends.

441
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,480
Don't just stand there. Sit down.

442
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,760
Come on, it's the Spring Festival.

443
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,100
Let's drink to our heart's content. Let's drink!

444
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,640
Cheers!

445
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,140
Today is the day of our sect's rise to power in the Central Plains.

446
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,680
I hope everyone here will avenge our past shame and never rest until death!

447
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,620
 Avenge out our past shame and never rest until death!

448
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,400
 Avenge out our past shame and never rest until death!

449
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,100
 Avenge out our past shame and never rest until death!

450
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,040
- Chief. 
 - Chief.

451
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,760
 We wish the Chief and the Left and Right Guardians victory in conquering Tianqi!

452
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,460
 Victory in conquering Tianqi!

453
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,340
Sword Deity Xie, it's been a long time.

454
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,700
How come you traveled all the way here?

455
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,940
I didn't come as a traveler, but with my sword in hand.

456
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,240
Young Master Xie Xuan, what does that mean?

457
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,240
Literally.

458
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:37,580
I'm the new head of Shanqian Academy, as well as a swordsman.

459
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,720
Even a scholar has to hold a sword when his country is in trouble.

460
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,480
- This is... 
 - The signal for the demonic sect's eastward march.

461
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,320
Listen.

462
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,400
It's the biggest event I've seen since I got here.

463
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,360
Sword Deity Xie.

464
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,300
You're just in time.

465
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:15,180
With the world in turmoil, let's take it upon ourselves to restore order.

466
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,620
I'm not well-educated. What do you mean by that?

467
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,740
It means it's time to kill.

468
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,260
Just a few of them trying to get through?

469
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,540
It's Ye Dingzhi!

470
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,540
Is he already this strong?

471
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,020
- I'll alert the others. 
 - Okay. After them.

472
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,060
Left and Right Guardians.

473
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,900
We've set up Lone Void Formation.

474
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,580
Those from Beili can't get through.

475
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:21,700
 We wish the Chief victory in conquering Tianqi!

476
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,000
Brother Yun.

477
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,620
Changfeng?

478
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,420
Baili Dongjun?

479
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,940
You must be after Ye Dingzhi, too.

480
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,160
This fog is unusual.

481
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,533
Find your opponent's weaknesses and strike decisively. One woman can defeat ten thousand men.

482
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:09,160
Loneliness is a sign of supremacy.

483
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,980
The void is a sign of inferiority and weakness.

484
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,900
The secret to victory is to be lonely and weak.

485
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,200
Lone Void Formation.

486
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,900
You know about it too?

487
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,120
I encountered it during the examination at the Academy.

488
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,640
At that time, Zhuge Wucheng, Lord Wuzuo from Tian Wai Tian,

489
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,300
used this formation to trap Brother Yun, me, and the others.

490
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,660
Zhuge Wucheng?

491
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,620
It's true.

492
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,640
The Lone Void Formation is one of the formations in the Qimen Dunjia Arts.

493
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,020
It was lost with the disappearance of the Zhuge Clan.

494
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,140
It's a formation with a military aura.

495
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:50,320
Yet, after leading troops for years, I see none of that military aura in this formation.

496
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,520
Instead, it seems to be a ghostly one.

497
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,200
If it's used for evil purposes, it's no longer the Lone Void Formation.

498
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,880
It's... the Ghostly Formation.

499
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,460
What happens to those who enter the formation?

500
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,280
There are ghosts in the middle of the day?

501
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,620
What you see is not what it seems.

502
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,020
Hidden dangers lurk everywhere.

503
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,980
What you see is not what it seems,

504
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,700
but what you hear is the truth.

505
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,800
When the wind tears around you, that's when the enemy appears.

506
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,380
This fog is getting thicker.

507
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,460
On Qilian Mountain, people from various Beili sects are gathered,

508
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,380
but they're unaware of the Lone Void Formation.

509
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,740
Qilian Mountain?

510
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,920
Could it be a coincidence?

511
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,580
What?

512
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,860
We need to break the formation.

513
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,280
How?

514
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,300
Locate the formation's core.

515
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,540
What kind of evil formation is this?

516
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,900
We must break it as soon as possible.

517
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,600
Is this the Lone Void Formation?

518
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,640
It's said that this isn't the Zhuge Family's true Lone Void Formation.

519
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,540
It's so profound.

520
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,050
The Zhuge Family's Lone Void Formation only responds to the Way of Heaven,

521
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:37,820
but ours steals the Way of Heaven.

522
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,320
Fellow guardians, please enter the formation.

523
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,960
Xie Xuan, have you found it?

524
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,800
I've found the trace.

525
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,620
Break!

526
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,201

527
00:44:25,201 --> 00:44:27,620

528
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:40,030

529
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:50,510
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

530
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:58,460
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

531
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:07,780
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

532
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:16,140
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

533
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,360
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

534
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,720
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

535
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,960
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

536
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,620
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

537
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,000
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

538
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,060
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

539
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,580
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

540
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:44,000
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

541
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,360
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

542
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,760
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

543
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,840
♫  I met you  ♫

544
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:41,660
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫
