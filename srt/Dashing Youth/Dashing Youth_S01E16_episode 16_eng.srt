00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,300
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,600

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,020

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,610

23
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,987

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,080
Your food is here, Sir.

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,220
- Another round of drinks! 
 - Let me fill your cup!

26
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,540
Waiter, get me a jar of liquor!

27
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,000
All right!

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,060
Sir, let me fill your cup.

29
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,260
Waiter, get us a pot of tea.

30
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,540
Sir, Sir. Sir.

31
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,740
This table is reserved for important guests.

32
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,700
Only important guests can sit here.

33
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,620
Get me a cup of water.

34
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,980
Here you go, Sir.

35
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,050

36
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,400
Sir.

37
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,300
What would you like to drink?

38
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,620
A jar of Sangluo, please.

39
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,980
Sir, we have other premium liquors here.

40
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,820
No need. The Sangluo will do.

41
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,780
Liquor isn't meant for mere enjoyment and showing off.

42
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,720
You have a point, Sir.

43
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,420
That table is taken.

44
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,760
Young man, if you don't mind, why don't you join me?

45
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,060
Is this place haunted? No one's sitting here.

46
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,360
What I meant was that table has been reserved.

47
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,000
Fine, then. Sorry for disturbing you.

48
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,220
Sir, your liquor.

49
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,460
Sangluo.

50
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,140
Get another cup for this fellow here.

51
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:05,960
All right.

52
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,320
I have a friend who knows how to brew this.

53
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,880
Try this, then.

54
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,360
I think...

55
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,080
it's not as good as my friend's.

56
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,340
Is your friend a brewmaster?

57
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,740
He's just obsessed with liquor.

58
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,580
May I have your name, young man?

59
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,120
Sir, you're kind enough to invite me to join you, no need to be so polite.

60
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,340
I've never had any parents.

61
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,540
I come and leave empty-handed, so I gave myself the surname Sikong.

62
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,100
I also desire to be like the wind that blows by and never returns.

63
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,480
Therefore, my name is Sikong Changfeng.

64
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,540
That's an interesting introduction.

65
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,440
Took awhile to think it up, right?

66
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,620
That's supposed to be a secret.

67
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,740
Sir, you called me out so easily.

68
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,260
Waiter, take this liquor away.

69
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,140
We don't want it anymore. Get us something else.

70
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,420
May I know what you'd like to order?

71
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,980
I'd like some Qiulubai.

72
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,100
 Interesting.

73
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,020
Sir, we're not serving Qiulubai today.

74
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,100
Why?

75
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,380
Qiulubai is only served for four hours once a month.

76
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,040
Today isn't the right time.

77
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,740
- What about tomorrow? 
 - Not tomorrow either.

78
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,820
Not the day after or even the day after that.

79
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,860
It's served on the 14th day of the month which is 13 days from now.

80
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,420
You'll have to wait.

81
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,380
- You... 
 - I'm curious.

82
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,560
Why does it have to be Qiulubai?

83
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,500
To be honest, I came to Tianqi to meet a friend.

84
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,980
The one that you mentioned?

85
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,580
Yes. That friend of mine loves nothing else but liquor.

86
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,364
Before we parted ways last time,

87
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:57,020
he insisted that he wanted to drink Qiulubai from Tianqi.

88
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,960
That's why I wanted to buy a jar for him as a gift.

89
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,300
Kid, you want Qiulubai?

90
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,880
There's one up there.

91
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,700
Is that Qiulubai?

92
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,300
You talk too much.

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,220
Waiter, how much does that jar of Qiulubai cost?

94
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,540
Nothing.

95
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,620
Nothing?

96
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,760
As long as you can get it.

97
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,440
- That's simple. 
 - Changfeng.

98
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,860
You want that liquor?

99
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,600
Since you stretched your hand out, that means you've accepted the challenge.

100
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,300
- You set me up! 
 - Sir, how could you say that?

101
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,660
That is indeed a jar of 12-year-old Qiulubai and the only one in this world.

102
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,820
If you want it you'll need to rely on your capabilities.

103
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,820
If you fail to do so you need to leave something behind.

104
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,740
As for what it will be...

105
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,860
That's for me to decide.

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,275
Master Xie.

107
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:01,020

108
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,580
Master Xie.

109
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,160
Mister Chen.

110
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,740
Master Xie is the strongest martial artist in Diaolou Tavern.

111
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,680
Many men have tried to take the jar of liquor but none have succeeded.

112
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,020
That means that if I succeed, I'd be the first to do so.

113
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,980
I suppose so.

114
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,300
Truly skilled martial artists would never take this liquor.

115
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,860
Most of those who try are people that are still young and inexperienced.

116
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,860
However, the only person who has ever succeeded is Master Li.

117
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,920
But he only did so for fun and he left after touching the jar.

118
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,360
So, if you manage to take it, you'd be the first to do so.

119
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,360
Very well.

120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,300
Bring it on!

121
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,440
Nice spear.

122
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,060
The Silver-Moon Spear.

123
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,760
I'll take that.

124
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,660
He's overestimating himself.

125
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,100
That's a nice spear, but what a waste.

126
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,620
Go back!

127
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000

128
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,480
 Defeated as soon as I arrived.

129
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,660
 Tianqi City sure lives up to its name.

130
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,960
Sikong Changfeng. It's been a while, but no need to welcome me like this.

131
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,880
Baili Dongjun?

132
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,500
Not bad, you still remember me.

133
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,760
When did you arrive? Why didn't you come visit me?

134
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,980
I just got here today and I was about to visit you.

135
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,320
Long time no see, Sikong Changfeng.

136
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,540
Young Master Zhuomo.

137
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,500
Anyway, you got into a fight as soon as you arrived and got hit this hard?

138
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,900
Don't even mention it.

139
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,080
I thought I should prepare a gift to celebrate our reunion.

140
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,700
Normal liquor pales in comparison to yours.

141
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,460
But they've sold out their best liquor so I had to fight for it.

142
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,100
But in the end, I lost the fight, the liquor, and even my spear.

143
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,180
You couldn't defeat him?

144
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,740
What about the two of us?

145
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,100
Master Xie, your Warrior Force Field has improved a lot.

146
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Unfortunately, that young man managed to break it.

147
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,420
He's got potential.

148
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,160
Indeed, he's like an eagle.

149
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,220
Look.

150
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,560
This way, please.

151
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,860
You've found helpers already?

152
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,580
Is that jar over there Qiulubai?

153
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,340
Yes, it's a 12-year-old Qiulubai.

154
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,960
I want it.

155
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,740
That's a strong palm move.

156
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,220
I see, I'm not the only brewer who knows martial arts.

157
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,980
Junior, don't be rude.

158
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,140
This is the top-ranked brewmaster in Diaolou Tavern.

159
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,280
Everyone in Tianqi addresses him as Master Xie.

160
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,100
- Young Master Zhuomo. 
 - Master Xie, sorry for offending you.

161
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,580
This is my new junior.

162
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,420
I apologize for his rude behavior.

163
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,340
This is Mister Li's new disciple?

164
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,820
No wonder.

165
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,880
Did you fight me for the liquor?

166
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,760
That's my friend's spear.

167
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,240
Your friend failed the challenge.

168
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,000
He has to leave something behind. That's the rule.

169
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,760
If I win can I take both the spear and the liquor?

170
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,420
Of course.

171
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,640
Come on!

172
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,460
A fighting challenge for a jar of liquor would be strange.

173
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,520
How about I challenge you to something else?

174
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,860
What do you have in mind?

175
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,100
Let's see who can make the best liquor.

176
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,260
What? This guy is crazy!

177
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,940
Is he challenging Master Xie to a brewing showdown?

178
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,900
He's too full of himself.

179
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,460
Let's meet again on the 14th day of the month.

180
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,360
I'll bring my own liquor to Diaolou Tavern.

181
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,800
Prepare the best liquor you have in Diaolou Tavern

182
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,140
and the best liquor taster in the city.

183
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,940
Then I'll be taking that spear and that jar of liquor.

184
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,586
You insolent boy.

185
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:50,580
Do you know what you're saying?

186
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,380
Even if you are Mister Li's last disciple you should keep your ego in check!

187
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,200
Master Xie, my junior has been mastering the art of making liquor for over a decade.

188
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,140
I've been doing it for over 40 years.

189
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,620
Fine.

190
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,220
A good jar of liquor can tell hundreds of stories.

191
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,920
The passion of youth, the composure of a middle-aged man,

192
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,340
and the richness that comes with age. They're all different.

193
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,240
Having more years of experience under your belt doesn't mean you can defeat me.

194
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,860
I'll be waiting, then.

195
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,060
What brought you two here?

196
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,060
I was planning to take my junior to somewhere fun,

197
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,140
but when we passed by Diaolou Tavern we heard a commotion.

198
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,180
So we decided to check it out.

199
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,840
Well, it's just me who wanted to check it out.

200
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,080
And it just so happened that you were kicked out.

201
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,360
I was still reacting when he recognized you from afar.

202
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,690
He flew towards you and saved you from falling.

203
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,540
So you've really become Mister Li's disciple?

204
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,360
Becoming Young Master Zhuomo, your Second Senior's junior brother.

205
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,660
How nice.

206
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,980
You're doing great yourself. You're alive enough to meet me here.

207
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,420
Second Senior, where are we going exactly?

208
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,530
Well, we're here.

209
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,653

210
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,460
Come in. Let's get you a private room.

211
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,700
Nice. I'll leave you a good tip.

212
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,360
- Sir. 
 - You're here.

213
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,100
Come, come.

214
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,720
Is... Is this a brothel?

215
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,100
Not at all. Not at all.

216
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,020
This is Baihua Hall. It's different.

217
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,760
How is it different?

218
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,780
Because of her!

219
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,680
She makes this place different.

220
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,800
Years ago, Gu Jianmen and I came here for the first time.

221
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,160
She was playing the guqin.

222
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,220
Gu Jianmen was probably drunk

223
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,540
and when he heard her playing, he got into the mood and danced with his sword.

224
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,720
It was a magnificent scene to behold.

225
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,620
 So handsome.

226
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,340
 His sword gathered a flurry of petals in a sparkling array of colors.

227
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:36,300
 The petals eventually formed into a flowery bridge that led to her pavilion up there.

228
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,800
 Gu Jianmen said that her music speaks volumes about herself.

229
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,300
 He felt that the lady was his destined lover.

230
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,280
 So he stepped onto the petal bridge, and walked towards the pavilion,

231
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,520
 then lifted one veil after another to see her.

232
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,880
 Be careful, Sir!

233
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,280
And then?

234
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,860
And then, Gu Jianmen came down.

235
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,840
He got rejected.

236
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,300
That was quite some years ago.

237
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,380
I'm sure the young lady has blossomed into a fine and mature woman.

238
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,860
Everyone in Tianqi knows her name.

239
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,780
I wonder if Gu Jianmen would still sigh when he sees her.

240
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,520
Young Master Lei, it's been so long since you last came.

241
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,020
Not as long as Young Master Gu.

242
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,780
How long exactly do you mean?

243
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,480
Not that long ago, actually.

244
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,500
I can feel a murderous aura.

245
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,260
Sister... Sister-in-law.

246
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,180
Picking up bad habits at such a young age.

247
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,060
I... I'm innocent.

248
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,520
Honey.

249
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,540
Oh, right.

250
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,040
Baili Dongjun, you're picking up such bad habits at your age.

251
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,120
I told you not to come here, but you insisted.

252
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,940
I said I didn't want to come, but you still dragged me in here anyway.

253
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,340
Well? Are you satisfied? Happy now?

254
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,240
This isn't a place for me to come.

255
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,200
- Do you have no shame? 
 - Shut up.

256
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,260
Honey, let's go back to our cozy little home.

257
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,700
When does Young Master Lei plan to come here again?

258
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,780
Not anymore. I'll never come here again.

259
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,220
Even if my junior invites me, I'll never come again.

260
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,880
Come on.

261
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,800
Junior, have fun while you're young.

262
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,780
Your good days are numbered.

263
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,367
- Junior, Junior... 
 - Come on.

264
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,020
- Come on. 
 - Honey! Honey!

265
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,020
I was wrong!

266
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,380
Where are we?

267
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,340
What should we do?

268
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,860
Gentlemen.

269
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,820
What... What is it?

270
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,960
- What handsome young men we have here. 
 - Madam Ziyi.

271
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,700
Is Miss Feng still playing tonight?

272
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,460
I'm getting impatient.

273
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,500
Don't be.

274
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,680
She's here.

275
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,980
All right.

276
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,600
Second Master. You're here just in time.

277
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,960
This melody has a melancholic vibe to it.

278
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,260
I've... I've heard this before.

279
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,340
- Have you been here? 
 - No.

280
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,460
Do you know music?

281
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,040
No.

282
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,900
I've heard this score before. It's called Jiangnan Moon.

283
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,340
"All are home at the midnight gong, only the rustling of leaves is heard."

284
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,340
"The dew glows in the autumn night,"

285
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,860
"in my hometown the moon shines bright."

286
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,400
This score is about one's longing for home.

287
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,860

288
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,740
Sir.

289
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,560
Miss.

290
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,120
That's not a title I deserve to hold.

291
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,580
Our young lady would like to meet you.

292
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,880
Your young lady is...

293
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,640
Young man, are you really that ignorant?

294
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,500
There's only one they call young lady in Baihua Hall.

295
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,258
Wait, wait.

296
00:21:29,258 --> 00:21:31,500
Who is this dumb kid?

297
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,600
Why is Miss Feng inviting him?

298
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,440
I come here every day and I've spent quite a lot too.

299
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,300
- Second Master. 
 - I still haven't met Miss Feng in person.

300
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,060
How come he gets to meet her on his first visit?

301
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,320
Second Master, calm down, please.

302
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,060
- Aren't you from Qianjin House? 
 - What does that have to do with this?

303
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,560
Forget about Qianjin House tonight. We're all here for the music.

304
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,180
Everyone. Baihua Hall treats us unfairly.

305
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,500
Don't you think so?

306
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,260
- Yes! 
 - Exactly!

307
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,880
- Right! 
 - Why him?

308
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,400
Listen.

309
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,340
Yes, it's inappropriate.

310
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,060
Let's forget it.

311
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,840
Do you know who you're rejecting?

312
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,260
Wait, don't be angry, Miss.

313
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,960
That's enough.

314
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,020
Meeting a close friend isn't easy.

315
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,700
Who knows, she might be from your hometown.

316
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,520
Calm down, Second Master. Look.

317
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,300
Calm down, everyone.

318
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,700
- Let me get some fine liquor for all of you. 
 - He's going up just like that?

319
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,960
Isn't anyone going to stop him?

320
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,400
- Don't you go up there! 
 - Let's see who dares to challenge me.

321
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,780
Never mind, it's fine.

322
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,300
Idiot! Useless!

323
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,980
Go ahead.

324
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,060
No, wait.

325
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,740
Hey.

326
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,440
Second Master, calm down.

327
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,520
- Young man. 
 - Madam.

328
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,560
Can you get me a table so I can wait for him?

329
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,700
Sir, are you sure he'll be back tonight?

330
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,580
The night is young and he's got a lady in his arms.

331
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,580
Who knows how long they'll take?

332
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,420
Why don't I get you another girl to keep you company?

333
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,420
No need. That's not necessary.

334
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,320
Sikong Changfeng, I won't wait for you then!

335
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,640
You... enjoy!

336
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,740
Come again!

337
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,500
Come on.

338
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,360
Thank you.

339
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,020
Is it you?

340
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,100
Greetings, Miss. My name is Sikong Changfeng.

341
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,360
Are you from Wei City?

342
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,720
Wei City?

343
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,840
- Where do you come from? 
 - I don't remember.

344
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,600
Then, where did you learn to play that song?

345
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,740
I don't remember that as well.

346
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,320
Why can't you remember anything?

347
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,500
Are you just plain forgetful or is there something wrong with your brain?

348
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,740
Don't be mad, Miss.

349
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,240
I really can't remember my past.

350
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,840
I've been wandering around Jiangnan since I was young.

351
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,320
Perhaps it was a traveler who taught me the song.

352
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,800
When I heard you playing it I couldn't help but accompany you.

353
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,920
I hope you won't blame me for it.

354
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,500
I didn't mean to blame you.

355
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,580
It was me who lost my composure.

356
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,800
I had an older brother who could play this song as well.

357
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,220
I mistook you for him.

358
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,380
Looks like I over thought it.

359
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,180
You may leave now.

360
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:00,060
Don't tell anyone about my brother or how I lost my composure.

361
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,740
Don't tell anyone else and ruin my reputation out there.

362
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,680
Well, Miss?

363
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,120
Why do you keep calling me?

364
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,860
Actually,

365
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,220
I'd love to have a little sister.

366
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,980
How impudent of you.

367
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,540
Someone, get this shameless man out of here.

368
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,860
Wait, wait. Miss, hear me out.

369
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,520
That's not what I meant.

370
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,340
I've been wandering my whole life and I've never been envious of people who have parents,

371
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,340
but I've envied those who had little sisters.

372
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,460
Having a little sister feels like having someone to protect.

373
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,180
That's why...

374
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,080
That's why I think that if I had a sister to protect,

375
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,800
that would be something that I can take pride in.

376
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,180
- I won't do it. 
 - Why?

377
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,940
- Miss, what's your brother's name? 
 - Wei Luoli.

378
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,463
Alright, from now on, my name will be Wei Luoli.

379
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,500
You...

380
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,320
How dare you tease me time and again?

381
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,825

382
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,560
You didn't kick me that hard.

383
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,700
That means you aren't really angry.

384
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,600
Miss, I may have forgotten whether I'm from Wei but we're both from Jiangnan.

385
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,240
And we know the same song.

386
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,060
This shows that we're fated.

387
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,880
Just now, I said that I wanted a sister like you and I meant it.

388
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,780
Yes, this is our first time meeting.

389
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:07,220
Getting a brother all of a sudden for no reason must feel strange.

390
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,200
I crossed the line.

391
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,700
I'm not from Jiangnan.

392
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,920
I'm from...

393
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,260
You're trying to trick me again.

394
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,660
You misunderstood, Miss.

395
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:25,066
I have a friend who said that words can be deceiving but music can't.

396
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:30,100
That's because music is the purest and cleanest thing in the world.

397
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:35,580
So, miss, no matter where you're from, what you miss most is Jiangnan.

398
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,420
The person you care about the most is also there.

399
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,720
What is your friend's name?

400
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,220
Baili Dongjun.

401
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,380
That's a fine name.

402
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,526
I'm tired. Let's end this conversation for now.

403
00:27:57,526 --> 00:28:00,840
Linglong. See our guest off.

404
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,040
Miss!

405
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,620
You may meet many people throughout your life, but only befriend a few.

406
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,560
I believe that true friends do exist.

407
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,980
Your guqin and my leaf resonated together.

408
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,160
I will be back.

409
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,820
Now you sound like a scholar.

410
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,260
No matter how you look at me, I'm still a wanderer.

411
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,120
Miss, you seem to fancy...

412
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,020
No, I mean, you don't hate him.

413
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,940
He's interesting, isn't he?

414
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,900
Junior, you frightened me.

415
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,780
What brings you here?

416
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,460
I've been practicing all day under my master's watchful eye.

417
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,440
I thought we could grab a drink together but you weren't around.

418
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,520
What a letdown.

419
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,020
You...

420
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,040
Did you go to a brothel?

421
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,220
It's not what you think.

422
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,640
I knew it.

423
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,300
I can smell the scent of rouge, even the night breeze can't blow it off you.

424
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,600
- You visited a brothel. 
 - It wasn't a brothel. It's Baihua Hall, a place for music.

425
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,090
I heard that you had a girl that you fancied

426
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:15,260
but now you're visiting a brothel.

427
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,000
- I guess you didn't fancy that girl very much. 
 - That's not true.

428
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,740
It was Second Senior Lei who brought me there.

429
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,860
Besides, before I got there I didn't know where we were going.

430
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,480
You didn't know before, then what about after you got there?

431
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,420
You reek of rouge.

432
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,500
- You must have spent quite a while there. 
 - Yes, I did.

433
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,980
But that's because... Miss Lei went there too, and my friend met a girl there. And then...

434
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,180
Why is it so hard to explain?

435
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,240
So, where's your friend?

436
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,740
Yes, I went to a brothel, so what?

437
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,220
Why are you getting mad?

438
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,900
I'm mad?

439
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,200
I'm mad because I've been practicing all day while you're having fun outside.

440
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,380
I feel it's unfair, okay?!

441
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,540
Junior, listen to me...

442
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,320
Shameless.

443
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,860
What did I do wrong?

444
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,540
 I was supposed to gather information about Ye Dingzhi.

445
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,900
 Why did I argue with Baili Dongjun instead...

446
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,460
 and even slapped his face?

447
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,180
 Forget it.

448
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,880
 I should try to contact Qixuan.

449
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,720
He's coming out!

450
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,080
That's all he can do?

451
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,620
That was fast.

452
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,400
Yeah, is this supposed to take a long time?

453
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,480
Everyone, it's not what you think.

454
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,960
Miss Feng and I were just talking about music. I didn't do anything to her.

455
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,500
Bullshit!

456
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,160
- Why is your hair undone then? Huh? 
 - That's right!

457
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,240
Before this, Miss Feng had only performed and never offered other services.

458
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,580
Who do you think you are?

459
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,360
- No... 
 - Who are you to do this? How dare you!

460
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,760
- Everyone, my hair came undone because... 
 - Shush.

461
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,180
Everyone, stop listening to this nonsense.

462
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,980
- Beat him up! 
 - Beat him up!

463
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,760
Wait, Everyone!

464
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,620
No, it's a misunderstanding!

465
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,860
- Don't let him get away! 
 - I'm off!

466
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,540
After him! Beat him up!

467
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,160
Miss Feng, what are you thinking about?

468
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,380
You should get some rest.

469
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:08,280
Linglong, have I ever told you about Luoli?

470
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,980
Do you want to have a heart-to-heart talk, Miss?

471
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,860
A heart-to-heart talk?

472
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,940
Perhaps I just suddenly want to pour out my feelings.

473
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,860
It's been such a long time.

474
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,500
I'm afraid that I might forget everything.

475
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:49,340
When I was little my whole family was annihilated.

476
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,440
My master escaped with me.

477
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,100
Along the way he picked up a kid.

478
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,480
That kid was Wei Luoli.

479
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:13,760
Every night he would pluck a leaf and gaze at the moon under the eaves,

480
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,520
playing Jiangnan Moon.

481
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,780
Whenever he played the song,

482
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,700
I knew he was missing home too.

483
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,060
What happened next?

484
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:37,640
One day my master took his sword and went out with him.

485
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,660
They never came back.

486
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:47,580
They said my master and Luoli were dead.

487
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,800
Miss.

488
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,840
That's the end of the story. Time to get some rest.

489
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,280
You may leave now.

490
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,760
 What's your name?

491
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,600
 Wei Luoli.

492
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,180
 Where's your family?

493
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,340
 They're all dead.

494
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,520
 Brother Li, let's be family from now on.

495
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,010

496
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,100
A showdown?

497
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

498
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,100
Baili Dongjun is challenging Master Xie to a liquor showdown

499
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,100
in order to take the 12-year-old Qiulubai.

500
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,400
Everyone in Tianqi knows about it now.

501
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,200
That Qiulubai was made in the third year of your reign.

502
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,900
When it was completed,

503
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,800
you said that if no one could take it in the next 12 years,

504
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,100
you would use it as an offering for the gods during the harvest season.

505
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:52,600
Now that the 12 years are almost up, for Baili Dongjun to do this is...

506
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,700
clearly insulting you publicly.

507
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,100
Your Majesty, the chancellor has arrived.

508
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:43,000

509
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,400
Nice calligraphy.

510
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,200
Interesting.

511
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,100
As for the couplet,

512
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,960
it's just too pretentious.

513
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:59,400
Years ago when you presented this couplet to me, I raved about it for a long time.

514
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,400
But now even you seem to dislike it.

515
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:12,240
People always despise their own past.

516
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

517
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,700
Offer a seat to him.

518
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

519
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,700
Mister Li, have some tea.

520
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,800
This tea is a Nanjue specialty known as Phoenix Snowflakes.

521
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,100
It's hard to come by. Try it.

522
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,500
Your Majesty, why have you summoned me today?

523
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,400
When I was young, I was into poetry and books instead of martial arts.

524
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,300
My mother wasn't favored.

525
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,000
They all thought I was the most unpromising of all the princes.

526
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,700
Luckily, I had two close friends.

527
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,000
One was from Yunxi's Ye Family and the other was from Xilin's Baili Family.

528
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,800
Both of them were exceptional warriors.

529
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,100
With their help I managed to survive and ascend the throne.

530
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,600
Later...

531
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:25,100
I made a terrible mistake... which still fills me with much regret.

532
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,700
I received some news so I summoned you here to thank you in person.

533
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:38,400
That means you're thanking me for saving Ye Dingzhi?

534
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,100
Exactly.

535
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,000
Since you've realized your mistake why don't you reopen his case?

536
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,400
Forget it.

537
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
It's all about your dignity again.

538
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,800
All right, I've received your gratitude.

539
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,200
That's all then.

540
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,400
- I'm off. 
 - Wait.

541
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,700
I summoned you here for another reason.

542
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:06,440
I heard that you recently took in a new apprentice surnamed Baili.

543
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,000
Baili Dongjun.

544
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,600
It's the grandson of your other sworn brother, Baili Luochen.

545
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,600
This time Luochen's grandson is in Tianqi and I'd love to meet him.

546
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,500
That's not necessary.

547
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,200
Didn't you say before that you'd stay out of the court's affairs?

548
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,400
Baili Dongjun is just a normal apprentice of mine.

549
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,600
He has no official rank or title.

550
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,700
How is he part of the court's affairs?

551
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:46,900
The grandson of the Marquis of Zhenxi is in Tianqi, yet he hasn't come to meet me.

552
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,300
It's improper.

553
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,300
You should punish the Marquis of Zhenxi instead.

554
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,500
You've already killed one of your sworn brothers

555
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,700
so a second one probably makes no difference.

556
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,700
Your Majesty, why brother losing your composure in front of me?

557
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,700
Rest assured, Baili Dongjun won't be staying in Tianqi forever.

558
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,700
I'm planning to leave the city with him and travel around.

559
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,800
He won't be back in the next few years.

560
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,000
You're the chancellor, though.

561
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Since I'm leaving, someone more suitable will naturally take over as chancellor.

562
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,200
Farewell.

563
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,200
What if I insist on keeping him here?

564
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,900
You can try.

565
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:31,510

566
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:40,060
Mister Li, don't you think that sometimes you can be too overbearing?

567
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,000
Is that so?

568
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,100
In front of you, I feel like...

569
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
you're the Emperor instead of me.

570
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,800
I'm an exiled immortal.

571
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,400
A mortal emperor like you should stop bothering me.

572
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,400
Master.

573
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,400
Looks like the Empty Mind Technique isn't that impressive after all.

574
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,400
♫  The spring breeze blows past the tavern, swaying the window  ♫

575
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Your Majesty, he's gotten past the Grand Eunuch.

580
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,200
Mister Li.

581
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:33,561
Xiao Qi.

582
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,600
You're in the palace today as well.

583
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,300
Your senior's disciple, Xiao Wang, has also come to Tianqi.

584
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,400
He did me a little favor too.

585
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,400
You came all the way here and I have to suffer because of this.

586
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,400
I have to pretend to put up a fight.

587
00:43:50,937 --> 00:43:54,604
Your Emperor wants to kill me. He's gone crazy, hasn't he?

588
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,600
That's why I'm here.

589
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,500
I was afraid that you'd go crazy and kill him.

590
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:04,297
Move aside then.

591

592

And then?

607
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,000
And then, he turned around.

610
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,200
He turned around and looked at the palace.

Grand Eunuch, are you feeling nervous?

617
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:45,300
I'm afraid my entire life's worth of cultivation might be utterly decimated today.

618
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,000
This was supposed to be a murderous trap.

619
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,800
I gathered the top fighters from all over Beili

620
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,000
to kill the legendary top martial artist in the world.

621
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,700
We overestimated ourselves.

622
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,400
We thought we could trap him but we were trapped instead.

623

He's reminding His Majesty to leave Young Master Baili alone, at least for now.

You've gotten my message so I shall stop scaring you now.

00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:27,300
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

645
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:35,200
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

646
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:44,500
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

647
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:53,100
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

648
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,200
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

649
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,500
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

650
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,900
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

651
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,300
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

652
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,800
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

653
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,800
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

654
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,300
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

655
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,800
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

656
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,200
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

657
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,400
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

658
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,300
♫  I met you  ♫

659
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:17,400
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

660
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:26,300
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

661
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:35,600
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

662
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:44,100
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

663
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,200
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

664
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,600
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

665
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,000
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

666
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,500
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

667
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,900
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

668
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,000
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

669
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,400
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

670
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,900
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

671
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,300
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

672
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,600
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

673
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:25,400
♫  I met you  ♫
