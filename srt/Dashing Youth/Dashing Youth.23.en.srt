192
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,740
Not bad.

193
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,420
It has a feeling of longing.

194
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,820
What's the matter?

195
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,860
Are you missing your loved one?

196
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,500
Master, how do you know?

197
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,980
Right.

198
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,620
There is nothing in this world

199
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,740
that you don't know.

200
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,500
She...

201
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,820
She's not my loved one.

202
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,620
We only met twice.

203
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,580
I fell for her last time.

204
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,900
But she

205
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,620
doesn't seem to have
any feelings for me.

206
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,220
But since

207
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,140
we met twice,

208
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,260
maybe we can meet

209
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,220
for the third time someday.

210
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,140
After meeting for the third time,

211
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,420
I can say some things

212
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,340
I've kept deep in my heart.

213
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,380
I just don't know

214
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,340
if she'd want to hear it.

215
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,420
Master, it's all trivial matters.

216
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,340
I made a fool of myself.

217
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,900
Reluctance to bid farewell

218
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,540
and romance

219
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,700
are nothing trivial.

220
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,940
So, when are you

221
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,100
going to see her for the third time?

222
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,540
I don't know.

223
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,140
Perhaps

224
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,980
it's when I venture
into the martial arts world again,

225
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,180
when I've honed

226
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,900
my spear technique enough,

227
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,380
and when I am confident enough

228
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,540
to stand in front of her.

229
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,220
You have a good ambition.

230
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,220
Hone your spear technique?

231
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,060
How are you going to hone it?

232
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,460
Well...

233
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,620
With mere

234
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,060
eight or nine moves of Zhuixu Spear

235
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,820
that you know of?

236
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,820
But Zhuixu Spear is all I know.

237
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,180
Is Zhuixu Spear all you know?

238
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,140
Yes.

239
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,820
Why don't you think

240
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,780
about the fact

241
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,780
that your master
is the best martial artist?

242
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,700
You're right.

243
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,580
Master, do you know

244
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,740
Zhuixu Spear's remaining moves?

245
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,780
Why are you
still thinking about Zhuixu Spear?

246
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,980
You already have the best martial artist
as your master.

247
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,980
Why don't you think

248
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,420
of more advanced moves?

249
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,500
More advanced ones?

250
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,180
For example...

251
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,700
For example?

252
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,140
Dragon Transformation.

253
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,380
Dragon Transformation?

254
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,700
How can Dragon Transformation
have no dragon?

255
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,900
Did you get a good look?

256
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,940
There are 33 moves.

257
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,420
Except for the last move
where you transform the dragon,

258
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,100
I saw everything.

259
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,700
The last move is an illusion,

260
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,060
not a spear technique.

261
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,740
It'd be weird
if you could see it clearly.

262
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,740
But seeing clearly
and being able to learn

263
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,780
are two different things.

264
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,300
Otherwise, others will learn

265
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,380
your moves

266
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,020
when you fight them.

267
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,140
How can we allow that to happen?

268
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,060
I'm going to travel the world

269
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,100
with my wife.

270
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,220
I don't have time

271
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,260
to go through all the moves

272
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,900
with you.

273
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,020
But with your talent,

274
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:56,980
you probably don't need me

275
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,860
to teach you.

276
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,500
Take that and train yourself.

277
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,020
Thank you, Master.

278
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,020
You're

279
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,260
probably the luckiest one

280
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,340
among all my disciples.

281
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,660
Why is that?

282
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,340
My swordsmanship
is the best in the world.

283
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,140
So are my blade skills.

284
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,980
My fist and palm techniques

285
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,660
are probably the best in the world too.

286
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,020
It's just that spear technique

287
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,660
isn't my specialty.

288
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,860
How can Baili Dongjun and Xiao Ruofeng

289
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,260
be better with blades and swords

290
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,260
than me?

291
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,140
But you're different.

292
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:37,780
Me?

293
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,340
If you become a Spear Deity,

294
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,020
you'll be the one and only Spear Deity

295
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,740
in the world.

296
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,620
Master, you think too highly of me.

297
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,340
I'm telling the truth.

298
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,860
Baili Dongjun
was born into a noble family.

299
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,500
Xiao Ruofeng
was born into the imperial family.

300
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,620
Ye Dingzhi is a descendant
of a famous general.

301
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,620
Except for you.

302
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,740
You're a wanderer

303
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,860
born on earth

304
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
who can live anywhere,

305
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,380
but you can stand
shoulder to shoulder with them.

306
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,020
How is that not amazing?

307
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,740
Don't let me down.

308
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,500
I want to see you at your wedding

309
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,500
the next time we see each other.

310
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,740
She loves food.

311
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,380
I wonder if she's tried this before.

312
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,620
She'll like it

313
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,740
when she comes to Nanjue.

314
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:00,860
Watch out.

315
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,260
You're annoying.

316
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,260
I'm just joking, Mr. Ye.

317
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,020
What are you
thinking so seriously about?

318
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,500
What's this?

319
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,740
Bamboo Rice?

320
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Did you make it yourself?

321
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,500
I haven't had Bamboo Rice.

322
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,260
Is it tasty?

323
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,300
Ye Dingzhi.

324
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,220
Since you want to become stronger,

325
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,180
why don't you listen to me

326
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,420
and learn our skills?

327
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,340
What's the point

328
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,500
of practicing the sword technique
in this lame bamboo forest

329
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,340
all day?

330
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,300
I know you were practicing
with a female blade deity.

331
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,740
But I don't think

332
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,900
it's a big deal.

333
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,540
Your master's dead.

334
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,220
Yi Wenjun is getting married too.

335
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,540
What else

336
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,460
is holding you back?

337
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,260
Wouldn't it be good

338
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,820
to follow me back

339
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,460
and become the best?

340
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,740
Those living in Sky's Beyond

341
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,500
are surviving members of Beique, right?

342
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,060
What do you want from me?

343
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,300
It was my father who led the army

344
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,460
to destroy Beique.

345
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,020
Let the previous generation

346
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020
settle their grudges.

347
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,700
General Ye
acted on Beili's imperial orders

348
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,100
when he wiped out Beique.

349
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,500
People of Beique

350
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,540
was able to escape death

351
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,100
because General Ye did not pursue them.

352
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,220
I came to you

353
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
only because we can get

354
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,220
what each other wants

355
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,300
by working together.

356
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,740
We have

357
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,060
a technique called Xunian Art.

358
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,900
Only innate martial artists

359
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,580
can practice it.

360
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,460
My father went into seclusion
to practice it

361
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,460
and hasn't come out.

362
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,060
So we need to find

363
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,980
an innate martial artist

364
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,940
to learn the same art

365
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,700
and help him.

366
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,020
And you're an innate martial artist.

367
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,220
Do you

368
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,980
have anything I need?

369
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,460
You'll become the best martial artist.

370
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,340
If you learn the supreme technique,

371
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,900
you'll become the best.

372
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,020
Once my father comes out of seclusion,

373
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,460
we'll head south
with the northern tribes

374
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,460
to crush Beili

375
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,780
and kill the Xiao Family.

376
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,940
We'll avenge your father

377
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,020
and your family's death.

378
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,780
You can also

379
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,940
be reunited with the woman you love.

380
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,580
Isn't that good?

381
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,580
Although I hate the Xiao Family,

382
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,580
I never plan

383
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,260
to involve

384
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,020
Beili's people

385
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,260
in my grudge.

386
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,060
If Beique and the northern tribes

387
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,020
head south together,

388
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,300
do you know how many people will die?

389
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,580
Do you know how many people died

390
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,980
when Beili crushed Beique?

391
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,500
Countless people died.

392
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,900
And so many innocent people
were sacrificed.

393
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,460
Even my mother...

394
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,100
I admit

395
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,980
I want to be the best,

396
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,700
but I can't cover up

397
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,300
the previous mistake

398
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,940
with a bigger one.

399
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,340
You should leave.

400
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,380
Ye Dingzhi!

401
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,000
[One month later]

402
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,820
My Lord. Mr. Nangong.

403
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,500
A strange man wants to enter the city.

404
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,700
A strange man?

405
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,220
The man is dressed in black

406
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:26,980
and wears a bamboo hat.

407
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,500
His hat has a strange emblem.

408
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,100
Oh, right.

409
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,860
And he's holding a scroll.

410
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,900
Looks like

411
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,740
it's time to let people
in the martial arts world

412
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,220
know about Xueyue City.

413
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,900
Baixiao Hall

414
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,580
is the biggest intelligence organization
in the martial arts world.

415
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,340
It is said

416
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,700
that Baixiao Hall will eventually

417
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,340
hear about everything
that happens in the world.

418
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,300
Baixiao means knowing everything.

419
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,060

420
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,060

428

from Xueyue City.

429
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,260
Fifth. Not bad.

430
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,180
Zhao Yuzhen?

431
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,420
Is he

432
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,620
Wang's junior?

433
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,740
That's right.

434
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,300
He's the youngest person ever

435
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,340
to be on

436
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,980

437
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,340
What about Dongjun?

438
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,740
What's his rank?

439
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,740
Patience.

446
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,140
- None?
- What's going on?

447
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,740

Baili Dongjun from Jixia Academy.

449

Great!

- Amazing.
- How amazing.

451
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,260
We're convinced.

452
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:07,900
Amazing.

453
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,900
Ye Dingzhi, swordsman.

454
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,420
Who's that?

455
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,300
Yun.

456
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,820
Am I as strong as Yun now?

457
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,260
Congratulations!

458
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,300
Congratulations!

459
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,500
This brat

460
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,940
is not bad at all.

461
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,620
Why hasn't Luo He come back yet?

462
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,820
Luoxia is also missing.

463
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,460
I'm starving.

464
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,780
[Xiaguan]

465
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,700
Are we really leaving?
Won't you regret it?

466
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,900
I won't.

467
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,100
He's ranked first on Liangyu Ranking.

468
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,820
Changfeng is also on Liangyu Ranking.

469
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,900
Let them find their own paths

470
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,380
from now on.

471
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,740
We have our own way

472
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,460
to go.

473
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,940
Besides,

474
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,820
as long as we feel like it,

475
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,340
there's always a chance
to see them again.

476
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,180
Luo He.

477
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,540
Chunshui, everything's ready.

478
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
Baili Dongjun.

479
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,500
Sikong Changfeng.

480
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,700
What does the old man want now?

481
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,980
Well,

482
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,780
I am traveling to get married.

483
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,500
We'll meet again someday.

484
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,020
Don't

485
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,340
embarrass me

486
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,820
in Beili.

487
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,740
Everyone in Xueyue City, listen.

488
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,020
I, Luo Shui,

489
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,540
pass my lord title

490
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,940
to Baili Dongjun and Sikong Changfeng.

491
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,060
They're now the third lord.

492
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,660
The disciples and elders in the city

493
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,500
must listen to them both

494
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,620
and never disobey them.

495
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,340
Anyone who disobeys

496
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,540
will be banned
from re-entering Xueyue City.

497
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,060
- Xueyue City's disciples
- Xueyue City's disciples

498
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,900
- shall obey the lord's orders.
- shall obey the lord's orders.

499
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,900
Are you two drunk?

500
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:26,700
Master!

501
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,300
Master!

502
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,980
Dongba. Changfeng.

503
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,380
You heard her.

504
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,780
My wife

505
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:34,980
just made you two

506
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,260
Xueyue City's lords.

507
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,180
Do a good job.

508
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,740
I don't know how to be a lord.

509
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,020
I don't want you two to come back

510
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,580
and find me ruining the city.

511
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,380
Don't worry. You'll have help.

512
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,780
Master, I have a question.

513
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,460
Why am I the third lord?

514
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,460
What about the second lord?

515
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,260
Guess.

516
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:55,900
Wait.

517
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,620
Who is this help?

518
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,540
Explain yourself

519
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,860
before you leave.

520
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,740
A stunning beauty from the north.

521
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,420
Think about it.

522
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,300
A stunning beauty?

523
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,220
Is she as beautiful as me?

524
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,580
No.

525
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,420
How could she be as beautiful as you?

526
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,860
But the one I'm talking about

527
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,580
is indeed amazing.

528
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,220
But she's not mine.

529
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,540
She's Baili Dongjun's.

530
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,420
She?

531
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,940
That darned old man.

532
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,980
We've been waiting all night.

533
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,100
But

534
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,380
the person he said
is not showing up at all.

535
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,020
It's not like you don't know

536
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,900

It has indeed been a long time.

548
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,700
It's been so long

549
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,180
that the silly boy

550
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,780
has become a young man

551
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,300
who can protect what he wants.

552
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,540
Mr. Li is my master.

553
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,700
I beat Qiulubai from Diaolou Tavern

554
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,060
with Seven Starry Nights.

555
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,300
And now I rank first

556
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,220
on Liangyu Ranking.

557
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,180
Am I considered famous now?

558
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,420
Yes.

559
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,740
That's why I came today

560
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,860
to fulfill my promise.

561
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,820
When we first met,

562
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,460
the fallen petals
were as beautiful as today's.

563
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,260
Miss.

564
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,140
Can you tell me

565
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,100
your name now?

566
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,540
My name is Yue Yao.

567
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,660
Yue Yao.

568
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,620
That's nice.

569
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,500
It turned out that the person
I had waited for so many years

570
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,700
has such a beautiful name.

571
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
Baili Dongjun,

572
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,500
since I've come to Xueyue City,

573
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,260
can you

574
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,100
buy me a drink?

575
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,580
What would you like to drink?

576
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,980
Wind, Flower, Snow, and Moon.

577
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,780
Xiaguan's wind, Shangguan's flower,

578
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,100
Cang Mountain's snow,
and Erhai Lake's moon.

579
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,340
Sounds like a romantic liquor.

580
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,020
I've never brewed it.

581
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,780
But I want to brew the first cup of it

582
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,900
for the one I love.

583
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,020
I'll treat you to something else.

584
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,860
I imagined today's scene

585
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,780
countless times.

586
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,940
Should I be at a loss?

587
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,740
Should I be overjoyed?

588
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,900
Should I be so happy

589
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,380
that I just want to
draw my sword and dance?

590
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,620
But when this moment really came,

591
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,140
all I want to say is,

592
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,180
"Nice to meet you again, Miss Fairy."

593
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,300
Even though you never responded to me

594
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,540
and it's narcissistic of me to say so,

595
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,820
I firmly believed

596
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,100
that the moment
when you and I are reunited

597
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,420
is the real beginning

598
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
of our story.

599
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,940
But I didn't expect that this moment

600
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,180
would be the end of our story.

601
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,420
I've...

602
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,500
fallen for someone else.

603
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,540
Or I should say

604
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,340
I've really

605
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,340
fallen in love with someone.

606
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,660
That person also asked me

607
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,540
if I wanted to see you.

608
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,820
I told her I wanted to see you,

609
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,020
but I just

610
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,220
simply want to

611
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,660
quietly

612
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,940
fulfill a promise from a chance meeting

613
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,900
that I've been remembering for years.

614
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,140
This liquor on my hand

615
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,780
is called Overly Soon.

616
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,220
It's the first liquor I made

617
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,220
after returning to Tianqi City.

618
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,300
I'll treat you to this.

619
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,140
Miss Yue Yao.

620
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,340
Farewell.

621
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,660
Martial Uncle Baili.

622
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,180
Martial Uncle Baili.

623
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,420
Martial Uncle Baili.

624
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,580
Martial Uncle Baili.

Xueyue City is a place

644
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,700
suitable for romance

645
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,220
and love.

646
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,220
I hope

647
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,140
I can bring her here one day.

648
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:56,850
[Shangguan]

649
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:08,980
Do you

650
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,380
have a lot of questions for me?

651
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,060
Baili Dongjun.

652
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,020
The first thing

653
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,220
I want to tell you is

654
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,420
that I'm sorry

655
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,580
for lying to you.

656
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:32,940
I...

657
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,780
Hear me out.

658
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,540
I'm from Sky's Beyond.

659
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:38,860
It's

660
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,140
a place far, far away.

661
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,900
It's in the freezing north.

662
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,660
It's a home

663
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,340
for Beique survivors
whose country was destroyed.

664
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,260
If you've heard about it,

665
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,700
the king of Beique
had the last name Yue.

666
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,420
And I'm his daughter.

667
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,940
They call me

668
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,020
the Princess of Beique.

669
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,060
My father

670
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,660
went into seclusion at Desperate Ground
after our country was destroyed.

671
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,060
If he wants to achieve great success
in his cultivation

672
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,620
and come out of seclusion,

673
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,420
he needs

674
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,700
an innate martial artist's help.

675
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,820
No wonder you approached me.

676
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,940
It's because
I'm an innate martial artist.

677
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,180
Yes.

678
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,140
I went to Qiandong City

679
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,100
to find your master,

680
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,900
Gu Chen,
the Scholarly Deity of Western Chu.

681
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,900
I thought of asking him
to come out of seclusion

682
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,500
and help us restore Beique.

683
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,780
We unexpectedly found out

684
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,980
you're an innate martial artist.

685
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,940
My father has been in seclusion

686
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,060
for 15 years.

687
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,820
Fifteen years

688
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,900
is a long period of time

689
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,900
for anyone.

690
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,980
We don't know
whether he's alive or dead.

691
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,420
That's why we want to find
an innate martial artist.

692
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:55,860
Of course.

693
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,060
If he's alive,

694
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,170
Beique will have a chance

695
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,540
to make a comeback.

696
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,060
I heard

697
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,460
you're joining the Academy's examination.

698
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,180
With my identity,

699
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,420
it's inconvenient for me
to move around Beili.

700
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,260
So I borrowed my sworn sister,

701
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,380
Yin Luoxia's name

702
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,060
to join the exam.

703
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,620
So,

704
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,300
I approached you

705
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,820
with an agenda

706
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,860
from the beginning.

707
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,700
The Yin Luoxia in your eyes

708
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,220
isn't the real me either.

709
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,220
Are you disappointed in me

710
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,940
after hearing all this?

711
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,300
Baili Dongjun.

712
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,660
I'm wondering

713
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,180
why you're

714
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,700
suddenly telling me this.

715
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,460
After thinking about it,

716
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,860
there's only one answer.

717
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,380
What is it?

718
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,540
You don't want
to take me back to Sky's Beyond.

719
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,420
Sometimes I think you're foolish,

720
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,260
but sometimes,

721
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,140
you're surprisingly perceptive.

722
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,180
Since I chose to tell you,

723
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,740
it means

724
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,900
I've made my decision.

725
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,540
I won't take you back to Beique.

726
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,060
And I won't allow Beique's army

727
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,740
to set foot in the Central Plains.

728
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,500
Why?

729
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,180
Because I don't want to see

730
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,260
war raging

731
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,140
and the people suffering.

732
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,820
My country is gone.

733
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,620
What's lost is lost.

734
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,620
I've found

735
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,700
what I've been looking for.

736
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,420
I want to build

737
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,460
a new home

738
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,500
for my people

739
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,780
in a new place.

740
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,900
A new home?

741
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,740
It sounds exciting.

742
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,020
So you've chosen

743
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,740
a difficult

744
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,060
but admirable path.

745
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,940
But

746
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,340
you said

747
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,300
so many things.

748
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,820
Don't you

749
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,700
have a more romantic reason?

750
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,820
I thought

751
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,140
you think being with me

752
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,460
is more important than anything

753
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,740
because I'm charming

754
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,580
and live a carefree life.

755
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,100
So...

756
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,900
Who wants to be with you?

757
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,460
Isn't that what you want?

758
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,380
I thought Luoxia and I

759
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,180
were in love with each other.

760
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,300
I told you I'm not Yin Luoxia.

761
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,060
A name is just a code name.

762
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,980
In my opinion,

763
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,220
your identity is fake,

764
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,180
but you're real.

765
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,020
Everything we've gone through

766
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,820
is real.

767
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,100
You do have your own agenda.

768
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,620
That's why you made friends with me

769
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,460
during the exam

770
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,420
and joined me

771
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,620
when forming a team.

772
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,500
But that didn't stop you

773
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,500
from fighting side by side with me,

774
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,780
not abandoning me

775
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,020
in times of crisis,

776
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,980
treating my wounds

777
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,540
and applying the ointment for me
when I was injured.

778
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,860
Anyway,

779
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,740
you're the one I like.

780
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,900
It's not because of what you have.

781
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,420
Who you are,

782
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,660
your identity,

783
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,780
and what you're after

784
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,660
are not important to me.

785
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,540
It just

786
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,460
makes me know you better.

787
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,100
You just said

788
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,780
you like me.

789
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,780
Did I

790
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,380
say that?

791
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,380
All right.

792
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,580
What about you?

793
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,860
Well...

794
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,180
Well...

795
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,340
I probably think the same way too.

796
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,540
Such a strong sword qi.

797
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,380
You look a bit like Rain Demon now.

798
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,580
Ms. Yan Lingxia.

799
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,980
Looks like you've perfected

800
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,900
your Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

801
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,060
Thank you for your guidance these days.

802
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,620
I'm very thankful.

803
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,980
Take a stroll with me.

804
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,140
You're the most talented young man

805
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,460
I've ever met.

806
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,220
Maybe one day,

807
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,820
you'll become the best in the world.

808
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,620
The Rain Bruiser is lucky.

809
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,620
I'm flattered.

810
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,820
My friend, Baili Dongjun,

811
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,220
is no less talented than me.

812
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,380
It's too early to say

813
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,660
that I'll become the best in the world.

814
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,060
There are ambitious youngsters
in every generation.

815
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,580
Good. Very good.

816
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,460
I've had a question

817
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,700
these days.

818
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,340
You're clearly not someone

819
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,380
who is too eager
to make a name for himself.

820
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,900
Why are you so eager

821
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,060
to master Demon Deity Sword Techniques?

822
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,500
I promised someone.

823
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,540
I said

824
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,660
I'd take her

825
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,740
to eat beef from the steppe,

826
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,420
worship Bodhisattvas
from the Buddhist States,

827
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,260
drink Nanjue's herbal tea,

828
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,620
and sail through East Sea.

829
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,180
The world

830
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,540
isn't in that cage called Tianqi.

831
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,620
A woman?

832
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,060
Yes.

833
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,460
The woman I love the most.

834
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,420
But

835
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,620
are you going there alone?

836
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,180
It must be difficult

837
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,900
to get into

838
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,940
Beili's Tianqi City.

839
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,180
I still want to give it a try.

840
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,900
That's good.

841
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,060
If only...

842
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,420
Ye Dingzhi.

843
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,620
Since you're doing this for her,

844
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,620
whether you succeed or not,

845
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,340
she will be the happiest woman
in the world.

846
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,220
I'll definitely succeed.

847
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:03,540
All right.

848
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,060
I hope you can be with your beloved one.

849
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,020
When the time comes,

850
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,260
take her to Dongyue Lake.

851
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,860
I'll prepare some good liquor for you.

852
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,020
Senior...

853
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:17,700
Oh, right.

854
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,540
I would like
to leave Xuanfeng Sword to you

855
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,700
for safekeeping.

856
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,500
Are you not bringing it with you?

857
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,260
No.

858
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,260
It's the only thing

859
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,660
that my master left me.

860
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,020
I see.

861
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,340
All right.

862
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,540
You may leave now.

863
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,700
Grass sways in the stream in spring.

864
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,180
Fish swims and causes ripples.

865
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,620
Waves come steeply.

866
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,660
Smoke rises from the boat.

867
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,260
Write new sentences with a brush

868
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,380
and dress like ancient sages.

869
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,860
Flowers show their beauty
in the morning light

870
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,940
in front of 36 mountains.

871
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,540
Wenjun.

872
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,140
I'll definitely get you out of there.
