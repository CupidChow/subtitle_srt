♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,000

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,000

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,380

23
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,000

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,600
Do you think he'll sit over here?

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,200
Waiter.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,800
Of course, he will.

27
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,400
Come and have some tea.

28
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,380
Thank you.

29
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,460
You didn't look or talk to me the entire way.

30
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,260
Why?

31
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,400
If you enter the Academy one day you'll have to call me Senior Brother.

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,300
I'll take care of your studies and behavior.

33
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,600
Then you can't ignore me like you do now.

34
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,500
It's not that I'm ignoring you. I'm just a little worried.

35
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,700
I'm worried that you think I'm holding a grudge against you.

36
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,500
So...

37
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,460
I felt a little awkward.

38
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,700
He's childish.

39
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,500
No. It's called youthfulness.

40
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,200
Okay, tell me why you think I'd think you were holding a grudge against me.

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,500
Because you showed up and then my master died.

42
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,800
That's a fact.

43
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
But those are two different things.

44
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,300
These two things seem to be related,

45
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,200
but in the end, if I hadn't done the Sword Song,

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,300
people wouldn't have thought my master was still alive and hiding in Qiandong City.

47
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,000
Then my master wouldn't be dead.

48
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:52,900
So it appears that the one who really caused my master's death... was me.

49
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,000
You shouldn't think that way. If you do you'll put yourself into a bind.

50
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,100
Don't worry.

51
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,200
If I really kept thinking that way, I wouldn't have been able to step out of Qiandong City.

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,000
The real killers of my master were those two, Wufa and Wutian.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm very clear about that.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,100
So, Brother Lei and Little Master, don't worry about me.

55
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,300
Look, look. So sensible.

56
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,000
He deserves to be my junior brother in the future.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,600
You're not finished yet.

58
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,300
That's right.

59
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,000
Even though I thought long and hard about it and tried to convince myself,

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,100
I still have a grudge in my heart.

61
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,900
If you hadn't come, maybe my grandfather and uncle could have protected my master.

62
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,500
That's why I still feel like... beating you up.

63
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:57,100
All right. Then wait until the day you can beat me.

64
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,640
Okay, deal.

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,700
- Deal. 
 - Deal.

66
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,500
Rascal, you're awfully arrogant.

67
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,900
Do you know that Xiao Ruofeng is Mister Li's best disciple?

68
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,500
As for me, I got in a few years before him, but I'm no match for him.

69
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,000
I think you'll be in your seventies or eighties before you can beat him.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,400
He won't be Mister Li's best disciple for long.

71
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,300
- Why? 
 - Because... it'll be me.

72
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,700
Come on.

73
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,000
Young Master.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,500
- Young Master. 
 - What happened?

75
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,000
A letter from the Academy has arrived.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,800
You are being asked to serve as the examiner for the Academy's preliminary examination.

77
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,400
The man made it clear that this was a notification, not a discussion.

78
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,300
Master knows I don't like to show my face in public,

79
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,500
but he wants me to be the examiner for the preliminary exam.

80
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,220
What a crafty old man.

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,300
It's about having the ability to do what others can't, but not necessarily what others can.

82
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,600
To put it simply, it's just a way to make fun of us,

83
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,700
and make things difficult for us for entertainment.

84
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,800
Do you think Baili Dongjun will be disappointed when he enters the Academy

85
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,900
and finds he already knows his future senior brother?

86
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,600
Young Master, I thought that even a person chosen by Little Master

87
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,200
still had to pass the Academy's examination.

88
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,100
But why do you make it sound as if this person is definitely going to be Baili Dongjun?

89
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,920
This is a good question.

90
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,480
Since it's a good question, answer me then.

91
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,500
I guess I'll have to think carefully about the questions for the preliminary examination.

92
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,700

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,900

94
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,580
Tianqi City.

95
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,000
We've finally arrived.

96
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,300
I've lived in Tianqi before, but I never really paid attention to the gate.

97
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,900
I heard White Feather Sword Deity once came to Tianqi to save his disciple from being executed.

98
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,400
Before he left he smashed the plaque with his sword.

99
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,200
None of the world's masters dared to stop him.

100
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,700
This story is true.

101
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,900
- I want to do that, too. 
 - Hey, hey, now.

102
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,900
You can't. It's a capital offense.

103
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,700
Did White Feather Sword Deity get beheaded back then?

104
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,600
Who could have beheaded him?

105
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,500
He's the Sword Deity.

106
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
I'll wait until I've become a deity,

107
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,200
then I'll smash this plaque with my sword.

108
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll part ways with you two here.

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,200
Second Senior, take Dongjun to the Academy.

110
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,300
I'm going into the palace first.

111
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,390

112
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,600
Let's go.

113
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,000
The roads in Tianqi City are still as wide as ever.

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,600
It's much bigger than Qiandong City.

115
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,000
- It's perfect to roam around in. 
 - Indeed.

116
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Back in the day, Gu Jianmen and I used to travel side by side in Tianqi City.

117
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,200
Now he's tied up in the Gu Family's affairs with the Xinan Circuit.

118
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,000
 Since you're interested in exploring this place, I'll return to the Academy first.

119
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,940
Young Miss, Second Young Miss.

120
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,400
Sister. There are freshly sliced pieces of beef, mutton,

121
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,000
plus fish sliced as thin as a cicada's wing, and Nanjue grown mushrooms.

122
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,900
What do you think? What's good to eat first?

123
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,600
I know you treat me the best.

124
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,000
Knowing that you miss having hot pot,

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,700
Young Miss warmed up the pot and cooked the meat early this morning.

126
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,700
That's for sure. She's my elder sister.

127
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,540
Take your time. There's a lot of good food.

128
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,340
I went to a lot of fun places this time and brought back a lot of new things.

129
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,780
I've got rice cake from Jiangnan and sausage from Shuofeng.

130
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
You can have anything you want.

131
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,100
Sister, I want to eat them all.

132
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,400
Did you have any fun on your trip to Chaisang?

133
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,900
I've heard it's a very prosperous place with a lot of good liquor.

134
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,400
Sister, did you bring some back?

135
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,940
Qing'er, since when did you start to enjoy drinking?

136
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,500
The trip was so rushed that I forgot to bring some back.

137
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,500
It's okay. You can get some next time.

138
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,500
Young Miss.

139
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,300
Young Miss, Second Young Miss.

140
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,600
Mo Qixuan, it's you. Sit down and eat with us.

141
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,080
Let's talk outside.

142
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,600
What's the matter?

143
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,800
Baili Dongjun has arrived at Tianqi.

144
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,500
Tianqi?

145
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,480
Now, at this time of year,

146
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,360
- he's going to... 
 - That's right.

147
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,400
The Academy's examination.

148
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,000
Xin'er, what do they need to talk about outside?

149
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,900
Did you encounter some problems on your trip?

150
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,500
Sister seems to have a lot on her mind.

151
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,500
- Young Miss, she... 
 - Xin'er, get me another plate of mutton later.

152
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,400
The meat is delicious and the mushrooms too.

153
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Got it.

154
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,800
What did you say about Sister?

155
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,400
Nothing. Just enjoy your food.

156
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,200
Your sister is just fine.

157
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
 Young Miss, there's no time for hesitation.

158
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,100
 If he enters the Academy...

159
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,600
If he enters the Academy...

160
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,190
and has Mister Li's protection, Beique...

161
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,060
will have lost our opportunity.

162
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,900
 Miss Fairy! Are you leaving?

163
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,600
 You haven't told me your name yet.

164
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,800
 How do I find you in the future?

165
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,500
♫  The wind passes through the window frame  ♫

166
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,600
♫  The rain falls gently in the Martial World  ♫

167
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,000
♫  The stars change in the misty waves  ♫

168
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,400
♫  How many people in the world  ♫

169
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,600
♫  really understand your intentions?  ♫

170
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,400
♫  We're all friends who gather as kindred spirits  ♫

171
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,400
♫  Let me ride my horse with the wind  ♫

172
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,600
♫  Wandering freely wherever I please  ♫

173
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,100
♫  Even if the road ahead is mysterious, I will not stop  ♫

174
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,000
♫  These tender feelings have flown far away with the wind  ♫

175
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,600
♫  Oh, what feelings  ♫

176
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,200
♫  The bold horse prances, kicking up dust  ♫

177
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,820
The first thing to do in Tianqi is go to Diaolou Tavern.

178
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,140
Who was that?

179
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,180
How dare you attack me from behind.

180
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,420
You just said you wanted some Qiulubai from Diaolou Tavern. Do you still want it now?

181
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,370

182
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,020

183
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,780
Yes!

184
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,620
I won't let you have it.

185
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,900
You...

186
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,780
You're only a little over halfway through Tianqi City, but there's more to see.

187
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,060
That's all for today.

188
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:21,080
As for the rest... it can wait until you can get out of this place.

189
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,460
Who are you?

190
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,980
You have a lot of guts and are quite arrogant.

191
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,960
Just missing the skills to back it up.

192
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,340
It's a little early for you to be exploring Tianqi City in one go.

193
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,180
This asparagus is also tasty.

194
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,380
I'll get you some more later.

195
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,360
Sister, hurry up. I've almost finished it!

196
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,380
The mutton is delicious.

197
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,900
Have more. I'll have Xin'er get another plate later.

198
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,040
Qing'er.

199
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,440
What is it?

200
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,420
Well... I need to go to Tianqi City in Beili.

201
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,180
Please cover for me in Tian Wai Tian and keep it from Envoy Wuxiang.

202
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,140
What?

203
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,100
You just got back and now you're leaving again.

204
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,860
I knew Mo Qixuan's visit would be bad!

205
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,120
I'll beat him up every time I see him!

206
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,240
Qing'er.

207
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,780
- Be good. 
 - I don't want to hear it.

208
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,640
I'll pretend I'm deaf today. I can't hear anything. I just want to eat.

209
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,840
Consider it as doing me a favor, will you?

210
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:52,260
Qing'er, when I'm done, Beique will be restored and Father can be released.

211
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,900
Don't you miss Father?

212
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,260
But I miss you more.

213
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,880
I'm always alone in Tian Wai Tian.

214
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,560
I don't have anyone to talk to.

215
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,080
This time I'll leave Xin'er with you, okay?

216
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,160
Young Miss.

217
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,460
Qing'er.

218
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,580
Go on then.

219
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,100
Just come back soon.

220
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,600
Sister.

221
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,660
Promise me. You have to come back sooner.

222
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,860
Don't make me wait so long.

223
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,560
Okay, I promise.

224
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,140
You're awake?

225
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,020
Take it easy. You've slept the whole day away.

226
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,340
Why are you here?

227
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:23,860
I remember... being knocked out by an old man.

228
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,760
An old man?

229
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,400
You know what? You really sound a bit like the rest of us.

230
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,360
No wonder Old Seven has his eye on you.

231
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
What are you talking about?

232
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
What is this place?

233
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,000
Who's the old man who knocked me out?

234
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,860
This is Jixia Academy.

235
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,460
The one who knocked you out is naturally the Academy's Mister Li.

236
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,860
No, wait.

237
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:51,020
If you're lucky, he'll be your master.

238
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,000
That's the famous Mister Li of the Academy?

239
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,040
The world's best martial artist launched a sneak attack?

240
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,660
Master, that old man, loves to joke.

241
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,880
All right. It's your first day at the Academy.

242
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,980
I'll show you around. Let's go.

243
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,440
To meet that old man?

244
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,020
I mean, teacher.

245
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,520
Take it easy. I like it when you call him the old man.

246
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,420
That said, you can't just meet the old man whenever you want.

247
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,115
Not just you. If the old man doesn't want to see us,

248
00:19:24,115 --> 00:19:26,500
begging wouldn't even help.

249
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:32,140
But if he wants to see us, he'll easily find us even if we go to Nanjue.

250
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,160
Forget it, it's hard to explain. Let's go. Don't dilly-dally.

251
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,500
Who's dilly-dallying?

252
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,260
Wait for me!

253
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,500
It's getting late.

254
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,580
Why don't we have dinner? Let's go to Diaolou Tavern. It's on me.

255
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,080
- Forget it. 
 - Senior Lei.

256
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,860
Oh, right. Listen carefully.

257
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,420
You're not allowed to leave the Academy for the next few days.

258
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,340
Just stay right here.

259
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,020
Why?

260
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,300
Don't ask so many questions. This is for your own good.

261
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,940
With your identity, you've got a lot of eyes on you.

262
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,740
Besides, you're not a student of the Academy yet. Just behave yourself.

263
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,500
I'm not a student of the Academy yet?

264
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,340
But didn't you all tell me I'm Mister Li's last disciple?

265
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,340
Kid, who gave you such courage and confidence?

266
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,580
You're just an alternative Old Seven found.

267
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,840
- Senior Lei. 
 - Senior Lei.

268
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,585
By the way, yesterday, the biggest gambling house in Tianqi City, Qianjin Gambling House,

269
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:42,300
started a new bet.

270
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,260
They're betting on who's going to be the old man's... no, wait.

271
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,220
Who will be Mister Li's last disciple?

272
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:55,940
Since your name isn't yet known to the world, they refer to you as "Little Master's Choice,"

273
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,500
and the betting odds are one-to-one.

274
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,420
One-to-one?

275
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,780
Not bad.

276
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,300
Looks like I'm pretty popular with everyone.

277
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,220
Do you know why?

278
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,500
Of course. I'm not stupid.

279
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,700
I'm sure it's all do to Little Master.

280
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,580
That's one piece of it and there's another.

281
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,460
What's it?

282
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,460
That's because they haven't seen you in person yet.

283
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,060
Though Master Tu of Qianjin Gambling House has just inherited the family business

284
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,160
and isn't really old, he has sharp eyes.

285
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,940
If he ever got a look at you, the odds would definitely change.

286
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,660
What do you mean by that?

287
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,180
Think about it yourself.

288
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,040
Senior Lei.

289
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,220
Let's go.

290
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,320
This is the one that Little Master and Senior Lei brought back?

291
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,660
He's so young.

292
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,420
Of course, he is. Little Master is young, too.

293
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,720
Little Master is a genius. Who can compete with him?

294
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,200
So the legendary last disciple he brought back must be on par with him.

295
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,500
Lei Mengsha, what if I don't get picked? What do I do then?

296
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,100
How rude you are.

297
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,060
If Master doesn't pick you, don't be discouraged.

298
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,520
There are 12 other teachers in the Academy. They accept disciples, too.

299
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,400
What if they take a liking to you someday?

300
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,200
I don't think that's possible.

301
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,540
But you don't have to be so discouraged. Think about it.

302
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,400
At worst, you can go to Affiliated Academy. It's big. It's easy to get in.

303
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,000
It's a good place for the nobles in the city to make a name for themselves in Tianqi City.

304
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,980
Like you, the young master of Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion.

305
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,600
If you want to go to Affiliated Academy,

306
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,640
whenever that is, you'll be its guest of honor.

307
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,400
But if you don't want fame or to spend your time like that,

308
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,660
you'll have to wait until next year to take the examination again.

309
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,600
But if you take the examination again next year, you won't have the chance to be Mister Li's last disciple.

310
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,160
So I came here in such high spirits,

311
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,680
- but I might have to head back to Qiandong City dejected? 
 - That's right.

312
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,380
Why didn't anyone tell me before I came?

313
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,520
We didn't tell you?

314
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,380
No. You can't blame me for this.

315
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,040
On your way to Tianqi City,

316
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,780
you acted as if Tianqi City was the place for you to impress everyone

317
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,360
and you were ready to make your mark.

318
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,400
Xiao Ruofeng and I could do nothing but encourage you.

319
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,880
Who was that?

320
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,680
You can't even dodge that?

321
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,670
Just go to the Affiliated Academy.

322
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,230

323
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,940
Sir, I've never seen anyone so dumb.

324
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,480
That's enough.

325
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,060
Seeing is believing.

326
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,200
It's an eye-opener.

327
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,600
- Is it true? 
 - Yes.

328
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,399
It is said that a disciple from Affiliated Academy wanted to test his martial skills,

329
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,580
so he threw a peach at his head.

330
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,100
He didn't even realize it and got hit right on the head.

331
00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:01,940
So, how could Little Master be so impressed by such a person?

332
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,940
He... He's hiding his strength.

333
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,280
No way.

334
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,980
Given Little Master's and Young Master Zhuomo's temperaments, they wouldn't do such a thing.

335
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,760
Unless...

336
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,500
he's really a good-for-nothing!

337
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,140
Why does Little Master want a good-for-nothing?

338
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,440
Who knows?

339
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,000
Maybe in a few years, he won't be a good-for-nothing.

340
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,600
Is it funny?

341
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,460
Where's Tu'er?

342
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,260
Off listening to songs.

343
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,180
He's a good-for-nothing, too.

344
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,500
He can't do anything. Never happy with anything.

345
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,060
Get someone to gather more information about the man the Little Master brought back.

346
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,460
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Come back here.

347
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,700
Go to the treasury and get 1,000 taels of gold.

348
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,740
Get someone to make a bet for me.

349
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,380
On whom?

350
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,580
On Little Master's Choice.

351
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,220
Yes, Sir.

352
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,040
Continue the massage.

353
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,960
Sir.

354
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,560
As you predicted, Young Miss traveled alone to Tianqi.

355
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,780
Young Miss is gentle and indecisive.

356
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,660
She seems to be swayed by the idea of restoring the country.

357
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:45,620
Plus, it's hard for her to bring back Baili Dongjun alone.

358
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,260
You and Qixuan go there secretly.

359
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,300
If necessary, you can help her.

360
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,960
Yes.

361
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,340
No news of Wufa or Wutian yet?

362
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:06,100
Envoys Wufa and Wutian lost half their powers to Scholarly Deity and ran off after their meridians were broken.

363
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,940
Since then, they've disappeared.

364
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,040
Our men searched for them but to no avail.

365
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,120
Fine then.

366
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,000
This time, I'll ask Wuzuo to go with you.

367
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,300
He's already left.

368
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,160
He'll help you if he has to.

369
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,980
We've been away from home too long.

370
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:35,860
So long that many of us have forgotten what home is like.

371
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:42,880
Only when the Chief finishes his retreat, and we all work together, can we go back.

372
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,340
I'll do whatever it takes to fulfill my duty.

373
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,380
What did you say?!

374
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,640
You're the one I trust the most.

375
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,720
How dare you tell Envoy Wuxiang the whereabouts of Young Miss!

376
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,540
I had no choice but to do so.

377
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,140
Yeah right, you had no choice?

378
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,420
Qixuan.

379
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,260
Don't forget we... have to go home.

380
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,740
What does Envoy Wuxiang want us to do?

381
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,280
He wants us to hide in the shadows and help make things happen.

382
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,600
- When do we depart? 
 - Tomorrow.

383
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,820
I got it.

384
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,560
You may leave now.

385
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,720
Very good.

386
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,120
It doesn't help at all.

387
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,580
 Wait, you really can't use any of your internal strength?

388
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,780
 Why do you still think I'm pretending?

389
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,140
 I already told you I don't know how to do it.

390
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,080
 I meant it.

391
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,180
 That's impossible.

392
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,080
 If you don't have any internal strength, how can you use Xichu's Sword Song?

393
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,500
 I got it.

394
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,740
 Your master must have done something to block all your internal strength.

395
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,080
 How about this?

396
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,860
 I'll teach you a set of internal strength breathing techniques.

397
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,480
 Let's see if it can draw out your internal strength.

398
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,420
 You don't need to thank me.

399
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,180
Looks like I have to pack and go back to Qiandong City.

400
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,360
How can a disciple of Scholarly Deity give up so easily?

401
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,040

402
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,540
Who are you?

403
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,340
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

404
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,340
Why should I tell you?

405
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,540
These sword moves are really exquisite.

406
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,580
As long as you know it.

407
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,160
But if you know only sword moves and have no internal strength, you're nothing.

408
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,580
I told you, without internal strength, how powerful can your fist be?

409
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,300
Stop!

410
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,460
Let's stop fighting.

411
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,260
Don't test me anymore. That's really all I've got.

412
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,360
I'm not hiding anything.

413
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,340
Test?

414
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,420
Who do you think I am?

415
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,660
You?

416
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,540
Aren't you one of those disciples from the Affiliated Academy?

417
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,180
Lei Mengsha was right.

418
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,940
Tianqi City has many talents.

419
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,660
I've come all this way for nothing.

420
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,480
I'll be laughed at by my father when I get back.

421
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,460
I've heard a lot about you and was interested in you.

422
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,100
Yet after a few days you've already become so dejected.

423
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,980
If you dare humiliate me, you'd better watch out or I...

424
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,800
I...

425
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,620
I'll call for someone.

426
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,300
You know the greatest sword techniques,

427
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,800
but you lost your confidence because you were struck by some mere fools.

428
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,780
You're not from the Academy.

429
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,744
Do you know why your master cultivated you with medicinal liquor

430
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:37,180
and gave you a full body of internal strength but you can't use a single bit of it?

431
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,980
Who are you?

432
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,020
How do you know all this?

433
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,020
I know a lot more.

434
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,400
I know a lot of things you don't.

435
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,460
Your master did this because

436
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,420
he was worried someone would find out before the time was right.

437
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,580
So he put a restraint on you to block your internal strength.

438
00:32:53,580 --> 00:33:00,280
Unless you can't control yourself, like when you're drunk.

439
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,460
You're a friend of my master's?

440
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,220
But you sound so young.

441
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,700
Young doesn't mean weak.

442
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,480
The Academy's Mister Li and Xichu's Sword and Scholarly Deities became famous

443
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,200
when they were young too.

444
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,460
I'm not really friends with Scholarly Deity but we had a connection.

445
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,180
I owe him a favor.

446
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,980
So now it's time to return the favor.

447
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,180
Can you... help me with the restraint?

448
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,800
If you try to forcibly remove the restraint, years of accumulated internal strength will surge through your body all at once.

449
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,860
You'll either die or become crippled.

450
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:37,360
Besides, I'm not going to do it the hard way.

451
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,780
My way is the only and best way.

452
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,300
What is it?

453
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:49,300
Let your internal strength slowly integrate into your body little by little.

454
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,300
- How? 
 - Learn internal strength techniques.

455
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,100
In the end, your style is the same as Lei Mengsha's.

456
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,380
Forget it. It's just a few days away.

457
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,780
If we could train our internal strength in just a few days, then everyone would be a great master.

458
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,700
- Do you think I'm stupid? 
 - But you're different.

459
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,020
The internal strength techniques I'm talking about aren't the same as Lei Mengsha's.

460
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,660
I'll come again tonight.

461
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,360
I'm not free tonight.

462
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,420
The weak have no right to say no.

463
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,020
You...

464
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,420

465
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,220
Yunyang.

466
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,400
Martial Uncle Wang, you're back!

467
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,070
After finishing this one, there's only one left.

468
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,570

469
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,540
One more and then I'll have to wait until next year.

470
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,460
Yuzhen.

471
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,100
Senior Brother.

472
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,920
Martial Uncle.

473
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,540
Yuzhen, you haven't finished the peaches yet?

474
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,360
Yes. But there's only two left.

475
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:42,280
Senior Brother, why do you think peaches only grow in summer and fall?

476
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,960
Why don't we have peaches all year round?

477
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,020
It's only when everything lies dormant in winter that the flowers bloom in spring

478
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,820
and in the summer and fall can have fruit.

479
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,800
There's a rule for everything. Just go with the flow.

480
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,220
But I want to eat peaches every day.

481
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:04,080
Everything has a rule, so I'll change it and make it serve a better cause.

482
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,700
- Senior Brother, is it fun outside of the mountain? 
 - Not bad.

483
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:14,260
There's good liquor and beautiful ladies, it kept me away for awhile.

484
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,020
I'd like to go down the mountain too.

485
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,140
Look what I've brought you.

486
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,820
A sword?

487
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,020
This is no ordinary sword.

488
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:31,060
This one is made from a fragment of the Kunlun Sword Deity's Grand Mysterious Sun sword.

489
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,820
It's the warmest sword on earth.

490
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,720
If you bury this sword in the ground, it'll keep the whole yard in spring.

491
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,020
You have to get better at practicing the Fire Arts.

492
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,100
Then it won't be hard for you to eat peaches in winter anymore.

493
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,680
- What's the name of this sword now? 
 - Divine Fire.

494
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,800
What an awful name.

495
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,740
Split.

496
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,060
Combine.

497
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,480
- You can use it this way? 
 - You can use it this way?

498
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,060
Of course. That's the way it works.

499
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,760
Yixing. You're back?

500
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,140

501
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,140
- Master. 
  - Chief.

502
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,340
I'll leave you all to it. I'm off then.

503
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,340
Take it.

504
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,540
Master, Junior Brother was talking about going down the mountain again.

505
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:14,660
I read Xiao Yu's fortune when he was born.

506
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,060
Whether it's secret techniques or swordsmanship,

507
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:22,220
he'll be the best at Mount Wangcheng for a hundred years.

508
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,740
But there is good and bad to this.

509
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,760
He's going to stay at Mount Wangcheng for the rest of his life.

510
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,320
If he goes down the mountain a catastrophe will come upon him.

511
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,840
He's not resigned to his fate.

512
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:40,900
He always thinks that destiny can be changed.

513
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,260
Is there really no other way?

514
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,700
How can you understand yourself better without seeing the world?

515
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,860
If there is, I'll think of a way.

516
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,180
You just stay out of this.

517
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,760
All right. You love to take everything upon yourself.

518
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,420
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

519
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,500
I haven't taken a shower the whole trip.

520
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,220
I feel so uncomfortable.

521
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,820
Come back here.

522
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,520
Did you meet a man named Baili Dongjun while traveling?

523
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,940
Oh, I forgot to mention that.

524
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,820
He's the heir of Xichu's Sword Song. What an eye-opener.

525
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,180
He went to Tianqi City.

526
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:28,420
Just let him be. It's good for young people to widen their horizons.

527
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,460
Coincidentally, you're going there, too.

528
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,900
Why? I literally just got back.

529
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,940
The Academy's examination is around the corner.

530
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,860
You have to go.

531
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:44,060
Master, are you asking me to join the Academy instead of learning from you?

532
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,900
Well, I only want to stay at Mount Wangcheng.

533
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,140
As for the Academy...

534
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,980
Is Mister Li still accepting disciples this year?

535
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,320
You wish to enter the Academy?

536
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,380
The Academy only asked us to send someone from our sect over.

537
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,460
What? Why me again?

538
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,094
I also want to seriously learn some techniques, pretend to be a master of the world,

539
00:40:09,094 --> 00:40:12,340
and get to know the beautiful girls down the mountain.

540
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,840
Because you're the only one who knows Baili Dongjun.

541
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,580
I'm asking you to go to Tianqi to keep an eye on this person.

542
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:24,740
The heir to Xichu's Sword Song will certainly cause chaos in the future.

543
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,140
But what's that got to do with me?

544
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:33,080
If you want to be the greatest martial arts master someday, he'll certainly be your rival.

545
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,220
Be the greatest martial arts master?

546
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,820
Master, you really think highly of me.

547
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,600

548
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:24,620
 I'm the White Feather Sword Deity's best friend, the Green Feather Liquor Deity.

549
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,180
 Come on, Brother Yun. It's your turn.

550
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,620
 Isn't this too embarrassing?

551
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,980
 - Come on. 
 - Brother Yun, go ahead.

552
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,400
 Brother Yun, you must do it.

553
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,860
 - Brother Yun, you can do it. 
 - I'm the White Feather Sword Deity's friend,

554
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,120
 the Green Feather Liquor Deity.

555
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:24,660
Brother Yun, Uncle Ye, Auntie, I'm here to see you.

556
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,500
Brother Yun, you know what?

557
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,100
I'm about to fulfill our pact.

558
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,220
There are few people in the world who can brew better liquor than me now.

559
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:50,340
In a few days, I'll challenge Diaolou Tavern's Qiulubai.

560
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,800
If I win against it, I'll become a world-famous liquor deity.

561
00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:00,660
But now, I've decided that I'll accomplish your part as well.

562
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,580
Not only will I be a liquor deity, but I'll also be a sword deity.

563
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,940
Brother Yun.

564
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,176

565
00:43:17,176 --> 00:43:19,520

566
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:30,920

567
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:42,500
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫
