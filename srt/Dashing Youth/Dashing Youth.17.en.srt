177
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,180

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,020
I'll go to Luo Xuan.

188
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,060
He sings well.

189
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,340
Mrs. Lei, he has admitted his fault.

190
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,460
He gave you his promise as well.

191
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,580
You should forgive him.

192
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,860
Mr. Li, you're already here.

193
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,820
I can't just beat him to death.

194
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,060
Mr. Li,

195
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,060
I assume you're not just here

196
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,460
to rescue this useless fool.

197
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,580
I shall not interrupt your conversation.

198
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,740
Hanyi.

199
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,460
Let's go.

200
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,420
Master.

201
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,300
Master,

202
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,860
luckily, you showed up in time.

203
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,420
My wife was almost beating me to death.

204
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,980
I didn't want to come here initially.

205
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,020
Even if you don't die now,

206
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,380
you will die

207
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,780
because of your laughable aspiration

208
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,380
in a few more years.

209
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,340
Master,

210
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,460
you still remember it?

211
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,980
Back then,

212
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,490
you said your aspiration
lies with the world.

213
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,940
I mocked you for being a child.

214
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,100
Now, your child

215
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,340
is learning how to curse you out.

216
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,740
You can't afford

217
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,460
to be the same young man

218
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,180
who approached me back then.

219
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,460
Tell me about it.

220
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,780
What does the world mean to you?

221
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,220
The world?

222
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
Back then, I was young and impulsive.

223
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,860
I thought the world

224
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,820
was a place where young men
like us could venture and conquer.

225
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,900
What about now?

226
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,900
Now, I've finally figured it out.

227
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,700
The world is never a place

228
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,060
for us to venture and conquer.

229
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,340
It's a place where many living humans

230
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,620
are trying their best to live.

231
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,700
What about your aspiration, then?

232
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,220
It still lies with the world.

233
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,260
Now, it's about protecting the world.

234
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,180
It's been many years.

235
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,220
It seems like you have changed,

236
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,380
but it also seems like
you haven't changed at all.

237
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,660
You and Jianmen are best friends.

238
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,780
Now that Jianmen is gone,

239
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,900
you're spending time with Ruofeng.

240
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,940
But Ruofeng has a special identity.

241
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,180
He'll leave the Academy eventually.

242
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,980
By then, you...

243
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,180
Master,

244
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,780
I don't want to leave the Academy.

245
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,460
However, the Academy is a place

246
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,620
just for you to study.

247
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,180
Once you grow up
and are done with your studies,

248
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,780
you have to leave the Academy.

249
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,900
Since the students are gone,

250
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,300
there's no need for the old teacher
to remain there any longer.

251
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,780
Master,

252
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,740
don't tell me you're leaving?

253
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,500
That's right.

254
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,340
Mengsha, you have to
leave eventually as well.

255
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,700
However,

256
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,940
once you take that step,

257
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,780
you won't be able

258
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,180
to return to the Lei Clan again.

259
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,300
If so, I won't.

260
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,860
You don't wish to implicate
the Lei Clan.

261
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,700
That's why you disregarded
the clan rules

262
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,060
and made them kick you
out of the clan deliberately.

263
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,100
You didn't want to implicate
your wife and child.

264
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,980
That's why you made your daughter
take her mother's surname.

265
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,820
If anything happens,

266
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,620
at least

267
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,420
the Swordheart Grave can back them up.

268
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,020
But Mengsha,

269
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,300
those who achieve great feats

270
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,340
have to sever their ties
with the past completely.

271
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,580
Well...

272
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,700
You still have a long way to go.

273
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,020
Tell Hanyi to go to me

274
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,300
when the time comes.

275
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,660
I'll teach her swordsmanship.

276
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,300
Master.

277
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,700
Well...

278
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,140
Aren't you going to come back?

279
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,940
You fool!

280
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,660
You only got the point

281
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,980
after so long?

282
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,780
You think a person like you

283
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,380
can protect the world?

284
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,780
Listen. Not everyone has the right

285
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,580
to protect the world.

286
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,940
If you and Ruofeng

287
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,820
wish to acquire that right,

288
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,460
you have to go
through trials and hardships.

289
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,580
You better

290
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,340
don't die
in the middle of the process.

291
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,300
Mr. Li, I won't disappoint you.

292
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,180
You've already disappointed me.

293
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,420
My only wish

294
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,540
is for my disciples to travel
the martial arts world freely

295
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,660
and do whatever they like.

296
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,660
The responsibility of protecting the world
is too heavy to bear.

297
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,980
It's fine as long as
you don't let yourself down.

298
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,340
[Nanjue]

299
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,740
I heard that Li Changsheng

300
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,820
intends to leave Tianqi City.

301
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,540
If Li Changsheng's not in Tianqi City,

302
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,180
although you have to pay a price

303
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,180
for taking someone away by force,

304
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,060
it'll not be too difficult.

305
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,820
I'll head there myself.

306
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,900
You've been this stubborn

307
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,260
since young.

308
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,300
You think you don't need help?

309
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,340
Even if you're capable,

310
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,980
I'm afraid your beloved

311
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,460
would've been married
to someone else by now.

312
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,740
Master.

313
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,380
I wish to master
the Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

314
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,220
I never expected you
to go through that much

315
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,380
in just six months.

316
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,340
Your journey was bumpier than mine.

317
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,580
So,

318
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,740
how did it go last night?

319
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,420
Why are you the same as them?

320
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,620
You shouldn't learn
all that nonsense from them.

321
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,380
Sikong Changfeng,
don't you have a conscience?

322
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,820
People slandered me because of you

323
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,980
and Senior Lei.

324
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,780
I even argued with Luoxia
because of that.

325
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,620
You should cut me some slack.

326
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,340
She

327
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,700
only caught up with me yesterday.

328
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,940
She took me

329
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,180
as a big brother she played with
when she was young.

330
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,260
Judging from your tone,

331
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,620
you sound disappointed.

332
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,620
What's there for me
to be disappointed about?

333
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,540
I made acquaintances
with a beauty that's hard to meet

334
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,460
just because I played a random tune.

335
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,020
People wished they were as lucky as me.

336
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,180
Why should I be disappointed?

337
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,620
Fine. You're not disappointed, then.

338
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,580
If so, are you her brother or not?

339
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,580
How should I know?

340
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,980
I can't recall the past.

341
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,180
Right.

342
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,540
You told me that you lost your memories.

343
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,740
Maybe.

344
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,780
I didn't think of it on purpose.

345
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,140
When I think about it,

346
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,300
I think my life before this

347
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,100
was all blank and empty.

348
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,580
Seems like

349
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,900
you truly forgot everything.

350
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,020
So what?

351
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,020
It's not like

352
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,100
I'm depending on my past to survive.

353
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,380
Sikong Changfeng.

354
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,540
Have you considered this, then?

355
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,780
You don't know about your background,

356
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,780
yet you two

357
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,700
know the same tune.

358
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,180
What does that mean?

359
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,820
I don't know either.

360
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,540
What are you doing?

361
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,060
What if you are truly her brother?

362
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,340
What if she played that tune

363
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,060
so that her brother could recognize it
and show up?

364
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,700
There are plenty of customers
in Baihua Hall.

365
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,180
Some are from Tianqi while some aren't.

366
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,420
Some are rich while some are poor.

367
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,700
Why are you the only person
who has heard that tune before?

368
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,860
Aren't you anxious at all?

369
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,180
She's very popular, you know?

370
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,260
Once you miss out on her,

371
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,740
you won't get another chance.

372
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,900
But I can't remember anything.

373
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,740
I can't remember anything

374
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,020
no matter what I do.

375
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,860
Why are you panicking when I'm not?

376
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,740
Baili Dongjun,

377
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,380
the past may be in the past,

378
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,860
but there might still...

379
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,620
be a future for us.

380
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,460
Fine, then.

381
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,380
Why haven't you started
brewing liquor yet?

382
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,860
Don't tell me you forgot about the bet

383
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,660
on the 14th day of the month?

384
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,020
Of course, I remember that.

385
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,780
I'm trying to get inspiration here.

386
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,980
Why are you panicking when I'm not?

387
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,260
Baili Dongjun, you...

388
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,620
This isn't about you alone, you know?

389
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,660
My spear was there as a mortgage.

390
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,620
All right. I got it.

391
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,500
Don't worry.

392
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,900
Your business is my business.

393
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,260
Just leave your spear to me.

394
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,180
Who's there?

395
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,060
Qixuan, it's you.

396
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,140
What are you doing here?

397
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,300
I came upon receiving your letter.

398
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,780
And, we will leave this place soon.

399
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,420
Leave?

400
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,420
So...

401
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,700
That means you guys

402
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,820
were the ones
behind Ye Dingzhi's incident.

403
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,780
Yes.

404
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,940
Yuji discovered that Ye Dingzhi

405
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,540
was an innate martial artist as well.

406
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Now, it doesn't matter

407
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,180
even if we don't
have Baili Dongjun with us.

408
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,780
But...

409
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,940
Young Lady,
what's with all the questions?

410
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
Could it be that your intention
to restore our state

411
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,660
has been shaken?

412
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,580
That's right.

413
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,060
My intention has been shaken...

414
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,820
after all this while.

415
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,420
Qixuan,

416
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,180
so what

417
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,260
if we find an innate martial artist?

418
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,540
We can unlock Langyue,

419
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,220
wait for Father to come out
from his seclusion,

420
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,300
and order the cavalries of Beique

421
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,100
to annihilate Beili.

422
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,500
Is that it?

423
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,340
But what about

424
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,140
the people who have just settled down

425
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,540
from the flames of war

426
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,580
barely 20 years ago?

427
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,340
Luoxia.

428
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,460
Who's there?

429
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,780
Luoxia.

430
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,540
Young Master told me to call for you.

431
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,620
Luoxia?

432
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,740
All right. Coming.

433
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,940
Luoxia, you're here.

434
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,860
Master.

435
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,540
Look at the weiqi pieces.

436
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,500
The black weiqi pieces are unmatched.

437
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,300
They're forcing the white weiqi pieces
to retreat to a corner.

438
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,140
They're going to win.

439
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
But it's not like there's no chance

440
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,460
for the white weiqi pieces
to make a comeback,

441
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,700
right?

442
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,220
Master, you said so yourself
that it was just a possibility.

443
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
The white weiqi pieces

444
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,740
have too slim of a chance to win.

445
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,780
And, the price they have to pay
is too huge.

446
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,300
It's more likely
that they'll suffer a complete defeat.

447
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,300
Just now,

448
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,500
I saw a pigeon from Xue

449
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,300
flying by.

450
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,500
It was agile and swift.

451
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,620
It looked beautiful.

452
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,140
Here he comes.

453
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,940
Luoxia,

454
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,020
do you remember

455
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,260
the first thing I told you?

456
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,060
You...

457
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,780
are here.

458
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,300
Luoxia.

459
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,940
Since I'm now your master,

460
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,740
your identity

461
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,500
and background don't matter.

462
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,260
You're still my disciple.

463
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,620
You're my first disciple.

464
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,740
You're also my only disciple.

465
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,780
No matter what happens,

466
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,500
I'll take care of everything.

467
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,380
Master.

468
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,820
Xin.

469
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,260
When will Yao come back?

470
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,020
I'm bored to death.

471
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,180
In the past, no one looked for me

472
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,300
no matter where I went.

473
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,020
Now that she's back,

474
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,900
it's as if we have
a grand court assembly every day.

475
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,340
Different people come to her

476
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,820
for different matters every day.

477
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,820
I can't do this anymore.

478
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,140
Xin, I'm exhausted.

479
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,340
Now that I'm counting the days,

480
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,060
I think she'll return soon.

481
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,740
Second Young Lady,
you should wait for a little longer.

482
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,740
Young Lady, I, Wuxiang,
have something to report to you.

483
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,740
Lord Wuxiang.

484
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,780
I feel unwell lately.

485
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,580
You may make the decisions yourself.

486
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,620
Second Young Lady.

487
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,660
He saw through me?

488
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,820
Second Young Lady,

489
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,020
no one could tell
when you were passing off as Young Lady.

490
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,740
So what?

491
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,060
You still saw through me.

492
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,420
Lord Wuxiang.

493
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,140
Spare the formalities.

494
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,620
Second Young Lady,
you're the twin sister

495
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,820
of Young Lady.

496
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,580
And, you two grew up together.

497
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,500
You two are very close.

498
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,380
Logically speaking, if you truly
wanted to pass off as Young Lady,

499
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,060
it should be hard to see through.

500
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,700
If so, Lord Wuxiang,
how did you find out?

501
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,740
Young Lady is a reserved person
while you're more active.

502
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,420
You two have different personalities.

503
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,700
Moreover,

504
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,940
I watched over you two
as you two grew up.

505
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,900
It's not that easy

506
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,500
to deceive me.

507
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,420
Second Young Lady,
it must have been tough on you.

508
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,500
Lord Wuxiang,

509
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,140
since you knew that I was here,

510
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,500
does that mean

511
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,420
you know where Yao is?

512
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,580
What?

513
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,180
Is Yao coming back soon?

514
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,660
Is she in trouble?

515
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,340
Second Young Lady, don't worry.

516
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,820
Young Lady is fine.

517
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,220
It's just that...

518
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,820
It's just that...

519
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,900
What?

520
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,580
Get to the point!

521
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,860
You're just making me get anxious.

522
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,740
It's just that Young Lady

523
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,500
might not return

524
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,540
to Sky's Beyond anymore.

525
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,020
She's not returning to Sky's Beyond?

526
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,700
What do you mean?

527
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,220
It's just like what I've said.

528
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,940
Young Lady released
the innate martial artist

529
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,420
and gave up on restoring the state.

530
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,700
She's not returning to Sky's Beyond.

531
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,180
She gave up on restoring the state?

532
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,820
Why would Yao give up
on restoring the state?

533
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,980
I don't believe it.

534
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,100
Xin, do you believe that?

535
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,260
I don't either.

536
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,180
Wuxiang, are you lying to me?

537
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,500
Are you trying to target
me and my sister

538
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,260
because of your selfish ambitions?

539
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,860
After some time,

540
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,660
Yuji and Qixuan will return.

541
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,860
Second Young Lady,
even if you don't believe me,

542
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,340
you should believe them, right?

543
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,860
What else

544
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,180
do you want to tell me?

545
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,420
All this while,

546
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,060
I've been bothered

547
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,140
by one particular thought.

548
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,940
Those around me and I

549
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,940
had once devoted our efforts
to one particular goal.

550
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,900
But lately, I realized

551
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,420
that it might not

552
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,900
be the right thing to do.

553
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,860
Speaking of the right goal,

554
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,100
I haven't found it yet.

555
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,220
I'm confused.

556
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,260
Master,

557
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,180
please enlighten me.

558
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,900
You see, in life,

559
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,180
right and wrong

560
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,620
cannot be differentiated clearly.

561
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,860
We make different choices

562
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,940
at different periods in life.

563
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,340
Once you've witnessed

564
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,660
how vast the world is,

565
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,220
naturally, your perspective
will become different as well.

566
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,940
Luoxia, why are you suffering?

567
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,340
Was it because

568
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,980
you took a path
different from the others?

569
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,860
Or...

570
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,020
was it because you haven't
found an answer yet?

571
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,900
Perhaps it's both.

572
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,820
In life,

573
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,540
no one can guarantee

574
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,860
that they can travel together
with other people.

575
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,220
Even if it's us,
the Eight Young Masters of Beili,

576
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,100
all of us are taking different paths.

577
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,900
So what?

578
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,340
Therefore,

579
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,060
it depends on who you wish

580
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,500
to travel with the most.

581
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,900
Are you still lost?

582
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,660
If so, that means

583
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,940
you need to continue

584
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,580
seeking the answer
at the bottom of your heart.

585
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,420
Second Young Lady,

586
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,580
you should rest early.

587
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,900
The Left and Right Guardians

588
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,300
won't return that soon.

589
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,820
Xin.

590
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,740
What if...

591
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,300
I'm saying what if.

592
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,300
What if Wuxiang was speaking the truth?

593
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,940
What should we do, then?

594
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,500
I don't know.

595
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,420
I just think

596
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,940
that Young Lady might be doing so
for her own reasons.

597
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,460
Second Young Lady, what about you?

598
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,060
Me?

599
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,780
The Beili Army is attacking!

600
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,620
Young Lady, run!

601
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,500
Young Lady!

602
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,940
That's the hairpin Mother gave me
before she died...

603
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,700
Qing!

604
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,300
Give it back to me!

605
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:56,780
Qing!

606
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,060
Give it back to me!

607
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,900
Qing!

608
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,060
Yao!

609
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,060
She seized the hairpin Mother gave me!

610
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,980
That's mine!

611
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,740
That's my home!

612
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,340
Give it back to me!

613
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,380
Give it back to me!

614
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,340
Second Young Lady!

615
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,340
I might...

616
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,700
hate her to the core for this.

617
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,980
Liu Yue,

618
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,500
are you admiring the moon here?

619
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,340
Master.

620
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,020
Can you truly see the moon

621
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,420
behind that veil of yours?

622
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,700
Admiring the moon behind the veil

623
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,020
is just like
admiring flowers in the mist.

624
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,540
It's beautiful in its own way.

625
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,020
Tell me.

626
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,060
Why were you looking for me?

627
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,180
Master, I heard that you were about
to embark on a journey.

628
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,700
Master, will you depart alone?

629
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,580
You're much smarter than Lei'er.

630
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,540
Of course not.

631
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,180
I'll travel
with that troublesome junior of yours,

632
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,180
Baili Dongjun.

633
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
If so, can you take
one more person with you?

634
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,700
Do you intend to make me

635
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,500
take your disciple as well?

636
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,260
Master, you do know me well.

637
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,100
As a master,

638
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,740
not only do I have
to deal with my disciples,

639
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,820
but I also have to deal
with my disciples' disciples?

640
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,420
I wouldn't take any of you in
had I known this would happen.

641
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,460
You brats worry me to no end.

642
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,140
Young people

643
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,980
should go out and explore the world.

644
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,780
They shouldn't be stuck in Tianqi City.

645
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,420
Master, if Luoxia can
travel the world with you

646
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,300
and Dongjun,

647
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,940
I'm sure her horizons

648
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,540
will be broadened.

649
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,300
You look pretty free yourself.

650
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,980
Why aren't you taking her
on a journey yourself?

651
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,420
It's inconvenient for me

652
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,220
to travel the martial arts world
with my looks.

653
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,420
But Master, you...

654
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,180
Thank you, Master.

655
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,420
Fine, fine.

656
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,580
Oh my.

657
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,300
You sly little fox.

658
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:19,350
[Lansheng, Yaoquan, Sitangchun, Biluo]

659
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,620
I smell the scent of the peach blossom.

660
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,620
Dongjun,

661
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,020
each type of liquor
has its own character.

662
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,260
Just like humans.

663
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,660
Liquors of different characters

664
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,500
will give out different tastes.

665
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,660
I often heard

666
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,100
that the Qiulubai of Tianqi City

667
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,740
has three kinds of taste.

668
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,580
Could it be that it contains

669
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,740
three characters?

670
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,660
When you drink,

671
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,020
what you feel

672
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,420
will be the flavor of the liquor itself.

673
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,220
It's not because the liquor
has three characters.

674
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,780
It's because your heart

675
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,260
is guided by the liquor.

676
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,660
Due to that, emotions
start flooding into your heart.

677
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,460
If so, Master,

678
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,940
what does your favorite liquor

679
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,940
taste like?

680
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,820
It's the happiest taste...

681
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,940
I've ever had in my life.

682
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,380
It's also...

683
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,780
the most regretful taste
I've ever had in my life.

684
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,540
Where can I find such liquor?

685
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,140
It's actually covering
two sides of the spectrum.

686
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,220
You can find it.

687
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,500
It's called

688
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Peach Blossom

689
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,820
and The Descending Moon.

690
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,500
Peach Blossom and The Descending Moon?

691
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,420
If so, could there be a type of liquor

692
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,740
that gives out a taste of love

693
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,180
and heartlessness at the same time?

694
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,020
The most heartless one
is often the most loving one.

695
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,940
It's comparable to seeing stars
in broad daylight.

696
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,100
He's drinking this early in the day?

697
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,860
Initially, I thought

698
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,060
the matter would end

699
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,140
after Li Changsheng caused
such a huge commotion

700
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,180
and announced to the public

701
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,940
that he would leave Tianqi

702
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,020
with Baili Dongjun.

703
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,100
I never expected

704
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,300
all kinds of troubles
to arise from this.

705
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,020
It's just a bottle of liquor,

706
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,300
yet it represents
His Majesty's authority.

707
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,900
Baili Dongjun
is disrespecting His Majesty

708
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,620
for requesting that pot of liquor.

709
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,380
It's a shame

710
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,020
that His Majesty

711
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,060
dares not provoke Mr. Li.

712
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,460
Although he's enraged,

713
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,340
he cannot express his emotions.

714
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,900
Therefore, at this moment,

715
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,100
I'm sure His Majesty

716
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,700
hopes that someone can stand up

717
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,460
and wield that sword on his behalf.

718
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,300
I understand.

719
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,580
Your Highness,

720
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,380
a guest has arrived.

721
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,700
The message relayed to me
by the Grand Eunuch's messenger

722
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,140
made me sweat.

723
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,380
However, it's also making me excited.

724
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,780
When will Baili Dongjun

725
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,700
spar with Master Xie?

726
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,660
Your Highness, it's tomorrow.

727
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,780
Seems like the luck is on my side.

728
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,860
Yingxian, tell me.

729
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,860
What if this young master

730
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,900
never leaves Tianqi City alive?

731
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,900
Doesn't that mean my throne will be...

732
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,820
However, the Marquis of Zhenxi
possesses immense military strength.

733
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,420
If just due to

734
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,140
the rebellious young master's death

735
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,220
in a brawl in Tianqi City,

736
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,740
troops are mobilized, causing unrest,

737
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,540
do you think an army like that

738
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,500
can achieve victory?

739
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,660
Your Highness, you're wise indeed.

740
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,950
[Qianjin House]

741
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,780
Sir,

742
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,020
the odds for Baili Dongjun's victory

743
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,300
has reached 1,500.

744
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,740
Just do the usual thing.

745
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,980
Find a random person.

746
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,380
Bet 1,000 taels on him

747
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,540
using his name.

748
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,180
Gold taels.

749
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,940
I understand.

750
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,500
You're betting on Master Xie, right?

751
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,460
Come back.

752
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,180
Who said I was betting on Master Xie?

753
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,300
Bet on Baili Dongjun.

754
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,220
Here, have some of this.

755
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,220
It'll make your dumb brain smarter.

756
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,140
Go now.

757
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,100
Yes, sir.

758
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,460
What a familiar sight.

759
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:05,980
No wonder

760
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,660
they said I made a fortune.

761
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,900
Did he get the time wrong?

762
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,500
It's been so long.

763
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,940
I guess he got the date wrong.

764
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,540
The Eight Young Masters of Beili
are here!

765
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,580
Are all eight of them here?

766
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,100
Let's go and take a look!

767
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
They're here!

768
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,180
They're actually here!

769
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,980
It's rare to see

770
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,380
all of them appearing at the same time.

771
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,120
[Miss Yueya, Liquor Taster]
[Mr. Xun, Liquor Taster]

772
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,060
Sirs, please.

773
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,260
Master Xie.

774
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,940
Who is this?

775
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,380
This is Mr. Qingxiang, Xie Xuan.

776
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,500
So it's Mr. Qingxiang.

777
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,460
I've long heard of your name.

778
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,500
Greetings, Master Xie.

779
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,420
Please.

780
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,060
Excellent.

781
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,580
Let's go upstairs.

782
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,380
Little Mister, please stay here.

783
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,540
Do you still remember

784
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,620
our promise?

785
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,180
Aren't you afraid
that I might practice favoritism?

786
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,860
Little Master,

787
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,900
you're more trustworthy

788
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,900
than Mr. Li from the Academy.

789
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,740
All right.

790
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,620
You should just call for me later.

791
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,380
He's looking at me!

792
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,900
Wretched fools.

793
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,300
Is today the day

794
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,780
Baili Dongjun

795
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,260
will spar with Master Xie
in a liquor-brewing contest?

796
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,300
That's right, Your Majesty.

797
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,380
Which of the princes have gone there?

798
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,900
Second Prince

799
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,740
and Ninth Prince.

800
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,980
Ruofeng is Baili Dongjun's senior.

801
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,980
It makes sense for him to be there.

802
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,180
But why is Xie there too?

803
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,660
Second Prince

804
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,780
always loves to share your burden
with you, Your Majesty.

805
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,020
Zhuoqing.

806
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,500
You do live up to your reputation

807
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,100
as my Grand Eunuch.

808
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,280
[No animals were harmed
during the filming of this drama.]

809
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,700
