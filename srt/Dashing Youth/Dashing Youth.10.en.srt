136
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,900
Someone who runs a gambling house.

137
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,460
A gambling house manager

138

Not even the gods can save you.

155
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,180

Indeed,

158
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,180
there's nothing worse than that.

159
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,500
Because you got yourself

Let me see what you've got.

167
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,500
Not too bad.

168
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,940
Tian King and Tian Nine.

169
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,740
They make a good match
with your Tian tiles.

170
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,820
All the gibberish

171
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,060
just flies over my head.

172
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,820
But the words do sound pretty cool.

173
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,260
So, do you have a chance of winning?

174
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,940
You showed my tiles to the public

175
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,820
but the banker hasn't shown his.

176
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,060
How would I know if I'm able to win?

177
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,180
No need to trouble you, mister.

178
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,940
I'll do it myself.

179
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,500
Double Earth and Plum.

180
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,740
Is it a good hand?

181
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,180
Not the best.

182
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,220
But it's more than enough

183
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,580
to win me.

184
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,660
And yours?

185
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,860
Double Human.

186
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,300
Is it good?

187
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,540
It is a good hand,

188
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,820
but it's not better
than the banker's Double Earth.

189
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,700
She's lost too.

190
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,500
Your deck

191
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,580
is pretty good.

192
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,780
But it's too bad...

193
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,460
That's not all I've got.

194
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,420
Supreme Duo?

195
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:25,860
What?

196
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,480
She actually got the Supreme Duo!

197
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,220
I've never seen that before.

198
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,260
What is up with her luck?

199
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,300
What's going on?

200
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,500
How could that be?

201
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,420
Could it really be her?

202
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,980
I can't believe it.

203
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,700
Gamblers

204
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,300
could hardly think of getting
the Supreme Duo

205
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,220
that can win against everything
once in their lives.

206
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,980
But this is the first time

207
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,300
I've seen someone producing
the Supreme Duo.

208
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,300
Supreme Duo?

209
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,900
That's a good deck.

210
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,020
Why are you so surprised, Master Tu?

211
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,700
That lady.

212
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,900
She cheated.

213
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,900
Did you see it?

214
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,900
If I did,

215
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,500
she'd have to leave her hands

216
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,380
in Qianjin House

217
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,420
no matter what.

218
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,700
If you didn't see it,

219
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,540
how come

220
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,900
you're so sure she cheated?

221
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,500
Because Tu Wan cheated.

222
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,260
When he's seated down there,

223
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,220
no one would be able to get
the Supreme Duo.

224
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,220
But didn't you say

225
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,900
that in Qianjin House,

226
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,100
there have never been

227
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,380
any cases of cheating?

228
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,420
If caught, then it's cheating.

229
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,500
If not caught,

230
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,740
then it's a skill.

231
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,300
Aren't you going to check

232
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,700
whether or not your meat is grilled?

233
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,460
You go check

234
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,500
if your liquor is done brewing.

235
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:50,940
Yes.

236
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,420
Let's go.

237
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,180
Second Master Tu.

238
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,100
What now?

239
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,860
May I know your name, miss?

240
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,620
I've told you

241
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,860
that I'm Yin Luoxia.

242
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,660
Tu Zao!

243
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,300
You think I'm a fool?

244
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,420
I thought she was a scam.

245
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,620
That's why I called you

246
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,660
to test her ability.

247
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,780
Besides, you deserved the loss.

248
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,500
Ye Dingzhi.

249
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,860
Is she famous?

250
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,220
Well,

251
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,980
she is the daughter
of the former King of Gambling.

252
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,580
Back then,

253
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,540
at the third biggest

254
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,780
gambling house in Beili,

255
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,180
Qingzhou's Xiaoyao Hall,

256
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,700
the King of Gambling

257
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,300
lost to Lian Rulie from Nanjue.

258
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
The wealth he accumulated for decades

259
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,940
was lost in one game.

260
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,140
The next day,

261
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,940
his daughter took the seat at the table.

262
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,340
She won three games in a row

263
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,940
and reclaimed the title
of the King of Gambling.

264
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,260
She was just 10 years old then.

265
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,700
She was too short

266
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,300
and had to sit

267
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,700
on the King of Gambling's shoulders
to play.

268
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,300
Turns out you're the King of Gambling.

269
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,860
My skills pale in comparison.

270
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,780
I admit defeat.

271
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,700
We can gamble another time.

272
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,260
Forget about gambling.

273
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,660
Do I pass the exam?

274
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,060
To be able to cheat in Qianjin House

275
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,340
is indeed a skill.

276
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,460
Pass.

277
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,860
Candidate Yin Luoxia
passes the preliminary examination.

278
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,220
You dare choose to brew liquor

279
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,100
in such a limited examination period.

280
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,140
You must be either a genius or a fool.

281
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,780
Hopefully you're a genius.

282
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,940
Then

283
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,820
we'd be able to be classmates.

284
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,380
Did she have to

285
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,540
poke fun at me before she left?

286
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,180
Think positive.

287
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,420
She was encouraging you.

288
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,540
As if I'd believe that.

289
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,780
What are you doing?

290
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,660
Leave it here for a moment.

291
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
So I can also sleep for a while.

292
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,540
Still not out yet?

293
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,060
It's been so long.

294
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,780
Judging by the time,
they should be about done.

295
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,380
How long have they been inside?

296
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,300
I'm not sure.

297
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,780
Look.

298
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,700
They haven't come out after so long.

299
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,900
It's been many hours.

300
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,900
What are they testing?

301
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,940
Oh my.

302
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,540
Well.

303
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,780
What exactly is going on in there?

304
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,420
Why aren't they out yet?

305
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,420
[Qianjin House]
Yeah.

306
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,420
- Yes.
- Right.

307
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,940
Why aren't they out yet?

308
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,820
Two hours is over?

309
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,660
No,

310
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,300
not yet.

311
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,060
But the incense stick

312
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,900
is already half burned.

313
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
It's not your problem.

314
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,260
The flow of time and space around here

315
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,890
has become chaotic

316
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,060
for some reason.

317
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,940
I filled the cup just now.

318
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,420
Why is it empty?

319
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,540
It's Qimen Dunjia.

320
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,300
Qimen Dunjia?

321
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,140
That's right.

322
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,180
Since you've mastered Qimen Dunjia,

323
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,660
I already know who you are.

324
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,780

326

Where are my flowers?

328
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,420
What happened?

329
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,820
I won't break

the formation.

331
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,820
Since you possess such a skill,

332
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,780
you get a pass.

333
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,820
I'm Zhuge Yun.

334

Thanks for seeing my poor performance.

You're too humble.

It means a lot.

Just like your surname is Baili.

Sir,

isn't the time you set

349
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,300
overly long?

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,660
12 hours in total.

Looks like you got up right on time.

Let me tell you.

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,100
Right.

He will be the Sword Deity

377
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,620
while I'll be the Liquor Deity.

378
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,140
The liquor brewed
by the future Liquor Deity

379
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,780
can't possibly be beaten
in such a place.

380
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,020
You also still remember.

381
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,300
I,

382
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,780
Baili Dongjun,

383
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,540
want to be tested together.

384
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,860
Is there liquor to drink?

385
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,540
You, another candidate,

386
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,900
you're the only one left
in the exam hall.

387
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,060
You, Master Tu, and I.

388
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,620
Why don't the three of us

389
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,460
judge this exam together?

390
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,540
What say you?

391
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,300
It's my pleasure.

392
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,580
The liquor smells fragrant.

393
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,340
Good liquor.

394
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,180
It's as good as the Money Water

395
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,900
we serve in Qianjin House.

396
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,020
Not bad.

397
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,860
It is good indeed.

398
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,380
The liquor has a rich taste

399
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,500
and it's smooth in the mouth.

400
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,180
It's something special.

401
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,180
Try the other one.

402
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,420
This liquor is as clear as crystal.

403
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,300
It doesn't smell strongly
of liquor either.

404
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,180
If you hadn't told me it's liquor,

405
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,620
I would've thought it was water.

406
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,540
But it does have

407
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,060
a refreshing scent.

408
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,340
It's...

409
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,780
It's sweet and light.

410
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,980
Baili Dongjun.

411
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,820
What's the name of this liquor?

412
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,660
Overly Soon.

413
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,020
Overly Soon?

414
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,540
Why is it named Overly Soon?

415
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,140
Because it should have been brewed
for much longer.

416
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,300
But in order for you all to taste it,

417
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,620
I took it out earlier.

418
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,180
But like an aged liquor
has its own taste,

419
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,700
an under-brewed liquor

420
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,020
also has the freshness
of early fermentation.

421
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,580
As for this brew,

422
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,100
it's not meant for liquor aficionados,

423
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,900
but more suited for gentle ladies

424
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,620
or

425
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,620
fragile elders.

426
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,980
Liquor can have different tastes.

427
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,780
Not one particular flavor

428
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,980
is the best.

429
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:42,980
Lingsu.

430
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,740
Pour me another cup.

431
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,740
Young man.

432
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,020
Can I have another cup?

433
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,260
As you wish.

434
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,300
You both ask for one cup,

435
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,580
but you are a bit greedy.

436
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,780
What a familiar taste.

437
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,780
You've sampled Overly Soon before?

438
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,260
I don't know

439
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,820
if it's overly soon or not.

440
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,260
All I know is that this liquor...

441
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,940
has the taste of Mother.

442
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,420
Since young, Mother would

443
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,740
make this kind of liquor for me
every year.

444
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,300
It made me think of my mother.

445
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,060
Sorry for getting emotional.

446
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,660
Please forgive me.

447
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,260
This liquor also reminded me
of my younger days.

448
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,500
It reminds me of my childhood friends.

449
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,700
The time is perfectly right.

450
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,020
Dongjun.

451
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,820
You said the liquor

452
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,380
is suitable for gentle ladies

453
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,060
and fragile elders.

454
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,860
But seems like

455
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,620
a heroic man

456
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,860
like Master Tu

457
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,470
and a wandering traveler

458
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,260
like Ye Dingzhi

459
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,820
also love the liquor.

460
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,940
Every person is different

461
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,020
and every liquor is distinct.

462
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,020
Who knows

463
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,620
which one you might choose?

464
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,420
All right.

465
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,620
We've tasted the liquors.

466
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,580
Now, let us try

467
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,420
the meat.

468
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,780
The same goes for me.

469
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,140
As you wish.

470
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,140
Liu Yue won't let me in.

471
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,620
Now you guys won't either?

472
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,060
I'm his senior brother.

473
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,090
[Qianjin House]

474
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,740
It's been so long.

475
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,900
Why aren't they out yet?

476
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,900
Could it be
Liu Yue is pulling a prank on me?

477
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,540
Have a taste, everyone.

478
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,940
Another piece.

479
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,380
The lamb seems to have come from Man.

480
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,420
Man?

481
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,020
Ye Dingzhi?

482
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,340
You've been to Man?

483
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,580
Beiman?

484
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,380
Yes, I have.

485
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,940
I had the opportunity

486
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,620
to take part
in their god-worshipping festival.

487
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,860
This leg of lamb

488
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,700
was grilled for exactly 12 hours.

489
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,060
Ye Dingzhi.

490
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,820
You didn't just visit Man,

491
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,780
but

492
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,060
you stayed there for some time, right?

493
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,180
The way the lamb
was cooked and prepared

494
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,620
and its taste
couldn't have been reproduced

495
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,100
by someone who merely went there
for a visit.

496
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,940
Yes.

497
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,940
In my heart,

498
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,300
visiting a place

499
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,900
isn't just taking a quick look around.

500
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,260
It's about

501
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,420
truly integrating into the life there.

502
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,780
Without a few years of living together,

503
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,460
it can't be considered an actual visit.

504
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:16,860
Ye Dingzhi.

505
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,140
I didn't expect

506
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,300
that we're about the same age,

507
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,100
you've experienced so much more.

508
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,100
Beiman is the northern-most place
I've been to

509
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,500
and Nanjue is the southern-most place
I've been to.

510
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,100
I've been to various Buddhist nations
in the west

511
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,860
and sailed across the seas in the east.

512
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,620
The world is vast.

513
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,500
I only worry that I wouldn't
be able to see it all

514
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,940
or travel far enough.

515
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,700
You really remind me

516
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,220
of a childhood friend of mine.

517
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,180
If he was alive,

518
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,900
he'd definitely live as carefree as you.

519
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,380
So Mr. Liuyue,

520
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,980
when can you give me an answer?

521
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,700
Regarding the liquors presented,

522
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,220
I'm sure everyone here

523
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,660
already has an answer.

524
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,420
The winner is...

525
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,060
Baili Dongjun.

526
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,100
The way he made the liquor

527
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,660
is the most common one
for making rice liquor.

528
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,700
Whereas mine is...

529
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,700
Your academy is prejudiced!

530
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,060
Your liquor is indeed a good liquor.

531
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,340
It is rich and smooth.

532
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,380
Then why?

533
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,180
But for this liquor,

534
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,620
even if you're the best brewmaster,

535
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,860
you'll need half a year

536
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,380
to produce this taste.

537
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,900
But you only used

538
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,060
12 hours

539
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,660
to produce the taste.

540
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,580
Lingsu.

541
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,300
Check him.

542
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,660
Sir.

543
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,620
It seems this man
replaced the liquor from the bottle

544
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,620
with the liquor
that was brewed on the spot.

545
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,020
Your name, Xin, stands for "trust."

546
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,380
Yet you did such a despicable act.

547
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,620
Remove him.

548
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,500
Someone.

549
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

550
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,420
Get out.

551
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,460
Put me down!

552
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,500
This is not fair!

553
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,100
You people are being unfair!

554
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,580
Let me go!

555
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,220
Let me go!

556
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,980
I don't care about your rules.

557
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,860
The point is,

558
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,300
I think this young man's Overly Soon

559
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,060
tastes better than that guy's liquor.

560
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,380
You've judged the liquors

561
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,260
and tasted my grilled meat.

562
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,020
Will Mr. Liuyue be able

563
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,580

00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,940
I simply made it up.

752
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,700
This technique

753
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,860
was created by your master.

754
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,820
It's called Autumn Water Technique.

755
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,700
Autumn Water Technique?

756
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,380
When the autumn water comes,

757
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,700
streams flow into the river.

758
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,460
The river current is so strong

759
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,940
that one couldn't distinguish
between cow and horse

760
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,140
in between two shores.

761
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,220
When your master was young,

762
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,220
he traversed the world.

763
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,380
He slept in the autumn
and next to grand rivers.

764
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,820
One night, he dreamed
of entering the waters

765
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,180
and spoke with the River Deity.

766
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,460
The next day,

767
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,020
he came up
with this Autumn Water Technique.

768
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,260
Use the natural energy
to guide the internal strength,

769
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,740
flowing continuously like a river.

770
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,900
That's brilliant.

771
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,740
In my mind,

772
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,900
there are three and a half eccentrics
in this world.

773
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,540
Who are the three and a half?

774
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,780
The first one

775
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,020
is your master,
the Scholarly Deity Gu Chen.

776
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,340
He read countless books
and had limitless imagination.

777
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,220
As if there is

778
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,540
nothing in the world
that he could not do.

779
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,220
The second one

780
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,820
is Mr. Li of the Academy.

781
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,340
However, I'm not one

782
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,460
to appreciate tackiness.

783
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,420
Because too many people admire

784
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,260
and respect him,

785
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,900
that made me not like him.

786
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,220
But he once tore off
the Martial Ranking

787
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,300
and claimed

788
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,580
that no one in the world

789
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,700
can judge him.

790
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,380
Now that's far from being
tacky behavior.

791
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,540
So I consider him an eccentric, too.

792
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,700
As for the half,

793
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,620
it's Imperial Master Qi Tianchen.

794
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,140
He is a very capable man.

795
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,020
He's on a par with Lyu Suzhen.

796
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,100
But because he serves
in the imperial court,

797
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,420
he is restrained by the title

798
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:48,900
of Imperial Master.

799
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,460
And so he lost half of the divine aura.

800
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,020
That's why he's only half an eccentric.

801
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,380
You only mentioned two and a half.

802
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,500
Who is the other one?

803
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,980
Me, myself.

804
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,860
Aren't you ashamed at all?

805
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,180
When it comes to martial arts,
every fighter thinks they're the best.

806
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,740
In the upcoming final examination,

807
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,900
it will be a duel of power.

808
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,220
But the rules this time

809
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:08,940
allow for teaming up.

810
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,300
So I'd suggest you to...

811
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,420
I have my own plan.

812
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,180
But if you do as I say,

813
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,740
you'll surely reach the last leg.

814
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,380
The Academy's exam

815
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,900
forbids outsiders to be in the venue.

816
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,340
How do you know so much?

817
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,660
Because there's nothing

818
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,940
that gets past me.

819
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,980
It's just you're dumber than I thought.

820
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,620
I can't believe you haven't figured out
who I am.

821
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,300
Baixiao Hall?

822
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,700
That's right.

823
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,540
I'm the chief of Baixiao Hall,

824
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,180
Ji Ruofeng.

825
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,380
Ruofeng.

826
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,820
How come you have the same name

827
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,580
as Xiao Ruofeng?

828
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,660
Now you've got me stumped.

829
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,620
Although he and I
are both named Ruofeng,

830
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,380
he is the wind to become a dragon.

831
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,140
People try to use him

832
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,820
to ascend to the Ninth Heaven
and transform into a dragon.

833
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,140
Whereas I am the shadowless wind.

834
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
I cannot be traced,

835
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,700
cannot be found,

836
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,740
and yet I am everywhere.

837
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,780
We are not the same.

838
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,260
What kind of qinggong is that?

839
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,700
Cloud-Stepping Wind.

840
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,500
I'm looking forward

841
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,660
to your performance on the exam.

842
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,180
Just make sure you don't die.

843
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,700
Is fighting to the death

844
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,180
part of the Academy's exam?

845
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,140
You've underestimated Tianqi City

846
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,020
as well as the Academy's exam.

847
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,740
Did I

848
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,740
underestimate Tianqi City?

849
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,980
I never underestimate anything.

850
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,460
I just believe

851
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,060
that with a sword in my hand,

852
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,500
I will be the one

853
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,700
who will make it to the end.

854
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,860
Ruofeng.

855
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,060
What do you think

856
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,260
of the candidates taking part

857
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,420
in the exam?

858
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,220
Aside from Ye Dingzhi,

859
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,620
there is one more person

860
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,740
whom we should pay attention to.

861
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,100
Despite him not having displayed

862
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,100
any other strengths,

863
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,060
but his name alone

864
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,260
is enough to conjure up all sorts.

865
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,660
Who?

866
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,780
Zhuge Yun.

867
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,500
Zhuge?

868
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,980
Do you mean that Zhuge?

869
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,380
Aside from that Zhuge,

870
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,860
who else in the world

871
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,180
knows Qimen Dunjia?

872
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,900
So Baili Dongjun is...

873
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,500
If Dongjun manages to return
from his studies

874
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,020
safely,

875
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,860
I will give you the antidote.

876
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
But if something bad

877
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,580
happened to him,

878
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,300
a person who's been poisoned
by Pleasant Death

879
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,420
will surely die a pleasant death.

880
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,660
Senior Lei,

881
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,860
your concern for Baili Dongjun

882
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,260
far exceeds that of mine as his patron.

883
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,620
I must say it's not normal.

884
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:29,540
Is it?

885
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,060
I don't think so.

886
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,140
After all,

887
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,860
he's once helped Jianmen.

888
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,740
We should help one another.

889
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,420
Rest assured.

890
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,460
The current Baili Dongjun

891
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,420
is no longer

892
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,460
the Baili Dongjun we're seeing now.
