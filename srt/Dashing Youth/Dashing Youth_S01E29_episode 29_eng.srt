♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,760
Here it comes.

25
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,225
Dragon Transformation, transform!

26
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:34,400

27
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,260
We've already used five groups of people as a diversion.

28
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,420
We're sure that they didn't catch up to us.

29
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,700
Is our mission considered complete, then?

30
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,180
If that's all there is, that means we only helped a couple get together

31
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,740
and annoy Prince Jingyu.

32
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,420
Of course, it's more than that.

33
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,560
Isn't this Feili, the Soul Official?

34
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,220
Leave the rest to us.

35
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,420
Esteemed envoys, we dare not trouble the two of you for such dirty deeds.

36
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,880
Does that mean the two of you are going to act together?

37
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,380
You guys should stop asking questions.

38
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,220
Instead, you should return to Tianqi as soon as possible

39
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,900
and continue to lie low while planning for the grand scheme.

40
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,060
Great.

41
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,000
But Feili, you mustn't let us down.

42
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,660
Finally, I got everything sorted.

43
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,980
Brother Ye, what's with all the trouble?

44
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,140
Isn't it better to live directly in the mountains?

45
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,820
This place is pretty good too.

46
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,520
Isn't it lonely to live alone?

47
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,360
You're a young boy. Do you understand the meaning of loneliness?

48
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,940
Brother Ye, you have some guests.

49
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,440
- Young Master. 
 - Why are you all back?

50
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,560
Young Master, we were supposed to lie low within Tianqi City

51
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,000
and inquire about Miss Yi under your orders.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,780
But a benefactor showed up a few days ago.

53
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,440
He gave us access to an opportunity.

54
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,000
Young Master, I'll leave the two of you to it. I'll tell you the details later.

55
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:29,346
♫  Even as the time passes quickly between spring and autumn  ♫

56
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:35,126
♫  I will never see the face of my old friend again  ♫

♫  By the window  ♫

65
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,200
On the day of your wedding,

66
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,200
I was there.

67
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,305
I know.

68
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,455
I heard you.

69
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,900
I went there with your senior.

70
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,060
We managed to reach the mansion's entrance.

71
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,614
I was even inside the mansion. I gave it my all.

72
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,260
I've tried my best to improve my martial arts since leaving Tianqi.

73
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:56,000
This way, I can go and pick you up once I can defeat them.

♫  Hoping that my dreams will still be fulfilled  ♫

75
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,220
♫  Memories seep into my mind, filling it with love and longing  ♫

76
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,000
If I have to wait until then, will I be old?

77
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,374
♫  Alas, sighing at a fate that is so sorrowful  ♫

78
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:16,980
♫  Because of you, the gratitude and grievances stir yet remain unsaid  ♫

79
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,865
You'll never grow old.

80

♫  Longing, Longing for karma that won't come  ♫

♫  By the window  ♫

86
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,020
Mister Qin.

87
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,360
May I ask where Young Master Feizhan is?

88
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,720
My name is Feili.

89
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,620
Are you two brothers?

90
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,060
We don't look alike, do we?

91
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,680
He's full of despair, while I'm a dashing gentleman.

92
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,180
Young Master Feili, you're such a jokester.

93
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,020
We were able to complete the task, all thanks to Young Master Feizhan's help.

94
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,180
I'm not done yet.

95
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,580
Although we're brothers, we do opposite things.

96
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,090
He saves people while...

97
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,690
I kill.

98
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,700
But why?

99
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:47,020
It's because all those who know about us have to die.

100
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,920
Did you say a woman
came looking for Ye Dingzhi?

101
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,860
And he was happy about it?

102
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,820
He was more than just happy.

103
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,020
It's just like...

104
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,720
It's just like...

105
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,080
It's just like me when I see candied hawthorns.

106
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,360
What does that woman look like?

107
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,700
Just like the goddesses we see in portraits.

108
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,520
People say that the women of Gusu City are beautiful.

109
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,410
But compared to that lady,

110
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,680
they're way inferior.

111
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,240
Isn't that Uncle Qin's zither?

112
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:29,893

113
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,400
 Young Master, after our brief encounter, I have to head back in advance.

114
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,560
 Someone is pursuing us.

115
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,240
 The four of us will proceed southward and lure them to Nanjue.

116
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,040
 Young Master, we'll come and see you again once everything has settled down.

117
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
 We were able to leave Tianqi together with Miss Yi

118
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,240
 all thanks to the help of Deputy Commander Luo and General Ye's old acquaintances.

119
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,380
 Deputy Commander Luo helped us to escape Prince Jingyu's Mansion

120
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,460
 while General Ye's old acquaintances escorted us out of Tianqi until we reached Gusu.

121
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,220
 Now, we've parted ways.

122
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,140
 Each of us is leading our pursuers to different locations.

123
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,920
 But we should be reunited someday.

124
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,640
 Young Master, please don't worry.

125
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,380
 From Qin Yuehan.

126
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,740
Senior Luo and Father's old acquaintances.

127
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,820
Brother Yun.

128
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,120
Wenjun.

129
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,260
You're awake.

130
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,120
Good morning.

131
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,720
Master.

132
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:03,427
Tell Prince Qing that he can begin his operation soon.

133
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:06,672

134
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,900
Your Majesty, Prince Qing seeks an audience.

135
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,500
Summon him.

136
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

137
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,020
Summon Prince Qing.

138
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,767
Greetings, Father. Long live Father.

139
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,680
Spare the formalities.

140
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,800
Thank you, Father.

141
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,180
What do you need?

142
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,980
Tell me.

143
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,707
Father, although Prince Jingyu's mansion has suppressed the news from the public,

144
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:07,620
there are no undiscovered secrets.

145
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,180
In my opinion, Ye Dingzhi isn't capable enough to take Yi Wenjun out of Tianqi.

146
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,940
I'm sure someone aided him.

147
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,680
Tell me about it.

148
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,160
I dare not do so.

149
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,600
Just speak your mind.

150
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:31,000
If we think about it, of all the officials in the court, only Marquis Zhenxi is able to help Ye Dingzhi.

151
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,880
And Baili Dongjun once helped him when he tried to steal the bride.

152
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,860
He also escorted him out of Tianqi.

153
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,000
Father, if Baili Luochen's subordinates are able to enter the capital and abduct the princess consort,

154
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,320
they might be able to storm the palace and steal the throne in the future.

155
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,960
It's not about whether he can do it.

156
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,600
It's about whether he wants to do it.

157
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,180
Xie'er.

158
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,400
Yes, Father.

159
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,160
I'll leave that to you.

160
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,500
Yes, Father. I won't disappoint you.

161
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,480
It's late at night. What are we doing?

162
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,240
Censor Zhang?

163
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,940
You see, it's midnight. Why has His Majesty summoned me to the court?

164
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,360
I have no idea either. Let's hurry.

165
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,800
Well...

166
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,280
- Is my hat tilted? 
 - Yes.

167
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,600
Last night, the Seven Imperial Censors were summoned in the middle of the night.

168
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,100
It seems like something huge is going to happen.

169
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:31,580
Brother, do you think we're their target?

170
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm sure it's related to Prince Qing seeking an audience with Father.

171
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,420
Prince Qing's largest foes are us.

172
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:49,440
It's hard to say.

173
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,300
Logically speaking, it's most likely that Prince Qing is targeting us.

174
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,040
However, I have a feeling that something else is happening.

175
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,440
What is it?

176
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,973
By the Mandate of Heaven and the Emperor's decree,

177
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:15,460
Baili Luochen, the Marquis Zhenxi, is accused of treason.

178
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,300
Effective immediately, the Seven Imperial Censors

179
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,480
are ordered to jointly investigate this matter.

180
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,780
Thus ordered.

181
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,560
Your Highness!

182
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,180
Your Highness.

183
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,240
What is it? Why are you panicking?

184
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,780
Eunuch Li is here. He also brought an imperial edict with him.

185
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,940
So what? I'm Prince Jingyu. Imperial edicts are nothing special to me.

186
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:53,720
Your Highness, although the imperial edict was delivered to Prince Jingyu's Mansion, it wasn't for you.

187
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,700
Eunuch Li.

188
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,460
Greetings, Prince Jingyu.

189
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,840
Greetings, Prince Langya.

190
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,980
Eunuch Li, what do you mean by that?

191
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,920
What do you mean when you said it was delivered to my mansion, but it wasn't meant for me?

192
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,080
Seems like the imperial edict was for me.

193
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,566
Indeed, Prince Langya.

194
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:21,020
Both of you are always close to each other.

195
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,620
Just now, I went to Prince Langya's mansion, but I couldn't find you there, Your Highness.

196
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,680
I knew that you would be in Prince Jingyu's mansion.

197
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,820
Your Highness, since I've found you, you should now receive the edict.

198
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,160
Your Highness, this is a secret edict.

199
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,500
Although His Majesty sent me here to deliver the edict, I have no idea what the edict is about.

200
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,820
Your Highness, you should read it yourself.

201
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,600
Eunuch Li, this edict is quite troublesome.

202
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,480
Although I don't know what the edict is about,

203
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,140
I do know that His Majesty was frowning when he wrote it.

204
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,860
He was pondering for a long time.

205
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,940
Eunuch Li, your words are making me even more nervous.

206
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,040
If so, I shall take my leave. I won't trouble you any longer, Your Highness.

207
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,220
Brother, what did it say?

208
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:06,820
According to the edict, there are already 600 Jinwu Guards waiting outside Tianqi City.

209
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,200
Waiting outside of Tianqi City?

210
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,160
What is Father up to?

211
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,020
He ordered me to depart for Qiandong today.

212
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:23,480
I am to bring Baili Luochen, Marquis Zhenxi, back to Tianqi City.

213
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,960
Yao'er, whose letter was that?

214
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:30,500
My maidservant wrote to me that the emperor is summoning the Marquis to the palace.

215
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,420
He was branded with the crime of treason.

216
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,240
You mustn't go.

217
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,080
If I don't go, what should you do, then?

218
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,190
Father, I—

219
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,340
Dongjun, what are you doing here?

220
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,800
- Who is this lady? 
 - Grandfather, we can talk about that later.

221
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,540
- I heard that— 
 - Baili Dongjun, head back.

222
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,300
I won't.

223
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,700
I'll say this again. Head back.

224
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,540
Didn't you say I could come out once I defeated you?

225
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,440
Heir Apparent, today I'll show you the meaning of defeat.

226
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:36,880
Come, show me how much you've improved over the past year.

227
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,660
You transformed sound to sword energy.

228
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,400
That's right.

229
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,080
Miss, how should I address you?

230
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,380
My name is Yue Yao.

231
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,760
Yue Yao?

232
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,980
If so, who is Yue Fengcheng, the city lord of Beique City, to you?

233
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,293
He's my father.

234
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:24,713
I knew it.

235
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:28,920
To Beili, I'm a fugitive from Beique.

236
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,060
Marquis, will you capture me and hand me over to the emperor of Beili?

237
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,260
I'm too old for this. I don't care whether you're a fugitive or not.

238
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,620
As long as you're someone Dongjun likes and he brings you back,

239
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,000
you're part of this family.

240
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,600
Marquis.

241
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,700
Using zither as your weapon, huh?

242
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,900
It's an excellent technique indeed.

243
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,600
I've never seen such sword techniques before.

244
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,500
However, you lack training.

245
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,800
You should head back and train.

246
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,500
Is that so?

247
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,000
You brat.

248
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,300
Heir Apparent, what do you think?

249
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,300
You were taken by surprise by your Instant Kill Sword Arts.

250
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Grandfather, I'll show Yao'er around.

251
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,600
Let's go.

252
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,060
He has grown up.

253
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,760
Look at that brat.

254
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:37,000
In the past, whenever you poured me the liquor you brewed, you would always show off.

255
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,200
But today, you've grown mature.

256
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,000
You've grown up.

257
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,500
Grandfather, if you wish to listen to my prattle, I should gladly oblige.

258
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,300
Dongjun, since you were young, your father kept you in check.

259
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,900
Your mother kept you in check.

260
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:11,500
The only person who spoiled you was me, your fearsome grandfather.

261
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,900
Do you know why?

262
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,300
It's because you don't want me to be like you and Father.

263
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,300
You don't want me to lead a tough life.

264
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,860
Grandfather, you wanted me to be carefree.

265
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,200
You're too intelligent.

266
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,900
Once we grow old, we'll think about the many things that we missed out

267
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,500
when we were young.

268
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:44,180
But I want my children and grandchildren, especially you, to have what I missed out on.

269
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,400
But Grandfather, there are two different ways to be carefree.

270
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,700
They're different.

271
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,000
How are they different?

272
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,280
I love to be carefree indeed.

273
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,300
But not as a carefree noble heir of the Marquis.

274
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,000
I want to be a carefree martial artist.

275
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
- A martial artist? 
 - Yes.

276
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,700
I want to draw my sword for my friends, for love, and for injustice.

277
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,600
Although I'm carefree, I still have a sense of duty.

278
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,220
Although I don't obey the rules, I have my own principles.

279
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,460
Grandfather, now, the Baili Family is in trouble.

280
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,480
And I, your grandson, am ready to face the trial.

281
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
Come.

282
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,880
Sir, do you want to buy some?

283
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,200
Please take a look.

284
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,600
Have you heard? The Marquis Zhenxi has plotted a rebellion.

285
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,900
That's impossible.

286
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,500
Of all the times to do it, why would he do it when the state is this peaceful?

287
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,400
You're right.

288
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,700
Thank you, Miss Yi.

289
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,600
Elder Wang You.

290
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,080
Elder, do you need anything from us?

291
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,860
It's nothing major.

292
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,060
Miss Yi has been here for some time.

293
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:59,800
I happened to descend the mountain, so I came to check on both of you.

294
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,400
Thank you for your concern.

295
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,500
Since both of you are doing well, I shall take my leave, then.

296
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,300
Wait, Elder.

297
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,600
What's the matter, Brother Yun?

298
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
To be honest,

299
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,000
I heard people saying that the Marquis Zhenxi has plotted a rebellion.

300
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,500
His Majesty has sent an envoy to capture him in Qiandong.

301
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,700
Elder, is that true?

302
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,500
That's right.

303
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,000
The rumor I heard was incomplete. Elder, can you tell me the details?

304
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I don't know the details either.

305
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,600
I can only make assumptions.

306
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,800
The Marquis Zhenxi has long been stationed in the state's west.

307
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,200
He has a strong foundation there.

308
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,500
And it's very far from Tianqi City.

309
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,000
The emperor wishes to intervene, yet his reach is limited.

310
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,100
Over time, he became a thorn in the emperor's flesh.

311
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,700
And regarding Miss Yi's escape from Tianqi City,

312
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,400
although Prince Jingyu's Mansion has suppressed the news

313
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,000
and prevented them from reaching the people,

314
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,200
those who are keeping Prince Jingyu and Prince Langya under surveillance,

315
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:27,000
right under His Majesty's nose, will definitely find out if they want to.

316
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,600
This event gave those who harbored sinister intentions an opportunity to act.

317
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,200
They could twist the facts and influence the emperor

318
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,800
by saying that the Marquis Zhenxi played a role in her escape.

319
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
It must be Prince Qing.

320
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
It's all because of me.

321
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,000
Miss Yi, don't blame yourself too much.

322
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,300
Even if you hadn't escaped,

323
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,600
they would still find other excuses to topple Marquis Zhenxi.

324
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,000
Moreover, that was just my assumption.

325
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,900
It might not be accurate.

326
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,500
Elder Wang You is right.

327
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,220
Wenjun, don't blame yourself for this.

328
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,620
If so, I shall take my leave first.

329
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,820
- Thank you, Elder. 
 - Thank you, Elder.

330
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,380
I suppose you've made up your mind.

331
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,860
Yes.

332
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,200
Actually, I've made up my mind when I heard the news.

333
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
But everyone in Tianqi City is out to get you.

334
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,100
There are plenty of people in Tianqi City whom I wish to kill as well.

335
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,900
You mustn't be impulsive.

336
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,020
Don't worry.

337
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm only heading to Tianqi to help Marquis Zhenxi overcome this ordeal.

338
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,500
As for Prince Qing, as long as Marquis Zhenxi is fine,

339
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,600
he'll be utterly useless.

340
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,220
All right.

341
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,040
Wenjun, since I'll be heading to Tianqi,

342
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,660
do you need me to accomplish anything for you?

343
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,680
Wenjun?

344
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
Wenjun, what's wrong?

345
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,200
I'm fine.

346
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,600
Well, Brother Yun,

347
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:17,000
if you see Senior when you're back there, please send my regards to him.

348
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,600
All right.

349
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,700
 The imperial edict has arrived!

350
00:32:53,030 --> 00:33:01,530

351
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,200
Marquis, the imperial edict has arrived.

352
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,700
Such audacity! Why aren't you kneeling upon seeing the imperial edict?

353
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:25,760
You should head back to Tianqi and ask the one who drafted the edict why I'm not kneeling.

354
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,280
Why haven't you withdrawn yet?

355
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,980
The Marquis Zhenxi has rendered countless military merits. He received His Majesty's grace a decade ago.

356
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,680
He may bring his sword with him to the palace and not kneel in front of His Majesty.

357
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,980
What do you know at your age?

358
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,680
- Even so, his son still needs to kneel. 
 - Shut up!

359
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,380
So, it's you, Eunuch Cheng. It's been a long time since we met.

360
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,720
Years ago, I had the honor of making your acquaintance on several occasions.

361
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,760
I never expected you to still remember me. I'm honored.

362
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,520
Qiandong City is located in a remote region. It's very far from Tianqi.

363
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,740
As I recall, I haven't received an imperial edict in ages.

364
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:46,520
Eunuch Cheng, I'm sure the imperial edict is heavy to hold.

365
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,080
You may announce it.

366
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,860
Yes, Marquis.

367
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,920
By the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:

368
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,140
The Imperial Censorate has submitted a memorial accusing Baili Luochen, the Marquis Zhenxi,

369
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,600
of conspiring with traitors and attempting to rebel. This is a grave act of treason.

370
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:24,340
Considering his past contributions in quelling the rebellions, he is not to be detained at this time.

371
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,880
Effective immediately, he is to follow the envoy to the capital for trial.

372
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,320
Thus ordered.

373
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,440
Excellent. Interesting.

374
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,820
This is interesting indeed.

375
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,180
Captain, which army is this?

376
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,900
How dare they ride their horses in Qiandong City?

377
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,560
It's the divine bird flag. They're the Jinwu Guards.

378
00:36:17,823 --> 00:36:20,601

379
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,020
Marquis, you should receive the edict.

380
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,560
Father, should we receive it?

381
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,760
Eunuch Cheng, what did he mean by that?

382
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,120
If they don't, does that mean they're going to start a rebellion?

383
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,520
If so, can we still leave this place alive?

384
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,480
Chengfeng.

385
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,140
Receive the edict.

386
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,120
The Marquis Zhenxi thinks he's a big shot, huh?

387
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,280
We're envoys from Tianqi. How dare he make us wait this long?

388
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,600
Even if he ignores the fact that we're envoys of Tianqi,

389
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:15,000
Baili Luochen should come out and receive you, the Seventh Prince.

390
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,680
Silence.

391
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,920
He's a marquis. Why is he wearing a red robe?

392
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,240
Is he in a hurry to be married off?

393
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,220
The Marquis Zhenxi had plenty of nicknames back then,

394
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,860
his most notable ones being "God Killer", and "Bloody Robe Marquis".

395
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,620
When he's wearing his red robe, it means he doesn't wish to kill.

396
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:44,620
Of course, he doesn't mind dealing with small fries either.

397
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,820
Smart people wouldn't want to offend him when he's in this state.

398
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:52,760
We're envoys of Tianqi. Don't tell me he dares kill us?

399
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,360
I've heard that the Jinwu Guards were a bunch of useless fools.

400
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,380
Now that I'm seeing you all in person, the rumors are certainly true.

401
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,860
Marquis Zhenxi.

402
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,920
Prince Langya, let's talk inside.

403
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,740
Your Highness, I still remember that my son

404
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:33,440
had a pleasant chat with you
in Tianqi over a year ago.

405
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,820
I never expected things to end up like this.

406
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,040
The imperial court and its situation are ever-changing.

407
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,400
Your Highness, last time you took my son away from me here.

408
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,440
This time, you're going to take my father away.

409
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,320
Last time, I returned your son to you in one piece after bringing him home.

410
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:03,640
This time, I'll surely do my best as well, as long as the Marquis Zhenxi didn't do it.

411
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,900
If I had done it, Your Highness, you would have been dead by now.

412
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,180
Marquis Zhenxi, when do you plan to depart?

413
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,300
Tomorrow.

414
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,160
Thank you, Marquis Zhenxi.

415
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,200
Brother Yun.

416
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,040
This will be a perilous trip.

417
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,440
Don't worry. Just wait at home.

418
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,960
If you need anything, go find Elder Wang You.

419
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,960
Take good care of yourself. I'll return soon.

420
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,540
Take care.

421
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,920
Wait for my return.

422
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:07,280
I assume Prince Langya has received Marquis Zhenxi by now.

423
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,560
Excellent.

424
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:17,200
This time, I'll make sure that old Marquis Zhenxi

425
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:26,100
and that despicable Baili Dongjun stay here forever.

426
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,721

427
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:33,340

428
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:44,460

429
