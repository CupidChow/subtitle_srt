22
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:49,115

23
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:52,220

24
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,080
Take a look. Which one do you like?

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,420
This is nice, right?

26
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,340
Let's buy this one.

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,540
Brother Ye, wait for me!

28
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,340
Brother Ye, you are so kind.

29
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,020
Brother Ye, can you be my big brother?

30
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,060
I don't need Master anymore.

31
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,120
Brother Ye. Brother Ye.

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,980
Elder Wang You, you have been living in Mount Muyun and observing Tianqi City.

33
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,020
I have something to ask you.

34
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,460
Are you trying to ask the whereabouts of your companions?

35
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,940
Yes.

36
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,960
I wanted to ask Prince Langya, but I couldn't swallow my pride, so I didn't.

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,500
Afterward, I tried to ask around during the journey,

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,500
but then I realized no one knew about me stealing the bride, as if it had never happened.

39
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,340
As for your friends, Luo Qingyang was taken away by the Shadow Sect, and locked up.

40
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,060
Nevertheless, he's the sect leader's proudest disciple,

41
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,140
as well as a future imperial guard appointed by the Emperor.

42
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,580
Sect Master Yi will probably release him once everything quiets down.

43
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,380
It's just that maybe he might be given some agreements to comply with.

44
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,860
As for Baili Dongjun, his father, Baili Chengfeng,

45
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:17,020
brought him back to Qiandong City and grounded him, alongside Sikong Changfeng.

46
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,740
However, as of now, Sikong Changfeng has already left Qiandong City

47
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,300
and is roaming around for training.

48
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,340
I thought you would only know what happened to them in Tianqi City.

49
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,900
To my surprise, you're even well aware of their whereabouts afterward.

50
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,180
The birds on the trees told me.

51
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,440
That's true! Master speaks to birds.

52
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,100
No, not just birds, but also fowls, beasts, insects, fish, flowers, and grass.

53
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,860
My master can sit down and converse with them the whole afternoon.

54
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,580
- He's lying to you. 
 - Nonsense!

55
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,100
My master never lies.

56
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,300
Except when he says he'll buy me candied hawthorns, everything he says is true.

57
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,140
 If the big commotion we caused in Tianqi City could be completely suppressed,

58
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,700
 does that mean Wenjun didn't even know what happened?

59
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,900
 That I came and had already charged into Prince Jingyu's mansion?

60
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,780
I'm telling the truth.

61
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,820
- Master can speak to birds. 
 - Quiet!

62
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,540
Master, there he goes again.

63
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,600
Why is he always suddenly lashing out at me?

64
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,600
It's because what he'll do in the future might bring tremendous trouble,

65
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,420
and he doesn't want to get the people around him involved,

66
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,500
so he pushes everyone away.

67
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,220
I still don't get it.

68
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,820
What exactly does Brother Ye want to do?

69
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,180
A mere thought can foment evil.

70
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,320
There you go again.

71
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,260
How much longer will it take?

72
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,120
I'm exhausted.

73
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,740
We should arrive in three days.

74
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,740
But why are you exhausted?

75
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,500
You took naps after every few hours of walking.

76
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,860
I doubt you're tired.

77
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,660
Fine, let's say I'm not tired.

78
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,260
Thank you for carrying me, Master.

79
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,560
Not me.

80
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,020
It was Young Hero Ye.

81
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,860
Brother Ye?

82
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,180
Brother Ye! Brother Ye!

83
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,920
You're so kind to me.

84
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,020
Brother Ye, you're too good to me.

85
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,460
Get off of me.

86
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,540
Brother Ye is a big softy at heart!

87
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,500
Brother Ye is a big softy at heart!

88
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,600
Brother Ye is a big softy at heart!

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,980
Why is he smiling so happily?

90
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,660
It's because he isn't attached.

91
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,860
Young Lady.

92
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,380
Qixuan?

93
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,650
Qixuan, is that you?

94
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,360
Yes, it's me.

95
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,220
Qixuan, Qing'er said Baili Dongjun headed to Tianqi

96
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,700
to help Ye Dingzhi steal the bride but failed, and then disappeared.

97
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,240
Is that true?

98
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,400
Young Lady, you sure heard quickly.

99
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,860
That's right. A few youngsters tried to steal the princess consort at the imperial wedding.

100
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,840
They indeed played out of their league.

101
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,600
Is he...

102
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,560
Is he all right?

103
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,640
It seems you truly like him, Young Lady.

104
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Don't worry. From the news I received, he has already returned to Qiandong City

105
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,980
and has been placed under house arrest by his father, Baili Chengfeng.

106
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,320
Qixuan,

107
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,380
thank you.

108
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,320
Qixuan, give me a moment.

109
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,975

110
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,460
Young Lady.

111
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,540
Is that all right?

112
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:23,720
To me, every word you say is an order I cannot defy,

113
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,540
so you don't have to ask.

114
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,240
Qixuan,

115
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,580
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,700
You thought you were careful enough to conceal your trace.

117
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,660
However, considering our years of friendship, do you think you can deceive me?

118
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,960
Do you want to stop me?

119
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,620
Envoy Wuxiang ordered the Young Lady to be locked up for three years to reflect on herself.

120
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,780
If you go back now, I'll pretend nothing has happened.

121
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,020
Envoy Wuxiang?

122
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,380
Qixuan.

123
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:23,000
Zi Yuji, to whom do you pledge your loyalty, the Yue family or Envoy Wuxiang?

124
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,680
Young Lady, please return and reflect on yourself.

125
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,420
Young Lady, go.

126
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,660
Qixuan, but you...

127
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,160
Now!

128
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,060
I never thought that one day you would draw your sword against me.

129
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,130
I... also never thought that one day,

130
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:22,500
I would point a sword at your face.

131
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,860
Put your sword down right now.

132
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,300
Come with me to bring the Young Lady back.

133
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,060
I can pretend nothing happened.

134
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,720
Yuji.

135
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,460
We grew up together.

136
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,340
You know me.

137
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,200
I can't do this.

138
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,400
Yuji,

139
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,460
let Young Lady go, and take me to Envoy Wuxiang.

140
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,320
I'll bear all the responsibility.

141
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,580
Get lost.

142
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,960
Qixuan,

143
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,220
you're right.

144
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,120
We grew up together.

145
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,540
Of course, I know you won't betray Young Lady.

146
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,380
But do you think I could betray you?

147
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,900
I also serve the Young Lady and you are my best friend.

148
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,500
Young Lady, we should be on our way.

149
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,500
If you keep waiting, the sacrifice of the White-Haired Deity would be in vain.

150
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,240
Young Lady.

151
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,320
Young Lady.

152
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,120
It's the White-Haired Deity.

153
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,880
Young Lady.

154
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,920
Qixuan.

155
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,140
Young Lady, you should leave now.

156
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,560
Are you not leaving with us?

157
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,200
No.

158
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,840
But... you helped me.

159
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,760
You can't stay in Tian Wai Tian anymore.

160
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,780
The Martial World is vast enough to accommodate me.

161
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,700
Young Lady, no need to worry about me.

162
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,180
You should leave now.

163
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,920
- Qixuan... 
 - Please go.

00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,460
I let the Young Lady go, so I'm here to face my punishment.

180
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,780
Do you know what punishment you will face?

181
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,440
I do.

182
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:20,400
News from Nanjue says something has happened at our base there.

183
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,860
You will go and handle it.

184
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,860
On your command.

185
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,500
Envoy Wuxiang, didn’t we already plan to abandon the base in Nanjue?

186
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,260
Our enemies have ambushed it.

187
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,320
Sending our men over equals digging their graves.

188
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,520
Since he can't be of use anymore,

189
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,168
he might as well die as a discarded pawn.

190
00:16:15,168 --> 00:16:18,925

191
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,000
Greetings, Elder Wang You.

192
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,500
Elder Wang You, this way, please.

193
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,820
Young Hero Ye.

194
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,560
Elder Wang You, I can lodge at an inn in the city.

195
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,100
Young Hero Ye, are you going to live in an inn for the next two years?

196
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,260
Who owns that crop field?

197
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,600
It belongs to our sect.

198
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,160
May I?

199
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,840
By all means, Young Hero Ye.

200
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,200
Then I'll build a hut by the crop field.

201
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,980
Why bother?

202
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,000
I owe others too much, yet I haven’t reclaimed anything.

203
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,160
I don't want to feel indebted anymore.

204
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:33,863

205
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,840
Brother Ye!

206
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,320
Brother Ye! I brought you candied hawthorns from Gusu City!

207
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,840
I pleaded with Master so hard to buy them.

208
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,540
Master was so unwilling when he coughed up the copper coin.

209
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,100
- Here! 
 - I don't like them. You can have it.

210
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,240
Do you really not want it?

211
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,420
Then... I'll eat it.

212
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,340
Go on.

213
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,780
Oh, right. I almost forgot something important.

214
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,660
Master says he can't always stay by your side.

215
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,140
He has a family sword technique.

216
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,900
Long-term practice may help purify your mind.

217
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,640
Master's assigned me to teach you it.

218
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,740
Did you see all that?

219
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,660
Without missing a move.

220
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,060
That's amazing. Are you very skilled in wielding a sword?

221
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,960
Curious?

222
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,560
I'm going to throw these leaves into the air. Can you hit all of them?

223
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,800
Try me.

224
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,900
Here they come!

225
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,100
Candied hawthorns.

226
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,300
You call this candied hawthorns?

227
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,504

228
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,980
Her Highness is spacing out again.

229
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,500
Yeah.

230
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,460
She’s the most favored of all the consorts in this mansion.

231
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,620
Yet, she pulls a long face every day. Not one bit of energy.

232
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,300
Imperial Physician, please wait here.

233
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,940
Thank you for your trouble.

234
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,920
Your Highness, the imperial physician is here.

235
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,280
Let him in.

236
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,100
Prepare a hand rest and a handkerchief.

237
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,660
Yes.

238
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,240
I'll take your pulse, Your Highness.

239
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,500
What else can you diagnose?

240
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,500
It can only be a cold.

241
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,760
Your Highness, have you often vomited and lost your appetite recently?

242
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,380
Yes.

243
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,260
Is there any problem with that?

244
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,920
Your Highness, your pulse feels like a slippery bead.

245
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,080
Strong and dynamic. Quick and agile.

246
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,320
It's a pregnancy pulse.

247
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,480
- Congratulations, Your Highness. 
 - Congratulations, Your Highness.

248
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,020
Congratulations, Your Highness.

249
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,860
Pregnancy...

250
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,140
Pregnancy pulse?

251
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,540
Your Highness, please be very careful with your body these days.

252
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,680
Your Highness, please don't.

253
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,160
Tell me.

254
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:07,060
Why is Heaven... doing this to me?

255
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,580
Your Highness, a pregnancy is good news.

256
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,060
Young Hero Ye, your inner evil is persistent.

257
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,440
Why don't you give up on practicing Demon Deity Sword Techniques?

258
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,700
Elder Wang You, does the Demon Deity Sword Techniques

259
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,880
trigger my inner evil?

260
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,720
 Disciple, I didn't allow you to watch it

261
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,500
 because this is a sword move one wields at the last moment.

262
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,880
 This devastating move is used

263
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:14,080
 during the final moment to destroy everything.

264
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,680
 Master...

265
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,480
 Master!

266
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,120
If I can't leave with her,

267
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,380
can't I trade this lethal move...

268
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,580
for her freedom?

269
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,300
Young Hero Ye.

270
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,860
Elder Wang You, thank you again.

271
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,340
Don't worry.

272
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,260
I won't launch this lethal sword move.

273
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:28,130
Because one will only be enlightened

274
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,060
at the moment they need it.

275
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,420
Since there is a path of living, why walk the desperate one?

276
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,440
What is the path of living?

277
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,020
Let go.

278
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,740
No.

279
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,200
Elder Wang You, get rest early.

280
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,440
Who's there?

281
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,140
It has been a while, Ye Dingzhi.

282
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,100
You're stalking me again.

283
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,620
What are you doing here?

284
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,860
Of course, I'm here to mock you for overplaying your hand.

285
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:53,220
That being said, I'm also here to congratulate you on returning from Tianqi alive.

286
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,500
I just didn't think that after this failure,

287
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,480
you would come and crouch in this place.

288
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,140
How useless.

289
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,860
Why are you still holding up so stubbornly?

290
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,300
I can't believe that old geezer advised you to let go.

291
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:22,140
In the end, even if he’s not Prince Jingyu’s man, he’s loyal to the Tianqi royals.

292
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,600
Not only would I not advise you to let go, but I would also help you reclaim what you want.

293
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,100
I'll reclaim what I want by myself.

294
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,300
You should leave.

295
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,740
After all, we are not the same kind.

296
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,020
Who is your kind, then?

297
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:49,280
In the far west, there was once a person who was my kind.

298
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,720
Unfortunately,

299
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,560
I landed him into trouble.

300
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,740
I wonder how Brother Yun is doing now.

301
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,860
Hopefully, Senior can keep him safe.

302
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,180
A guqin score?

303
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,440
Did Master leave this?

304
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,160
Young lady, after waiting here for days, he's finally playing the guqin.

305
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,400
Yes, it's just that he's terrible.

306
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,840
It seems he has discovered the score you secretly left.

307
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,420
Greetings, Young Master.

308
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,300
So you did come.

309
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:19,260
"Master has already died, and you're free now. You don't have to call me Young Master.

310
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,980
Master saved our lives before.

311
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,000
We swore we would serve both Master and you for life.

312
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,340
However, you never summoned us, so we didn't dare to show up.

313
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,480
That's why we could only follow you secretly.

314
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,536
We may not be skilled in martial arts, but as long as you need us,

315
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:34,580
we'll risk our lives without hesitation!

316
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,600
We will risk our lives without hesitation!

317
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,280
Fine. Get up.

318
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,460
I summoned you for a favor.

319
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,500
Please command us, Young Master.

320
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,390
I'm worried about someone.

321
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:10,300
Can you sneak into Tianqi and ask around if she is doing well?

322
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:19,550

323
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:23,190

324
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:50,240

325
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,540

326
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,830

327
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,650

328
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,340

329
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:27,290

330
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,580
You fool...

331
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,940
why are you here?

332
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,160
After this ambush,

333
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,880
we repaid the kindness of Tian Wai Tian

334
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,440
for raising us.

335
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:06,280

336
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,700
Steward! Steward! Prince Langya has arrived!

337
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,500
Your Highness, Prince Jingyu has left for Yindu.

338
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,100
He's not at home. We didn't expect this to happen.

339
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,820
Your Highness, only you can help me now.

340
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,440
Tell me on the way. What's the situation now?

341
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,880
The Princess Consort is so skilled that we can't enter the room.

342
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,840
So, we don't know what's happening inside

343
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,340
I told my brother about this before.

344
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,880
Sister-in-law, be careful.

345
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,000
Who's your sister-in-law?

346
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,240
Why didn't you dodge it?

347
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,420
Mister Li's best disciple

348
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,120
is unable to dodge my palm attack?

349
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,610
If I take this attack...

350
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,260
will you be happier?

351
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,520
Besides, now...

352
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,520
Did you come here to ask for a beating?

353
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,040
I was told you were pregnant, so I came to pay a visit.

354
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,690
I'm not the only pregnant woman,

355
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,640
yet you specifically came to visit me, Prince Langya.

356
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,991
You're worried that I would go out of my mind

357
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:57,740
and kill the child in my stomach out of anger, aren't you?

358
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,040
Sister-in-law, marriage and having a child

359
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,360
are two different matters.

360
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,270
Knowing that you haven't gotten over it,

361
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,160
I must pay more attention to you.

362
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,540
You may leave.

363
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,950
I'm not as stubborn

364
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:22,840
or as weak as you think.

365
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,210
Then this child,

366
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,040
will you give birth to them?

367
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,880
At least, I won't kill it myself.

368
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,940
However,

369
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,070
if it has to leave by fate,

370
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,220
I hope no one will stop it.

371
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,040
Get lost. Now!

372
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,000
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

373
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,880
What a nice brother he has.

374
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,800
I'm sorry.

375
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,740
Come in.

376
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,400
Second Young Lady.

377
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,380
Urgent news?

378
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,820
Envoy Wuxiang sent this over.

379
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,560

380
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,220
Yi Wenjun is pregnant?

381
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,160
Look how loyal she is!

382
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,400
You care about her so much, yet she's bearing a child for her beloved husband.

383
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,040
What a steamy night they must've enjoyed!

384
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,260
This is hilarious.

385
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,000
Hilarious, indeed.

386
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,480
This score left by Master is something else.

387
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,640
It hides martial techniques within the notes.

388
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,680
As expected of him.

389
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,400
Clouds tumble in a westward gale.

390
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,040
Power across the seas, returning home in triumph.

391
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,000
Just reading this score for a few days has enlightened me so much.

392
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,780
Why am I so intelligent?

393
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,000
You really are shameless.

394
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,600
As long as I can make you smile, why not?

395
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,280
What brings you here?

396
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,840
- I came— 
 - Did you miss me?

397
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,800
I came here to teach you martial arts skills.

398
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,600
So you left the score here?

399
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,800
That's right. However...

400
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,340
I'm having some regrets now.

401
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,940
Why?

402
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,760
On my first day in Luochuan Inn, it was full of guests.

403
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,540
Only one room was left.

404
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:48,240
But today when I left the inn, it was empty.

405
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,880
Do you know why?

406
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,240
Someone died in the inn?

407
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,260
No. It's because your playing is awful.

408
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,500
Everyone couldn't bear it and fled.

409
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,400
The innkeeper wanted to complain to the officials.

410
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,080
By the time he and his men arrived, it was heavily guarded.

411
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,420
The guards all looked as if they were suffering something unbearable.

412
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,120
So, the innkeeper gave up.

413
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,720
Does it really sound that bad?

414
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,920
This is one of the four best guqin in the world, the Nine Heavens Guqin.

415
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
Wind gusts and thunder strikes in the Nine Heavens,

416
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,840
where a dragon lies in a millennial vernal slumber.

417
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,740
The Scholarly Deity of Xichu roamed the Martial World in a white robe with a guqin and sword,

418
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,720
countless pretty ladies were enamored by him.

419
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,200
I didn't get to see it, but I would've loved to.

420
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,880
Was Master really that charming back then?

421
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,440
Out of 64 unparalleled courtesans from 32 music parlors in Tianqi City,

422
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,480
40 of them were madly in love with him.

423
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,080
What do you think?

424
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,800
So you girls like this type of man?

425
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,940
A guqin with a sword concealed inside.

426
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,600
The sword unsheathes as the guqin sounds.

427
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,970
What lady...

428
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,500
wouldn't be fascinated by such a gentleman.

429
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,740
All right. For what you said, I'm going to learn to play the guqin.

430
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,900
What did I say?

431
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,460
To make all ladies fall for you?

432
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,960
That's not necessary. You alone are enough.

433
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,560
But...

434
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,400
But what?

435
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:52,160
A young man playing less skillfully with his eyes closed can be charming, too.

436
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,140
Gentler.

437
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,380
Stupid sword skills.

438
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,160
Stupid man.

439
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,920
Today, I heard an interesting story that happened in the imperial city of Beili.

440
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,720
I wonder if you're interested, Young Master Ye.

441
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,560
I'm not interested.

442
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,840
You haven't even heard it and said you're not interested!

443
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,020
What a heartless man.

444
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,520
Have you already forgotten your past beloved in just a few days?

445
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,400
I thought you would be very interested in this.

446
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,620
What are you getting at?

447
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:18,600
Instead of describing it as interesting, I would say it's good news.

448
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,640
Beili is truly blessed.

449
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,960
The Emperor begets a prince, while the prince begets an imperial grandson.

450
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,840
Generations upon generations, the monarchy flourishes.

451
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,300
What do you mean?

452
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:37,120
That means the daughter of the Shadow Sect's leader whom you hold so dearly

453
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:41,960
and the new second consort of Prince Jingyu, Yi Wenjun,

454
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,780
is pregnant.

455
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,880
Are you insane?

456
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,580
I know. You went insane because you were so loyal to her,

457
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,280
while she couldn't endure the lonely nights and enjoyed a great time with her real husband to bear his child!

458
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,060
- Shut up! 
 - I won't!

459
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,820
She seduced another man when she was already married.

460
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,080
And you know she's married, but you're still hung up on her.

461
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,860
A couple of cheats and harlots!

462
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,420
Drop.

463
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,321

464
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,040

465
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:49,070

466
00:43:51,960 --> 00:44:00,853

489
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,280
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

490
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,380
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

491
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,860
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

492
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:45,220
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

493
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:49,640
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

494
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,020
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

495
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:58,620
♫  I met you  ♫
