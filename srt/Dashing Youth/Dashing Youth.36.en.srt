00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,620
what was the internal strength technique
you practiced?

187
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,780
The Autumn Water Technique.

188
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,980
When autumn floods swell,

189
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,380
rivers pour into the Yellow River,

190
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,020
and its waters become so vast that

191
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,660
making it impossible

192
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,620
to distinguish cattle from horses
on the banks.

193
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,100
That's an impressive

194
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,140
internal strength technique indeed.

195
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,740
But it's not enough.

196
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,380
Elder, please enlighten me.

197
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,620
The Scholarly Deity invented
the Autumn Water Technique

198
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,100
after being inspired

199
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,460
by the water in autumn he witnessed.

200
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,500
But that was
his enlightenment after all.

201
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,780
No matter how good you are at it,

202
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,140
you'll never be as good as
the Scholarly Deity.

203
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,500
Moreover,

204
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,540
"When autumn floods swell,
rivers pour into the Yellow River."

205
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,380
is not good enough.

206
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,860
Come with me.

207
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Where's your master?

208
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,140
He went on a journey.

209
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,140
I don't know when he'll return.

210
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,660
I'm afraid
it'll be difficult for him to return.

211
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,980
Elder, what do you mean?

212
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,020
Your master went to the north.

213
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,620
He went to the far northern land.

214
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,500
Why did Master go there?

215
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,020
Why do you think I'm here, then?

216
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,460
Elder,

217
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,140
I've lost all of my powers.

218
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,500
You should stop talking

219
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,620
in riddles.

220
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,100
You only lost your powers,

221
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,620
not your brain.

222
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,660
There is always
something greater beyond.

223
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,380
The way of the martial arts

224
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,740
is limitless.

225
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,260
Therefore, what you can achieve
is also limitless.

226
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,300
The stronger you are,
the heavier your responsibilities are.

227
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,580
The icy plains in the north,

228
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,180
the desert in the west,

229
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,860
the boundless sea to the east,

230
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,540
and the endless mountains to the south,

231
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,660
these four directions are
guarded by four saints.

232
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,740
One day,

233
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,820
you'll guard one of them too.

234
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,820
Me?

235
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,780
But that's all in the future.

236
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,980
Once you go beyond the stone monument,

237
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,820
you can see

238
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,620
a spectacular view.

239
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,060
[Boundless Sky]

240
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,700
Boundless Sky?

241
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,900
My predecessor wrote

242
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,660
Bound Sky alone.

243
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,020
But in my opinion,

244
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,820
it's only bound

245
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,140
because there's an end to our vision.

246
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,420
The sky is boundless.

247
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,740
Therefore, I changed it

248
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,140
to Boundless Sky.

249
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,820
Over there,

250
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,300
it's a different world.

251
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,980
Go.

252
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,500
This place is...

253
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,740
According to
A Record of Mountains and Seas,

254
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,980
at the end of the sky

255
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,380
lies a bottomless cliff.

256
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,340
The swirling clouds and mist
gather there,

257
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,140
yet they flow like seawater.

258
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,460
The rapid flow causes sparks,

259
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,820
dyeing the sky with a crimson shade.

260
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,740
Another ancient manual,

261
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,100
Heavenly Wind Chronicles,

262
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,620
states that at the end of the sky,

263
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,500
whenever a prosperous era is dawning,

264
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,220
deities will come

265
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,500
and Buddhas will do their prayers.

266
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,860
It's a place where deities live.

267
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,540
I assume the authors

268
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,780
must've visited this place before.

269
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,500
It's because what they said

270
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,980
was true.

271
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,380
What's behind the clouds and mist?

272
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,860
I don't know either.

273
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,500
Maybe you'll find deities
and Buddhas there.

274
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,260
Maybe you'll find out
that it's only a fantasy.

275
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,900
Or, maybe

276
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,500
you'll reach the end of the sky.

277
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
It's not what

278
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,100
we can seek out.

279
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,140
Now, do you understand why I said

280
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,100
the Autumn Water Technique

281
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,020
wasn't good enough?

282
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,140
"Sea of clouds

283
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,220
cascading from above."

284
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,620
That sentence alone

285
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,100
reminds me of the magnificent view
where thousands of horses

286
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,020
tread upon the plains.

287
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,020
Even if this were an endless sea,

288
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,020
boundless and stretching far and wide,

289
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,780
with the fastest ship

290
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,980
traversing a thousand li each day

291
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,140
for years,

292
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,500
it would still be impossible
to explore the entire realm of clouds.

293
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,900
The world is full of vibrant
and wondrous experiences,

294
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,020
with countless sights

295
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,340
and things yet unseen.

296
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,620
That's why you said

297
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,540
"Rivers pour into the Yellow River"

298
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,660
wasn't enough.

299
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,380
Indeed.

300
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,100
When the autumn waters come,
the River Deity may be proud.

301
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,140
Yet before the vast sea,

302
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,380
he can only lament
his own insignificance.

303
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,020
Not to mention the sea of clouds
we're looking at right now.

304
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,500
But in the presence
of such a magnificent view,

305
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,340
nothing matters that much.

306
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,140
With your internal strength gone,
just train anew.

307
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,740
It's nothing major.

308
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,500
You can always turn back

309
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,260
as long as you're not
at the end of the road.

310
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,380
You can always turn back

311
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,780
as long as you're not
at the end of the road.

312
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,860
The Scholarly Deity invented
the Autumn Water Technique,

313
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,020
a profound internal strength technique,
after witnessing the autumn rain

314
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,340
flowing into the Yellow River.

315
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,540
Now, you've witnessed
a magnificent sight as well.

316
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,980
Don't you think it's time for you

317
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,540
to invent another technique
that's more profound than his?

318
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,860
Are you saying that one can invent
an internal strength technique

319
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,020
by admiring this view alone?

320
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,820
It's more than just
a view you're admiring here.

321
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,740
There's also the Way of Heaven.

322
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,740
For the days to come,

323
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,220
you can ponder upon
your internal strength

324
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,220
behind the stone monument.

325
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,100
Elder,

326
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,020
are you serious?

327
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,420
Of course.

328
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,220
All things have their principles.

329
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,100
Now, you can train in the presence
of the Way of Heaven.

330
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,180
Not everyone

331
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,420
gets an opportunity like this.

332
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,220
You should cherish it.

333
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,260
Elder Mo Yi.

334
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,100
What were you doing?

335
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,100
I was observing the sea.

336
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,300
The tide rises and falls,

337
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,020
just like life.

338
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,980
When my father was young,

339
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,940
he was gentle and polite.

340
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,740
My sister grew up together with me.

341
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,020
She was once naive and carefree.

342
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,180
Maybe it's because
our lifespan is too long.

343
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
As we continue on our path,

344
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,300
we get distracted and confused.

345
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,100
When we live as humans,

346
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,340
we might be searching

347
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,660
for what we desire all the time.

348
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,740
Even if you don't know what you desire,

349
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,500
that's fine.

350
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,260
However, you must know

351
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,500
what you do not desire.

352
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,540
Once you cast away
the things you do not desire,

353
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,660
everything will become

354
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
clearer.

355
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,700
Elder, why did you

356
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,900
suddenly turn into

357
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,420
a scholar of philosophy?

358
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,100
I'm not used to it.

359
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,460
I'm getting older.

360
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,460
I can't stop myself
from sharing my experience with them

361
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,220
when I see youngsters I like.

362
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,700
Just let it go.

363
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,580
Yun?

364
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,660
Yun?

365
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,860
Yun!

366
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,220
Let it go.

367
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,420
Yun!

368
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,100
Yun!

369
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,460
Yun!

370
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,180
Ye Dingzhi?

371
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,700
Ye Dingzhi!

372
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,500
Ye Dingzhi.

373
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,420
You're finally here.

374
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,420
You told me to come, didn't you?

375
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,020
Speak. What's the matter?

376
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,460
Release me.

377
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,100
Can you please release me?

378
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,660
Ye Dingzhi!

379
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,580
If not, you should kill me!

380
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,300
Do you think I intend to spare you?

381
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,740
Everyone who participated in the plan

382
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,060
has been killed by me.

383
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,460
To protect you, Zhong Feili said
that you had nothing to do with the plan

384
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,420
before his death.

385
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,580
He took me for a fool.

386
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,140
If so, why are you...

387
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,460
It's because

388
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,660
I need a puppet.

389
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,100
More importantly,

390
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,220
I realize

391
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,900
that you're suffering from this.

392
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,860
You had fun

393
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,220
when you played hard-to-get, right?

394
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,060
If so, you should enjoy this process.

395
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,260
Enjoy the fun.

396
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,780
Ye Dingzhi!

397
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,980
Ye Dingzhi, come back!

398
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,940
Come back! Release me!

399
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,820
Come back!

400
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,300
Ye Dingzhi!

401
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,980
Ye Dingzhi!

402
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,180
Come back!

403
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,140
I am the ex-Left Guardian
of Sky's Beyond,

404
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,780
Zi Yuji, Marquis Purple Robe.

405
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,300
I am the ex-Right Guardian
of Sky's Beyond,

406
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,580
Mo Qixuan, the White-Haired Deity.

407
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,220
We implore to be allowed
to return to the sect.

408
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,380
Don't you guys fear me?

409
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,820
I was supposed to be dead.

410
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,940
You were the one who saved my life.

411
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,540
I have nothing to fear

412
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,940
even if you wish to take my life!

413
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,260
I've never saved you before.

414
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,420
After Qixuan and I betrayed
our former sect,

415
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,860
we escaped to that bamboo forest

416
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,300
and found that shack.

417
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,220
We found this

418
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,740
in the shack.

419
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,460
Back then, I was seriously wounded.

420
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,020
I only managed to survive

421
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,300
thanks to your medicine.

422
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,140
And,

423
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,100
I also received the help

424
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,300
of Miss Yan Lingxia.

425
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,620
Although you had no idea,

426
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,940
Qixuan and I

427
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,020
were still indebted to you.

428
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,860
And?

429
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,500
And,

430
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,140
you're strong enough.

431
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,460
Only those who are strong

432
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,820
can lead us out of these icy plains.

433
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,740
We only believe

434
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,420
in the power of one's sword.

435
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,340
You two wanted
to return to the sect, right?

436
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,380
Why are you two still here?

437
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,620
Thank you, sect leader.

438
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,580
It's all just a game.

439
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,980
If one isn't strong enough,

440
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,020
they'll end up as pawns.

441
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,140
That's why my father was
accused of treason

442
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,580
and his entire clan was executed.

443
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,860
That's why my wife

444
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,980
was taken away on numerous occasions.

445
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,300
I could never live in peace!

446
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,340
From now on,

447
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,380
I no longer want to be a pawn.

448
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,660
I will be the chess player
who controls the pawns.

449
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,820
A game.

450
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,420
A pawn.

451
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,980
I'm sure you're not doing this
of your own accord.

452
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,260
Even if I'm stuck in the game,

453
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,620
I'll finish it my own way!

454
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,260
No.

455
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,260
I won't let you go.

456
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,100
Why are you doing this?

457
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,820
If you don't let go,

458
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,900
your inner demon
will keep pestering you.

459
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,620
You'll never get to move on

460
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,380
or be released from this torment

461
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,260
as long as it pesters you.

462
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,620
I've told you I won't let go.

463
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,700
It's already been so long.

464
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,860
You keep thinking about that day.

465
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,420
But that day has already happened.

466
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,540
Everything is already set in stone!

467
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,020
What's the point in holding on?

468
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,860
Who said everything
has been set in stone?

469
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,100
It's not over

470
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,500
as long as I think the path
I'm treading upon

471
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,900
isn't over yet!

472
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,780
But my path has already ended.

473
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,660
I chose this path

474
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,820
of my own accord.

475
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,580
You should stop dwelling on it.

476
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,100
It's pointless.

477
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,260
Just give up.

478
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,300
No.

479
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,820
Why would you tell me to give up

480
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,140
if giving up doesn't make a difference?

481
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,500
Yun, come back.

482
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,380
Farewell.

483
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,940
Yun!

484
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,500
Come back!

485
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,700
You're not allowed to leave!

486
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,380
Not bad at all.

487
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,540
[One year later]

488
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,420
Elder Mo Yi?

489
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,700
How did it go?

490
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,460
For one year,

491
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,580
my dantian was empty.

492
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,740
But today,

493
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,940
internal strength
is gushing out of my body.

494
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,140
My body is filled
with internal strength.

495
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,780
You've done visualization training
for one year.

496
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,180
It's not strange for you
to achieve this feat.

497
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,660
Have you straightened out your thoughts?

498
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,420
I'm going to head back

499
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,500
and bring him here.

500
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,060
What if he doesn't agree
to leave with you?

501
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,100
If so, I'll reason with him.

502
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,420
I'll persuade him

503
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,900
and bring him back.

504
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,060
Good. At least you have an aspiration.

505
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,940
Elder Mo Yi,

506
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,460
why did it sound like

507
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,580
you were mocking me?

508
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,100
However,

509
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,660
there's no rush.

510
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,460
Compared to finding him,

511
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,980
I think I prefer

512
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,340
to take a bath first.

513
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,060
This is exhilarating!

514
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,940
Elder Mo Yi, you said
the autumn rain isn't satisfying.

515
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,460
Now, even the sea of cloud
isn't satisfying for me.

516
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,340
What's satisfying for you, then?

517
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,740
The sky!

518
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,260
Only the vast sky will satisfy me.

519
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,860
My internal strength technique,

520
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,580
is called

521
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,740
Hanging Sky.

522
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,060
Come.

523
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,540
Who said you could

524
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,500
grow a mustache?

525
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,140
Yao,

526
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,420
when I went beyond the stone monument,

527
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,260
I lost the concept of time.

528
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,780
It's already been over a year,

529
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,820
yet it feels like
it's only been a few days.

530
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,340
Only my mustache

531
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,100
can tell the truth.

532
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,100
But I did gain something out of it.

533
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,060
I invented my
internal strength technique.

534
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,220
It's called Hanging Sky.

535
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,020
Isn't it great?

536
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,980
Yeah, yeah.

537
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,140
It would be better

538
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,740
if you shave

539
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,500
your mustache.

540
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,340
Don't move.

541
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,020
If not, I might cut your face
by accident.

That brat Baili Dongjun,

568
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,180
actually

569
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,420
entered the Roaming Mystical Phase
for a second just now.

570
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,500
That was interesting.

571
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,980
It's a shame
that it only lasted for an instant.

572
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,500
Elder Mo Yi,

573
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,740
it's time for us to leave.

574
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,060
Once I bring Ye Dingzhi

575
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,220
back from Sky's Beyond,

576
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,460
I'll invite you to Xueyue City

577
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,340
to try the liquor I brew.

578
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,860
See you then.

579
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,260
I hope we won't see each other again.

580
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,740
People say that deities
transcend emotions and feelings.

581
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,540
Elder, you're heartless indeed.

582
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,620
If you do see me again,

583
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,700
you'll regret

584
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,980
what you said today.

585
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,860
Initially,

586
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,660
I was worried as Ye Dingzhi

587
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,100
had absorbed all
of your internal strength.

588
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,060
I never expected you

589
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,900
to recover your powers this soon.

590
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,460
And, you became stronger.

591
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,540
But the thing I'm happiest about

592
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,100
is that you look as vigorous as always.

593
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,940
Senior, what about you?

594
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,580
How have you been
for the past two years?

595
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,620
It's been great

596
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,940
and not that great.

597
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,180
What do you mean?

598
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,700
It's a long story.

599
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,900
Let's talk inside.

600
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,180
Is that guy outside Baili Dongjun?

601
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,300
If so, I'll take

602
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,620
a good look at him later.

603
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,220
Luoxia.

604
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,740
I went to Riverside Manor

605
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,020
with your token.

606
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,500
I've become your master's disciple too.

607
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,980
From now on,

608
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,500
you cannot call me Luoxia.

609
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,180
You have to call me Junior
according to seniority.

610
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,740
Luoxia,

611
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,140
you should stop teasing me.

612
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,540
It's fun to tease you.

613
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,460
Mr. Baili, I've long heard of your name.

614
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,140
I never expected

615
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,420
my name to be that famous
in the martial world

616
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,820
even though
I've been away for two years.

617
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,980
I'm ashamed.

618
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,220
It's not about your name, you know?

619
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,420
It's about...

620
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,340
Luoxia!

621
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,620
Master.

622
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,660
Have a seat.

623
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,780
Senior, what did you mean by that?

624
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,580
Did you encounter any trouble?

625
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:36,980
It's the guy

626
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,100
that you wish to avoid the most.

627
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,060
Was it Ye Dingzhi?

628
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,780
That's right.

629
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,540
Half a year ago,

630
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,780
a sudden force emerged

631
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,100
from the northwest of Beili.

632
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,500
They unified all the sects

633
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,620
on the icy plains.

634
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,940
They were unpredictable and ruthless.

635
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,060
People call them the demonic sect.

636
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,940
They kept harassing

637
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,020
the borders of Beili.

638
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,900
Therefore,

639
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,940
Beili sent out
some expert martial artists

640
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,220
to fend them off.

641
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,980
None of them were their match.

642
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,020
As we have no idea
about their background,

643
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,660
we dare not act recklessly.

644
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,700
Until last month,

645
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,940
three veterans

646
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,500
of the martial arts world

647
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,020
infiltrated the demonic sect.

648
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,740
They intended to take down

649
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,060
the sect leader of the demonic sect

650
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,780
to leave them leaderless.

651
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:22,860
They were prepared

652
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,460
to sacrifice their lives
to achieve their goal.

653
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,140
But no one expected them to...

654
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,660
None of them died.

655
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,260
All of them came back alive.

656
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,740
Before the martial arts world

657
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,100
of Beili could celebrate the occasion,

658
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,380
they realized

659
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,060
that these three veterans

660
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,780
had lost all of their powers

661
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,980
even though they were still alive.

662
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,180
They said the person
who did this to them

663
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,980
was the demonic sect's leader.

664
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,660
His name

665
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,900
was Ye Dingzhi.

666
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,140
Dongjun, what's on your mind?

667
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,060
I'm thinking about Yun.

668
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,860
I'll bring him back.
