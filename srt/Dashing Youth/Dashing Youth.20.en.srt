00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,020
without a place to call home.

189
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,380
Usually,

190
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,300
a rich kid like him

191
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,620
would be someone that you'd detest,

192
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,900
but why are you friends with him?

193
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,420
When I met him,

194
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,500
I didn't even know

195
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500

196

Back then, all I thought was

197
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,660
that we happened to meet by chance,

198
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,820

around the martial arts world

200

Even after

201

the Marquis's Mansion,

202

I realized

203
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,660
that even someone
from the Marquis's Mansion

204
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,820
could be like him.

205
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,140

206

210
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,740
but they have a dirty heart.

211
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,260
But Baili Dongjun is different.

212
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,180
His heart is as pure

213
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,180
as a youth's.

214
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,300
Nice answer.

Moreover,

216
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,500
I think that both of us

217
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,300
are of the same kind.

218

lucky to not get killed easily.

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,740
but

378
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,900
I dared not bother you.

379
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,740
Then,

380
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,260
why do you come today?

381
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,740
I'm leaving Tianqi soon.

382
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,820
I'm here to bid you farewell.

383
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,900
Farewell?

384
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,540
We met by chance, after all.

385
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,260
You didn't have to come

386
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,420
to bid me farewell.

387
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,780
You flatter me.

388
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,180
I know

389
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,180
that to you,

390
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,260
I'm just

391
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,300
a nobody.

392
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,780
But to me,

393
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,300
you are special.

394
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,020
I have to leave now,

395
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,900
but I will be back

396
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,300
when I have truly

397
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,460
mastered spear techniques

398
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:12,980
and when I can truly

399
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,100
protect you.

400
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,660
Oh my.

401
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,740
How silly and naive of him.

402
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,220
Cut to the chase.

403
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,340
So, why are you here?

404
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,300
I'm sure Li Changsheng

405
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,500
is about to give me

406
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
a problematic task.

407
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,220
Mr. Li wants you

408
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
to forge a nice blade

409
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,660
for this young man here.

410
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,500
I won't.

411
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,820
I've just received

412
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,740
an important order,

413
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,900
and I've got no time for him.

414
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,100
How important is it?

415
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,180
Why don't you take a look

416
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,020
at what Mr. Li is offering you?

417
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,740
Well...

418
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,020
It's hers.

419
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,580
Mr. Li searched for it for a long time.

420
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,580
Kid,

421
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,740
you already have
a Celestial Level Sword,

422
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,060
and you still came here

423
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,060
to get a blade from me?

424
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,900
Looks like Li Changsheng

425
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,540
is ready to teach you

426
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,460
his ultimate moves.

427
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,740
What ultimate moves?

428
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,500
The Double-Handed Blade-Sword Technique.

429
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,500
That's right.

430
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,500
His Double-Handed Blade-Sword Technique

431
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,820
is forceful

432
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,780
yet elegant.

433
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,940
A perfect balance of light and heavy,

434
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,580
and it was invincible.

435
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,580
I see that your sword

436
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,420
is on the lighter side,

437
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,420
so I'll give you

438
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,180
a heavier blade.

439
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,820
Looks like Mr. Luo

440
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,460
has some leftover stock.

441
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,020
A few years ago,

442
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,980
someone gave me

443
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,820
a piece of meteoric ore.

444
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,900
I forged a sword and a blade with it.

445
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,300
That sword is meant

446
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,700
for the order I mentioned earlier.

447
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,300
As for the blade,

448
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,220
it needs to go
through the final forging stage

449
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,300
for another three days.

450
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,980
The one who placed that order

451
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,300
must be as important as Mr. Li.

452
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,740
And more decent, to add.

453
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,420
At least

454
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,580
that person came here

455
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,020
with real money,

456
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,900
instead of offering me

457
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,540
a piece of stone

458
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,700
for a mythical weapon

459
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,020
like that person did.

460
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,140
Remember,

461
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,380
don't disturb me

462
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,260
for the next three days.

463
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,660
Nice blade.

464
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,900
What's its name?

465
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,620
Unlike those fellows

466
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,220
from Swordheart Grave,

467
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,300
I disassociate myself

468
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,540
from the weapon

469
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,860
as soon as it is made.

470
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,540
Whatever name it is,

471
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,460
it's up to the owner to decide.

472
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,820
It's been so long,

473
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,460
and you still won't pass up a chance

474
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,140
to poke fun at Li Suwang
from Swordheart Grave.

475
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,340
I'm not.

476
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,300
I just don't like

477
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,500
his pretentious and genteel personality.

478
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,780
A sword is a sword.

479
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,620
What's the point of giving names

480
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,140
like that

481
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,580
"Listen to the Rain and Watch the Snow"

482
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,140
or "Smell the Wind
and Look at the Flowers".

483
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,020
Phooey!

484
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,900
How disgusting.

485
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:26,980
Fine,

486
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,140
since my sword is called Dustless,

487
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,020
I'll call my blade...

488
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,700
Maybe...

489
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,140
Unsullied by the dust
of the mortal world,

490
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,380
a pure heart lies beneath the cinders.

491
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,060
Why don't you call it Cinderless?

492
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,900
Alright, we'll call it Cinderless.

493
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,580
Good.

494
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,980
Now that you have a blade,

495
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,540
as Mr. Li said,

496
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,820
you can stop practicing

497
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
the 19 Embroidery Sword Techniques.

498
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:54,980
You can start practicing
the blade techniques.

499
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,580
What technique should I practice?

500
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,060
Take this.

501
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,340
[Five-Tiger Cliff Blade Technique]
Five-Tiger Cliff Blade Technique?

502
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,340
But, Mas...

503
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,260
But, Chunshui,

504
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,500
I've seen this technique before.

505
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,620
Even the guards at my home know this.

506
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,620
Don't underestimate this technique.

507
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,100
I had a friend

508
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:12,980
who used this...

509
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,180
He used this technique

510
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,420
and became famous, right?

511
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,420
You're making stories up again.

512
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:18,980
I don't believe you.

513
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,420
You can believe him

514
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,620
because the friend he was talking about

515
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,500
is me.

516
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,380
If you're not convinced,

517
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,620
why don't we have a spar?

518
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,660
Sure.

519
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,220
You believe me now, don't you?

520
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,100
You can use ordinary weapons

521
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,660
and ordinary techniques,

522
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,900
but the person who wields the weapon

523
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,460
must be more than ordinary.

524
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,700
Mr. Luo's
Five-Tiger Cliff Blade Technique

525
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,980
is actually weaker than Xiao Yi's

526
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,060
19 Embroidery Sword Techniques.

527
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,420
I understand.

528
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,700
I will train harder.

529
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,420
Good to see you being so humble.

530
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,340
Yun... Yun?

531
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,500
Yunyun?

532
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,780
Should I call you

533
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,540
Dongdongjun?

534
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,860
What brings you here?

535
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,700
To take my sword.

536
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,420
Is this

537
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,140
where Mr. Luo lives?

538
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,060
Who are you?

539
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,860
I'm Ye Dingzhi.

540
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,060
I have come to collect a sword
as my master's command

541
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,620
It's you.

542
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,540
Come, have a seat.

543
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,340
The sword is ready.

544
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,660
Your master has already paid for it,

545
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,020
so you can collect it anytime.

546
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,020
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

547
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,460
How is your master

548
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,340
doing lately?

549
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,580
Who are you?

550
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,900
I'm Nangong Chunshui.

551
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,460
Mr. Li has entrusted me

552
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,660
to bring Baili Dongjun here

553
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,700
to collect a blade.

554
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,380
Dongjun is here too?

555
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,060
He got wiped out

556
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,540
by Mr. Luo's
Five-Tiger Cliff Blade Technique,

557
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,940
and he's resting in there.

558
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,100
I'll see him tomorrow, then.

559
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,620
You haven't answered my question.

560
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,900
My master...

561
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,420
He has left.

562
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,580
Young man, you knew my master?

563
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,340
I guess

564
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,380
he was a good friend.

565
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,340
So you're the owner

566
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,260
of that sword.

567
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,460
What a coincidence.

568
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,820
What's its name?

569
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,380
And what's your blade's name?

570
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,500
It's called Cinderless.

571
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
I named it.

572
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,700
Then, I'll call my sword

573
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,180
Pavilion Moon.

574
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,700
Pavilion Moon?

575
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,460
Nice name.

576
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,020
Now, we have

577
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,260
matching weapons.

578
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,060
Alright, now that you're done talking,

579
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,860
it's time for us to leave.

580
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,580
Yun, want to join us?

581
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,780
I need to return to Nanjue

582
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,940
to handle my master's affairs.

583
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,260
I can tag along for a while, though.

584
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,900
Why?

585
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,900
Are you leaving?

586
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,300
Yes,

587
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,500
or else we won't make it in time.

588
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,340
Make it in time?

589
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:42,980
Make what in time?

590
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,180
Are we rushing

591
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,180
to go somewhere?

592
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,620
Why do I feel like you're not

593
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,780
rushing anywhere all this time?

594
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,740
We're not heading there directly.

595
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,460
We're stopping by somewhere

596
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,660
and it might take some of our time.

597
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,780
Where?

598
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,300
The Tang Sect.

599
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
Why are you going to the Tang Sect?

600
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,700
I've heard there's
a Poison Convention there,

601
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,020
so we're going to check it out.

602
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,740
I guess we're not

603
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,420
going to see each other again
in this lifetime.

604
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,340
Use your weapons

605
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,420
to their fullest.

606
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,900
Hopefully, one day,

607
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,300
I can hear legends of them

608
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,460
in this small town.

609
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,420
I wonder

610
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,340
where that kid is now.

611
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,180
When we received that letter
from the Ninth Prince,

612
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,700
I thought even the Academy

613
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,180
had enough of that troublemaker,

614
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,140
and had expelled him.

615
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,660
That made me happy for a while.

616
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Our son

617
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,100
may be naughty on the surface,

618
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,900
but it's good for him

619
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,340
to follow Mr. Li

620
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,300
and travel around the world.

621
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,340
Well,

622
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,900
do you think
they'll pass by Qiandong City?

623
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,460
Probably not.

624
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,860
Mr. Li avoids trouble like the plague,

625
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,780
and meeting

626
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,620
the famous Marquis of Zhenxi

627
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,380
is the biggest trouble he could have.

628
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,700
I know you miss him,

629
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,140
but at his age,

630
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,540
he should be

631
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,660
broadening his horizons.

632
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,940
Don't you miss him?

633
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,980
No, I don't.

634
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,060
Why would I miss that rascal?

635
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,260
Chengfeng.

636
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,380
I keep worrying

637
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,900
about something.

638
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,180
I'm afraid that Dongjun...

639
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,260
Don't worry.

640
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,780
Mr. Li is with him.

641
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,100
Nothing would happen to Dongjun.

642
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,220
If you're still worried...

643
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,580
My brother will become

644
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,100
the next head of the Wen Family,

645
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,660
so stop torturing him.

646
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,580
That depends on

647
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,180
what he perceives

648
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,140
as true torture.

649
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,780
Planning to head out for fun again?

650
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,900
I have to stay at home
and concoct poisons every day.

651
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,700
It's so boring!

652
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,060
We've got so many poisons.

653
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,980
It's enough to poison
half of Beili's residents.

654
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,580
Two days ago,

655
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,820
we received

656
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,260
an invitation from the Tang Sect.

657
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,700
You mean

658
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,740
the Poison Convention?

659
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,940
That's right.

660
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,460
Everyone knows

661
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,740
that the Wen Family's poison
is the best in the world,

662
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,380
but the Tang Sect is now claiming
to have the best poisons.

663
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,300
I'm afraid they're planning
to compete with us.

664
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,340
Now that they're inviting us

665
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,700
to the Poison Convention,

666
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,980
we'd better not lose.

667
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,340
Is Father

668
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,220
really allowing us
to attend that convention this time?

669
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,700
He said

670
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,700
that we don't even need to compete.

671
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,020
For centuries,

672
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,340
if we claim to be the second best,

673
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,940
no one would dare
to claim that they're the best.

674
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,500
However,

675
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,100
we're not afraid
of having a competition.

676
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,940
If anyone tries to outshine us,

677
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,980
we'll just poison them.

678
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,420
Awesome!

679
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,540
I've always wanted

680
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,540
to show Tang Linghuang
from the Tang Sect

681
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,260
who's better at using poisons!

682
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,900
When do we depart?

683
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,700
Tomorrow.

684
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,700
I said tomorrow!

685
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,540
Go.

686
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
To my disciple, Changfeng,

687
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,420
I am going to the Tang Sect.

688
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,940
Let's meet there.

689
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,340
The Tang Sect?

690
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,220
Mr. Luo

691
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,260
may have a fiery temper,

692
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,740
but he's quite a nice person.

693
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,820
Before we left, he gave me

694
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,220
the liquor he brewed himself.

695
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,660
How does it taste?

696
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,340
Rough but strong.

697
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,660
I can feel the passion in him.

698
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,500
He's actually

699
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,060
a pretty loyal guy,

700
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,460
but he's not good
at expressing himself.

701
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,260
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have lost the chance

702
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,180
to be with that wild lass.

703
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,540
That wild lass?

704
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,740
You mean the owner of the jade pendant?

705
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,700
Yes.

706
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,460
Later, she married

707
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,940
Li Suwang from Swordheart Grave,

708
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,340
and then

709
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,020
they had a baby girl.

710
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,100
You know her.

711
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,420
Li Xinyue.

712
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,260
Second Senior's mother-in-law?

713
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,860
But she's quite old now.

714
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,420
Look at you,

715
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,980
and you're calling her a lass?

716
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,100
She will always be a lass.

717
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,700
She was just 25 years old when she died.

718
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,260
That's how old a lass should be.

719
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,660
She's gone?

720
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,620
Luo Sheng has always blamed himself

721
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,980
for her death.

722
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,140
But actually

723
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,540
it had nothing to do with him.

724
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,460
Later, he adopted a new identity

725
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,100
and moved to this town.

726
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,100
He swore he would never

727
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,220
get involved
in the martial arts world again.

728
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,700
So Mr. Luo

729
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,620
created a mental cage

730
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,180
and locked himself inside.

731
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,860
Who wouldn't do that?

732
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,940
To me,

733
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,220
I'm caged between Heaven and Earth.

734
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,940
I can never grow old

735
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,220
or die.

736
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,060
It sounds interesting,

737
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,500
but sometimes,

738
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,460
it can be pretty boring.

739
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,460
Chunshui.

740
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,220
You're getting too full of yourself.

741
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,020
Wen Buping.
[*Lit: steady pace]

742
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,180
Just like your name,

743
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,060
you sure have a steady pace.

744
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,860
I'm about to fall asleep
in this carriage!

745
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,340
Can't you go faster?

746
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,820
What can I do?

747
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,020
The Wen Family

748
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,380
is different from other sects.

749
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,820
If the other sects arrived first,

750
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,660
the Tang Sect would welcome them
with open arms

751
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,500
and do the honors.

752
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,940
But if we arrived first,

753
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,460
they'd be wary of us,

754
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,820
and vice versa.

755
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,180
Don't worry.

756
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,340
I did my calculations.

757
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,700
It's best if we arrive

758
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,900
in the last minute.

759
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,580
Fine.

760
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,420
You're just too cautious.

761
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,060
You're reckless and I'm mild.

762
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,020
This is

763
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,500
how our family gets better.

764
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,660
What's wrong now?

765
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,020
We're not even moving now?

766
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,860
Your messenger is back.

767
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:22,820
Well?

768
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,540
Have you found them?

769
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,540
We've found Young Master Dongjun,

770
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,900
but Mr. Li is nowhere to be seen.

771
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,020
Young Master is traveling

772
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,700
with two young men

773
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,020
and a young lady.

774
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,180
A young lady...

775
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,060
Mr. Li isn't with him?

776
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,260
Where are they going, then?

777
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,540
It looked like
they were heading to Jin City too.

778
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,620
The Tang Sect?

779
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,660
They're going to the Tang Sect too?

780
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,540
I have a bad feeling about this.

781
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,660
Did Dongjun

782
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,900
get separated from Mr. Li

783
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,860
and get abducted by those three...

784
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,180
I need to go first.

785
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,540
Enjoy your slow ride!

786
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:00,980
Dongjun.

787
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,940
Who exactly is

788
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,020
Chunshui?

789
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,540
You can think of me

790
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,980
as Li Changsheng's reincarnation.

791
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,060
I don't know
whether humans do reincarnate,

792
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:11,980
but I know

793
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,100
they just don't reincarnate

794
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,500
as adults.

795
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,180
Still,

796
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,340
the way you bluff and exaggerate

797
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,060
does resemble him.

798
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,540
Right, Yun.

799
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,580
He is Mr. Li.

800
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:23,900
What?

801
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,140
You might just

802
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,460
become my disciple.

803
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:33,900
Yeah.

804
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,540
Something happened that night.

805
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,460
You can take him as your master today.

806
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,540
I went to Tianqi

807
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,820
and took the Academy examinations

808
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,140
just to see

809
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,580
what my master's lifelong rival

810
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,340
looked like.

811
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,340
I've never thought

812
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,740
of becoming your disciple.

813
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,980
And now,

814
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,380
this is even more impossible.

815
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,820
When it comes to apprenticeship,

816
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,180
perhaps your master
was better than I am.

817
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,900
A thought just came to me.

818
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,380
What is it?

819
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,940
The martial arts world

820
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,100
is supposed to be dead.

821
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,740
But as we martial artists

822
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,900
fill it with stories,

823
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,380
the world has come alive.

824
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,060
Cheers!

825
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:25,700
Cheers!
