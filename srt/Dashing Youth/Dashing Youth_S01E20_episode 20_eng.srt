♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,020

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,360

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,820

24
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,540
Disciple, do you still remember what I said before we embarked on this journey?

25
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,280
What was it?

26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,780
Observe every strike I make carefully except for the last strike.

27
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,280
Otherwise, it'll all go to waste.

28
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,440
I don't want to miss that strike.

29
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,100
My silly disciple.

30
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,010
Amid the approaching spring chill,

31
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,080
here I come treading on water.

32
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:11,620

33
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,700
Rain Demon. You're came after all.

34
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,660
Brother Chunshui, what kind of person is the Rain Demon?

35
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,100
Is he going to lead Brother Yun astray?

36
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,660
During our journey I've heard a lot of martial artists talking about

37
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,540
how he's traveling Nanjue with Brother Yun.

38
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,260
The Rain Demon had a nickname when he was young,

39
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,780
the Rain Maniac, because he was maniacal and arrogant.

40
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,460
During his younger days roaming the martial world,

41
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,500
he defeated many people who were actually stronger than him

42
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,420
simply because he was a maniac.

43
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,920
Unfortunately, he would eventually encounter Li Changsheng.

44
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,780
And what kind of person was Li Changsheng?

45
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,340
He's far more maniacal and arrogant.

46
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,500
Can you stop flattering yourself in such an obnoxiously indirect way?

47
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,620
You rascal. Am I flattering myself?

48
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,850
I'm clearly flattering Li Changsheng.

49
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:34,900
As I said, in this life, I want to be a genteel scholar, an elegant young man.

50
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,620
I shall steer clear of worldly affairs and shall only appreciate beautiful ladies.

51
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,580
You're over 180 years old and you're still thinking of appreciating beautiful ladies?

52
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,060
You're too old for that.

53
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,020
Brother Chunshui.

54
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,420
The Rain Demon used to be a handsome man.

55
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,600
But while he was mastering the Demon Deity Sword Techniques, something happened and he turned into a beautiful woman.

56
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,220
See? Unlike you, he doesn't care much about romantic affairs.

57
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,900
Otherwise, he wouldn't have traveled all this way to kill Yan Lingxia.

58
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,040
Brother Chunshui. What's the deal with Yan Lingxia?

59
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,460
Beautiful.

60
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,580
So beautiful.

61
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,100
You really don't care if you're too old?

62
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,820
Five li from here is a town named Qianyue Town.

63
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,640
We'll spend the night there.

64
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,140
Rain Demon, we shouldn't have met today.

65
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,080
What a nag.

66
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,700
Master, do you think the Rain Demon is a match for Yan Lingxia?

67
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,300
I can't say for certain.

68
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,020
I thought you knew everything.

69
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,980
What are you uncertain about?

70
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:14,920
If he's doing this for himself, I guess they'd probably end the fight in a draw.

71
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,460
But if he's doing this for someone else...

72
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,500
You mean for Brother Yun?

73
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:29,780
The Rain Demon may be called a demon, but to me, compared to most people, he's...

74
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,660
He's what?

75
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,080
Kinder.

76
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,720
I've lost, but you're about to die.

77
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,338
You brought it on yourself.

78
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:04,226
Just to pursue the useless title of the top martial artist of Nanjue.

79
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,900
I have never sought for such a title even if the whole world believes otherwise.

80
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,540
Let them believe what they want.

81
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,540
Disciple.

82
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,920
I told you not to watch my last strike,

83
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,480
but...

84
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,740
You still saw it didn't you?

85
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,040
Master...

86
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,660
Disciple, don't be sad.

87
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,800
Don't avenge me either.

88
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,100
I've been practicing the demonic art for so many years

89
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,020
that my health has almost depleted.

90
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,520
Even if I didn't seek death today, I wouldn't make it past six months.

91
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,980
Throughout this journey, I've launched 13 strikes.

92
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:46,180
Every strike has been a lesson for you.

93
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,080
As your master...

94
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,980
this is all I can do for you.

95
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,940
Disciple.

96
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,580
I didn't want you to see the final strike

97
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,380
because I don't want you to follow in my footsteps.

98
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,020
But...

99
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,660
since you saw it,

100
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,540
you'll have to bear the legacy of my sword techniques.

101
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,760
I left you a letter.

102
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,680
There's an address on it. Head to that address.

103
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,460
Master.

104
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,200
I left a present for you.

105
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Thank you, Master.

106
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:06,340
There's an old man in the north that I've never been able to defeat.

107
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,560
Make sure you train hard and defeat his disciple.

108
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,260
I will remember.

109
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,660
I won't disappoint you.

110
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,980
Farewell, my disciple.

111
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,740
No one knows where I, the Rain Demon, came from.

112
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,680
I also don't wish for anyone to know where my final resting spot is.

113
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,500
Master!

114
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,740
Brother Chunshui, what are you looking at?

115
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,600
I can sense... an old friend departing somewhere.

116
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,340
Not bad. You can already take three hits from me.

117
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,820
Sikong Changfeng, let's talk.

118
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,320
Sure.

119
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,180
All this time I've been meaning to ask you something.

120
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,060
Baili Dongjun is from the Marquis Mansion and he has a noble status.

121
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,560
His father is the Marquis son and his mother is the young lady of the Wen Family.

122
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,260
Right now he's also a disciple of Li Changsheng, the top martial artist.

123
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:35,620
He's lucky to have a good life, but you've been wandering since your youth without a place to call home.

124
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:42,240
Usually a rich kid like him would be someone that you'd detest, so why are you friends?

125
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,820
When I met him I didn't know he was from the Marquis Mansion.

126
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:54,260
Back then, all I thought was we happened to meet by chance and it's good to travel the Martial World together.

127
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:02,420
Even after I knew he was from the Marquis Mansion, I realized that someone from there could still be like him.

128
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,640
- Like what? 
 - I have seen many noble young masters.

129
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,100
Most of them may look decent outside but they have a dark heart.

130
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,700
But Baili Dongjun is different. His heart is pure, like a youth's.

131
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,540
Nice answer.

132
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,200
Moreover, I think that both of us are the same kind. He's had a good life, while I haven't.

133
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,180
He and I will both reach our goals eventually.

134
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,060
That's a marvelous answer.

135
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,900
We've been training for several days and you've probably heard rumors that I might take you in as my disciple.

136
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,500
Wait, sir. Those are just rumors.

137
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,700
I'm already glad that you're willing to give me a few pointers.

138
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,460
I wouldn't dare dream of becoming your disciple.

139
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,860
I won't take you in as my disciple

140
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,980
because I'm not qualified.

141
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,260
There's someone far more formidable than I who wants to take you in as his disciple, but it's not the right time yet.

142
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,140
That day will come soon though.

143
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,860
He's also waiting to meet you again somewhere in this Martial World.

144
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,160
Meet me again?

145
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,060
Life is like a dream.

146
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,580
Meetings and partings come and go.

147
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,150
Are you leaving already, Young Master Xie?

148
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,660
As we have met, so must we part.

149
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,160
I've finished my book, so I have to go.

150
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,800
Brother Sikong, I hope we can meet again somewhere.

151
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,320
Martial Uncle.

152
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,180
Sir, I think it's also time for me to go.

153
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,260
When are you leaving?

154
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,120
Right now, then.

155
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,760
- You're so eager to leave, too? 
 - Since I feel like venturing now, why not?

156
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,900
It's a big world outside. Sir, may we meet again.

157
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,280
I'm off!

158
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:13,320
The Martial World remains the same because of the youths that continue to come generation after generation.

159
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,080
We're here. This is it.

160
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,675

161
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,540
Brother Chunshui, have you been here before?

162
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,320
What do you need? Hoe, spade, or plough?

163
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,320
A blade. A good one.

164
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,680
Who are you?

165
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,000
An old friend.

166
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,500
- What's your name? 
 - Nangong Chunshui.

167
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,680
Your surname isn't Li?

168
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,940
You look exactly the same as that man when he was young. You're not his son?

169
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,440
Why? Does he look like a playboy to you?

170
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,260
Of course.

171
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,880
That pompous brat. I wouldn't be surprised if he's got a bunch of grandchildren.

172
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,860
- Pompous brat. 
 - Hush.

173
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,640
That's not nice of you to describe an old friend like that.

174
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,260
All right, don't just stand there. Come in and talk.

175
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,800
So, who are you?

176
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,960
I'm Baili Dongjun, a disciple of Mister Li from the Academy.

177
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,160
I'm Yin Luoxia, Young Master Liu Yue's disciple.

178
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,640
Liu Yue's disciple?

179
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,120
No wonder you look so pretty.

180
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:48,300
As for you, you look like a mediocre martial artist but you have a nice sword.

181
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,500
So we've got two boys in the Hard Phase of Mortals and a lass who's in-between.

182
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,900
How bold is he to let you three approach me like this?

183
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,440
I wonder how powerful you are to look down on those in the Hard Phase?

184
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,460
I'm not looking down on those in the Hard Phase. I'm just looking down on you.

185
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,920
That's because I'm also in the Hard Phase of Mortals.

186
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:29,340
Kid, if you want to provoke me, try again in another 30 years.

187
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,880
You're the one who's provoking me.

188
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,200
Dongjun, this is the man I told you about.

189
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,400
He's one of the top three weapon makers, Luo Sheng, the Military Deity.

190
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,360
Sir. Those herbs are exceptionally rare. Do keep them properly.

191
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,460
Also, please send my master's regards to Mister Xin.

192
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:00,020
Rest assured. These herbs concern both the patient from the Mu Family and my life.

193
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,840
Thank you, Shopkeeper. I'm off.

194
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,082
Safe journeys.

195
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,100
 Come look.

196
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,520
 Do come again.

197
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,140
 I love the new score that you're playing!

198
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,180
 Come on!

199
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,840
- Take this. 
 - How long has it been since you last came?

200
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,860
- Yes. 
 - We've missed you.

201
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,820
 Should I go see her?

202
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,140
 I had an older brother who could play this song as well.

203
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,300
 I mistook you for him.

204
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,960
 Actually, I'd love to have a little sister.

205
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,540
 You... How dare you tease me time and again?

206
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,820
 You may meet many people throughout your life, but only befriend a few.

207
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,160
 I believe that true friends do exist.

208
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,900
 Your guqin and my leaf resonated together.

209
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,940
 I will be back.

210
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,840

211
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,740
He's gone?

212
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,840
Sister Linglong, Young Master Sikong is back.

213
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,500
Miss. He... He's back again.

214
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,525

215
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,660
Young Master Sikong, it's been awhile.

216
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,960
What made you think of me?

217
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,100
I... Actually, I've been thinking about you all this time

218
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,000
but I didn't dare bother you.

219
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,660
Then why did you come today?

220
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,940
I'm leaving Tianqi soon.

221
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,100
I'm here to bid you farewell.

222
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
Farewell?

223
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,400
We met by chance, after all.

224
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,420
You didn't have to come to bid me farewell.

225
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,540
You're too kind.

226
00:21:54,540 --> 00:22:01,400
I know that to you I'm just a nobody.

227
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,400
But to me, you're special.

228
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,120
I have to leave now, but I'll be back when I've truly mastered spear techniques

229
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,100
and when I can truly protect you.

230
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh my. How silly and naive of him.

231
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,460
Cut to the chase. So why are you here?

232
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,700
I'm sure Li Changsheng is about to give me a problematic task.

233
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,900
Mister Li wants you to forge a nice blade for this young man here.

234
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,060
I won't.

235
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,900
I just received an important order and I've got no time for him.

236
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,400
How important is it?

237
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,920
Why don't you take a look at what Mister Li is offering you?

238
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,540
This... is hers?

239
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,580
Mister Li searched for a long time.

240
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:47,540
Kid, you already have a Celestial Level Sword and yet you still came here to get a blade from me?

241
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,720
Looks like Li Changsheng is ready to teach you his ultimate moves.

242
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,160
What ultimate moves?

243
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,900
The Double-Handed Blade-Sword Technique.

244
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,980
That's right. His Double-Handed Blade-Sword Technique is forceful, yet elegant.

245
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,340
A perfect balance of light and heavy, and invincible.

246
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:12,340
I see that your sword is on the lighter side so I'll give you a heavier blade.

247
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,560
Looks like Deity Luo has some leftover stock.

248
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,180
A few years ago someone gave me a piece of meteorite.

249
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,360
I forged a sword and a blade with it.

250
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,080
That sword is meant for the order I mentioned earlier.

251
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,400
As for the blade, it needs to go through the final forging stage for another three days.

252
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,580
The one who placed that order must be as important as Mister Li.

253
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,940
More decent than him.

254
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,840
At least that person came here with real money

255
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:53,120
instead of offering me a piece of stone for a mythical weapon.

256
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,560
Remember, don't disturb me for the next three days.

257
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,420
Nice blade. What's its name?

258
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,780
Unlike those fellows from Swordheart Grave,

259
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:59,000
I disassociate myself from the weapon as soon as it's made.

260
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,480
Whatever it's name is, it's up to the owner to decide.

261
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,160
It's been so long,

262
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,080
and you still won't pass up a chance to poke fun at Li Suwang from Sword Heart Tomb.

263
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,060
I'm not.

264
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:15,820
I just don't like his pretentious and genteel personality.

265
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,060
A sword is a sword.

266
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,660
What's the point of giving it names like "Listen to the Rain and Watch the Snow"

267
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,340
or "Smell the Wind and Look at the Flowers".

268
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,620
Peh! How disgusting.

269
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:32,020
Alright, since my sword is called Dustless, I'll call my blade...

270
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,280
call it...

271
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,580
Unsullied by the dust of the mortal world, a pure heart lies beneath the cinders.

272
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,040
Why don't you call it Cinderless?

273
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,100
Alright, we'll call it Cinderless.

274
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,580
Okay.

275
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,940
Now that you have a blade, as Mister Li said,

276
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,180
you can stop practicing the 19 Embroidery Sword Techniques.

277
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,820
You can start practicing the blade techniques.

278
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,260
- What technique? 
 - Take this.

279
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,740
Five-Tiger Mountain Breaking Technique?

280
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,440
But, Mas...

281
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,193
But, Brother Chunshui, I've seen this technique before. Even the guards at my home know this.

282
00:27:09,193 --> 00:27:10,820
Don't underestimate this technique.

283
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:16,260
- I had a friend who used this before... 
 - Used this technique to became famous, right?

284
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,280
You're making stories up again. I don't believe you.

285
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:27,600
You can believe him because the friend he was talking about is me.

286
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,720
If you're not convinced, why don't we spar?

287
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,860
Sure.

288
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,500
You believe me now, don't you?

289
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,420
You can use ordinary weapons and ordinary techniques,

290
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,880
but the person who wields the weapon can't be ordinary.

291
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,080
Deity Luo's Five-Tiger Cliff Mountain Breaking Technique

292
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,040
is actually weaker than Xiao Yi's 19 Embroidery Sword Techniques.

293
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,780
I understand. I will train harder.

294
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,420
It's rare to see you so humble.

295
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,440
Yun... Brother Yun?

296
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,440
Brother Yunyun?

297
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,540
Should I call you Dongdongjun?

298
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,540
What brings you here?

299
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,800
Because this sword is mine.

300
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,100
Is this where Mister Luo lives?

301
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,900
Who are you?

302
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,500
I'm Ye Dingzhi.

303
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,660
I've come to collect a sword at my master's command.

304
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,340
So it was you.

305
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,640
Come, come, have a seat.

306
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,600
The sword is ready.

307
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,300
Your master has already paid for it so you can collect it anytime.

308
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,420
Thank you, Diety Luo.

309
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,340
How is your master doing lately?

310
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,680
Who are you?

311
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,300
I'm Nangong Chunshui.

312
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,260
Mister Li entrusted me to bring Baili Dongjun here to collect a blade.

313
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,500
Dongjun is here too?

314
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,080
He didn't believe in Deity Luo's Five-Tiger Technique and is resting in there.

315
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,220
I'll see him tomorrow, then.

316
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,820
You haven't answered my question yet.

317
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,600
My master... has left.

318
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,580
Young man, you knew my master?

319
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,480
I guess he was considered... a good friend.

320
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,600
So you're the owner of that sword.

321
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,820
What a coincidence. What's its name?

322
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,460
What's your blade's name?

323
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,680
It's called Cinderless. I named it.

324
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,700
Then, I'll call my sword...

325
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,500
Pavilion Moon.

326
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,080
Pavilion Moon? Nice name.

327
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,260
Now we can join forces in the future.

328
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:25,500
All right, now that you're done talking it's time for us to leave.

329
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,720
Brother Yun, want to join us?

330
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,120
I need to return to Nanjue to handle my master's affairs.

331
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,260
I can tag along for awhile, though.

332
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,800
What?

333
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,540
Are you leaving?

334
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,660
Yes or else we won't make it in time.

335
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,360
Make it in time? In time for what?

336
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,940
Are we rushing to get to that place?

337
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,340
Why do I feel like you haven't been rushing at all?

338
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,960
We're not heading there directly.

339
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,940
We're stopping by somewhere and it might take some of our time.

340
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,660
Where?

341
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,000
The Tang Sect.

342
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,120
Why are you going to the Tang Sect?

343
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,120
I've heard there's a Poison Convention there so we're going to check it out.

344
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,520
I guess we're not going to see each other again in this lifetime.

345
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,680
Use your weapons to their fullest.

346
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,560
Hopefully, one day, I can hear legends of them in this small town.

347
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,440
I wonder where that kid is now.

348
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,480
When we received that letter from the Ninth Prince,

349
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,380
I thought even the Academy had enough of that troublemaker and expelled him.

350
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,160
That made me happy for awhile.

351
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,740
Our son may be naughty on the surface,

352
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:54,380
but for him to travel the world with Mister Li is a good thing.

353
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,900
Do you think they'll pass by Qiandong City?

354
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,260
Probably not. Mister Li avoids trouble like the plague

355
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:08,480
and meeting the famous Marquis Zhenxi is the biggest trouble.

356
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,860
I know you miss him, but at his age he should be broadening his horizons.

357
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,000
Don't you miss him?

358
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,080
No, no, I don't.

359
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,060
Why would I miss that rascal?

360
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:43,120
Chengfeng, I keep worrying about something.

361
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,380
I'm afraid that Dongjun...

362
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,140
Don't worry. Mister Li is with him.

363
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,100
What could happen to Donjun?

364
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,220
If you're still worried...

365
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:11,180
My brother will become the next head of the Wen Family so stop torturing him.

366
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:17,240
That depends on what he perceives as true torture.

367
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,980
Planning to head out for fun again?

368
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,180
I have to stay at home and concoct poisons every day.

369
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,020
It's so boring!

370
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,240
We've got so many poisons.

371
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,780
It's enough to poison half the people in Beili.

372
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,260
Two days ago, we received an invitation from the Tang Sect.

373
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,140
You mean... the Poison Convention?

374
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,260
That's right.

375
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,900
Everyone knows that the Wen Family's poison is the best in the world

376
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,780
but the Tang Sect is now claiming to have the best poisons.

377
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,840
I'm afraid they're planning to compete with us.

378
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:11,180
Now they're inviting us to the Poison Convention. We'd better not lose.

379
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,640
Is Father really allowing us to attend this time?

380
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,000
He said that we don't even need to compete.

381
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,720
For centuries, if we claim to be the second best,

382
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,760
no one would dare claim that they're the best.

383
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,920
However, we're not afraid of competition.

384
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,080
If anyone tries to outshine us, we'll just poison them.

385
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,420
Amazing!

386
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,360
I've always wanted to show Tang Linghuang from the Tang Sect who's better!

387
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,100
When do we depart?

388
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,800
Tomorrow.

389
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,700
I said tomorrow!

390
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,840
Go.

391
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,800
 To my disciple, Changfeng, I'm going to the Tang Sect.

392
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,560
 Let's meet there.

393
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,340
The Tang Sect?

394
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,240
Deity Luo may have a fiery temper but he's quite a nice person.

395
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,640
Before we left he gave me liquor he had brewed himself.

396
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,520
How does it taste?

397
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,000
Rough but strong.

398
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,560
I can feel the passion in him.

399
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,740
He's actually a pretty loyal guy but he's not good at expressing himself.

400
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,560
Otherwise he wouldn't have lost the chance to be with that wild lass.

401
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,340
That wild lass?

402
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,220
You mean the owner of the jade pendant?

403
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,800
Yes.

404
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,920
Later she married Sword Heart Tomb's Li Suwang and they had a baby girl.

405
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,320
You know her. Li Xinyue.

406
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,880
Second Senior's mother-in-law?

407
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,180
But she's quite old now.

408
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,640
Look at you, calling her a lass.

409
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,000
She will always be a lass.

410
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,600
She was just 25 years old when she died.

411
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,260
That's how old a lass should be.

412
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,400
She's gone?

413
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,180
Luo Sheng has always blamed himself for her death.

414
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,960
But it actually had nothing to do with him.

415
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,180
Later he adopted a new identity and moved to this town.

416
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,220
He swore he would never get involved in the Martial World again.

417
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,580
So Deity Luo created a mental cage and locked himself inside.

418
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,680
Who wouldn't do that?

419
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,800
To me, I'm caged between Heaven and Earth.

420
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,840
I can never grow old or die.

421
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:12,480
It sounds interesting, but sometimes, it can be pretty boring.

422
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,260
Brother Chunshui, you're getting too full of yourself.

423
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,360
Wen Buping, Wen Buping. You really are like your name, 
  (TN: literal meaning is "steady pace")

424
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,140
step by step, each so steady.

425
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,060
I'm about to fall asleep in this carriage!

426
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,340
Can't you go faster?

427
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,020
What can I do?

428
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,140
The Wen Family is different from other sects.

429
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,020
If the other sects arrived first,

430
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,460
the Tang Sect would welcome them with open arms and do the honors.

431
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:52,420
But if we arrived first, they'd be wary of us and vice versa.

432
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,660
Don't worry, I did my calculations.

433
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,980
It's best if we arrive at the last minute.

434
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,900
Got it, got it.

435
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,180
You're just too cautious.

436
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,140
You're reckless and I'm calm.

437
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,520
This is how our family gets better.

438
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,260
What's wrong now?

439
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,020
We're not even moving now?

440
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,880
Your messenger is back.

441
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,620
Well? Have you found them?

442
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,200
We've found Young Master Dongjun, but Mister Li is nowhere to be seen.

443
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,060
Young Master is traveling with two young men and a young lady.

444
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,400
A young lady...

445
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,540
Mister Li isn't with him? Where are they going, then?

446
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,960
It looked like they were heading to Jin City too.

447
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,180
The Tang Sect? They're going to the Tang Sect too?

448
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,780
I have a bad feeling about this.

449
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,880
Did Dongjun get separated from Mister Li and get abducted by those three...

450
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,760
I need to go first! Enjoy your slow ride!

451
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,240
Dongjun. Who exactly is Brother Chunshui?

452
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,460
You can think of me as Li Changsheng's reincarnation.

453
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:15,752
I don't know whether humans do reincarnate, but I know they don't reincarnate as adults.

454
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:18,780
Still, the way you bluff and exaggerate does resemble him.

455
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,700
Not bad, Brother Yun. He's Mister Li.

456
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,920
What?

457
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,380
You might just become my disciple.

458
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,740
Yes. Something happened that night.

459
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,480
You can take him as your master today.

460
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,900
I went to Tianqi and took the Academy examination

461
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,280
just to see what my master's lifelong rival looked like.

462
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,920
I've never thought of becoming your disciple.

463
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,300
And now this is even more impossible.

464
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:01,300
When it comes to teaching disciples, perhaps your master was better than I was.

465
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,860
A thought just came to me.

466
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,400
What is it?

467
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,980
The Martial World is supposed to be dead.

468
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:23,400
But as we martial artists fill it with stories, the world has come alive.

469
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,820
 - Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

470
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,666

471
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,420

472
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:50,030

473
00:40:52,950 --> 00:41:00,759
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

474
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:09,780
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

475
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:18,940
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

476
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:27,660
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

477
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,720
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

478
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,080
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

479
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,465
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

480
00:41:37,465 --> 00:41:41,980
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

481
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:45,460
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

482
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,520
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

483
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,940
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

484
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,460
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

485
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,920
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

486
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,020
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

487
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:08,000
♫  I met you  ♫

488
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:53,027
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

489
00:42:53,027 --> 00:43:00,680
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

490
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,040
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

491
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:10,360
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

492
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:18,440
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

493
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,800
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

494
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,200
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

495
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,481
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

496
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:33,060
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

497
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,500
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

498
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,566
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

499
00:43:39,566 --> 00:43:42,080
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

500
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,440
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

501
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,960
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

502
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,340
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

503
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:59,340
♫  I met you  ♫
