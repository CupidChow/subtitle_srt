2
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,600
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,840
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,500
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,220
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,920
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,240
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,720
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,800

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,320

22
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,400

23
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,160
You left Liu Yue and Mochen behind to come and hide here?

25
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,500
If I hadn't, how would you know that Baili Dongjun went to Black Tortoise Parlor?

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,780
Black Tortoise Parlor?

27
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,140
Why is he so unlucky?

28
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,200
Little Master, you have a letter.

29
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,040

30
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,900
You're buying information from Bai Xiao Sect?

31
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,020
Yes. It cost me a pretty penny.

32
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,540
You indeed are rich.

33
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,200
They said you need to pay more for this letter.

34
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,440
Seems it's must be important information.

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,275

36
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,860
- Should we call off the examination? 
 - It's too late.

37
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,080
Let's go check on Baili Dongjun.

38
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,640
Baili Dongjun!

39
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,500
You all should have escaped without me.

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,220
Now I've distracted him for nothing.

41
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,640
Since we can't escape, let's fight.

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,400
There are four of us. Don't you think we're strong enough?

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,260
Try him and see.

44
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,260
I may be new to the Martial World, but I can tell that he's at the Carefree Phase of Heaven.

45
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,140
We're only at the Hard Phase of Mortals. We're no match for him.

46
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,060
You're wrong.

47
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,540
How so?

48
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,820
I'm not at the Hard Phase of Mortals.

49
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,540
I've reached the Unrestrained Phase of Earth.

50
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,300
Then why did you come here to become a disciple?

51
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,620
Who said I wanted to be a disciple?

52
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,640
My master, Lu Suzhen, is an immortal wandering the world. He's no less powerful than Mister Li.

53
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,740
I've been ordered here to gain more experience.

54
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,460
- Well... 
 - Dongjun.

55
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,080
What?

56
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,300
I'm also... at the Unrestrained Phase of Earth.

57
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,020
I'm such a fool.

58
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,840
I won't fight you. You four may leave.

59
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,660
Why are you suddenly letting us go?

60
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,900
Just now you could have abandoned the kid with the sword, yet you did not.

61
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,940
I'm impressed. The point of the test is to impress me.

62
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,020
If you could actually beat me, then there's no need for you to learn skills here.

63
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,340
You could become a master yourself.

64
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,140
Remember what happened here today.

65
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,640
No matter what, never abandon your companions.

66
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,200
I'll remember what you said.

67
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,900
I, Yujia, will remember.

68
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,420
Yujia? What a stupid name.

69
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,000
I told you to watch out.

70
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,580
Sorry, Sir.

71
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,000
Here's another tip.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,040
You won't find what you're looking for with just your pouch.

73
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,340
You must find the other teams.

74
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,440
Only by collecting all four pouches will you find the answer.

75
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,060
Time is of the essence. Go.

76
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,080
Thank you, Sir.

77
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,800
Thanks.

78
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,820
Thanks for saving me.

79
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,000
This year's candidates aren't too bad at all.

80
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,280
Are you okay?

81
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,540
No, I'm not okay. The energy in my body is all messed up.

82
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:50,526
That strange old man actually believed I was going to break the sword and used a lot of force.

83
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:52,860
I need to recuperate.

84
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,540
I'll help you settle it. It won't take long.

85
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,020
How long will it take?

86
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,740
At least an hour or so. We need to treat his wound at once.

87
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,420
If we run into Zhuge Yun with one man down, we'll be in trouble.

88
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,460
I'll stand guard for you.

89
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,260
You sure know a lot of tricks.

90
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,200
I've died way too many times.

91
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,340
Concentrate.

92
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,820
This is wonderful.

93
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,500
What do you mean?

94
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,720
A group of exceptional youths gathered in such a magnificent and big city,

95
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,280
fighting side by side, and healing each other under one roof.

96
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,140
It's a beautiful thing.

97
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,320
If you all hadn't shown up...

98
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,740
There should only be one team coming here today.

99
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,740
We received a tip-off that someone entered the exam under a false identity.

100
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:45,920
That's right. One of them is the head disciple of Lu Suzhen, Wang Yixing, not Zhao Yujia.

101
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,880
However, given Mister Lu's ties with Mister Li,

102
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,080
I'm sure Mister Li already knew about it. It's no surprise.

103
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,380
Not only Zhao Yujia, there are others as well.

104
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,340
Unfortunately, we're too late. They've already left.

105
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,980
Young Master.

106
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,320
We found a team in an alley. All four candidates are dead.

107
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,360
All dead?

108
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,000
What about Zhuge Yun? Is he dead?

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,560
Yes.

110
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,440
If Zhuge Yun is dead... did we get it wrong?

111
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,640
Bai Xiao Sect tips are seldom wrong.

112
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Let's go check it out.

113
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,040
Zhuge Yun? Of the Zhuge Family?

114
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,980
I'll come with you.

115
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,560
Three of the candidates died horrendously.

116
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,540
When we discovered them it was hard to take in.

117
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,180
We've sent messengers to inform their families.

118
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,980
What kind of monster would do such a thing? What grudge did he have against them?

119
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,920
Why did he kill the innocent?

120
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,440
Zhuge Yun died in a different manner. There are fewer wounds on his body.

121
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,640
This way.

122
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,840
He's dead.

123
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,620
I got it. The culprit must have special feelings for the Zhuge Family.

124
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,880
Why else would Zhuge Yun receive a more merciful death than the others?

125
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,920
Now is not the time for your nonsense. Get the coroner at once.

126
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,980
This is the Zhuge Yun you've mentioned?

127
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,660
That's... That's not Zhuge Yun?

128
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,260
And he's no martial artist.

129
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,140
A scapegoat.

130
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,380
None of you noticed anything suspicious about Zhuge Yun?

131
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:29,920
No. We had doubts about his identity, but it was clear that he used the Qimen Dunjia Arts.

132
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,960
I think I know who he is.

133
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,860
But if I'm right, things are going to get very complicated.

134
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,960
Interesting.

135
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,620
However, you can't do anything about us being here.

136
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,640
 It's indeed Lord Wuzuo. And this time both Twin Lords have come.

137
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,780
Zhuge Yun?

138
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,140
No. A young man like Zhuge Yun couldn't possibly emanate that kind of energy.

139
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,540
Who are you?

140
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,640
That's none of your business.

141
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,660
You're not our target.

142
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,860
Keep healing him.

143
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,540
- I'll take care of this. 
 - All right.

144
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,760
A nobody like you? You're out of your depth.

145
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,740
A nobody?

146
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,520
This is...

147
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,760
Between creation and destruction lies calamity.

148
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,740
Before the world is formed lies infinite calamities.

149
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,900
It's called the Infinite Sword technique.

150
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,920
You're not Zhao Yujia.

151
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,060
You can impersonate Zhuge Yun but I can't impersonate Zhao Yujia?

152
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,160
That's right, I'm not him.

153
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:06,060
I'm the head disciple of Lu Suzhen of Mount Wangcheng, Wang Yixing.

154
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,800

155
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900

156
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,500
Your future disciple is up against a strong foe.

157
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,280
He could die at any second yet you're sitting here drinking and yawning?

158
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,620
First of all this is Tianqi City.

159
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,380
Martial artists are a dime a dozen and capable ones are everywhere.

160
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,100
There's always someone stronger.

161
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,860
And I'm the strongest of them all.

162
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,480
I am number one!

163
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,040
What's taking the candidates so long? I'm tired.

164
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,820
Their opponent is no ordinary man.

165
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,080
There's no such thing as an ordinary opponent.

166
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,775
There are two kinds of enemies,

167
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:50,140
those who want to kill you and those you want to kill.

168
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,120
In the latter case one should train hard and strike swiftly.

169
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,360
With the former, just hang in there and hope you don't die.

170
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,740
Based on Ruofeng's message, have you guessed who those people are?

171
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:14,260
An empire once retreated and stood on the defensive in a place outside of here.

172
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,898
That empire...

173
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:19,940
Its ruler believed in the Shengtian Religion. It was a theocratic empire.

174
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,460
I met that ruler back then.

175
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,320
He had five formidable bodyguards.

176
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,160
They were Wufa, Wutian, Wuxiang, Wuzuo.

177
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,180
Even today their powers are unmatched.

178
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,460
There are five guards, but you only mentioned four of them.

179
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,040
Yes. Do you know why?

180
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,560
Just as I thought.

181
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,260
Every time you appear there's always trouble.

182
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,320
Zhuge Yun. Wait there!

183
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,520
Why didn't you tell me the Wuzuo Lords were coming?

184
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,420
Isn't it good to increase the odds of winning?

185
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,320
Now that Wuzuo has emerged, they'll be dead for sure.

186
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,380
Pretend to be hurt by me. Let's wait and see what happens.

187
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:24,680
Warriors commanded to arrive, fight formation ready, press forth.

188
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,260
Nine-word Mantra. Interesting.

189
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,000
Attack!

190
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,740
It's the Immovable Lord technique!

191
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:15,420
A menacing projection of buddha's warrior, striking fear in gods and demons alike,

192
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,340
the Immovable Lord technique.

193
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,960
Expanding every ounce of energy within your body to land a killing blow.

194
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,880
It's the most reckless and self-destructive move.

195
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,260
Can you really channel the Immovable Lord?

196
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,980
I... don't believe it.

197
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,500
Then I'll make you believe it.

198
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,740
Impressive. All right, Ye Dingzhi, you can stop now.

199
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,920
The Academy should be aware now with all this noise.

200
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,320
Save some strength and wait for them to come.

201
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,420
Stop?

202
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,220
Oh, no. He's lost it.

203
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,760
Seems like your Immovable Lord technique is a little half-baked.

204
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,540
Then don't blame me for annihilating you.

205
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,620
You dare hurt my people?

206
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,460
You really think you can be this brazen just because I was injured?

207
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:09,740
Now it's time for this lead actor to enter the scene.

208
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,220
♫  The rain from the mountains comes and the wind blows hard  ♫

209
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,900
That's...

210
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,120
"When autumn water comes, streams flow into the river."

211
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:42,060
"The river current is so strong that one couldn't distinguish between a cow and a horse."

212
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,740
Good. Very good!

213
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,408
♫  Who hears the sound of the flute?  ♫

214
00:19:48,408 --> 00:19:50,308
♫  Missing you again and again countless times  ♫

215
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:52,143
♫  An unintentional incantation  ♫

216

♫  The obsession can't be returned  ♫

221
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,300
Master. I haven't found the Path that you spoke of yet.

222
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,040
All I can do is follow in your footsteps.

223
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,900
♫  Only wishing for the dreams in our hearts  ♫

224

♫  Life and death, promised in a pot of wine  ♫

♫  Who knew a sky existed beyond the sky?  ♫

228
00:20:34,414 --> 00:20:36,414
♫  Consider the approaching clouds as a sign  ♫

♫  As long as the world sees  ♫

♫  Who says the martial arts world is dangerous?  ♫

♫  The heart is like algae floating on the waves  ♫

♫  I'm all alone  ♫

♫  The obsession can't be returned  ♫

♫  Who's confusing games cover the sky with one hand?  ♫

239
00:20:57,014 --> 00:21:01,250
So... that's Xichu's Sword Song.

240
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,860
♫  The youth go forth  ♫

241
00:21:19,414 --> 00:21:21,814
This isn't over.

242
00:21:46,694 --> 00:21:48,634
Why...

243
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:57,054
Why did I just sense... his return?

244
00:21:58,074 --> 00:22:01,534
He hasn't returned. He's dead.

245
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:05,874
♫  If the world were destroyed at my fingertips  ♫

246

♫  In this mortal world, there would nothing left to care about  ♫

247
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:15,013
- I know. 
 - No, you don't.

248
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:19,167
He didn't die back then.

249
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:22,120
He stayed in Qiandong City for over ten years.

250
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,611
He died a few months ago.

251
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,680
Before he died, he had a disciple.

252
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,643
What you felt was his disciple's sword song.

253
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,540
Though he is gone, his sword song will remain forever.

254
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,050
Let it be a consolation.

255
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:42,740
♫  Allow me to see you one more time before I leave  ♫

256
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,460
♫  Hoping  ♫

257
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:50,320
♫  Hoping that my dreams will still be fulfilled  ♫

258
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,646
Will his disciple...

259
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,500
come here?

260
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,750
Maybe. Who knows?

261
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,847
Maybe he's already forgotten about the master of the Tianqi Royal Academy's 32nd Division.

262
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:11,260
Or maybe he's always calling out your name in the middle of the night.

263
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,740
♫  Balancing on a thin line  ♫

264
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,900
♫  Why am I afraid to close my eyes  ♫

265
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,380
♫  What I can't bear most  ♫

266
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,620
♫  Is that from now on you're alone in this world  ♫

267
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,520
♫  By the window  ♫

268
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,220
It's so frustrating. We couldn't catch him.

269
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,020
That guy led us on a wild-goose chase.

270
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,700
- He was bidding time for the others. 
 - What?

271
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,940
This guy had accomplices?

272
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,420
It's Liu Yue.

273
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,340
Why is he calling us to go back suddenly?

274
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,300
There's only one possibility.

275
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,600
Master has decided to take over the exam.

276
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,120
Well?

277
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,040
Why were you severely injured?

278
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,360
I distracted the people at the Academy.

279
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,260
Those three are stronger than I expected.

280
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,820
One of them hailed from Mount Wangcheng and knew the Infinite Sword technique.

281
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,160
Another knew the Immovable Lord technique.

282
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,580
Baili Dongjun even used Xichu's Sword Song.

283
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,660
And for some reason Young Miss held back against Baili Dongjun.

284
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,460
Young Miss?

285
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,660
If we don't bring Baili Dongjun back,

286
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,600
how do we explain it?

287
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,920
It's fine. Lord Wuxiang has a fallback.

288
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,540
Brother, someone's here.

289
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,780
Still looking back?

290
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,680
Up here.

291
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,520
Mister Li.

292
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,700
Good. So you do still remember me after all these years.

293
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,100
There's no need for introductions then.

294
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,620
Hold on.

295
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,060
We're not here for you.

296
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,600
Why are you attacking us?

297
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,100
Do you know why they call me Mister Li?

298
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,060
Because I'm the Chancellor of the Academy.

299
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:05,860
You're interfering with the exam and you ask me why I'm attacking you?

300
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,360
That's ridiculous.

301
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,660
One of you can leave and the other will die here.

302
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,340
Mister Li, how arrogant of you.

303
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,260
It's you then.

304
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,940
You keep taunting me.

305
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,760
It would be unreasonable to let you live.

306
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,640
Bring it on then.

307
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,500
The corpse stays here.

308
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,460
Got it?

309
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,020

310
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:52,580
Are we supposed to find the other teams and steal their pouches?

311
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,960
Zhuge Yun was too fast. I forgot to steal his.

312
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,020
Don't worry, I've got it covered.

313
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,380
You stole it right under everyone's noses.

314
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,340
As expected of a trickster.

315
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,280
Watch your mouth.

316
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,200
Wait a minute.

317
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,500
Each team only has one pouch.

318
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
How come Zhuge Yun's team had three?

319
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,400
That wasn't Zhuge Yun.

320
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,140
They must have stolen those pouches from the other teams.

321
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,460
And those candidates are likely dead by now.

322
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,180
Never mind. Let's not dwell on it.

323
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,220
At least we're still alive, right?

324
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,980
If you ran off with the pouches instead of telling us,

325
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,520
you could have become Mister Li's last disciple.

326
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,560
Why don't we see what's inside the pouches?

327
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,260
It's a poem.

328
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,340
 The Vermilion Bird weeps for the sun does not rise.

329
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,000
"You do not witness the Black Tortoise entering the world."

330
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,420
 The White Tiger's menacing gaze appears in the wind.

331
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,000
 The moon will not set, waiting for one to rise.

332
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,180
Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise.

333
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,040
The four heavenly spirits that each oversee a direction.

334
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,660
This is the law by which the Emperor's buildings are constructed.

335
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,160
This poem is about the Four Beasts.

336
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,260
Therein lies the answer.

337
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,560
Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise.

338
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,520
We have three of them.

339
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,440
What about the Azure Dragon?

340
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,440
I've got it. The answer lies in the Azure Dragon.

341
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,000
"The moon will not set, waiting for one to rise." We must go where the dragon rises.

342
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,380
The place where the dragon rises?

343
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,620
Qinglong Gate. 
  (TN: Long means dragon)

344
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,900
Tianqi City has four gates, one in each direction.

345
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,000
Qinglong Gate is right outside the palace.

346
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,380
However, there are two paths to Qinglong Gate.

347
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,180
Which one should we take?

348
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,220
 Qinglong Gate. The left leads to salvation, the right to death.

349
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,780
 Young Lady, lure Baili Dongjun to the right path.

350
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,020
 Run!

351
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,280
 Baili Dongjun!

352
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,220
 You all should have escaped without me.

353
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,260
The left path.

354
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,540
You guys go left and I'll go right.

355
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,920
It's better if we split up.

356
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,760
We can't let a lady venture out alone.

357
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,560
- I'll go right. 
 - Why don't we...

358
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,100
No.

359
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,940
Why not?

360
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,920
Just now...

361
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,280
We have no idea where those people came from.

362
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,620
They might set up an ambush.

363
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,080
You three are injured.

364
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,260
I'm still fine.

365
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,780
I'll go right.

366
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,460
Miss, why don't you and Dongjun go left?

367
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,960
Ye Dingzhi and I'll go right.

368
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,540
Don't worry. Even in our current state there aren't many people who can defeat us.

369
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,000
I...

370
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,900
That's true.

371
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,820
Then...

372
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,320
All right.

373
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,180
Let's go.

374
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,480
We're off.

375
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,300
We should get going too. It's almost dawn.

376
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,980
Wait...

377
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,980
Why can't we all stick together?

378
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,640
Yin Luoxia seems fishy?

379
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,760
It's only a suspicion.

380
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:40,360
Before the exam I saw her at Penglai Pavilion.

381
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,300
At that time, she looked different.

382
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,580
But I think she's decided to take our side.

383
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,960
Ye Dingzhi. You knew the left path was the right way.

384
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,260
Why did you choose to go right?

385
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,680
Let me ask you.

386
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,180
By the time the people on the right path realize something's wrong,

387
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,680
will they be able to get to the left path in time?

388
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,260
I wouldn't count on it.

389
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,060
What about Yin Luoxia?

390
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,720
Why not let her take this path?

391
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
She betrayed her organization.

392
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,260
She might meet her end here.

393
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,640
I wouldn't have thought you were such a caring person.

394
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,400
Thanks for the compliment.

395
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,480
I'm handsome and kind.

396
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,100
I couldn't bear to let our savior die, that's all.

397
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:39,260
Right, since you're Lu Suzhen's disciple, why are you taking the exam?

398
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,740
I was asked to do so.

399
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,920
What about you?

400
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,680
Immovable Lord Technique. You must be the Rain Demon's disciple.

401
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,060
What? Not content with being number one in Nanjue?

402
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,640
No.

403
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,080
Wanted to see Tianqi's hidden talent and pay my respects to Mister Li.

404
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,720
Hidden talent?

405
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,140
It's more like brutally competitive, am I right?

406
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,020
How long does it usually take to get from here to Qinglong Gate?

407
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,840
An hour.

408
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,540
Then we'll keep him busy for an hour.

409
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,360
I wonder who will reach there first?

410
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,780
How will they decide on the disciple?

411
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,960
Are we going to fight?

412
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,760
Baili Dongjun, how long until we get there?

413
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,380
About an hour.

414
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,560
We're too slow.

415
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,860
 At this rate you'll fail your friend who risked his life for you.

416
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,420
The first one who gets there will be the disciple, okay?

417
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,420
You're being unfair.

418
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,800
When it comes to qinggong, I never lose.

419
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,780
Are you okay?

420
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,940
Damage from the Immovable Lord.

421
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,240
My internal strength is still recovering.

422
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,500
You expended all your internal strength just now.

423
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,080
But your meridians are still intact.

424
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,300
To have such strong meridians...

425
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,660
You're a natural martial artist too?

426
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,960
What are you talking about?

427
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,360
He's saying that you're a natural martial artist. Do you know what that means?

428
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,960
Why don't you... come with me?

429
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,280
Run.

430
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,160
Brother Wang.

431
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,860
Who are you people?

432
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,480
 She...

433
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,220
 He looks so familiar.

434
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,480
I...

435
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,220
We...

436
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,060
I'm sorry. Our servants tried to run away.

437
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,320
I'm here to reclaim them.

438
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,120
What kind of servants dress like this?

439
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,280
And what housekeeper has such strong martial arts skills?

440
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,540
Miss, I advise you not to ask too many questions.

441
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,640
You look tired. Why don't you take a rest?

442
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,840
Off you go.

443
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,660
What did you say?

444
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,860
I said, leave.

445
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,660
If you insist on saving him, I'll kill you.

446
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,580
We'll see about that.

447
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,020
That insignia.

448
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,940
You're a Shadow Sect member.

449
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,560
What is this place?

450
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,580
The lord's mansion.

451
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,000
Leave or die.

452
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,960
Good job, Senior. You scared him away.

453
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,380
No.

454
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,980
He's very strong. I'm not sure I would win.

455
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,540
What scared him away was your identity.

456
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,500
Junior, you're getting yourself into big trouble.

457
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,640
It's okay.

458
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,180
Senior, don't tell anyone about this.

459
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,880
All right.

460
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,440
Are they here yet?

461
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,440
- Master. 
 - Master.

462
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,940
We're here.

463
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,640
Those who came seeking to be my disciples used to be more decent and presentable.

464
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,220
Look at you two. Far worse.

465
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,540
They didn't have to deal with assassins.

466
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,240
Which one of you is going to be my disciple?

467
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,560
My name is Yin Luoxia.

468
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,720
It was due to their protection that I made it this far.

469
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,160
I'm lucky and don't deserve to be your disciple.

470
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,720
Miss Yin...

471
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,760
Baili Dongjun, this is where I leave you.

472
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,340
Farewell.

473
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,460
Would you be interested in becoming my disciple?

474
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,480
May I ask why, sir?

475
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,000
Because you're pretty and shrewd.

476
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,960
I only teach those with whom I have an affinity.

477
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,240
Why?

478
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,960
My skills belong to me.

479
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,540
So I decide who gets them.

480
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,640
How's that for a reason?

481
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:12,680
Besides, your style is quite compatible with mine, so there's that as well.

482
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,880
- But I... 
 - Isn't that great, Miss Yin?

483
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,740
Are you kidding me?

484
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,840
Liu Yue, are you really going to take a disciple?

485
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,120
As your senior, I haven't accepted any disciples yet.

486
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,960
By right, I should have a disciple first.

487
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,720
If you want, then get one.

488
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,640
But your wife will probably bury you alive in the Sword Heart Tomb.

489
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,260
If you're not willing, I won't force you.

490
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,720
No. It's not that I'm not willing.

491
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,240
Your generosity is much appreciated.

492
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
It's just that...

493
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,820
 I can't bring Baili Dongjun back right now.

494
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,620
 Perhaps I should join the Academy and plan my next move.

495
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,780
 I'm sorry, Young Master Liu Yue.

496
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,640
Greetings, Master.

497
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,840
That wasn't so hard was it?

498
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,700
Hey, Kid. What about you?

499
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,860
Me?

500
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,840
Not now. I'm waiting for someone.

501
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,200
Waiting for someone?

502
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:31,080
Wang Yixing is Lu Suzhen's disciple. He won't take me as his master.

503
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,580
I know that. But there's still Ye Dingzhi.

504
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,940
He'll be here any moment.

505
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,220
I've heard that name many times.

506
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,320
Ye Dingzhi, Ye Dingzhi...

507
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,740
He sounds really strong.

508
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,920
Stronger than me.

509
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,220
If I choose him, what will happen to you?

510
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,960
What will happen to me?

511
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,000
I'll get laughed at as I ride my horse back to Qiandong City.

512
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,540
Since you got here first I'll give you a chance.

513
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,760
Let me ask you.

514
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,740
If both of you were right in front of me, who should I choose?

515
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,460
You should choose us both.

516
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,760
- Why? 
 - Because we're both excellent candidates.

517
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,580
You'll regret it if you reject either of us.

518
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,120
Let me tell you something.

519
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,720
It's only when people miss out on me that there's regret.

520
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,280
I've never regretted rejecting anyone.

521
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,500
During the preliminary exam I made a jug of liquor.

522
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,300
Ye Dingzhi roasted a lamb leg.

523
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,560
- So? 
 - Don't you get it?

524
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,580
Meat and liquor. Isn't this the best pairing in the world?

525
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,500
That's true. That would be amazing indeed.

526
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,440
I'm the liquor and Ye Dingzhi is the meat.

527
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,240
Together, we'll be the best disciples you've ever had.

528
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,500
Good point. Fine, I'll wait here with you.

529
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:12,240
I have a feeling that your title as Eloquent Zhuomo will soon be stolen by Baili Dongjun.

530
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,760
Baili Dongjun, why do you wish to become my disciple?

531
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,640
Good question. Let me think.

532
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,640
You've only starting to think about this question now?

533
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,040
When I was young I promised someone we'd see the world together.

534
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,880
Besides this Academy, no one could challenge my father and grandfather.

535
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,040
Also, Xiao Ruofeng advised me to take you as my master,

536
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,480
telling me you're the best and how amazing and legendary you are.

537
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,073
So even before I came here

538
00:43:01,073 --> 00:43:05,600
I had thought of myself as the last disciple and not a candidate.

539
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:11,920
Now, if you ask me if I want to be your disciple,

540
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,980
I think... I'd say yes.

541
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,140
Despite not knowing me all that well?

542
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,000
I used to have a master.

543
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,400
He was the best I had ever seen.

544
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,240
Before he died, he told me to make a jug of Peach Blossom Moonfall

545
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,080
and hang it on the highest point of Tianqi City.

546
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:52,180
He also told me there was no one stronger than him, besides you, Mister Li.

547
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:58,860
So if I were to have another master, it could only be you

548
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,100
or else it would insult him.

549
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,820
Sounds like it's you who chose me, not the other way around.

550
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,300
That's right.

551
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,860
You won't regret training me.

552
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,520
- Why? 
 - Because one day, I'll be famous.

553
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,040
What do you mean by "famous"?

554
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,560
As famous as your father and your grandfather?

555
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,963
- No. 
 - As famous as the Eight Young Masters of Beili?

556
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,980
- No. 
 - Still, no?

557
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,140
How famous do you want to be?

558
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,060
As famous as me?

559
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,480
- Yes. 
 - I like your answer!

560
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:41,220
Whether Ye Dingzhi makes the cut or not, I'm definitely accepting you as my disciple.

561
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,700
All right.

562
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,700
My good disciple.

563
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,340
Liquor, please.

564
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,710
Delicious. Good liquor. Excellent disciple.

565
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,721

566
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:09,940

567
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:22,000

568
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:33,122
