00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:15,910

2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,800
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,840
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,866
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:57,500
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,820
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14

♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,220
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,600

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,720

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,450

23
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,540
Master.

25
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,660
- Thank you, Martial Uncle. 
 - Thank you.

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,900
It's rare to have everyone gathered.

27
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,040
It really is rare.

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,020
I'm gratified.

29
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,480
Wait.

30
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,760
Where's Baili Dongjun?

31
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,420
When I left he was still in his room.

32
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,530
But I told Sikong Changfeng that he should break down the door when the time comes.

33
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,460
A real man should stand by his word.

34
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,120
He proposed the challenge himself.

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,120
So even if the liquor isn't ready, he must carry him here to admit defeat.

36
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,820
Well said.

37
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,100
Actually, today is considered a significant day for Tianqi City.

38
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,080
Look. All these people are here to witness the elegance of the Eight Young Masters of Beili,

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,500
especially me, Young Master Zhuomo, right?

40
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,860
Do you think he can brew good liquor in such a short period of time?

41
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,100
To be honest, I don't want to doubt him. I think he can brew it well.

42
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,340
- But— 
 - Have some tea.

43
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,900
Thank you.

44
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,780
Have you ever tasted Qiulubai?

45
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,980
Baili Dongjun, can you make it?

46
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,940
Mister Xun. Miss Yueya.

47
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,987
Everyone, the liquor I'm using for today's competition is this jar of Qiulubai.

48
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:43,380

49
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,420
 Qiulubai?

50
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,060
It really is Qiulubai.

51
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,040
 Qiulubai?

52
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,520
The famous Qiulubai?

53
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,620
Where's Mister Li's disciple? Why isn't he here yet?

54
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,260
- Is he scared? Too afraid to show up? 
 - Keep your voice down.

55
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,200
The Eight Young Masters are upstairs. Don't let them hear you.

56
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,380
Send my message to the Academy.

57
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,750
If he doesn't show up within an hour, he loses by default.

58
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,100
We received a message from Diaolou Tavern.

59
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,740
If Senior Baili doesn't show up within an hour, he loses!

60
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,060
Baili Dongjun, can you do it?

61
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,360
- He's still not here? 
  - That's right.

62
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,380
 What's taking him so long?

63
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,340
Maybe he doesn't dare come.

64
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,420
 Exactly.

65
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,580
Still not here yet? That Baili Dongjun.

66
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,720
Here, have some tea.

67
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,160
 I'm ready.

68
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,240
Wait...

69
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,180
- Let's head out. 
 - Are you going to join a beauty contest?

70
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,538
Today is the day to make a name for myself in Tianqi.

71
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:18,300
In any case, I have to look good.

72
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,040
Where's the liquor?

73
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,660
 In broad daylight, are you daydreaming again?

74
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,020
 Are you daydreaming?

75
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,400
 Another dream about the brothel?

76
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,000
 I got it.

77
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,740
 What have you figured out?

78
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,660
 The autumn wind is merciless, revealing the night's chill.

79
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,280
 But the liquor I brew has sentiment.

80
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,620
 It's seeing stars in daylight, and remembering old friends.

81
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,700
 I finally understand.

82
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,060
- He's here. 
 - Here he comes.

83
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,320
Where?

84
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:01,000

85
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,360
- He's finally arrived. 
 - Yes!

86
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,460
- Baili Dongjun, is this your liquor? 
 - Is this your Qiulubai?

87
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,700

88
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,340
Since everyone's here, let the competition begin.

89
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,460
Mister Xun.

90
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,620
Miss Yueya.

91
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,700
Also, Little Master.

92
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,900
So the third taster is Old Seven.

93
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,070

94
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,520
Let's start with Qiulubai then.

95
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,900
I've been marching with the army for years.

96
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,140
It's been a long time since I've had this.

97
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,360
I miss it dearly.

98
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,140
So this is Qiulubai?

99
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,040
- As expected of Qiulubai. 
 - Yes.

100
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,800
The smell alone is intoxicating. I've never smelled anything this good.

101
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,780
 So this is the most famous liquor in Tianqi, Qiulubai.

102
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,060
 It truly lives up to its name.

103
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,540
You have a whole jar of liquor, but only serve three cups.

104
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,260
How about you give me the rest when you lose?

105
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,600
We'll see about that once you win.

106
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,700
Please taste it.

107
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,380
When the autumn dew is abundant, it's collected in jade pots,

108
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,080
and used to brew this liquor named Qiulubai.

109
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,200
Because it's so hard to gather the dew, even with thousands of people collecting it,

110
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,980
the amount produced is minimal.

111
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,900
So, this liquor can only be tasted one day each month.

112
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,720
Such a pity.

113
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,480
You're here for the challenge.

114
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,600
Can you stop drooling?

115
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,480
Well, it's not contradictory.

116
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,020
Compared to the last Qiulubai I tasted,

117
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,880
this is even richer.

118
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,580
Xiao Xie, you have certainly honed your brewing skills over the years.

119
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,000
This Qiulubai is nearly as good as the one I tasted from before.

120
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,680
Nearly as good?

121
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,060
I guess that's considered a compliment.

122
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,400
We all have our destinies, so why worry?

123
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,980
Just enjoy the liquor and the view from above.

124
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,600
This liquor is still excellent.

125
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,180
However, you now carry the worries of middle age, unlike the carefree days of your youth.

126
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:54,600
Most liquors have a single flavor, but Qiulubai offers three.

127
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:02,240
The warmth of spring, the passion of summer, and the melancholy of autumn.

128
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,340
Dongjun, how many flavors does your liquor have?

129
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,280
My liquor is from the heavens.

130
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,660
It carries no earthly flavors.

131
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,820
Is Junior's liquor truly that extraordinary?

132
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,260
That's an exaggeration, young man.

133
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,760
Serve your liquor.

134
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,480
All right.

135
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,640
Junior Niece, lend me your purple silk.

136
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,340
Here.

137
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,760
On a winter's snowy night, a beauty dancing with a sword.

138
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,060
The bright moon appears.

139
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,880
She moves toward the moon like an immortal ascending to the moon,

140
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,100
wandering freely in the celestial palace, roaming joyfully for thousands of miles until the break of dawn,

141
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,560
seeing stars in the daylight.

142
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,020
The Big Dipper.

143
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,380
This is the liquor I brewed, the Seven Starry Nights.

144
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:49,080
Dubhe, Merak, Phecda, Megrez, Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid. 
  (Name of the 7 stars in The Big Dipper)

145
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,340
Please, have a taste.

146
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,520
Seven Starry Nights?

147
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:03,140
Mister Xun, with your vast experience, have you ever had such a liquor?

148
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,180
Never.

149
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,520
If even Mister Xun hasn't tasted it, I'm quite eager to try it.

150
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,920
Please, go ahead.

151
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,100
Mister, please enjoy.

152
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,560
- What's it like? 
 - I wonder too.

153
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,480
Is he going to keep drinking?

154
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,260
Wonderful! What marvelous liquor!

155
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,560
How good is it?

156
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:23,940
It feels like I've returned to my youth, full of romantic dreams.

157
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,680
In those romantic settings,

158
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,960
I was filled with confidence and determination to achieve my ambitions!

159
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,560
Is it really that incredible?

160
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,740
This liquor...

161
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,340
You brought me to Tianqi and showed me the vastness of the world.

162
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,140
I have no way to repay your kindness.

163
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,700
The taste of your liquor is comparable to the other two.

164
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:09,080
But I've added something special for you.

165
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,340
Why is O-Old Seven's head steaming?

166
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,260
That's not steam, it's real energy.

167
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,840
Real energy is a form of energy.

168
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,920
Logically, it is supposed to be invisible and

169
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,900
we can only feel it when it's flowing in our bodies.

170
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,840
I've never heard of it being visible to the naked eye.

171
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,580
When Samadhi and real energy are complete, the heart refined through countless trials is now pure. 
  (TN: Samadhi - highest state of concentration)

172
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,140
Achieving such refined real energy where it's visible is very rare.

173
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,800
But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

174
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,580
It usually happens... when one breaks through a phase.

175
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,480
He's having a breakthrough?

176
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,580
Dongjun. Dongjun!

177
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,340
I've been stuck in that phase for ages with no method to advance.

178
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,040
Your liquor helped me with that.

179
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,040
Thank you.

180
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,060
Your Highness, please remain calm. Don't be mad.

181
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,940
So what if we can enjoy worldly pleasures?

182
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,080
It can't be compared to a moment in the celestial palace.

183
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,920
Master Xie, I didn't prepare much.

184
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,040
If you would like, please help yourself.

185
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,020
May I ask which master you learned from?

186
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,920
My master's surname is Gu.

187
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,980
I see. I see...

188
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,360
Have you reached a conclusion?

189
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,740
In this contest, Young Master Baili is the winner.

190
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,858
Excellent!

191
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:14,760
- Incredible! 
 - Awesome!

192
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,512
Impressive!

193
00:19:17,512 --> 00:19:20,232
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

194
00:19:20,232 --> 00:19:22,912
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

195
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:27,752
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

196
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:30,912
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

197
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:33,432
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

198
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:38,472
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

199
00:19:38,472 --> 00:19:40,580
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

200
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,786
Can I have the half-bottle of Qiulubai as promised?

201
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:45,303
You'll have it as you asked.

202
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:47,300
How generous of you!

203
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:50,552
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

204
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:53,232
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

205
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:57,524
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

206
00:19:57,524 --> 00:20:01,143
- It's truly a rare and exquisite liquor. A pleasure to drink. 
 - Hey!

207
00:20:01,143 --> 00:20:03,912
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

208
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:09,512
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

209
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,460
- Prepare to ascend the tower. 
 - All right.

210
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,640
Time for a farewell.

211
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,760
Who ordered you to do this?

212
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,040
Assassins! Protect His Highness!

213
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,100
Where did the assassins come from? How dare they!

214
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,180
How dare they set up an ambush at Diaolou Tavern?

215
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,460
Diaolou Tavern knew there was an important event today

216
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,620
but didn't take proper precautions, alarming His Highness.

217
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,960
Do you know your crime?

218
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,100
Xiao Ruofeng, you... How dare you!

219
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,920
The one who tried to kill someone from our Academy truly is presumptuous.

220
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,420
It seems I need to practice more.

221
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,380
Tianqi City is truly full of hidden talents.

222
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,620
This has been quite an eye-opener.

223
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,860
Time to leave. Let's leave these matters to my seniors.

224
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,800
Master is still waiting for me. Senior, farewell.

225
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,020
Master, I...

226
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,700
No need for farewells. Go ahead.

227
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,410
But I...

228
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,355

229
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,650
Someone came to report...

230
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,840
Useless.

231
00:23:08,652 --> 00:23:12,786

232
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,940
Master.

233
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,240
Winning is one thing, but how could you steal the tavern's specialty liquor?

234
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,380
I didn't steal it. I followed the rules and took it openly.

235
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,220
I didn't expect to leave Tianqi so soon.

236
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,020
There's no such thing as leaving. It's only embarking on a new journey.

237
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Enough talk. Get in the carriage. It's time to leave.

238
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,200
Are you really leaving tonight?

239
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,240
Why? Aren't you coming with us?

240
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,500
No, I'm staying. I came to Tianqi to retrieve something for someone.

241
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,700
Across the distant horizon we'll meet again.

242
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,800
All right.

243
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,660
Do you still have the liquor flask I gave you the last time we parted?

244
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,260
Of course.

245
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,860
How generous.

246
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,400
I have nothing else to give you. So I'll give you some Qiulubai.

247
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,500
Thank you.

248
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,880
We'll definitely meet again because when that time comes, I'll have made a name for myself across the world.

249
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,340
All right. So will I.

250
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,140
- Farewell. 
 - Farewell.

251
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,680
Come on, we have to go.

252
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,440
Little Spear Deity, see you!

253
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,000
Across the distant horizon, we'll meet again!

254
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,860

255
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,900
It's truly the scent of peach blossoms. Junior Niece, smell it.

256
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,500
Not bad.

257
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,700
Master, where's the highest place in Tianqi City?

258
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,900
The Royal Academy 32nd Division, Immortal's Guidance Pavilion.

259
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,320
All right, let's go there.

260
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,840
As you command, Little Disciple!

261
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,960

262
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,740
If Heaven didn't love liquor, the immortal wouldn't reside there.

263
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,600
If Earth didn't cherish liquor, there would be no spring of liquor on Earth.

264
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,300
Since both Heaven and Earth love liquor, it is fitting that liquor is revered.

265
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,340
The purest liquor surpasses even the divine, while the murkier ones are like wise men.

266
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,740
Since the sages and saints have partaken, they have become wandering immortals.

267
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,980
One walks the great path with a cup of liquor toasting to the land and mountains.

268
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:51,160
Yet, understanding the joys of liquor, it's difficult to explain to the sober ones.

269
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,060
Mister Li, this horse is so fast.

270
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,200
This is Fierce Wind.

271
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,160
My Fierce Wind? Impossible. My horse is red.

272
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,720
Master, your horse is white.

273
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,640
I painted it myself.

274
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,680
Master!

275
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,640
A white-clad, white-haired person on a white horse. That's the true appearance of an immortal.

276
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,340
I'm a fallen immortal, how can I bow to the mortal world?

277
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,400
Mister Li's demeanor is indeed as enchanting as ever.

278
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,560

279
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,900
Try this.

280
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,180
- Does it look good on me? 
 - Yes, it does.

281
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,900
- Are you tired? 
 - Not at all.

282
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,820
- Look at all this sweat. 
 - Thank you, my dear.

283
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,340
Yan Yan, slow down.

284
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,860
- Mother. 
 - What did you see?

285
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,660
Father. Soft candy. It looks delicious.

286
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,360
All right, do you want this one?

287
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,820
So...

288
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:46,900
this is Beili's... Tianqi City.

289
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:52,297
 A city of unparalleled glory and prosperity.

290
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:54,920
 The greatest city in the world.

291
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:05,800
I used to think it was just a city and leaving wouldn't matter much.

292
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,740
But now it seems there are still many places left to explore.

293
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,420
What do you think?

294
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,060
Junior Niece. Why... Why are you crying?

295
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,480
- I wasn't. 
 - If you really don't want to leave, I can come back with you.

296
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,820
That's right. We're not saying we won't return.

297
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:35,740
Next time we come back, I'll have the Emperor himself come out to greet you two.

298
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,080
Dongjun, we've arrived.

299
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,300
Look. That's the Immortal's Guidance Pavilion.

300
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:01,380
During major festivals, they hang the Xiao Family's divine bird flag.

301
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,100
The wind makes the flag flutter like it could tear through the sky.

302
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,160
That's the highest point in Tianqi City.

303
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,020
Wait for me here.

304
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,260
 Dongjun. Go to Tianqi City for me.

305
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:28,140
 Brew a jug of Peach Blossom Moonfall, and hang it at the highest place in Tianqi City.

306
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,040
 Master, I'm here.

307
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,635
 But it's also time for me to leave.

308
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,820
 I've never forgotten your wish.

309
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:44,030
♫  Because of you, the gratitude and grievances stir yet remain unsaid  ♫

310
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:49,839
♫  Longing, Longing for karma that won't come  ♫

311
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:52,339
♫  Balancing on a thin line,  ♫

312
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:54,860
♫  why am I afraid to close my eyes  ♫

313
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:00,540
Gu Chen, oh Gu Chen. You still remembered.

314
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,819
♫  By the window  ♫

315
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,140
Your Majesty.

316
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,820
- How is it? 
 - Mister Li took Marquis Zhenxi's only grandson, Baili Dongjun,

317
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:27,460
for a ride around Tianqi City, then they left the city.

318
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:37,200
- Anything else? 
 - The head of Shanjian Academy, Chen Ru, visited the Jixia Academy

319
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,300
and claimed to be the new chancellor.

320
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:46,080
Appointing officials is a matter of the court. How can someone appoint themselves an official?

321
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,940
What else?

322
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,980
Your Majesty, that's all.

323
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:05,260
Since he left, so be it.

324
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,660
What about Chen Ru?

325
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:12,440
Does the Court of Justice also handle appointments too?

326
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,180
No.

327
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,600
Just appoint him as the chancellor.

328
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,780
 Second Miss.

329
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,180
Where's my sister? Why didn't she come back with you?

330
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,780
She was delayed by something on the way back.

331
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:06,060
Lord Wuxiang said that you found a natural martial artist. But you released him.

332
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,020
Baili Dongjun is the young master of the Marquis of Zhenxi Mansion.

333
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:16,400
Capturing him was risky enough, but now he's become Mister Li's disciple.

334
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,380
- So... 
 - So his name is Baili Dongjun.

335
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,480
Why stop? Go on.

336
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,460
We found a more suitable candidate.

337
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,620
His name is Ye Dingzhi.

338
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,900
 You've been away from Nanjue for many years.

339
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:55,900
 A lot has happened. You're likely aware of it.

340
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:00,400
 Master, you were defeated by the female swordsman, Yan Lingxia.

341
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,800
 The title of the top martial artist in Nanjue has changed hands.

342
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,800
 Many people believed you were dead.

343
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,660
 Yet, you suddenly appeared in Tianqi City

344
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:17,800
 and publicly declared your whereabouts by challenging Mister Li.

345
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,000
You want to learn the Demon Deity Sword Techniques. I won't allow it.

346
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,600
When I couldn't defeat Li Changsheng, I studied the Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

347
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:33,700
Within a year my power increased by 60%, but I still couldn't defeat him.

348
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:44,800
If you want to surpass me don't follow my old path.

349
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,600
Master...

350
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,000
Swordsman, Lingyun.

351
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 That's me.

352
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,200
 It's said that after battling Yan Lingxia, your phase has plummeted.

353
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,600
 It was a devastating fall.

354
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,500
 So did you return because you're back to your former phase?

355
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:25,600
 Even if I've returned to my previous phase, it's merely to seek another defeat.

356
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,600
 I've long admired you.

357
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,800
 Today I, Lingyun, also wish to challenge you.

358
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
 If you win?

359
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,400
 I'll fight Yan Lingxia on your behalf

360
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,800
 and reclaim the title of Nanjue's top martial artist.

361
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
 If you lose?

362
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,300
 I'm prepared to die!

363
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,300
Let's go.

364
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,980
Disciple, did you learn that sword move from earlier?

365
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,080
I saw nine-tenths of it clearly.

366
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Not bad.

367
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,200
I've poured all my life's cultivation into thirteen sword strikes.

368
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,400
But we'll face many challengers like this on our journey.

369
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,700
Each time, I'll use only one strike.

370
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,900
You must observe them carefully.

371
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,700
Yes, Master.

372
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,800
Except for the final strike.

373
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,700
You're not allowed to watch that one.

374
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,300
Master, why did my master, the Scholarly Deity, ask me to brew that liquor

375
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,700
and hang it at the highest point in Tianqi City?

376
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,400
I never got a chance to ask him.

377
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
You should ask him yourself.

378
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,700
How would I know?

379
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,060
- You don't? 
 - Just kidding.

380
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,800
Of course, I know. Who am I?

381
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,600
Master.

382
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,500
It's something romantic.

383
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,900
Back then your master fell in love with a woman.

384
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:58,200
When they parted ways your master owed her a jar of Peach Blossom Moonfall.

385
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,800
If I hang it there will that woman see it?

386
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,400
Yes, because that woman is the owner of the Royal Academy 32nd Division.

387
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,200
Your master promised her that he would bring this jar of liquor

388
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,000
to her personally once it was brewed and also marry her.

389
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
But if he didn't come or if someone else hung the liquor on Immortal's Guidance Pavilion,

390
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,500
it would mean he's already dead and she should stop waiting for him.

391
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:35,800
She waited for many years hoping that one day your master would appear and marry her.

392
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,200
But as the years went by he never showed up.

393
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,600
Perhaps she waited too long and what she really wished was

394
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:50,000
that this liquor would never appear on that high pavilion.

395
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:57,200
Doesn't this mean she's found out that the man she loves is no longer alive?

396
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,700
It seems I have broken my master's wife's heart.

397
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,900
If she heard you address her like that she would be very pleased.

398
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,200
- It's you. 
 - Yes, it's me.

399
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,000
What brings you here? Seeing me off?

400
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Be careful. This person seems to have ill intentions.

401
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,200
Ji Ruofeng, you're more clever and stubborn than I imagined.

402
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,100
I want to know the truth.

403
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,300
So today I must find out here.

404
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,600
Perhaps you could simply tell me the answer, Sir.

405
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
I don't have the answer you want.

406
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
If you keep talking, I'll beat you up.

407
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Ji Ruofeng. You may have taught me martial arts for a few days. But gratitude is another issue.

408
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,600
If you insist on stopping us, don't blame me for being rude.

409
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,100
Who would dare get in Mister Li's way?

410
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:22,200
Unless Mister Li has lost his martial skills.

411
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,400
- What nonsense are you talking about? 
 - How so?

412
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,900
To understand, one must start with Mister Li's sudden departure from Tianqi City.

413
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,600
What's so strange about that?

414
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,000
Everyone knows I, Li Changsheng, act on impulse and do as I please.

415
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,400
If I want to leave, then I'll leave.

416
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,500
Is it really just a matter of impulse?

417
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,600
Mister Li, you once claimed to have traveled with the Poetry Deity and shook the heavens with your sword.

418
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,000
But the Poetry Deity has been dead for over a century.

419
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,300
Why are you still around?

420
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,900
There are still silly kids who believe that.

421
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,700
In the past hundred years, countless sword deities have emerged.

422
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,200
But why do you single out the Poetry Deity?

423
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,900
Was the Poetry Deity truly that legendary?

424
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,600
Or is Li Changsheng not legendary enough

425
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,600
and needs to fabricate some ethereal story to add a legend to his name?

426
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,500
If Li Changsheng and the Poetry Deity have a past and it's not a fabrication,

427
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,400
then how long has Li Changsheng truly lived?

428
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:27,000
Baixiao Hall investigated your experience after your sword made you famous. It only amounts to thirty years.

429
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,100
By this logic, the previous Li Changsheng must not have been the real one.

430
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,400
If you were to leave Tianqi today, Li Changsheng would likely cease to exist.

431
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,300
Is that true or not?

432
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,700
You are indeed more clever than I imagined.

433
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,000
Since you're leaving Tianqi there must be a reason why you can't stay.

434
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,400
So I'm guessing it's not that you don't want to keep being Li Changsheng,

435
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,800
but rather you cannot. Why not?

436
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,600
Because you've already lost your martial skills.

437
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,380
Mister Li, will you tell me the answer now?

438
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,800
Ji Ruofeng, I don't know if my master has truly lost his skills.

439
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,100
But you definitely have no tact.

440
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,300
I taught you the Autumn Water Technique.

441
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,300
- Are you confident you can beat me? 
 - Don't be too confident.

442
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,400
My master is Li Changsheng now.

443
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,800
Plus the Xichu's Sword Song was taught to me by the Scholarly Diety.

444
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,200
Aren't you worried about ruining your bright future here?

445
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,000
Chief Ji, you're joking. My bright future is sitting right behind me.

446
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,200
If I backed off, my future would indeed be ruined.

447
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,600
Junior, you never fail to come up with clever lines.

448
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,000

449
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,400

450
00:43:51,040 --> 00:44:01,060

451
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:12,300
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,500
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

474
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,880
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

475
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,000
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

476
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,400
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

477
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,800
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

478
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,300
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

479
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,700
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

480
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:10,000
♫  I met you  ♫
