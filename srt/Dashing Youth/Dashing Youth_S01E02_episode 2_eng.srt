♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,600

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,020

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,327

23
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,863
Turns out it's Young Master Zhuomo. Nice to meet you.

25
00:01:56,863 --> 00:02:00,803
As if. You're the Golden-Mouthed King Yan and I'm the Eloquent Zhuomo.

26
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:03,663
You don't talk much, while I can annoy everyone by just talking.

27
00:02:03,663 --> 00:02:06,543
We have nothing in common, so skip the pleasantries. Nice to meet me, huh?

28
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,483
Anyway, you can't defeat me even if you outnumber me.

29
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:13,903
So why don't we go our separate ways? I sincerely bid you farewell.

30
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:18,623
This is one of the Eight Young Masters you mentioned?

31
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:21,863
Yes, the Eloquent Zhuomo.

32
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:24,743
A chatterbox, indeed.

33
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:28,103
Gentlemen, I can hear you.

34
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:35,623
- Nice to... 
 - Don't start that again.

35
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:39,783
You say it's nice to meet me, but deep down, you think otherwise. Can't you be more sincere?

36
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:41,873
I know you must be thinking,

37
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:45,943
"Why am I so unlucky to run into the best young genius of the Lei Clan,

38
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:50,063
among the Eight Young Masters, the one who's most difficult to deal with, Young Master Zhuomo?"

39
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:51,943
Which is me.

40
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:54,143
It's either you forgot to check whether today is a lucky day,

41
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:56,303
or you forgot to make offerings for your late father to be blessed last year.

42
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:59,423
Everything that happens in this world is unpredictable.

43
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:03,543
Now that you've met me, it's your misfortune.

44
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:06,103
Shut your trap!

45
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:35,943

46
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:43,043
The Striking Touch of the Lei Clan is indeed powerful.

47
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:47,023
The Striking Touch consists of three moves.

48
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:50,223
That was called, "No Leaving."

49
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:57,043
The second move is "No Return."

50
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:03,523

51
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:11,903
Second Young Master, another person came.

52
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:17,003
Lei.

53
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:18,703
Him?

54
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:23,523
He sure does know how to find trouble.

55
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:28,063
I just told Su Muyu that I didn't want them to come.

56
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:33,623
Second Young Master, do we stand a chance?

57
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:39,143
Whether or not we stand a chance depends on...

58
00:04:40,923 --> 00:04:43,843
how determined we are.

59
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:57,343
Here's the third move, "Chanting Strike"!

60
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,063
- I have a question. 
 - What is it?

61
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:06,103
Do all martial artists give introductions as you fight?

62
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:26,623
Lei Mengsha. You're indeed impressive.

63
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:31,623
But you're alone, can you handle all of us if we join hands?

64
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,763
Who says he's on his own?

65
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:49,850

66
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:20,103
I'm Young Master Qingge, Luo Xuan.

67
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:23,623

68
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:26,110
Young Master Qingge, Luo Xuan?

69
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:30,063
Well, well. What brings you here?

70
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:33,023
Were you the only one allowed to come? I'm not welcome?

71
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:37,063
Young Master Qingge? The Young Master of Elegance among the Eight Young Masters.

72
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:41,983
His presence is said to be marked by an elegant tune or falling petals.

73
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:44,663
I used to think they were exaggerating.

74
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:47,913
But seeing him today, I can't believe there is such a—

75
00:06:47,913 --> 00:06:50,943
Such a pretentious person.

76
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:59,403
What are you waiting for? Run!

77
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:17,123
Going after them? You have to get past me first.

78
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:26,503
Wait. What is all this? Where are you taking us?

79
00:07:26,503 --> 00:07:29,823
Xiruo Temple is up ahead.

80
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,523
What do I call you?

81
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:37,423
Bai Dongjun.

82
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,303
Sikong Changfeng.

83
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:48,803
Why... do scouts nowadays give themselves such nice names?

84
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,903
Tell me. Have you gathered any news?

85
00:07:54,763 --> 00:07:57,223
What news?

86
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:02,323
Aren't you the scouts Old Seven sent to Chaisang City?

87
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:05,503
Tell me what you have found here.

88
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:08,683
 Liu Yue and Xiaohei are on another mission.

89
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:15,063
 Sneak into Chaisang City and you'll meet my scouts there.

90
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:29,383
Well, Brother Lei, there might be some misunderstanding.

91
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:34,003

92
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:41,403
So... you are truly out of your mind and want to make a name for yourself.

93
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:45,523
You stole a deed from your home and came all the way here

94
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:48,043
to run a tavern and sell your liquor?

95
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:52,363
To be more accurate, I'm a brewmaster.

96
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:59,463
And you just happened to be to be an orphaned wanderer in the martial world,

97
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:03,023
who happened to come to Chaisang City and because he gave you free liquor,

98
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:06,603
you became a freeloader who does menial tasks there?

99
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:09,683
You could put it that way.

100
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:12,603
Would you mind presenting it with a bit more tactful?

101
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:20,283
Oh, my. I must've lost my mind.

102
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:23,163
I thought both of you were sent by Old Seven to help me.

103
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,823
Instead, you're just... passersby.

104
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:27,503
Why did I waste my time

105
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:31,503
and the identity I worked so hard to disguise to save you?

106
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:33,263
I'm going crazy.

107
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:46,803
Well, Brother Lei, don't go crazy just yet. Don't be upset.

108
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:49,180
If you need any help, we can...

109
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:56,000
Help? With your smattering of martial art skills? How?

110
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:58,503
Someone's outside.

111
00:09:59,823 --> 00:10:01,263
What took you so long?

112
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:04,750
Did you get rusty after not fighting for awhile?

113
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:08,743
No one will think you're stupid if you shut up.

114
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,283
H-How can you talk to your senior like this, Old Six?

115
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:19,423
Tell me then. Why are you here?

116
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:21,663
Not just me.

117
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:46,643
Changhe?

118
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:50,503

119
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:07,743
What brings you here?

120
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:10,403
- I just swung by, so I— 
 - Changhe.

121
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:16,503
Your biggest problem is that you're too boring.

122
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,843
I'm not here to see you, I'm here for a show.

123
00:11:19,843 --> 00:11:22,463
- A show? 
 - Exactly.

124
00:11:23,463 --> 00:11:30,730
I sense a great show is coming to Chaisang City.

125
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,560
Maybe I will have the chance to meet those legendary talented boys.

126
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:47,383
Thanks.

127
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:54,903
So what's going on now?

128
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:57,983
What happened to Gu Jianmen? Isn't he getting married soon?

129
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,580
Why are you all so gloomy?

130
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,523
In the Xinan Circuit, there are two powerful noble families,

131
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:07,543
the Gu family, who runs the bank in Chaisang City,

132
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:10,623
and the Yan family, who owns the jade business in Kaiyang City.

133
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,763
Six months ago, Gu Luoli, the eldest young master of the Gu family,

134
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:17,983
died suddenly in Babie City, three hundred li from Chaisang City.

135
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:23,863
Since then, only two people have been capable of leading the Gu family.

136
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:29,783
Gu Luoli's youngest uncle, Fifth Master Gu, and Gu Luoli's younger brother,

137
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:34,163
who's also our third young master, Gu Jianmen.

138
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:37,343
Sikong Changfeng told me about all that.

139
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:42,123
H-H-He... We're in the middle of nowhere. Where did he get all those things?

140
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:48,003
No need to ask. He's just being pretentious.

141
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:57,323
Less than three days after Gu Luoli's passing,

142
00:12:57,323 --> 00:13:01,683
Fifth Master Gu used his identity as his uncle to arrange a marriage for him.

143
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:05,083
And the bride is the young lady of the Yan family, Yan Liuli.

144
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,103
She was the one who was in the carriage earlier today.

145
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:10,563
Her elder brother is the master of the Yan family.

146
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:15,623
The one you drank with in the tavern, Yan Bietian.

147
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:17,743
So this is how the marriage came to be.

148
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:21,483
In other words, the Gu's eldest young master didn't die naturally.

149
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:25,683
The Yan family and Fifth Master Gu joined hands to kill him

150
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:31,023
and use this marriage to control the Gu family who lost their master.

151
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:35,923
If that's the case, the Gu family will fall under the thumb of the Yan family.

152
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:39,823
How does this benefit Fifth Master Gu?

153
00:13:41,443 --> 00:13:44,063
What a surprise. What a surprise.

154
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:50,323
You actually have a profound understanding about the filthiness of human nature at such a young age.

155
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:51,703
That's right.

156
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:56,263
While Fifth Master Gu is regarded as an uncle in the Gu family, he has no real power.

157
00:13:56,263 --> 00:13:58,103
So he has been unhappy this whole time.

158
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:01,243
Once this plan succeeds and he becomes the master,

159
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:06,103
it doesn't matter if the Gu family falls from the top place in the Xinan Circuit.

160
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:08,223
No wonder this city is so strange.

161
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,679
That means the area around the Gu Mansion...

162
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:15,123
No, the entire Gu Mansion is already under the control of the Yan family.

163
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:18,563
Almost. Almost all of it has been controlled by the Yan family.

164
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:22,743
Up until Young Brother Bai appeared on Longshou Street.

165
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:28,563
That's why the Yan family finds you very suspicious.

166
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:33,143
Not at all. I came here on a whim. On a whim.

167
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:42,143
There's one more thing.

168
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:43,803
Go ahead.

169
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:46,623
Over there...

170
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:49,203
A female ghost is coming.

171
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:55,383
Someone saved them?

172
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:58,083
Yes. Pardon my incompetence.

173
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:02,543
You're not to blame.

174
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:05,903
Two out of the Eight Young Masters came.

175
00:15:05,903 --> 00:15:08,643
You're naturally no match for them.

176
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:20,143
Did you learn sarcasm from me?

177
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:21,923
Since you already know who she is, why do you mock her?

178
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:23,703
Who is she?

179
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,503
Miss Yan.

180
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:38,123
Young Master Qingge, Young Master Zhuomo, a pleasure to meet you both for the first time.

181
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:42,003
Actually, it's not the first time. We met you several times while escorting you this way.

182
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:45,683
You were the young lady in the carriage earlier today?

183
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:48,283
You're the owner of the tavern?

184
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:50,563
You're still alive?

185
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:53,583
I have great generosity, so I won't argue with you.

186
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:57,963
Old Seven told me he invited a key person over.

187
00:15:57,963 --> 00:16:00,083
I didn't expect it to be you.

188
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,303
Please have a seat.

189
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,083
I wonder what your intentions are, Miss Yan?

190
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,823
You allowed your men to attack us today.

191
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:18,163
And now you come to meet us secretly?

192
00:16:18,163 --> 00:16:20,023
Good question.

193
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:23,103
Because...

194
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,803
I love him.

195
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:30,843
Who do you love?

196
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:36,083
Oh, my Heavens. That's news.

197
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,583
You truly are in love with Gu Jianmen.

198
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:44,463
So your family killed Gu Luoli to allow your marriage with Gu Jianmen.

199
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,803
Are you crazy? Or is the entire Yan family crazy?

200
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:51,443
I think you're the crazy one. Will you shut up?

201
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:56,335
The man you love is the Gu's eldest young master who died earlier,

202
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:58,183
Gu Luoli, right?

203
00:17:04,243 --> 00:17:06,623
Looks like I'm right.

204
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:11,183
Yes. I love Gu Luoli.

205
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:12,723
But no one knows.

206
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:17,343
My brother wants to use my marriage to control the entire Gu family.

207
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:21,683
He killed my beloved and wants to use me as a pawn in his scheme.

208
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:26,463
So you entered this situation intentionally to destroy it?

209
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:33,863
Yes. On the wedding day, I will not marry Gu Jianmen.

210
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:38,343
The man I want to marry can only be Gu Luoli.

211
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:42,183
No offense, but he's dead.

212
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:48,843
So what? I still love him.

213
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:53,103
Miss Yan, what do you need us to do?

214
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,443
Kidnap me during the wedding.

215
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:56,663
 Kidnap you during the wedding?

216
00:17:56,663 --> 00:18:01,283
Your friends will soon go and seize something very important.

217
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:04,083
Bring that thing to kidnap me.

218
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,443
Then prepare yourselves to kill.

219
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:12,923
By the way, you need to remember this.

220
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:17,910
The mastermind was never my brother,

221
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:22,300
but... me.

222
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:28,743
To be honest, that's a bit scary.

223
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:31,023
Do you expect a resentful woman to act normally?

224
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:32,743
Oh, right.

225
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:38,863
My intuition is that behind my brother, there's another force.

226
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:43,463
It's a much stronger force.

227
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:47,943

228
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:51,303
What? You want to kidnap the bride?

229
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:55,483
Brother Lei, you went to look for a suitable candidate yesterday, didn't you?

230
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:59,403
Everyone knows the Eight Young Masters of Beili, so it's hard for you to show yourselves.

231
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:04,483
As for the other candidates, only a few are capable and willing to help.

232
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:08,423
Besides, it's not good to get innocent people involved.

233
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:11,403
If that's the case, let me try.

234
00:19:11,403 --> 00:19:14,043
- Sir... 
 - Why?

235
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:18,583
I did think about seeking your help before.

236
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,503
I even had reasons ready to convince you.

237
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:27,603
Nevertheless, as you said, I haven't yet decided to get innocent people involved.

238
00:19:27,603 --> 00:19:31,983
Whether I want to be involved or not, I’m already part of the game.

239
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:34,643
I want to hear your real thoughts.

240
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:37,143
To become famous all over the world.

241
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,263
Wh-What?

242
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:43,103
I want to become famous all over the world.

243
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:49,280

244
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:17,403

245
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:37,323
Mister Gu, you have a guest.

246
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:39,643
Would you like to invite me in?

247
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:41,363
Sure.

248
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:11,783

249
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:22,863
♫  The cold breeze dies down  ♫

250
00:21:22,863 --> 00:21:28,003
♫  Swallows and sparrows weave through the dense forest  ♫

251
00:21:29,203 --> 00:21:31,363
♫  The mists covers my vision  ♫

252
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:37,263
♫  As if I haven't awaken from a dream yet  ♫

253
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:40,503
♫  There are truly countless beautiful scenes  ♫

254
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:43,183
♫  Traveling alone is simply about looking at the vast sea  ♫

255
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:46,383
♫  To the ever-changing world  ♫

256
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:48,543
♫  Until a single red leaf  ♫

257
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:50,663
♫  Embraces the passing years  ♫

258
00:21:50,663 --> 00:21:54,583
♫  Only then can one appreciate the beauty of seasons  ♫

259
00:21:55,483 --> 00:21:59,023
Friends who play the zither should greet each other through music.

260
00:21:59,023 --> 00:22:00,743
What do you think, Sir?

261
00:22:00,743 --> 00:22:02,824
She's a fairy.

262
00:22:10,723 --> 00:22:13,363
I thought it was just a guest.

263
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:17,943
To my surprise, it's a guest from Tian Wai Tian.

264
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:20,506
Sir, you recognize me?

265
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,646
You have the same eyes as your mother.

266
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:31,066
Turns out you're my mother's acquaintance.

267
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:35,386
Then Sir, please offer some help to Beique.

268
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:39,006
I know why you came.

269
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:41,426
However, I have retired from worldly affairs.

270
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,766
Please leave.

271
00:22:52,306 --> 00:22:54,926
The fairy is looking at me.

272
00:22:56,586 --> 00:23:00,686
Disciple, wake up.

273
00:23:02,306 --> 00:23:05,846
I felt intoxicated by her eyes.

274
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:10,506
Silly boy... You're embarrassing me.

275
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:18,066
Miss Fairy, w-what's your name?

276
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:20,366
Perhaps you should answer me first.

277
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,866
What's your name?

278
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:27,626
I'm Dongjun.

279
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:30,046
Dongjun?

280
00:23:30,046 --> 00:23:33,306
The Lord of the East  (Dongjun)  wears a jade pendant that sounds like coral.

281
00:23:33,306 --> 00:23:36,666
When the time comes, he brushes against the tips of willow trees.

282
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,626
Confidence that Penglai  (paradise)  isn't far off.

283
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:44,146
The spring breeze has yet to arrive in the mortal world.

284
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:45,946
This is a great name.

285
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:48,526
"The Lord of the East wears a jade pendant that sounds like coral."

286
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:52,106
"When the time comes, he brushes against the tips of willow trees."

287
00:23:57,226 --> 00:24:00,386
Miss Fairy! Are you leaving?

288
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:04,626
You haven't told me your name yet. How do I find you in the future?

289
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:15,366
Perhaps I'll come to you one day.

290
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:22,146
When you become famous all over the world, and everyone knows where you are,

291
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:24,106
I will come to you.

292
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,766
Boys will be boys.

293
00:24:56,306 --> 00:24:57,770
Are you mocking me?

294
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,380
No.

295
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:05,066
I'm praising you.

296
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:10,106
Is he being sarcastic?

297
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,746
He's insane.

298
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:18,086
Why do you think you'll become famous after kidnapping the bride?

299
00:25:18,086 --> 00:25:20,046
Because this isn't an ordinary marriage.

300
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:26,046
As Miss Yan said, this marriage is an ascension ceremony in the Xinan Circuit.

301
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:27,961
Since I've already offended the Yan family,

302
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:31,306
serving my liquor at the wedding to make my name surely won't work.

303
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:35,486
I might as well go all out and openly interrupt this marriage.

304
00:25:35,486 --> 00:25:41,486
By then, all the guests will watch me descend like a heavenly warrior

305
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:44,826
and be impressed by my gallantry.

306
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:47,806
Sir, you're going overboard.

307
00:25:48,886 --> 00:25:52,406
Turns out you're doing this for a lady.

308
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:56,806
- So what? 
 - Haven't you thought that she might be angry

309
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,986
when she finds out you kidnapped someone else's bride?

310
00:25:59,986 --> 00:26:03,106
What's there to fear? The Eight Young Masters will be my witnesses.

311
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:04,986
Aren't you all going?

312
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:07,806
I'm doing this out of loyalty.

313
00:26:10,406 --> 00:26:11,986
You are going, right?

314
00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:16,066
Aren't they going? They should be, right?

315
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:21,046
 Come see the flowers.

316
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,580
 - Freshly picked today! 
 - Let's try the new dishes.

317
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:33,586
Miss, it's me.

318
00:26:33,586 --> 00:26:35,146
Come in.

319
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:39,826
- Miss. 
 - What have you found?

320
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:42,226
The Yan family has agreed to our request.

321
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:46,366
To show their sincerity they will deliver that thing to the agreed-upon place.

322
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:49,826
With that thing, once we put the Yan family in power,

323
00:26:49,826 --> 00:26:53,286
the Xinan Circuit will be completely under our control.

324
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:08,186

325
00:27:35,106 --> 00:27:36,686
Move aside!

326
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:38,386
I won't.

327
00:27:49,026 --> 00:27:51,346

328
00:27:51,346 --> 00:27:52,786
State your name!

329
00:27:52,786 --> 00:27:55,526
Do you know I'm from the Yan family of the Xinan Circuit?

330
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:58,806
Have you thought about how you'll end up if you offend us?

331
00:27:58,806 --> 00:28:02,946
What a coincidence. We happen to be looking for the Yan family.

332
00:28:02,946 --> 00:28:07,226
Tell them to leave that thing here and I'll spare their lives.

333
00:28:07,226 --> 00:28:08,786
Did you hear that?

334
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:13,606
My young master said the Yan family of Xinan Circuit is nothing.

335
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:16,966
Leave what's in the carriage here and you'll be spared.

336
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:19,806
I didn't say the first half.

337
00:28:19,806 --> 00:28:22,266
Young Master, I know that's what you wanted to say.

338
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:25,986
Such audacity! Who is he?

339
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:29,606
- My young master— 
 - Don't waste your breath on them.

340
00:28:29,606 --> 00:28:33,786
Go, beat them up.

341
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:36,486
Young Master, let me finish.

342
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:40,426
Did you hear that? My young master asked me not to waste my breath on you

343
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:42,486
and to beat you all up.

344
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:46,206
How dare you!

345
00:28:53,646 --> 00:28:55,446
Make way.

346
00:29:05,926 --> 00:29:07,646
Young Master!

347
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,286
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

348
00:29:22,286 --> 00:29:23,746
 A servant with a lantern, accompanied by beauties.

349
00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:25,686
 Murdering and burning while wearing a gold belt.

350
00:29:25,686 --> 00:29:28,026
 You're Liu Yue, one of the Eight Young Masters!

351
00:29:28,026 --> 00:29:30,106
 Word has it that you're peerlessly handsome.

352
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:32,526
And that's why you don't like others seeing your face,

353
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:36,466
and you always travel in a sedan chair to avoid showing your appearance.

354
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:38,866
I see that's true today.

355
00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:41,786
Young Master, what now? They've recognized you.

356
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:44,326
I have told you there's no need to use the sedan chair.

357
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:45,906
It's too obvious.

358
00:29:45,906 --> 00:29:51,286
I didn’t mean for anyone to recognize me, but they figured it out immediately.

359
00:29:51,286 --> 00:29:55,866
It seems... I am famous.

360
00:29:56,946 --> 00:29:58,786
True though.

361
00:29:58,786 --> 00:30:04,626
Exactly. We are the renowned Peerlessly Handsome Young Master Liu Yue on the Young Master Rankings.

362
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:07,306
It's me, not us.

363
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:12,806

364
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:16,506
Then let me see how skilled you are as one of the Eight Young Masters.

365
00:31:01,846 --> 00:31:05,866
Fell with a single blow. Just a singe blow.

366
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:08,246
Still not coming to help?

367
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:31,106
- This is a beautiful sword. 
 - Is it?

368
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:35,266
Can it match the peerless Young Master Liu Yue?

369
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:38,986
A human isn't a weapon. They shouldn't be compared with each other.

370
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:48,386
May I ask the name of the sword's owner?

371
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:50,686
White-Haired Deity.

372
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:54,646
What an interesting name.

373
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:58,166
My sword is renowned for its beauty.

374
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:03,646
If this beautiful sword can slay the famous Young Master Liu Yue...

375
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:09,266
wouldn't that be interesting?

376
00:32:14,806 --> 00:32:16,646
Do you have the confidence to kill me?

377
00:32:16,646 --> 00:32:21,006
It's tricky. But I want to give it a try.

378
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:27,066
Many people have wanted to try, but I'm still sitting here.

379
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:29,046
Is that so?

380
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:38,766
Young Master, more people have appeared.

381
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:42,326
I sense them. I underestimated the enemy.

382
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:47,526
Before killing you, I wonder if I could make a request.

383
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,366
Say it.

384
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:54,646
I want to see your face.

385
00:33:23,946 --> 00:33:28,706
Everyone sees fairness as beautiful, yet he’s all in black.

386
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:34,406
Everyone admires beautiful things, but he prefers the opposite.

387
00:33:34,406 --> 00:33:41,226
You're... Young Master Mochen, Mo Xiaohei.

388
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:44,786

389
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:51,486
Let me ask you, do you think the kidnapping mission is dangerous?

390
00:33:51,486 --> 00:33:52,946
Of course, it's dangerous.

391
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:55,806
If you ask me you shouldn't have gotten involved in this.

392
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:57,326
So, that's a yes.

393
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:01,046
I need to prepare in case things turn out badly.

394
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:05,086
Miss Yan seems to be quite a beauty.

395
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,846
She really can't compare to Miss Fairy?

396
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:08,846
I'm a faithful man.

397
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,786
Do you know what true love is? Do you have someone you like?

398
00:34:12,786 --> 00:34:14,566
Me?

399
00:34:15,046 --> 00:34:17,606
- I'm not into romance. 
 - What!

400
00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:20,806
What do you mean by "what"?

401
00:34:21,446 --> 00:34:23,246
Are you all right?

402
00:34:23,246 --> 00:34:25,006
What are you doing?

403
00:34:25,006 --> 00:34:27,426
What's the matter?

404
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:28,966
Why are you running?

405
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,886
Something's wrong with you.

406
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:33,466
I'm just saying that I don't like romance.

407
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:36,006
It reminds me of my master. It's not freeing at all.

408
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,280
Your master?

409
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,640
Yes, my master.

410
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:44,146
He passed down this Silver-Moon Spear to me.

411
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,000
All right, fine, he wasn't considered my master.

412
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,600
When I met him he was dying, his body covered in sores,

413
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,400
lying in an abandoned Taoist temple waiting to die.

414
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,500
He was Lin Jiu, who wielded the Chasing Ruins Spear, yet he ended up in such a pitiful state.

415
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,700
I saved him and he taught me spear techniques for five days.

416
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,000
- Then what happened? 
 - He passed after five days.

417
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Before he died, he asked me to bring his ashes back to his hometown.

418
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,300
He told me that a woman he deeply loved once lived there.

419
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,000
Every morning that woman would brush her hair by the lake.

420
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
He was a poor man then, and she was the town’s beauty.

421
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,300
So, he decided to roam the Martial World with his spear.

422
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,400
However, it was thirty years since he left.

423
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Thirty years? She must have married someone else, right?

424
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,200
Three years after he left, she married someone else.

425
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,700
She probably wouldn't remember the young lad

426
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,800
who woke up early each day to practice his spear and watch her brush her hair.

427
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,000
Your master was a great man.

428
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,800
Was he?

429
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,100
Perhaps.

430
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,900
Look, this is what the Martial World is.

431
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,700
So-called romance is simply useless.

432
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,500
Life is tough and short. Why torture ourselves?

433
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,300
Sikong Changfeng, you claim to be a wanderer

434
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,700
who roams the Martial World with a spear and a pot of wine.

435
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,100
May I know exactly which Martial World you're roaming?

436
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,700
Rivers and lakes? 
  (TN: Literal translation of Martial World)

437
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,500
That can only be called swimming.

438
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,400
How can you call it "roaming"?

439
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,600
So you're talking about the martial world with people in it.

440
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,000
Exactly. Since there are people, there will also be all kinds of feelings,

441
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,800
including affection and love.

442
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,300
It’s affection, righteousness, heroes, and beauties that make the Martial World vibrant.

443
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,700
You sure have a way with words.

444
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,200
You said you were dying before. What did you mean?

445
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,300
I only have memories from after turning 15.

446
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,100
I can't remember anything that happened before that time.

447
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,700
However, after I started practicing the spear and gained some martial skills,

448
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,700
I realized that my heart meridian had long been severely damaged.

449
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,500
I don't have much time left.

450
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,900
Bai Dongjun, how about I kidnap the bride on your behalf?

451
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,800
You can still change your mind.

452
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,400
No.

453
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:24,181
I want to do it myself.

454
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,200
Is becoming famous that important?

455
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,300
Why did she ask you to become famous?

456
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,500
About this... I'm not sure.

457
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,700
Perhaps she could tell that I would become famous from my face,

458
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,400
or maybe I was born with an exceptional physique

459
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,100
and will become a rare and peerless martial artist.

460
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,700
Yes, that's it.

461

Looking down on me?

464
00:37:58,683 --> 00:38:00,483
Sikong Changfeng.

What is it?

466
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,200
Don't worry. I won't die. Neither will you.

467
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
I know a skilled physician.

468

I'll take you there after we ruin this marriage.

Wait for me.

476
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,900
Although the story you told me inspired me.

477
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,900
It makes me even more certain that I'm doing the right thing.

00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,300
 Otherwise, my beloved might also get married soon.

480
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,800
Yuji.

481
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,400
Qixuan, how was it?

482
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,000
We lost it. I don't know what Liu Yue's background is.

483
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,300
Not only him, but Mo Xiaohei, who doesn’t get along with him, was also there.

484
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,650
- Did you... 
 - I retreated in time. I'm fine.

485
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,400
But that thing...

486
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:31,943
They won't get far with it.

487
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,800
Let's head back to Chaisang City and get ready in advance.

488
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:44,000
All right. I wonder what he wants it for.

489
00:39:48,383 --> 00:39:50,423
What do you make of it?

490
00:39:50,423 --> 00:39:53,763
Very good, very good.

491
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,600
What's very good?

492
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,400
You came. That's good.

493
00:40:01,343 --> 00:40:05,503
Before I came, Old Seven didn't tell me I was sent to save you.

494
00:40:06,623 --> 00:40:12,463
This is called predestined fate.

495
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,350

496
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,400
Let's go. That man wasn't from Xinan Circuit.

497
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,400
It seems there's another force backing the Yan family.

498
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,800
The most beautiful young master and the ugliest young master in the world.

499
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,500
What an interesting collaboration.

500
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,720

501
00:41:02,683 --> 00:41:05,403
It seems they're getting impatient.

502
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:07,903
Second Young Master.

503
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:10,403
Can I wear a white robe tomorrow?

504
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,150
I'm afraid... it's not allowed.

505
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,600
At the wedding, you should at least wear a red robe.

506
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
White robes are only meant for funerals.

507
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:36,943
But who can say whether it's a wedding or a funeral tomorrow?

508
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,200

509
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,600

510
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:54,040

511
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:05,800
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

512
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:13,600
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

513
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:24,100
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

514
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:31,500
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

515
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,600
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

516
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,900
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

517
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,200
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

518
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,700
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

519
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,200
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

520
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,300
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

521
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,800
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

522
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,200
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

523
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,700
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

524
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,000
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

525
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,600
♫  I met you  ♫

526
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:56,800
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

527
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:04,600
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

528
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:15,100
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

529

♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

531

♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

532
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,500

♫  I met you  ♫
