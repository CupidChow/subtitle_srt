If one day,

you really enter the Academy,

37
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,500
you'll have to call me Senior Brother.

38
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,940
I will take care

of your studies and your behavior.

By then,

00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,100
you can't just ignore me

42
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,860
like you do now.

43
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,300
It's not that I ignore you.

44
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,220
I'm just a little worried.

45
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,580
I'm worried that you'll think

46
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,420
I'm still holding a grudge
against you.

47
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,540
So...

48
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,460
I felt a little awkward.

Okay, tell me

53
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,740
why you think

54
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,100
I would think you hold a grudge
against me.

55
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,020
Because you showed up

56
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,180
and then my master died.

57
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,380
That's a fact.

58
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,100
But those are two different things.

59
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,420
These two things seem

60
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,660
to be related,

61
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,460

if I hadn't been

63
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,820

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,260

67
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,940
Then my master wouldn't be dead.

68
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,460

69
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,380
that the one
who caused my master's death

70
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,020
was me.

that the White Feather Sword Deity

173

once came to Tianqi

174
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,780
to save his disciple

to stop him.

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,580
Second Senior,

193
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,820
take Dongjun back to the Academy.

194
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,300
I'm going into the palace first.

195
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,660
Let's go.

196
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
The roads in Tianqi City

197
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,100
are still as wide as ever.

198
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,380
It's much bigger than Qiandong City.

199
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,940
It's perfect for a trip.

200
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,980
Indeed.

201
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,060
Back in the day,

202
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,340
Gu Jianmen and I used

203
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,260
to travel side by side in Tianqi City.

204
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,820
Now he's tied up in Gu Family's affairs

205
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,580
in Xinan Circuit.

206
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:20,980
Since you're interested

207
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,220
in exploring this place,

208
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,100
I'll return to the Academy first.

209
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,140
Young Lady, Second Young Lady.

210
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,660
Yueyao.

211
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
[Yueqing, Sky's Beyond]
There are freshly sliced beef, mutton,

212
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,940
fish slices as thin as a cicada's wing,

213
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,660
and mushrooms only produced in Nanjue.

214
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,220
What do you think?

215
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,380
What's good to eat first?

216
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,740
I know

217
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,980
you're the best to me.

218
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,620
Knowing that you miss having hot pot,

219
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,980
Young Lady warmed up the pot
and cooked the meat

220
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,740
early in the morning.

221
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,500
That's for sure.

222
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,660
She's my sister.

223
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,740
Eat slowly.

224
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,220
There's a lot of good food.

225
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,580
I went to a lot of fun places

226
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,780
this time

227
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,860
and brought back a lot of new things.

228
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,820
I've got rice cake from Jiangnan

229
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,540
and sausages from Shuofeng.

230
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,420
You can have anything you want.

231
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,020
Yueyao, I want to eat them all.

232
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,380
Did you guys have any fun

233
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,860
on your trip to Chaisang?

234
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,980
I've heard it's a very prosperous place

235
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,580
with a lot of good liquor.

236
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,500
Yueyao, did you bring some back?

237
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,340
Qing, since when did you

238
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,940
start enjoying drinking?

239
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,100
The trip

240
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,300
was so rushed

241
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,740
that I forgot to bring some back.

242
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,460
It's okay. You can go again next time.

243
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,500
Young Lady.

244
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,060
Young Lady, Second Young Lady.

245
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,340
It's you, Mo Qixuan.

246
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Sit down and eat with us.

247
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,180
Let's talk outside.

248
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,980
What's the matter?

249
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,380
Baili Dongjun has arrived at Tianqi.

250
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,620
Tianqi?

251
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,580
Now, at this time of year,

252
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,620
he is going to...

253
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,460
Yes.

254
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,260
To sit the examination of the Academy.

255
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,460
Xin,

256
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,140
what is it

257
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,740
that they need to go out and talk about?

258
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,260
Did you encounter any problems

259
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,540
on your trip?

260
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,740
Yueyao seems to have a lot on her mind.

261
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,740
Young Lady...

262
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,500
Xin,

263
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,380
get me another plate

264
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,380
of mutton later.

265
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,540
That meat is delicious.

266
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,020
And the mushrooms, too.

267
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,620
I got it.

268
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,740
What did you say about Yueyao?

269
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,780
Nothing.

270
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,140
Just enjoy your food.

271
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,100
Your sister

272
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
is just fine.

273
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,980
Young Lady, there's no time
for hesitation.

274
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,260
If he really enters the Academy...

275
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,540
If he really enters the Academy...

276
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,740
and has Mr. Li's protection,

277
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,900
Beique...

278
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,260
won't have a chance anymore.

279
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,500

280
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,860
are you leaving?

281
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,140
You haven't told me your name.

282
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,860

The first thing to do in Tianqi,

296
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,620
it's to go to Diaolou Tavern.

297
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,420
Who's it?

298
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,860
How dare you attack me from behind?

You said you'd like
to have some Qiulubai

300

from Diaolou Tavern,

301
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,220
but do you still want it now?

Chancellor of Jixia Academy]

304

Yes.

305
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,620
I won't let you have it.

306
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,100
You...

307
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,340
You're only a little over halfway
through Tianqi City,

308
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,580
but there's more to go.

309
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,620
That's all for today.

310
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,220
The rest of the way,

311
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,580
we'll wait until you can get out

312
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,180
of this place.

313
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,220
Who are you?

314
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,860
You have got a lot of guts
and are arrogant.

315
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,860
But you don't deserve to be like this.

316
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,860
It's a little early for you
to explore Tianqi City

317
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,380
in one go.

318
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,820
This asparagus is also tasty.

319
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,580
I'll get you some more later.

320
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,060
Yueyao, come on.

321
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,220
I've almost finished it.

322
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,260
The mutton is delicious.

323
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,100
Have more.

324
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:54,740
I'll have Xin

325
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,700
get another plate later.

327
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,340
What's it?

00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,860
Well,

329
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,420
I'm going to Tianqi City in Beili.

330

Please cover up for me in Sky's Beyond

331
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,780
and keep it from Lord Wuxiang.

332
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,860
What?

333
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,780
You've just come back
and you're leaving again.

334
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,820
I knew

335
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,420
Mo Qixuan's visit would be bad.

336
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,860
I'll beat him up

337
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,700

339
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,820
Be good.

340
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,580
I'm not listening.

341
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,580
I'll pretend I'm deaf today.

342
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,460
I can't hear anything.

343
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,540
I just want to eat.

344
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,220
Do me a favor,

345
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,940
will you?

346
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,260

347
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,020
when I'm done,

348
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,860
Beique will be restored

349
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,260
and Father will be released.

350
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,980
Don't you miss Father?

351
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,260
But I miss you more.

352
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,260
I'm always alone

353
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,980
in Sky's Beyond.

354
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,460
I don't even have anyone to talk to.

355
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,580
This time,

356
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,580
I'll leave Xin with you,

357
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,700
okay?

358
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,060

360
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,740
Go.

361
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,100
Come back soon.

363
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,580
Promise me

364
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,580
you'll come back sooner.

365
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,420
Don't make me

366
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,860
wait so long.

367
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,460
Okay, I promise.

368
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,140
You're awake?

369
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,980
Take it easy.

370
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,980
You've slept

371
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,100
the whole day away.

372
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,140
Why are you here?

373
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,500
I remember

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,380
being knocked out

375
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,540
by an old man.

376
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
An old man?

377
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,340
Well.

378
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,660
You sound

379
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,620
a bit like

380
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,860
the rest of us.

381
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,980
No wonder Ruofeng has his eye on you.

382
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,980
What are you talking about?

383
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,340
What is this place?

384
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,380
Who's the old man who knocked me out?

385
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,620
Here is the Jixia Academy.

386
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,900
The one who can knock you out

387
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,500
is naturally Mr. Li from the Academy.

388
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,140
No.

389
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,380
If you're lucky,

390
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,380
he'll be your master.

391
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,900
That's the famous

392
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Mr. Li of the Academy?

393
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,420
He's the world's best martial artist,

394
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,740
yet he even launched a sneak attack?

395
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,780
He loves to joke.

396
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,180
All right.

397
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:04,980
It's

398
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,740
your first day at the Academy.

399
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,500
I'll show you around.

400
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:06,940
Let's go.

401
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,900
To meet that old man?

402
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,660
I mean, teacher.

403
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,180
Take it easy.

404
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,900
I like it when you call him the old man.

405
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,500
Anyway,

406
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,740
you can't just meet the old man

407
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,940
when you want to.

408
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,540
Not to mention you,

409
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,180
if the old man

410
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,180
doesn't want to see us,

411
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,500
it's useless for us

412
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,180
to beg him.

413
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,020
But if he wants to see us,

414
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,740
he'll easily find us

415
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,340
even if we go to Nanjue.

416
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,740
Fine, I can't make it clear.

417
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,580
Let's go now.

418
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,260
Don't dilly-dally.

419
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,060
Who's dilly-dallying?

420
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,060
Wait for me.

421
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,420
It's getting late.

422
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,300
Why don't we have dinner?

423
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,420
Let's go to Diaolou Tavern.

424
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,180
It's on me.

425
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,260
No matter what...

426
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:48,980
Senior Lei.

427
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,740
Oh, right.

428
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,700
Listen carefully.

429
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,420
You're not allowed

430
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,260
to leave the Academy
for the next few days.

431
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,260
Just stay

432
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,020
right here.

433
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,020
Why?

434
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Don't ask so many questions.

435
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,020
This is for your own good.

436
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,260
For a man of your status,

437
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,940
you've got a lot of eyes on you.

438
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,940
Besides, you're not a student

439
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,740
of the Academy yet.

440
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,740
Just behave yourself.

441
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,260
I'm not a student of the Academy yet?

442
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,700
But didn't you all tell me

443
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,500
I'm Mr. Li's

444
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,340
last disciple?

445
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,500
Kid,

446
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,300
who gave you such courage

447
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,660
and confidence?

448
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,020
You're just

449
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,220
an alternative found by Ruofeng.

450
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,740
- Senior Lei.
- Senior Lei.

451
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,020
By the way,

452
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,220
yesterday,

453
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,260
the biggest gambling house
in Tianqi City,

454
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,500
Qianjin House,

455
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,980
started a new bet.

456
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,020
They're betting on

457
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,060
who's going to be the old man...

458
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,700
No.

459
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,020
Who will be Mr. Li's

460
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,180
last disciple?

461
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,820
Though

462
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,820
your name

463
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,060
is not yet known to the world

464
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,020
and is replaced

465
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,500
by "Little Master's Choice"

466
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,220
but the betting odds

467
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,900
are one to one.

468
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,420
One to one?

469
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,220
Not bad.

470
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,180
Looks like I'm

471
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,300
pretty popular.

472
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,580
Did you know why?

473
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,020
Of course.

474
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,580
I'm not stupid.

475
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,340
I'm sure it's all
Little Master's credit.

476
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,900
That's one point

477
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
and there's another.

478
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,300
What's it?

479
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,020
That's because

480
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,100
they haven't seen you in person.

481
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,260
Though Master Tu of Qianjin House

482
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,940
has just inherited the family business

483
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,420
and is not really old,

484
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,060
his has sharp eyes.

485
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,460
If he ever looked at you,

486
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,940
the odds would have to change.

487
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,660
What do you mean?

488
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,020
Think about it yourself.

489
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,940
Senior Lei.

490
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,220
Let's go.

491
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,700
This is the one that Little Master
and Senior Lei

492
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
brought back?

493
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,300
He's so young.

494
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,580
Of course, he is.

495
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,220
Little Master is young, too.

496
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,900
Little Master is a genius.

497
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,180
Who can compete with him?

498
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,660
So the legendary last disciple

499
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,060
he brought back

500
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,620
must be on par with him.

501
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,820
Lei Mengsha,

502
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,580
what if I don't get picked?

503
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,980
What should I do?

504
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,900
How rude you are.

505
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,780
If Master

506
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,940
doesn't pick you,

507
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,700
don't be discouraged.

508
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,900
There are 12 other teachers

509
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,140
in the Academy.

510
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,420
They accept disciples, too.

511
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,220
Just in case they take a shine

512
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,140
to you someday.

513
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
I don't think that's possible.

514
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,340
But you don't have to be so discouraged.

515
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,260
Think about it.

516
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,220
At worst,

517
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,300
you can go to Affiliated Academy.

518
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,180
It's big. It's easy to get in.

519
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,820
Well,

520
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,140
it's a good place

521
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,060
for the nobles in the city

522
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,860
to make a name for themselves
in Tianqi City.

523
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,820
Like you,

524
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,740
the young master
of Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion.

525
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,300
If you want to go to Affiliated Academy,

526
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,700
whenever it is,

527
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,620
you'll be

528
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,140
its the guest of honor.

529
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,940
But if you don't want fame

530
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,220
and don't want to waste your time,

531
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,100
you'll have to wait until next year

532
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,140
to take the examination again.

533
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,660
But if you take the examination again
next year,

534
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,340
you won't be able to be

535
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,140
Mr. Li's last disciple.

536
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,420
So

537
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,620
I came here

538
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,500
in such high spirits,

539
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,940
but I'll probably go back

540
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,340
to Qiandong City dejectedly.

541
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,300
That's right.

542
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,580
Why didn't anyone tell me

543
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,580
before I came?

544
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,620
Didn't we tell you?

545
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:19,980
No.

546
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,340
You can't blame me for this.

547
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,940
On your way to Tianqi City,

548
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,460
you acted

549
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
as if Tianqi City

550
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,700
was the place for you
to impress everyone

551
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,340
and you were ready to make your mark.

552
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,700
Xiao Ruofeng and I

553
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,300
could nothing but encourage you.

554
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,980
Who's it?

555
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,580
You can't avoid that?

556
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,580
Just go to Affiliated Academy.

557
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:09,270
[Qianjin House]

558
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,420
Sir,

559
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,940
I've never seen anyone so dumb.

560
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,780
That's enough.

561
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,060
[Tu Zao, Owner of Qianjin House]
Seeing is believing.

562
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,460
It's an eye-opener.

563
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,260
Is that true?

564
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,380
Yes.

565
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,900
It is said that a disciple
from Affiliated Academy

566
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,300
wanted to test his martial skills,

567
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:47,980
so he threw a peach

568
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,460
at his head.

569
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,020
He didn't even realize it

570
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,300
and got hit right on the head.

571
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,300
So,

572
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,020
how could Little Master

573
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,540
be so impressed

574
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,540
by such a person?

575
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,700
He...

576
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,700
He's hiding his strength.

577
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,740
No way.

578
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,220
Given Little Master's

579
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,700
and Mr. Zhuomo's temperaments,

580
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,260
they wouldn't do such a thing.

581
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,860
Unless...

582
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,700
he's really a good-for-nothing!

583
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,940
Why does Little Master

584
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,140
want a good-for-nothing?

585
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,380
Who knows?

586
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,980
Maybe in a few years,

587
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,100
he won't be a good-for-nothing.

588
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,700
Is it funny?

589
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,740
Where is Tu Wan?

590
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,540
He's gone to listen to the song.

591
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,580
He's a good-for-nothing, too.

592
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,140
He can't do anything.

593
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,500
What he cares about
is just to feed himself.

594
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,700
Get me someone

595
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:47,940
to find out more

596
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,860
about the man Little Master brought back.

597
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,620
Yes, sir.

598
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,660
Come back.

599
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,260
Go to the treasury and get 1,000 taels

600
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,740
of gold.

601
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,740
Get someone to make a bet for me.

602
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,580
On whom?

603
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,740
On Little Master's Choice.

604
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,220
Yes, sir.

605
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,940
Go on with the massage.

606
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,860
Sir.

607
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,740
As you predicted,

608
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,460
Young Lady's traveled alone to Tianqi.

609
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,620
Young Lady is gentle and indecisive.

610
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,260
She seems to be swayed

611
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,540
by the idea of restoring the country.

612
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,220
Besides, it's hard for her

613
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,620
to bring back Baili Dongjun alone.

614
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,340
You and Qixuan

615
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,860
go there secretly.

616
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,340
If necessary,

617
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,020
you can help her.

618
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,940
Yes.

619
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,340
No news of Wufa and Wutian yet?

620
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,900
Lord Wufa and Lord Wutian

621
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,740
lost half of their powers
to the Scholarly Deity

622
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,780
and ran away

623
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,740
with their meridians broken.

624
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,420
Since then, they've disappeared.

625
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,180
Our men searched for them

626
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,340
but to no avail.

627
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,700
Fine.

628
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,500
This time, I'll ask Wuzuo

629
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,740
to go with you.

630
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,460
He's departed.

631
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,420
He'll help you

632
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,260
if he has to.

633
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,980
We've been away from home too long.

634
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,540
So long

635
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,820
that many of us

636
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,180
have forgotten what home is like.

637
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,660
Only when the Chief finishes his retreat

638
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,380
and we all work together

639
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,780
can we go back.

640
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,780
I'll do whatever it takes

641
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,540
to fulfill my duty.

642
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,380
What did you say?

643
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,940
You're the one I trust the most.

644
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,220
How dare you tell Lord Wuxiang

645
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,820
about Young Lady's whereabouts?

646
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,780
I have

647
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,460
no choice but to do so.

648
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,100
What are you

649
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,220
talking about?

650
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,020
Qixuan.

651
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,620
Don't forget

652
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,260
we have to go home.

653
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,700
What does Lord Wuxiang want us to do?

654
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,140
He wants us to hide in the shadows
and help to make things happen.

655
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,420
When do we depart?

656
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,300
Tomorrow.

657
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,660
I got it.

658
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,660
You may leave now.

659
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,820
Very good.

660
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,220
It doesn't help at all.

661
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:40,660
Wait,

662
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,780
you really can't use any
of your internal strength?

663
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,420
Why do you still think

664
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,500
I'm pretending?

665
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,060
I told you I didn't know how to do it.

666
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,180
I meant it.

667
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,060
That's impossible.

668
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,220
If you don't have any internal strength,

669
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:56,940
how can you use

670
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,980
the Western Chu's Sword Song?

671
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,700
I got it.

672
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,380
Your master

673
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,580
must have blocked

674
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,500
all your internal strength

675
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,540
by some means.

676
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,500
How about this?

677
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,740
I

678
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,500
will teach you a set

679
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,820
of internal strength techniques
for breathing.

680
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,540
Let's see

681
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,980
if it can draw
out your internal strength.

682
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,220
You don't need to thank me.

683
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,460
Looks like I have to pack up

684
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,460
and go back to Qiandong City.

685
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,380
How can a disciple
of the Scholarly Deity

686
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,460
give up

687
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,460
so easily?

688
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,940
[Ji Ruofeng, Chief of Baixiao Hall]

689
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,740
Who are you?

690
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,940
You wouldn't know if I told you.

691
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
Why should I tell you?

692
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,260
These sword moves are really exquisite.

693
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,780
It's good that you know it.

694
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,420
But if you know only sword moves

695
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,300
but have no internal strength,

696
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,260
you're just nothing.

697
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,820
I told you, without internal strength,

698
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,580
how powerful can your fist be?

699
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,500
Stop.

700
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,060
Let's stop fighting.

701
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,660
Don't test me anymore.

702
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,020
That's all I've got.

703
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,460
I'm not hiding anything.

704
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,420
Test?

705
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,420
Who do you think I am?

706
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,860
You?

707
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,860
Aren't you one of those disciples

708
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,220
from the Affiliated Academy?

709
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,020
Lei Mengsha is right.

710
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,780
Tianqi City has many talents.

711
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,340
I've come all this way for nothing.

712
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,620
I'll be laughed at by my father

713
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,580
when I'm back.

714
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,460
I've heard a lot

715
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,140
about you

716
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,140
and I was interested in you.

717
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,740
Yet after a few days,

718
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,940
you've become so dejected.

719
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,180
If you dare humiliate me,

720
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:14,980
you'd better watch out or I...

721
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,500
I...

722
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,780
I'll call someone.

723
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,940
You know the greatest sword techniques,

724
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,660
but you lost your confidence

725
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,620
because you were struck

726
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,100
by some mere fools.

727
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,260
You're not from the Academy.

728
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,980
Do you know why your master

729
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,100
cultivated you with medicinal liquor

730
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,500
and gave you

731
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,620
a full body of internal strength

732
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,620
but you can't use

733
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,580
a single bit of it?

734
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,380
Who are you?

735
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,180
How did you know all this?

736
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,940
I know a lot more.

737
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,940
I know a lot of things

738
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,980
you don't.

739
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,260
The reason why your master did this

740
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,260
was because he was afraid
that someone would find out

741
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,140
before it was the right time.

742
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,900
So he put a restraint on you

743
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,380
to block your internal strength.

744
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,380
Unless

745
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,780
you can't control yourself,

746
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,220
like

747
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,580
when you're drunk.

748
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,460
You're a friend of my master's?

749
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,060
But you sound

750
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,380
so young.

751
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,340
Young doesn't mean weak.

752
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,700
Mr. Li of the Academy,

753
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,580
the Sword Deities
and the Scholarly Deity of Western Chu

754
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,420
were only young

755
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,540
when they became famous.

756
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,660
I'm not really friends
with the Scholarly Deity,

757
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,260
but we had a connection.

758
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,780
I owe him a favor.

759
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,180
So now

760
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,540
it's time to return

761
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,380
the favor.

762
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,780
Can you help me with the restraint?

763
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,500
If you try to forcibly
remove the restraint,

764
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,060
years of internal strength

765
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,460
will instantly flood through your body.

766
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,500
Either you die or you'll be crippled.

767
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,660
Besides,

768
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,260
I'm not going

769
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,460
to do it the hard way.

770
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,580
My way is the only

771
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,300
and best way.

772
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,540
What's it?

773
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,140
Let your internal strength slowly

774
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,500
integrate into your body
little by little.

775
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,060
How?

776
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,220
Learn internal strength techniques.

777
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,740
In the end, your style

778
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,860
is the same as Lei Mengsha's.

779
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,580
Forget it.

780
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,260
It's just a few days away.

781
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,780
If we can train

782
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,940
our internal strength in a few days,

783
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,740
then there will be many great masters
in the world.

784
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,860
Do you think I'm stupid?

785
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,260
But you're not like them.

786
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,580
The internal strength techniques
I'm talking about

787
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,020
aren't the same as Lei Mengsha's.

788
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
I'll come again tonight.

789
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,940
I'm not free tonight.

790
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,020
The weak have no right to say no.

791
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,020
You...

792
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,320
[Mount Wangcheng]

793
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,260
Yunyang.

794
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,500
Martial Uncle Wang, you're back.

795
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,940
After finishing this one,

796
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,260
there's still one left.

797
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,620
[Zhao Yuzhen, Disciple of Lyu Suzhen,
Mount Wangcheng]

798
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,300
One more,

799
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,740
and I'll have to wait till next year.

800
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,660
Yuzhen.

801
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,180
Yixing.

802
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,020
Yuzhen.

803
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,260
Yuzhen, you haven't
finished the peaches yet.

804
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,300
Yes.

805
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,020
But only the last two are left.

806
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,220
Yixing,

807
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,220
why do you think

808
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,180
peaches only grow in summer and fall?

809
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,340
Why don't we have peaches

810
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,740
all year round?

811
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,260
It's only when everything
lies dormant in winter

812
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,820
that the flowers bloom in spring

813
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,340
and the summer and fall
are brought to fruition.

814
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,500
There's a rule for everything.

815
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,700
Just go with the flow.

816
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,060
But I want to eat peaches every day.

817
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,380
Everything has a rule,

818
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,700
so I'll change it

819
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,980
and make it serve a better cause.

820
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,660
Yixing, is it fun outside the mountain?

821
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,380
Not bad.

822
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,780
Good liquor and beautiful ladies

823
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,220
have kept me away for a while.

824
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,020
I'd like to go down the mountain too.

825
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,420
Look

826
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,860
what I've brought you.

827
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,820
A sword?

828
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,740
This is no ordinary sword.

829
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,780
This is the sword

830
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,940
made from the Xuanyang Sword's blank

831
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,860
left behind by the Kunlun Sword Deity.

832
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,340
It's the warmest sword on earth.

833
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,660
If you bury this sword in the ground,

834
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,380
it'll keep the whole yard in spring.

835
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,340
You

836
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,900
have got to get better
at practicing Fire Arts.

837
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,620
By then,

838
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,980
it won't be a problem for you

839
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,100
to crave peaches in the winter.

840
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,460
What's the name of this sword now?

841
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,260
The God of Fire.

842
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,900
What an awful name.

843
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,940
Split.

844
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,260
Combined.

845
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,940
You can use it this way?

846
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,260
You can use it this way?

847
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,420
Yes.

848
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,660
That's the way it works.

849
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,900
Yixing.

850
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,940
You're back.

851
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,340
[Lyu Suzhen, Chief of Mount Wangcheng]

852
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,060
- Master.
- Chief.

853
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,180
I'll leave you all to it.

854
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,420
I'm off now.

855
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,540
Take it.

856
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,380
Master,

857
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,540
Yuzhen was talking

858
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,460
about going down the mountain again.

859
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,500
I read Yu's fortune

860
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,500
when he was born.

861
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,540
Whether it's secret techniques
or swordsmanship,

862
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,900
he'll be

863
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,900
the best at Mount Wangcheng
for a hundred years.

864
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,500
But there are gains and losses.

865
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,540
He's going

866
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,860
to stay at Mount Wangcheng
for the rest of his life.

867
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,020
If he goes down the mountain,

868
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,340
a catastrophe will come upon him.

869
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,500
He's not resigned to his fate.

870
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,060
He always thinks

871
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,620
that destiny can be changed.

872
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,460
Is there really no other way?

873
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,220
How can you realize yourself better

874
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,940
without seeing the world?

875
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,620
I will be the one

876
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,860
to put forward another way.

877
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,140
You just stay out of this.

878
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:53,860
All right.

879
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,100
You

880
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,900
love to take everything

881
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,060
upon yourself.

882
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,060
If there's nothing else,

883
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,020
I'll take my leave.

884
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,220
I haven't taken a shower the whole trip.

885
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,580
I feel so uncomfortable.

886
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,020
Come back.

887
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,140
Did you

888
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,580
meet a man named Baili Dongjun

889
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,540
on your way?

890
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,820
If you hadn't mentioned it,
I'd have forgotten.

891
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,260
An heir of the Western Chu's Sword Song.

892
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,340
What an eye-opener.

893
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,500
He's in Tianqi City now.

894
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,100
Just let him be.

895
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,500
It's good for young people

896
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,420
to widen their horizons.

897
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,380
Coincidentally,

898
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,340
you're going there, too.

899
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,180
Why?

900
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
I'm just back

901
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,820
not long ago.

902
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,420
The Academy's examination
is around the corner.

903
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,020
You have to go.

904
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,020
Master, are you asking me
to join the Academy

905
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,260
instead of learning from you?

906
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,020
Well,

907
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,260
I just want to stay at Mount Wangcheng.

908
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,340
As for the Academy...

909
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,180
Is Mr. Li still accepting disciples
this year?

910
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,060
You wish to enter the Academy?

911
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,580
The Academy

912
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,860
only asks us

913
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,140
to send one person there from our sect.

914
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,100
What?

915
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,540
Why me again?

916
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,100
I also want

917
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,420
to seriously learn some techniques,

918
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,940
pretend to be a master of the world,

919
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,980
and get to know

920
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,500
the beautiful girls down the mountain.

921
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,540
Because you're the only one

922
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,020
who knows Baili Dongjun.

923
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,100
I'm asking you to go to Tianqi

924
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,940
to keep an eye on this person.

925
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,340
The heir to the Western Chu's Sword Song

926
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,460
will certainly cause chaos
in the future.

927
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,340
But what's that got to do with me?

928
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,100
If you want to be the greatest master
in the martial arts world someday,

929
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,940
he'll be your rival for sure.

930
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,420
Be the greatest master
in the martial arts world?

931
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,180
Master, you really

932
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,020
think highly of me.

933
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,980
I'm the White Feather Sword Deity's
best friend,

934
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,820
the Green Feather Liquor Deity.

935
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,820
Come on, Yun.

936
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,940
It's your turn.

937
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,940
Isn't this too embarrassing?

938
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,420
Come on.

939
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,980
Yun, go ahead.

940
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,500
Yun, you must do it.

941
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,820
Yun, you can do it.

942
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,820
I'm the White Feather Sword Deity's
friend,

943
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,220
the Green Feather Liquor Deity.

944
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:18,940
Yun,

945
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,300
Mr. Ye,

946
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,620
Madam,

947
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,860
I'm here to see you.

948
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,140
Yun,

949
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,460
you know what?

950
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,500
I'm about to fulfill

951
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,380
our pact.

952
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,180
There are few people in the world

953
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,860
who can brew better liquor

954
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,700
than me now.

955
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,100
In a few days,

956
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,500
I'll challenge

957
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,780
Qiulubai of Diaolou Tavern.

958
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,460
If I win against it,

959
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,660
I'll become

960
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,900
a world-famous liquor deity.

961
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,700
But now, I've decided

962
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,860
that I'll accomplish

963
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,020
your part as well.

964
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,980
Not only will I be a liquor deity,

965
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,580
but I will also be a sword deity.

966
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,140
Yun.
