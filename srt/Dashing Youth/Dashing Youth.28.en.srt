00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
This time,

188
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,820
get rid of them together

189
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,060
with Baili Luochen.

190
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,460
Your Highness.

191
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,700
Your Highness.

192
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,300
I'm fine.

193
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,020
I'm fine.

194
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,380
I'll help you into the carriage.

195
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,940
Yingxian,

196
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,860
if it works this time,

197
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,380
I'll really be the emperor.

198
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,140
What's wrong?

199
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,180
These days,

200
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,100
I can't help

201
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,980
but think of Yun.

202
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,900
We didn't get

203
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,340
to say goodbye to each other

204
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,820
during the bride-snatching.

205
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,020
My father told me that he didn't die

206
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,420
and was taken away.

207
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,540
When I get out,

208
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,100
I'll find him

209
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,980
and snatch Wenjun back with him.

210
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,220
But Wenjun

211
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,220
is already married.

212
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,940
So what?

213
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,420
She's become

214
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,380
someone's wife,

215
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,820
and maybe

216
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,780
the mother of her children.

217
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,380
She's got her husband,

218
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,900
her own family.

219
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,020
It's not appropriate

220
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,580
to snatch her back

221
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,220
in this situation.

222
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:12,980
Well...

223
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,180
That's up to Wenjun.

224
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,220
If she wants to,

225
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,620
I'll go with Yun to save her.

226
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,780
If she doesn't,

227
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,340
I'll drink with Yun

228
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,540
to help drown his sorrows.

229
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,820
[The time is right for further action]

230
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,340
It's time.

231
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:28,980
Feizhan.

232
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,420
My Lord.

233
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,700
[Zhong Feizhan,
Soul Official in Sky's Beyond]

234
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,300
As I recall,

235
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,140
you and Feili have a relative

236
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,660
in Tianqi City, Beili.

237
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,540
Yes.

238
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,220
That's why

239
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,580
I stayed with my brother

240
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,540
in Tianqi City for a while
when I was young.

241
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,460
I'm quite familiar with it.

242
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,260
Their surname is Zang,

243
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,500
and they're barely a noble family,

244
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,260
but

245
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,500
they're in decline now.

246
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,340
Go to Tianqi, then.

247
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,740
Use my secret code

248
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,020
to contact Wufa and Wutian.

249
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,460
They've been gone long enough.

250
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,020
It's time for them

251
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,660
to do something serious.

252
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,460
What do you need me to do?

253
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,060
Take Yi Wenjun

254
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,540
out of Tianqi City

255
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,580
and send her
to the outskirts of Gusu City

256
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,180
so she can meet the man

257
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,740
she's been thinking about.

258
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,980
Lovers are reunited,

259
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,740
and the past destiny is resumed.

260
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,420
What a beautiful story.

261
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,260
It's a lovely day.

262
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,220
It's a shame

263
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,860
the good times are coming to an end.

264
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,820
I don't want

265
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,500
to take orders from him anymore.

266
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,180
Grand Eunuch Zhuoqing.

267
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,900
Where are you two going?

268
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,660
To be honest, Grand Eunuch,

269
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,980
we've been approached by Sky's Beyond.

270
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,780
That's why we

271
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,540
must leave the palace.

272
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,260
It's not easy

273
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,980
to leave the palace.

274
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,820
In this huge palace of Beili,

275
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,820
there are many martial experts

276
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,420
besides me.

277
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,500
I'll escort you out.

278
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,220
You'll be discovered

279
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,020
if you go out like this.

280
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,540
Grand Eunuch,

281
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,260
if you're up for it,

282
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,660
why don't we go together?

283
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,980
But

284
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,860
we don't know

285
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,700
who is coming today.

286
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,300
Maybe

287
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,380
I know.

288
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,220
Lord Wufa, Lord Wutian,

289
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,380
why are you bringing a guest along?

290
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,980
He's a very important ally.

291
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,620
But at the moment,

292
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,620
he is

293
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,500
waiting in a carriage outside the door.

294
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,660
He won't come in

295
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,380
until we've finished our business.

296
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,300
Did you come here

297
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,420
on the orders of Lord Wuxiang?

298
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,860
Lord Wufa, Lord Wutian,

299
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,660
since you're in Tianqi,

300
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,260
you must have heard of someone,

301
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,780
Ye Dingzhi.

302
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,900
He is also an innate martial artist.

303
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,580
A descendant of Ye Yu.

304
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,780
Lord Wuxiang

305
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,500
has a good eye for talent.

306
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,740
I wonder

307
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,940
what he'll do next.

308
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,260
Ye Dingzhi

309
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,700
was once engaged

310
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,780
to Yi Wenjun, the daughter
of the Shadow Sect's leader

311
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,420
and now Prince Jingyu's
secondary consort.

312
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,660
They were reunited

313
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,020
when he took the examination

314
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,260
at the Academy.

315
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,180
Unfortunately,

316
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,700
the person who came this time

317
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,900
is the most annoying one.

318
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
You don't need

319
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,060
to see such a person.

320
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,740
It's all right.

321
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,460
I'll go see him alone.

322
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,260
It's said that the Soul Officials, Feili

323
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,900
and Feizhan

324
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,660
are the most important right-hand men

325
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,780
of Lord Wuxiang of Sky's Beyond.

326
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,940
I'm happy

327
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,740
to see you today.

328
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,980
The one you want to see

329
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,780
is Lord Wuxiang.

330
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,260
I don't have

331
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
that honor.

332
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,420
Of course I'd like to meet

333
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,700
Lord Wuxiang.

334
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,580
But he

335
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,020
is not worth

336
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,100
all the effort.

337
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,020
The one I want to see

338
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,340
is your Emperor.

339
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,340
When I saw him
at the city gate that year,

340
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,540
I remembered

341
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,660
how impressive he was.

342
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,020
I wonder how His Majesty is doing now.

343
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,060
It seems that Lord Wufa and Lord Wutian

344
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,460
have told you quite a lot.

345
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,460
Don't worry.

346
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,260
Perhaps I can help you.

347
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,180
I'll be sure

348
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,300
to relay your words

349
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,100
when I get back.

350
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,740
Since Sky's Beyond is so sincere,

351
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,940
I can't

352
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,740
be too stingy.

353
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,420
This is my gift

354
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,420
to Sky's Beyond.

355
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,020
Four men
are hiding in Tianqi City.

356
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,900
Go to them

357
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,580
and tell them your plan.

358
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,700
Tell them

359
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,500
you're friends of Ye Dingzhi.

360
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,980
They

361
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,500
will do their best to help you.

362
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,420
They're good fighters.

363
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
Their identities

364
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,540
may be more important

365
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,460
than their martial arts.

366
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,260
Their master

367
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,980
is the late Rain Demon, the Sword Deity.

368
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,780
Their bringing Yi Wenjun

369
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,740
to Ye Dingzhi's side

370
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,980
is very different

371
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,740
from you bringing Yi Wenjun

372
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,340
to Ye Dingzhi's side.

373
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,420
Thank you, Grand Eunuch.

374
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,020
But when I get back to Sky's Beyond,

375
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,260
Lord Wuxiang will

376
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,460
ask me a question.

377
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,980
I have to ask you

378
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,020
about it now.

379
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,260
Go ahead.

380
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,660
Why do you

381
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,460
help us?

382
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,540
Because

383
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,100
I want the world to be in chaos.

384
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,300
Some things

385
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,580
can only be achieved through chaos.

386
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,740
He's just an eunuch.

387
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,020
He...

388
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,300
Grand Eunuch,
how was the conversation going?

389
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,220
We had a good chat.

390
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,420
[Four Slaves of Rain Demon,
Qin Yuehan, Baihua Pleasure House]

391
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,420
These four slaves

392
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,700
know how to pick a place.

393
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,220
I don't agree!

394
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,860
I will never agree!

395
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,180
Second Young Lady,

396
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,860
this is Lord Wuxiang's order.

397
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,580
Besides,

398
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,380
this is the best way

399
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,100
to control Ye Dingzhi.

400
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,420
Second Young Lady, please

401
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,580
don't let your emotions
get the best of you.

402
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,300
How long

403
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,620
does the entire plan take?

404
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,740
Three years fast,

405
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,780
five years slow.

406
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,780
By then,

407
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,020
we'll return to Sky's Beyond

408
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,100

Commander Luo,

411
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,020
are you leaving the palace today?

412
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,940
His Majesty has been kind enough

413
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,700
to grant me a day's leave

414
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,620
to visit my junior.

415
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,580
Commander Luo,

416
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,540
you have a great affection

417
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,660
for your junior.

418
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,860
If Prince Jingyu

419
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,900
hadn't met your junior back then...

420
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,900
Grand Eunuch, you must be joking.

421
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,300
I'm sorry for speaking out of turn.

422
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,020
Well,

423
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,260
I won't keep you any longer.

424
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,260
Goodbye.

425
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,100
Grand Eunuch,

426
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,220
I'm just the Vice Commander.

427
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,140
How interesting.

428
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,660
In less than ten years,

429
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,260
he'll be the best martial expert

430
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,340
in the palace.

431
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,100
Commander Luo.

432
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,580
Why are there so few people?

433
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,660
His Highness sent some men,

434
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,540
but Her Highness drove them away.

435
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,180
Has she been happier

436
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,980
since the baby was born?

437
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,300
Commander Luo, to be honest,

438
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,580
Her Highness still doesn't talk much,

439
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,020
but she

440
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,300
talks to me a little every day.

441
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,940
She hasn't been

442
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,500
happier.

443
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,980
Instead, she frowns more than ever.

444
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,980
Senior Luo,

445
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,740
you're here.

446
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,140
Commander Luo,

447
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,300
please be mindful of etiquette.

448
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,540
I'm going to check on Yu.

449
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,540
He likes you very much.

450
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,140
Grand Eunuch,

451
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,340
I've just received

452
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,820
a message from Feizhan.

453
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,260
He met the four slaves

454
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,700
at Baihua Pleasure House

455
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,420
and convinced them

456
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,580
to join the plan.

457
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,860
We'll take action today.

458
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,740
There's one person to watch out for.

459
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,380
The Vice Commander
of the Royal Guard, Luo Qingyang,

460
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,060
is also at Prince Jingyu's Mansion
today.

461
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,900
Luo Qingyang is the best disciple

462
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,940
of the Shadow Sect's leader.

463
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,180
He's a great swordsman.

464
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,540
He's also one of the best

465
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,980
of his generation in Beili.

466
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,660
Yes.

467
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,100
That means

468
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,060
we have another obstacle.

469
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,340
No.

470
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,660
It's not an obstacle.

471
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,620
Instead, it's a great help.

472
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,700
When is the next time you're coming?

473
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,580
That's hard to say.

474
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,620
His Majesty has granted me
a rare day off.

475
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,420
I'm afraid

476
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,820
it'll be a long time
before the next one.

477
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,900
I got it.

478
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,380

479
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,700
someone from the palace

480
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,860
has sent you some pastries.

481
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,620

482
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,340

493

00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,620
My men couldn't catch up with them.

568
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,340
Useless!

569
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,620
Where is Luo Qingyang?

570
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,540
Where is Luo Qingyang?

571
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,460
He helped them escape.

572
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,900
I'll report him to Father

573
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,540
and have him punished.

574
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,460
No.

575
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,540
Prince Jingyu's secondary consort

576
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,220
was robbed in the Mansion.

577
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,940
If this matter spreads out,

578
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,020
the whole Prince Jingyu's Mansion

579
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,540
will become the joke of Tianqi City.

580
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,340
Not to mention letting Father know.

581
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,940
From today onward,

582
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,860
announce to the public

583
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,020
that Princess Yi has contracted
a serious illness

584
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,820
and is unable to see anyone.

585
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,420
No one in her room

586
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,540
is allowed to leave the Mansion.

587
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,660
What should we do?

588
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,060
Ye Dingzhi.

589
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,940
Ye Dingzhi.

590
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,860
Yes, as long as we find Ye Dingzhi,

591
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,620
everything will be all right.

592
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,540
Ruofeng,

593
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,020
you took him away that day.

594
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,140
Where is he now?

595
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,140
I didn't send anyone to follow him

596
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,860
after crossing Mount Muyun.

597
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,820
We need to find out

598
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,220
where he is now.

599
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,020
You...

600
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,740
We should have killed him
in the first place

601
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,900
to avoid any more trouble.

602
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,020
You were

603
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,700
too kind

604
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,220
to think
he was your junior's best friend

605
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,420
and General Ye's descendant,

606
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,660
and insisted that I spare his life.

607
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,140
Fine.

608
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,980
I spared his life.

609
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,060
But you took him away

610
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,220
without sending anyone to follow him.

611
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,060
And now I'm in such a mess.

612
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,260
You're too soft-hearted.

613
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,700
Soft-hearted!

614
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,060
Ruojin, calm down.

615
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,180
Ye Dingzhi

616
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,140
is not that powerful.

617
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,020
There must be someone backing him.

618
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,540
Compared to him,

619
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,900
you should be more worried

620
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,100
about the person who took Wenjun.

621
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,140
Are you saying

622
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,540
that behind this force

623
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,860
is more than just

624
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,020
Rain Demon's men?

625
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,660
Of course it's not that simple.

626
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:00,900
Mr. Yi.

627
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,500
Father-in-law.

628
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,260
Yesterday, I chased Wenjun
to the city gate

629
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,180
and had a chance to intercept her,

630
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,860
but two men suddenly appeared

631
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,140
and stopped me.

632
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,060
If they could stop you,

633
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,660
they must be no ordinary people.

634
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,540
Yes.

635
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,220
And I've seen

636
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,660
these two before.

637
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:44,660
Who are they?

638
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,460
His Majesty was still a prince,

639
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,220
and although Beique was small,
they had great ambitions.

640
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,940
They had been

641
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,340
harassing our borders

642
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,820
and colluding with Western Chu.

643
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,740
His Majesty was ordered
to go on an expedition

644
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,500
and I joined the army.

645
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,460
In the end,

646
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,660
Beique lost.

647
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,620
To avoid being leveled,

648
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,860
they took a risky step

649
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,420
and came up with a plan.

650
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,340
What's it?

651
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,540
Beique was a country of martial arts,

652
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,820
and the Emperor was not only
the head of the country,

653
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,460
but also the leader of the sect.

654
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,460
Under the Emperor,
there were five guardians

655
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,660
who're highly skilled in martial arts.

656
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,620
They sent these five men

657
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,140
to assassinate the leaders of the army,

658
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,060
that is, His Majesty
and the Military Deity, Ye Yu.

659
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,020
Among the two of them,

660
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,860
one is short and fat,
the other is tall and thin.

661
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,420
They are the ones
who stopped me yesterday.

662
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,700
That means

663
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,660
they're

664
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,180
the remnants of Beique.

665
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,900
How ironic.

666
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,540
The biggest contributor

667
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,340
to Beique's demise was Ye Yu.

668
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,020
Now, they are helping Ye Dingzhi.

669
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,900
I've heard
that General Ye led his troops

670
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,820
with great restraint.

671
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,380
That's why the war lasted so long,

672
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,500
but there were fewer casualties

673
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,580
than in the previous war

674
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,060
against Western Chu.

675
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,140
After Beique's territory
was incorporated into Beili,

676
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,740
the rest of their people
were submissive.

677
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,900
These were all General Ye's credits.

678
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,060
But this time,

679
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,260
Beique's men helping Ye Dingzhi

680
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,020
has nothing to do with this.

681
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,340
I'm afraid

682
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,140
there's a bigger conspiracy behind this.

683
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,540
- What conspiracy?
- What conspiracy?

684
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Shouldn't the Shadow Sect

685
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,060
be telling me this?

686
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,500
Go to Lei Mengsha.

687
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,780
Let him

688
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,660
make the trip.

689
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,820
Yes.

690
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,860
Not bad.

691
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,700
I can say

692
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,060
that you've already achieved something.

693
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,420
Now I can carry a guqin

694
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,700
and hurt people with its sound.

695
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,060
It's so elegant and impressive.

696
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,700
This technique you taught me

697
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,500
is really awesome.

698
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,620
What's its name?

699
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,820
It's Xunian Art of Beique.

700
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,700
Xunian Art?

701
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,100
Yes.

702
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,740
It's the most profound

703
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,300
martial art in Beique

704
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,620
and also the most difficult

705
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,340
to master.

706
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,140
I've been practicing for years,

707
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,700
but only picked up the basics.

708
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,020
But you're an innate martial artist.

709
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,660
You can master it naturally.

710
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,980
Xunian, Xunian,

711
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,660
illusory and real.

712
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,660
Just as the sound of the guqin
turns into blades,

713
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,180
the sound of emptiness
turns into reality.

714
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,660
Why did you

715
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,700
make me learn this technique?

716
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,740
I wanted to teach you

717
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,460
this technique long ago

718
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,380
so that you could save my father.

719
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,340
Then, I changed my mind,

720
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,820
but Mr. Li said

721
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:12,940
there's no harm

722
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,460
in

723
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,820
teaching it to you.

724
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,820
The thing is,

725
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,700
it's only after you've mastered
the 19 Embroidery Sword Techniques

726
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:21,980
and

727
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,500
become more mature.

728
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,860
I think this is

729
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,260
the right time.

730
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,660
I see.

731
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,540
So when are we

732
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,420
going to save your father?

733
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,100
To Sky's Beyond?

734
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,100
It's not the right time.

735
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,420
It's too dangerous.

736
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,660
Besides,

737
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,540
if my father is really out,

738
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,540
it'll be a catastrophe

739
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,700
for Beili and the world.

740
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,980
Though

741
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,180
I really

742
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,740
miss him a lot.

743
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,340
Yao, don't worry.

744
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,340
Just wait until we're ready

745
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:11,980
to persuade him

746
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,260
not to start a war.

747
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,340
I'll be with you.

748
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,740
Dongjun,

749
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,780
thank you.
