00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,900
You'll win for sure!

193
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,580
Follow me, you'll win!

194
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,900
Don't you have faith in me?

195
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,740
How can you not trust me?

196
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,820
Just do as I do.

197
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,140
Everybody!

198
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,420
Have you placed your bet?

199
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,860
Miss,

200
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,420
[Mr. Mu, Proprietor of the Parlor]
if I'm not mistaken,

201
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,220
I own this gambling parlor.

202
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,940
How are you calling the shots now?

203
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,060
My apologies, Mr. Mu.

204
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,740
I'm used to it.

205
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,100
Have you placed your bet?

206
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,140
Miss,

207
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,140
we'll see

208
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,660
if you can still win.

209
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,740
Mr. Mu, haven't you heard?

210
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,740
We're the masters of our destiny.

211
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,620
Certainly.

212
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,340
What about it?

213
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,980
Nothing.

214
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,660
I just want you to know

215
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,140
that the saying is nothing but a lie.

216
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,900
Destiny is destiny.

217
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,700
When it comes

218
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,380
crashing down,

219
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,140
we are all doomed.

220
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,460
What's the card?

221
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,300
Double Heaven!

222
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,060
Thank you!

223
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,900
She said that

224
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,220
because you were going to lose

225
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,180
your entire gambling parlor

226
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,620
to her.

227
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,020
Yue Yao?

228
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,180
Luoxia.

229
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,380
Mr. Mu.

[Yin Luoxia,
Daughter of the King of Gambling]

231
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,380
That's all for today.

232
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,820
Record all this carefully.

233
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,100
We'll have a rematch.

234
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,460
Have fun, everyone.

235
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,420
Let's go.

236
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,500
I'm done with this.

237
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,260
Forget it.

238
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,860
Let's go.

239
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,020
Time to go home.

240
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,700
[Jin City Inn]

241
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,500
I'm here to run some errands

242
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,020
for my master.

243
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,220
As soon as I arrived,

244
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,340
I heard rumors of a mysterious woman

245
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,380
winning big in the gambling parlor.

246
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,020
I knew it was you.

247
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,500
So I came right away.

248
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,860
Master?

249
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,380
The most gorgeous man alive

250
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,620
you mentioned in the letter?

251
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,220
Correct.

252
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,140
I took on your identity

253
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,340
to become his disciple.

254
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,620
If it's possible,

255
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,300
I hope you can become his disciple too.

256
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,380
The peerlessly handsome Mr. Liu Yue.

257
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,140
Interesting.

258
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,220
I should meet him.

259
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,060
We'll see if he is more charming

260
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,860
than you.

261
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,340
Luoxia.

262
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,220
I'm done teasing you.

263
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,340
Come on.

264
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,940
I want to hear all

265
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,620
about the interesting things

266
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,540
you encountered

267
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,660
in Tianqi City.

00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,500
[Tang Sect]

269
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,100
The invitation?

270
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,620
Here you are.

271
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,060
Fine. Come in.

272
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:23,900
Come in.

273
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,820
Senior, let's go.

274
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:25,940
Invitation?

275
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,420
Let's go.

276
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,100
This way.

277
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,460
Sure.

278
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,700
Invitation?

279
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,740
Had I not come here,

280
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,540
you'd run out of medicine.

281
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,220
You'd die here.

282
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,620
Aren't you worried?

283
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,940
Does it matter?

284
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,620
Dying in the martial arts world
is better

285
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,260
than dying in the Medicine King Valley.

286
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,980
Your trip to Tianqi City

287
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,740
didn't break your spirit.

288
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,340
Stop standing there.

289
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,420
Let's go.

290
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,540
You've been through a lot.

291
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,300
However,

292
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,180
I have a question.

293
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,620
What is it you want to know?

294
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,740
Your identity,

295
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,740
your goal,

296
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,380
and

297
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,260
the cold power struggle aside,

298
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,020
are you

299
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,300
in love with Baili Dongjun?

300
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,180

[Tang Sect]

302
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,580
If we can't

303
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,580
find your friend today,

304
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,620
I'll talk

305
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,220
to Grandmaster Tang for you.

306
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,620
Thank you, Uncle.

307
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,220
What's over there?

308
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,540
The Poison Convention.

309
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,940
That's the Poison Convention?

310
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,300
Won't you go there?

311
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,740
The Convention over here

312
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,500
is meant

313
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,060
for the normal poison sects.

314
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,940
It seems lively,

315
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,540
but it has very little content in it.

316
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,500
The real Poison Convention

317
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,540
is always held

318
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,540
in Grandmaster Tang's Wutong Yard.

319
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,140
Only the five major poison sects

320
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,420
are participating.

321
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,860
That's a small circle.

322
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,740
That's only a Poison Gathering.

323
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,380
Yeah.

324
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,140
It's only a gathering.

325
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,460
This way, please.

326
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,300
Let's go.

327
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,980
The man in black

328
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,020
on the stage

329
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,340
is Tang Linghuang.

330
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:36,820
He is

331
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,340
the Tang Sect's spokesperson.

332
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:38,980
It's said

333
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,420
[Tang Linghuang of the Tang Sect]
he is the best poison

334
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,220
and hidden weapon user in the sect.

335
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,220
This time,

336
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,180
I came here

337
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,180
to test my skills against his.

338
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,540
As for the rest,

339
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,340
they are

340
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,780
the elites of the five poison sects.

341
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,620
This is the Poison God Sect.

342
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,100
That is the Withered Cloud Sect.

343
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,660
And the Undying Sect

344
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,180
What is Liu's sister doing here?

345
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,700
I miscalculated.

346
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,140
Who are the others?

347
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,300
The Five-Poison Clan.

348
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,940
The poison-using sects

349
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,980
are truly menacing.

350
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,980
Their names carry

351
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,820
either death or poison.

352
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,220
It seems they want the world

353
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,500
to know they are nasty.

354
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:14,980
Certainly.

355
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,300
We're the nice people here.

356
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,340
We are friendly.

357
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,220
The Wen Family
[*Lit: grace and elegance]

358
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,100
is all about grace and elegance.

359
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,220
All right, enough about them.

360
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,020
In any case,

361
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,460
they aren't as amazing as me.

362
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,020
Baili!

363
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Uncle Buping.

364
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,420
What a timing!

365
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,020
Just in time.

366
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,220
You're not a poison user.

367
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,500
What are you doing here?

368
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,940
Medicine and poison are related.

369
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,820
I don't use poisons,

370
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,180
but I know about them.

371
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,700
If you can't stand that,

372
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,780
stop wasting your time here.

373
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,780
I'm done talking to you.

374
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,820
You lost the argument.

375
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,540
King of Medicine, wait for me.

376
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,340
Changfeng?

377
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,340
Dongjun?

378
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
What are you doing here?

379
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,060
It's a long story.

380
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,940
Everyone.

381
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,140
As we all know,

382
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,740
in the martial arts world,

383
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,900
the art of toxin

384
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,380
is looked down upon
as a form of Sly Path.

385
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,740
It's not acknowledged by the world.

386
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,540
The Tang Sect

387
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,660
were shunned by the world for many years

388
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,620
due to our expertise

389
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,700
in poisons and hidden weapons.

390
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,340
Today,

391
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,140
when we mention the Tang Sect,

392
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,300
is there anyone out there

393
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,420
who would dare shun us?

394
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,260
- Indeed.
- Indeed.

395
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,060
- He is right.
- Yeah.

396
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,340
Sly Path or Right Path,

397
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,340
it's nothing but prejudice.

398
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,020
Poisons can take lives

399
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,060
and save lives.

400
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,660
Today,

401
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,020
we shall together

402
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,500
attend this Poison Convention.

403
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,420
I hope that all of us

404
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,740
can exchange knowledge
to our heart's content

405
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,780
and make the use of poison great again!

406
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,540
It totally sounds like a sham

407
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,740
we run into on the roads

408
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,780
that is recruiting.

409
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,860
Right? Right?

410
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,700
I didn't know

411
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,820
that side of you, Mr. Wen.

412
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,020
Uncle, I have a feeling

413
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,300
you are jealous of him.

414
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,940
The Wen Family

415
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,700
never likes to show off.

416
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,020
But your uncle wasn't born
with that sense.

417
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,980
He's always looking for a fight.

418
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,620
The Tang Sect is hosting

419
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,380
the Poison Convention

420
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,980
that welcomes the major poison sects

421
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,660
for a display of authority.

422
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,300
Of course, your uncle is being defiant.

423
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,260
Hush.

424
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,660
Send in the drug tester.

425
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,460
This is the drug tester
of the Tang Sect.

426
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,450
Originally

427
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,100
a bandit of great malice,

428
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,100
this man was captured by us.

429
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,420
After years of refinement and training,

430
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,340
he is already immune to poisons.

431
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,580
This is the Tang Sect's test

432
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,020
for all of you.

433
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,340
Anyone capable
of taking him down with poison

434
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,100
shall overthrow the Tang Sect

435
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,820
and rise as the head
of all poison sects.

436
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,460
You're talking big. I...

437
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,740
Wait here.

438
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,700
Don't get too eager.

439
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
The Wen Family is the best
at using poisons.

440
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,340
We can't go in first.

441
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,620
You're right.

442
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,140
The Wen Family
is keeping up appearances.

443
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,900
Our Five-Poison Clan

444
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,420
isn't this picky.

445
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,140
Since no one is coming forth,

446
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,740
I shall go first.

447
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,380
She is mean with her words,

448
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,180
but she has a good figure.

449
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,010
An alluring beauty.

450
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,540
This poison blade is infused
with a powerful poison.

451
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,500
It's called Elegant Jessamine.

452
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,540
No one can detoxify it.

453
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,140
Even the Five-Poison Clan

454
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,740
is incapable of curing it.

455
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,380
You...

456
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,700
Uncle, she is looking at me.

457
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,740
Her eyes watch all of us.

458
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,820
Truly alluring.

459
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,340
What is that?

460
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,260
That is the Buddhist Vajra Barrier.

461
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,380
I once poisoned a monk

462
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,460
at White Horse Temple.

463
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,140
The monk used the same technique.

464
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,860
I didn't expect

465
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,900
the bandit captured by the Tang Sect

466
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,140
to know a Buddhist technique.

467
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,740
Do not touch her!

468
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,660
Don't touch her!

469
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,420
Baili!

470
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,700
Don't you know she is...

471
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,180
What is it?

472
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:18,940
Yeah.

473
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,580
He's bold.

474
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,580
Are you saying I must marry her

475
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,180
because

476
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,500
I touched her?
Like what's written in huabens?

477
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,580
You wish.

478
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,100
Xiu, come back.

479
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,100
Wait.

480
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,060
Why did you

481
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,740
look so terrified of the possibility

482
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,500
of marrying me?

483
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,100
Don't you like me?

484
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,460
Isn't that obvious?

485
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,100
You...

486
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,740
I'll show you

487
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,660
my face.

488
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,020
We'll see if you like me, then.

489
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,100
That's not necessary.

490
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,620
Uncle.

491
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,460
If you see her face,

492
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,300
you must marry her.

493
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,820
What now?

494
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,180
Fall back.

495
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,700
Yes.

496
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,380
Xiu.

497
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:04,980
If you ever

498
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,500
got involved with a girl
from the Five-Poison Clan,

499
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,580
it'd be a life worth living.

500
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,340
But your life would be cut short.

501
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,260
Why is that?

502
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,980
You should ask Uncle Hujiu.

503
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,060
Shut it.

504
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
I am Wen Hujiu.

505
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,940
I'll take the challenge.

506
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,620
This fool.

507
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,820
He's still

508
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,780
an attention seeker.

509
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,140
First, a dose of Drunken Dream Death

510
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,620
to disable his inner strength.

511
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,340
Then, a dose of Ephemeral Youth

512
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,540
to strengthen the efficacy.

513
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,460
Lastly, a strike of Venomous Palm.

514
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,060
If he could still be alive,

515
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,540
he'd be the Great Golden Immortal.

516
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,300
Do all poisons nowadays

517
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,540
come with a poetic and artistic name?

518
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,380
Back then,

519
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,660
among the three of us,
one produced poisons,

520
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,620
one used poisons,

521
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,420
and another one

522
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,020
was responsible for naming them.

523
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,140
We made a good team.

524
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,460
The Wen Family is unstoppable.

525
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,540
Uncle.

526
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,700
You mentioned three.

527
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,660
Who was the last one?

528
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,700
Your mother.

529
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,340
Uncle Buping.

530
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,860
Why are you insulting me?

531
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,740
Baili Dongjun!

532
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,820
Sorry about that.

533
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,100
That's highly toxic.

534
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,340
What?

535
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,620
The Wen Family's poison
is indeed highly toxic.

536
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,620
That voice...

537
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,340
Tang Linghuang,

538
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,180
how dare you claim

539
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,460
the drug tester was a bandit?

540
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,260
How insolent you are

541
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,060
to have brought in

542
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
a speaking Golden Immortal!

543
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,020
Baili Dongjun,

544
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,020
what's the matter?

545
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,580
That drug tester

546
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,500
wasn't a bandit.

547
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,740
You are not our drug tester!

548
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,580
Who are you?

549
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,940
I am Nangong Chunshui.

550
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,980
I am a gentle scholar.

551
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,540
Who is that?

552
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,020
This bad old man.

553
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,020
I was worried about you.

554
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,660
A scholar?

555
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,540
We have an internal affair
to resolve here.

556
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,020
Those who are not from the Tang Sect

557
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,980
should leave now.

558
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
What is going on now?

559
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,140
Let's go.

560
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,500
What is this about?

561
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,940
Why aren't you leaving?

562
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,820
Uncle.

563
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,660
This is the friend

564
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,980
who got nabbed outside the gate.

565
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,100
He's one of us.

566
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,740
So he is with you.

567
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,260
If anyone

568
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,140
could abduct your friend,

569
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,820
the abductor

570
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,340
would be the most powerful being
in the world.

571
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,340
Enough.

572
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,100
Spare me the chitchat.

573
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,300
You have only one chance.

574
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,620
Watch closely.

575
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,180
Tang Linghuang.

576
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,340
What's the deal with Grandmaster Tang?

577
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,580
With all the commotion,

578
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,220
how can he be still asleep?

579
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,460
He should be awake by now!

580
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,660
Silence!

581
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,100
Show some respect!

582
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,980
Unrestrained

583
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,620
and invincible.

584
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,220
The mortal realm

585
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,220
cannot match Heaven's delight.

586
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,300
Two phases in a row?

587
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,940
He entered the Sovereign Sky Phase

588
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,140
from the Sturdy Phase.

589
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,740
He is truly formidable.

590
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,500
He is more than that.

591
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,020
It seems

592
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,140
Mr. Wen and this spokesperson
of the Tang Sect

593
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,860
are both being

594
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
heavily suppressed.

595
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,060
But why we don't feel anything

596
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,460
at all?

597
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,260
Because his control
over his inner strength

598
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,340
is highly precise,

599
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,780
which means he can suppress

600
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,300
anyone

601
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,420
within his reach.

602
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,340
Who exactly is he?

603
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,540
Old geezer, what do you think?

604
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,900
Is this enough of a show for you?

605
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,220
Very well.

606
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,540
Now,

607
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,180
try killing me

608
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,620
with your strongest poisons.

609
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,580
Do not go easy on me.

610
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,780
Otherwise,

611
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,060
I'll kill you all.

612
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,220
Master,

613
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,660
what are you up to?

614
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,620
Dongjun.

615
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,020
Spear Deity.

616
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,740
Lianyue of the Tang Sect.

617
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,460
Watch closely.

618
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,220
Ten years of training can't even hope

619
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,220
to show you the knowledge
within this epic battle between sages.

620
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,980
Blossom Shower.

621
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,260
Is this...

622
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,580
It's said that

623
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,460
when the Blossom Shower is unleashed,

624
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,820
there is no way to escape it

625
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
or hide from it.

626
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,940
One's fate is sealed.

627
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,420
Unbreakable Vajra Shield.

628
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,100
He is a Buddhist after all.

629
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,340
Spirit Stride, the ultimate
Taoist technique.

630
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,060
Who exactly is this man?

631
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,610
He is a master

632
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,140
of both Buddhist and Taoist techniques.

633
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,260
Cinderless,

634
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,620

is known to be invincible.

645

However, every technique

646
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,700
has a vulnerability.

647
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,020
The Tang Sect has a hidden weapon

648
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,500
that can break any vulnerability.

649
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,340
Does it matter if we do that?

650
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,700
Given the phase he's in,

651
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,580
it will take more than a few needles
to take him out.

652
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,620
I have

653
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,540
my Three Character Mantra.

654
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,860
Fine. I trust you.

655
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,060

656

Blood must be shed.

657
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,300
It's bad omen to deal no harm.

658
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,900
It's the last resort,

659
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,340
the greatest of all hidden weapons.

I'll poison you to death!

662

Getting what one wishes for

663
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,460
is the way to having no regrets.

664
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,420
Old man.

665
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,980
You're the only one left.

666
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,860
No poison in this world

667
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,900
can outmatch this.

668
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,780

with the poisons you swallowed,

their effects kicked in together.

If I top it off with my Sage's Touch,

Well, do the honor.

Are you

679
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,220
going to kill me?

681
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,300
allows one to reach Heaven.

682
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,660
Are you giving up now?

683
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,940
If you've changed your mind,

684
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,980
kill me, and only me.

685
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,500
Leave the Tang Sect out of this.

686
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,460
Enough of this.

688
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,020

689
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,180
Have you lost your mind?

690
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,100

to reach Heaven,

00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,860
not a living soul

696
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,060
or creation in sight.

697
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,180
Most people only remember
the first half.

698
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,900
They forget people like this

699
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,220
will lose sight

700
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,940
of everything but themselves.

00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,130
[Mo Yi of Penglai Island]

702
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,700
Penglai shrouded in Jade Pool mist,

703
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,700
no immortal peaks in sight.

704
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,900
Mo Yi,

705
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,300
long time no see.

706
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,180
Where is your master, Taoist Qingfeng?

707
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,020
He passed away.

708
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,300
What is your purpose

709
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,580
for this sudden visit?

710
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,980
I missed my old friends

711
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,060
and wanted to see him.

712
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,700
But he already left.

713
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,020
What do you mean

714
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,660
by "left"?

715
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,340
I came to bid farewell.

716
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,140
However, I'm not meeting my demise.

717
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,340
My destination is far away.

718
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,100
The furthest land in the world

719
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,820
is Penglai.

720
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,310
Where are you heading?

721
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,140
Why come here to bid farewell?

722
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,540
I am going

723
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,260
into a woman's heart.

724
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,500
I took in a lot of disciples.

725
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,020
I like them a lot.

726
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,180
If they ever get the chance

727
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,620
to visit this place,

728
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,300
I'd like for you

729
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,020
to offer them a drink.

730
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,500
Put it on my tab.

731
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,740
But sir,

732
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,340
you bade farewell just now.

733
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,900
Isn't this supposed to be

734
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,420
the last time we meet?

735
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,620
In other words,

736
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,260
I can never pay you back.

737
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,460
Given all the unpaid debts in the world,

738
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,500
mine shouldn't make a difference.

739
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,140
The perfect beauty doesn't exist.

740
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,020
Only the loved one can catch those eyes.

741
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,260
Long time no see.

746
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,460
Scram.

747
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,180
The mortal realm is covered in frost,

748

You're him.

751
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,180
Why do you think of him

752
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,660
when I mention

753
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,380

Does that mean deep down in your heart,

he is your husband?

757
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,620
You...

758
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,660
Still as ill-tempered as always.

759
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,260
We shall meet again,

The heaven is too lonely.

763
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,500
Only I walk between worlds.

764
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,980
This is a place of the greatest delight.

765
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,060
Immortal...

766
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,500
Please take away

767
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,660
my immortality.

768
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,340
Master, wake up.

769
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,500
Don't worry.

770
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,380
He's alive.

771
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,180
What did you

772
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,020
do to him?

773
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,220
You fool.

774
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,020
Don't you get it?

775
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,260
Grandmaster Tang

776
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,180
and Mr. Li came up with this plan.

777
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,180
Their plan?

778
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,540
Indeed.

779
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,020
He came to me

780
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,820
and asked me to host
this elaborated act for him.

781
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,020
It's been over 300 years

782
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,220
since the founding of the Tang Sect.

783
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,660
It's one of the greatest sects

784
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,140
in the martial arts world.

785
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,220
If I helped you with this plan...

786
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,860
Old man.

787
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,060
Stop saying this.

788
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
I might as well

789
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,420
go to the Lei Fortress.

790
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,020
A disciple of mine
has Lei as his family name.

791
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,500
I am quite fond of him.

792
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,420
Given my bond with him,

793
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,420
I could help Lei Fortress.

794
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,940
I might help them become the leader
of the martial arts world.

795
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,580
What do you think?

796
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,020
Where were we just now?

797
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,140
Take a seat.

798
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,260
After centuries,

799
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,700
the Tang Sect hasn't changed.

800
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,260
You don't realize the magnitude

801
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,580
of this matter

802
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,100
until I bring up the Lei Family.

803
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,420
An epic love-hate relationship.

804
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,540
Come on, have some tea.

805
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,180
Then again,

806
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,380
why does Mr. Li

807
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,540
look like a young man?

808
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,540
Well, this is interesting.

809
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,180
King of Medicine, do you know something?

810
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,500
The ancient tree, Chun,

811
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,380
respectively goes through 8000 years

812
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,540
of spring and autumn.

813
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,740
I know a technique

814
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,820
known as the Dachun Art.

815
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,860
It's the ultimate art
of the Unbound Wind-Rider Sect

816
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,340
which is now nowhere to be found.

817
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,380
To master this technique,

818
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,580
one would need the medicine stone

819
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,740
and the effort of the entire sect.

820
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,100
Whoever masters it

821
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,500
must be the prodigy

822
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,740
of the century.

823
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,420
Once the technique is mastered,

824
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,700
that person can be young again
once every 30 years.

825
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,060
However,

826
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,220
I've never seen it.

827
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,740
I've only heard rumors.

828
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,180
But today...

829
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,020
Such a miraculous technique does exist.

830
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,900
It gives immortality.

831
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,260
So, what exactly is Mr. Li's goal

832
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,260
of doing all this?

833
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,500
If my guess is right,

834
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,860
he wants to disable this art.

835
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,180
To disable the art?

836
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,340
To disable the art.

837
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,860
Li Changsheng came to me

838
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,540
for my help

839
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,260
in disabling
the effect of the Dachun Art.

840
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,940
However, I alone did not have the power

841
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,500
to accomplish this.

842
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,340
Therefore, I made use
of the Poison Convention

843
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,740
to cripple the effect
of the medicine stone

844
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,060
of the Unbound Wind-Rider Sect
using powerful poisons.

845
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,660
Then,

846
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,100
he would have
to disable the art himself.

847
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,860
He even orchestrated

848
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,460
this showdown.

849
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,220
Those who watched

850
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,260
or joined the showdown

851
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,540
would have

852
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,420
substantial growth
in their mastery of martial arts.

853
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,500
Consider it his compensation for you.

854
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,140
But why did he want
to become mortal again?

855
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,060
Lianyue,

856
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,740
you are too young to understand it.

857
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,820
With mortality,

858
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,540
life is short.

859
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:08,050
But if you were given

860
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,500
8000 years to live,

861
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,220
would you be able to withstand

862
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,020
the endless loneliness?

863
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,660
You'd have

864
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,340
to watch
all of your loved ones pass away

865
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,580
until there's no one left but you.

866
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,180
Nonsense.

867
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,860
Master.

868
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,700
That felt nice.

869
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,500
Allow me to introduce myself.

870
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,820
I am Nangong Chunshui.

871
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,140
I am a gentle scholar.

872
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,300
Everyone.

873
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,740
This is where I bid you farewell.

874
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,380
I stirred up quite the commotion

875
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,900
because of my personal goal.

876
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,420
I hope you don't

877
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,660
hold it against me, Grandmaster Tang.

878
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,420
My fellow disciples

879
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,380
will be known across the world.

880
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:12,980
As for you,

881
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,580
you shall be their powerful rival.

882
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,060
With you around,

883
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,500
the Tang Sect shall stand strong.

884
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,380
Why? Are you a fortune-teller?

885
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,260
Since you brought that up,

886
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,620
I did work as one for a couple of years.

887
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,780
You two brats,

888
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,060
time to go.

889
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,900
Two?

890
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,100
Does that mean...

891
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,860
Sikong Changfeng.

892
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,700
What is it?

893
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,460
Nothing serious.

894
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,100
I wonder

895
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,180
if you're willing

896
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,300
to be my disciple.

897
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,100
What are you waiting for?

898
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,300
Say yes.

899
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,820
Rascal.

900
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,300
Say yes.

901
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,580
It's good to be his disciple.

902
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,740
Our contract

903
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,580
ends today.

904
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,020
From now on,

905
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,180
I'm only half a master to you.

906
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,380
Thank you, Master.

907
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,540
Very well. I accept the offer.

908
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,660
Kneel.

909
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,220
Master,

910
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,820
please accept my bow.

911
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:08,740
Very well.

912
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,460
From now on, you are a disciple

913
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,540
of me, Nangong Chunshui.

914
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,260
Get up,

915
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,500
my junior.

916
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,060
Baili Dongjun,

917
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,980
strictly speaking,

918
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,100
you are Mr. Li's disciple.

919
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,980
Don't take advantage of me.

920
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,660
I don't care. You're my junior.

921
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,220
Enough.

922
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,580
You two, it's time to move on.

923
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,780
Sure. I'll get the horses.

924
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,660
I've waited for too long.

925
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,260
I'm tired of it.

926
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,660
We'll fly there.

927
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,580
Grandmaster Tang,

928
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,580
you know where we're heading.

929
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,300
Please

930
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,900
send the carriage there.

931
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,660
I have a few jars of fine liquor in it.

932
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,020
I wouldn't mind having

933
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,540
a few jars

934
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,020
of the Tang Sect's Drunken World.

935
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,140
That settles it.

936
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,460
Let's go.

937
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,060
Wait, Master.

938
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,060
My uncles,

939
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,380
I'll take my leave.

940
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,700
Send my regards to my family.

941
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:08,740
I'm leaving.

942
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,820
Take good care of yourself.

943
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,260
Don't worry about me.

944
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,620
Enough chitchat. Let's go!

945
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,420
Master!

946
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,420
Don't forget Luoxia!

947
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,700
I have a hunch

948
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,100
you have a perilous future ahead.

949
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,580
Mind your own business.

950
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,580
[Xiaguan]

951
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,620
My disciples,

952
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,300
why do I feel nervous?

953
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,020
This is it?

954
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,140
Master,

955
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,060
aren't we going to Xueyue City?

956
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,140
But the sign says

957
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,100
"Xiaguan".

958
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,020
This city

959
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,140
was once called Dachanghe.

960
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,100
The first character
of the name means "big",

961
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,700
but it's a very small city.

962
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,740
The place is remote

963
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,860
with picturesque scenery.

964
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,140
It's peaceful.

965
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,580
Then, four peerless elites came

966
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,100
to live in seclusion.

967
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,100
And that somehow

968
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,860
attracted more people
to settle down here.

969
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,580
So the city expanded.

970
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,940
Later on, it was divided
into two districts,

971
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,500
named Shangguan

972
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,020
and Xiaguan.

973
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,300
Wind for Shangguan,
blossoms for Xiaguan.

974
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,460
Snow for the Cangshan mountain.
Moon for the Erhai Lake.

975
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,620
People then combined

976
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,260
the names of both districts

977
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,100
into Xueyue City.

978
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:33,700
Out of the four elites

979
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,420
I mentioned just now,

980
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,060
only the Sword Deity

981
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,780
had descendants.

982
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,900
The people elected this descendant

983
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,340
to become the city lord of Xueyue City.

984
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,340
The current city lord is a woman.

985
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,420
She loves dressing in red.

986
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,620
There is a cinnabar mark
between her brows.

987
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,260
Her beauty is peerless.

988
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,100
Her swordplay is invincible.

989
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,620
She is the woman I love.

990
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,020
I dream of her every day.

991
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,300
I love her so much.

992
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,780
Master, you must be truly nervous.

993
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,300
What?

994
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,300
People get chatty when they are nervous.

995
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,540
Master.

996
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,260
You're almost 200 years old.

997
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,740
You're still bound by human emotions.

998
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,580
Go away.

999
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,260
Someone is coming this way.

1000
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,700
Calm down.

1001
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,660
She is one of us.

1002
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,020
[Luo Shui, City Lord of Xueyue City]
Who are you?

1003
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,180
Long time no see, Miss Luo.

1004
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,460
Pardon the intrusion.

1005
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,180
I am Nangong Chunshui.

1006
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,100
I don't remember

1007
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:16,860
anyone

1008
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,380
by the name of Nangong Chunshui.

1009
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,860
That's because

1010
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,660
I had a different name

1011
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,940
when we first met.

1012
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,020
You...

1013
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,660
It really is you.

1014
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,860
Why are you here again?

1015
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,100
Master.

1016
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,180
She's the woman you're in love with?

1017
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,260
She doesn't

1018
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,420
seem to like you at all.

1019
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:45,980
Nonsense.

1020
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,100
Miss Luo and I

1021
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,220
are meant for each other.

1022
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,180
We made a vow of life when we first met.

1023
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,540
You're just a playboy
and a heartbreaker.

1024
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,060
Miss Luo, after so many years,

1025
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,900
you're still as ill-tempered.

1026
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,380
You're the greatest martial artist.

1027
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,580
I can't slay you.

1028
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,060
But I don't want to see you again.

1029
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:11,660
Scram.
