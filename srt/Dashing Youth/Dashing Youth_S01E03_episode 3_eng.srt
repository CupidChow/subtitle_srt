24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,000
Congratulations, Fifth Master Gu!

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,560
- Okay. Thank you. 
 - Please come in.

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,860
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

27
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,620
Come on in. This way, please.

28
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,500
- Come in, please. 
 - Thank you.

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,180

30
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,980
- Greetings, Chief. 
 - Please come in.

31
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,840
The Gu and Yan Families are forming a powerful alliance, you'll definitely be more prosperous!

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,060
Thank you. Please come in.

33
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,049
Sure.

34
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,900
- Congratulations, Fifth Master Gu. 
 - Thank you.

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,700
 Thank you.

36
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:38,186
Lord Huixi has arrived!

37
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:42,086
Amazingly, Fifth Master Gu succeeded in inviting someone as esteemed as Lord Huixi

38
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:43,466
Who is he?

39
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:46,246
Lord Huixi's father died while serving the country.

40
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:49,206
In sympathy for the family, His Majesty granted the title of Lord Huixi to him.

41
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:54,666
He's not considered one of the Nine Ministers, but the imperial court treats him like one.

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,926
Greetings, Lord Huixi. I'm honored that you could attend my nephew's wedding.

43
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:03,026
It's an honor indeed.

44
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:07,006
What a flatterer. He's a far cry from the Gu Family master.

45
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:13,443
Fifth Master Gu.

46
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,623
If one is used to being a lamb, they may survive under protection.

47
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:20,003
However, when a lamb starts to harbor thoughts of becoming a wolf,

48
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:26,863
either their fellow lambs or the wolf opponents will kill them.

49
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:32,543
Fifth Master Gu, good luck.

50
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,783
It's just a funeral.

51
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:46,183
Though it looks pretty grand.

52
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:47,483
It's a wedding.

53
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:49,623
It's all the same.

54
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:52,243
You've been waiting for seven days.

55
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:55,363
Gu Jianmen didn't come to see you?

56
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,123
Why are you so quiet?

57
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:05,063
Isn't this what you wanted?

58
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:08,203
If he comes to you, it would be good news for Dark River.

59
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:10,563
But for you...

60
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:15,503
You'd probably be disappointed, right?

61
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:17,723
- Su Changhe. 
 - What?

62
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:22,303
Perhaps there are times when you should keep your mouth shut.

63
00:04:26,623 --> 00:04:28,723
Something is happening on Longshou Street.

64
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,183
Looks like the show is about to begin.

65
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,706
Have you decided?

66
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:47,306
Once you take this step, there's no turning back.

67
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,426
I won't turn back!

68
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:55,546
All right! Then we won't look back!

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,866
You dared to come back?

70
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:30,706
Why not?

71
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:45,106
Sorry about that. This street is now ours.

72
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,666
Even the Eight Young Masters of Beili are here.

73
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,266
This is getting more lively.

74
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,206
- The two youngsters there... 
 - What is it?

75
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,966
You know those two foolish boys?

76
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:57,880
Not really.

77
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:03,606
When I approached Gu Jianmen last time, I ran into them.

78
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:05,166
One of them uses a spear.

79
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,726
He doesn't have many spear techniques, but he's talented.

80
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:10,806
It's probably untapped potential.

81
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:13,126
As for the other one...

82
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:14,886
What's with him?

83
00:06:14,886 --> 00:06:17,246
The other one doesn't seem to know martial arts.

84
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,906
I can't say for certain, though.

85
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:22,006
There's actually something you're uncertain about?

86
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,926
Looks like the Yan Family is taking over the Gu Family after this wedding.

87
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,446
Dear guests, you have come from afar to attend my nephew's wedding.

88
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:09,546
I'm truly grateful.

89
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,146
The auspicious hour has arrived!

90
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:29,826
Music! Let's welcome the bride and groom!

91
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,686
First, bow to Heaven and Earth.

92
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,306
First, bow to Heaven and Earth.

93
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:05,410
First, bow to...

94
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,086
 Hold on.

95
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,686
Why's the wedding begun when all the guests haven't arrived?

96
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,506
Is this how the Xinan Circuit Leader treats his guests?

97
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,366
- Who are you? 
 - A guest.

98
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:55,086
I think I've met him somewhere.

99
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:56,726
Do you know him?

100
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:59,326
Is he someone famous?

101
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:01,666
But...

102
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,946
It's impossible.

103
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:09,686
Young man, I don't think you were invited.

104
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:12,846
May I know why you're here?

105
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,826
To kidnap the bride.

106
00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:22,046
Kidnap the bride?

107
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:30,660
- Kidnap the bride? 
 - Yes, to kidnap the bride.

108
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,806
Young Shopkeeper.

109
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:36,246
Since we've met once before, here's a word of advice.

110
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:39,406
- Don't spout nonsense. 
 - How am I spouting nonsense?

111
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,766
You didn't invite me because you couldn't afford to do so.

112
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:46,006
But since I'm here, you should treat me like a noble guest.

113
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:53,580
Really? Young Shopkeeper, I gave you two a way out before.

114
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:59,306
But it seems like you don't want it.

115
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,186
He's got the urge to kill now.

116
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:10,526
Kill them.

117
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:54,940
I can't hold on much longer.

118
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,720
I don't think we can successfully kidnap the bride.

119
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,526
Let's run.

120
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:02,506
Trying to run?

121
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:05,806
Do you think the Yan Family are weaklings?

122
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:19,546
Why aren't they here yet?

123
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:23,826
These guys are tougher than I imagined.

124
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,746
Bai Dongjun probably can't hold on much longer either.

125
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,426
I hope they won't get themselves killed.

126
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:35,283
Sir, I drank so much of your booze for free.

127
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:37,963
Today, I'm going to return the favor!

128
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:41,280
As soon as I draw my spear, run as fast as you can!

129
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,100
Run!

130
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:50,863
Hurry, run!

131
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:53,343
I won't.

132
00:12:53,343 --> 00:12:55,203
Liuli!

133
00:13:04,303 --> 00:13:07,583
Fools. You got it wrong.

134
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:36,003
Xiao Bai!

135
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,623
 - What... 
 - Look at that!

136
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:53,387
 Run! Run!

137
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:54,950
Come back!

138
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,340
♫  The echos of hoofbeats under the eaves stops for me  ♫

139
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,709
♫  Amidst love and hate, only my fighting spirit remains eternal  ♫

140
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:06,863
♫  The hot blood boils, making it's mark on the skies above  ♫

141
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:17,703
After hiding for days, it's time to show us what you've got.

142
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:22,983
I knew it. It's indeed him.

143
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:27,983
A horned white serpent the length of ten men.

144
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:32,423
This serpent is Bai Liuli, kept by Wen Lin, master of the Wen Family.

145
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:35,023
Your surname isn't Bai. You're from the Wen Family!

146
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:38,983
Your surname is Wen. You're Wen Dongjun!

147
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:40,943
What an awful name.

148
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:43,023
Liuli grew up with me.

149
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:45,503
My grandfather gave him to me when I was born.

150
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,583
Also, my surname isn't Wen.

151
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,863
It's Baili. My name is Baili Dongjun.

152
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:53,823
He's from the Baili Family?

153
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:58,323
He's so fearless.

154
00:14:58,323 --> 00:14:59,830
What other Baili could it be?

155
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,406
It must be the Marquis Zhenxi, Baili Luochen's family.

156
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:07,066
His grandfather fought in wars alongside His Majesty.

157
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:11,726
That would be the Marquis Zhenxi, Baili Luochen, who killed thousands of enemies.

158
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:16,846
And his father, Baili Chengfeng, is known for his exceptional sword skills.

159
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:20,346
His mother is a renowned poison physician, and the Wen Family Master,

160
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:24,026
Wen Lin's most favored daughter, Wen Luoyu.

161
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:27,966
His uncle, Wen Hujiu, is known for his knowledge of poisons.

162
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:33,920
There really is no other family quite like the Baili family.

163
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,966
So, am I qualified to be your guest?

164
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:44,666
What did I say? Something really did happen.

165
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:48,886
Something more interesting than we expected.

166
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:53,666
Perhaps Dark River won't get to join in this round.

167
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:56,586
That's not a bad thing, though.

168
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,946
Isn't that Bai Liuli, the Wen Family's serpent?

169
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:21,646
Why is Bai Dongjun standing on its head?

170
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:26,626
I thought Poison Deity Wen gave it to his most favored grandson a long time ago?

171
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:30,666
That means Bai Dongjun isn't who he claims to be.

172
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:35,066
He's actually the young master of the Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion, Baili Dongjun.

173
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:38,246
Luo Xuan, what should we do?

174
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:44,566
If the Marquis Zhenxi learns about this, will he send his troops and crush the Lei Fortress?

175
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:47,946
I'm doomed!

176
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,266
They're here.

177
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:54,866
Who?

178
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:16,306
Perfect.

179
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:20,466
Luo Xuan. You and Liu Yue deal with things here

180
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:23,466
while Xiaohei and I move the coffin inside.

181
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,886
Why do it like that?

182
00:17:26,886 --> 00:17:28,966
Because both of you are too dashing.

183
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,770
If you go inside,

184
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,960
you'll steal my spotlight.

185
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:42,566
Miss.

186
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:52,326
 That lad. Why has he come to Chaisang?

187
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:55,740
- Sir, what should we do? 
 - There's only one thing we have to do.

188
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,334
- What? 
 - Retreat.

189
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:58,926
- Got it. 
 - Run.

190
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:00,446
Run!

191
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:05,026
Turns out you're the young master of the Marquis Mansion.

192
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:06,866
Welcome to my humble abode. Sorry for the poor hospitality.

193
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:09,366
Please forgive me.

194
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:28,586
I'm here to kidnap the bride.

195
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:32,206
If you're actually welcoming me, how am I supposed to do that?

196
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:40,726
So, are you guys going to kill me?

197
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:42,986
Today is my sister's wedding day.

198
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:45,186
I have a few questions for you, Young Master Baili.

199
00:18:45,186 --> 00:18:47,086
- May I? 
 - Go ahead.

200
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:49,206
You said that you wanted to kidnap the bride.

201
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:52,946
- May I ask if you know my sister? 
 - Not really.

202
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:54,646
Does that mean you're her secret admirer?

203
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:59,186
- There's someone in my heart that your sister can't compare to. 
 - Then why...

204
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:03,546
Come on, is this the right time to talk about your dream girl?

205
00:19:04,606 --> 00:19:05,786
You have a point.

206
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:07,746
Young Master, you come from a renowned family.

207
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,246
The Marquis Zhenxi is a hero who contributed to the establishment of Beili

208
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:12,366
and achieved great merit on the battlefield.

209
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:15,326
We have immense respect for the people of the Marquis Mansion.

210
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:19,866
If you're here for the wedding, I would gladly welcome you as our noble guest.

211
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:22,526
However, you don't know my sister.

212
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:23,966
And you're not her secret admirer.

213
00:19:23,966 --> 00:19:27,606
Yet you say that you're here to kidnap the bride? Don't you think you're going too far?!

214
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:31,166
Looks like you're in the wrong.

215
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:36,106
I'm here to kidnap the bride, but not for myself.

216
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:42,846
- What do you mean? 
 - I mean, the person who really wants the bride... is here.

217
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,946
- It's a coffin! 
 - A coffin?

218
00:19:49,946 --> 00:19:53,506
- This is outrageous! 
 - Exactly.

219
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,426
Gu Luoli?

220
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:02,206
That's right.

221
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:05,366
He's the one who's here to kidnap the bride.

222
00:20:05,366 --> 00:20:08,686
Gu Luoli, the former master of the Gu Family, was Miss Yan's childhood friend.

223
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:13,246
He always doted on her, and Miss Yan has always been in love with him.

224
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:17,266
Isn't it logical for him to come for the bride?

225
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:19,926
Presumptuous! He's dead!

226
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:24,066
- If not for you, would he have died? 
 - What does he mean?

227
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,146
Why don't you ask for my opinion first, Brother?

228
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,926
I, Yan Liuli, am willing to marry Gu Luoli!

229
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,306
You heard her, right?

230
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:49,306
As long as they're in love, he's still the same nonetheless.

231
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,586
No matter what becomes of him, as long as it's him,

232
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,946
his existence is unique and valuable to her.

233
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,786
Baili Dongjun.

234
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:06,706
Will you celebrate my wedding... with him today?

235
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:09,526
Of course. Why not?

236
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:16,646
Cheers.

237
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,906
This liquor isn't very good.

238
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:50,906
You should've ordered from me in advance. I could've given you a discount.

239
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,750
Kill him!

240
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:02,826
He wants to kill Young Master Baili and pin the blame on the Gu Family!

241
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:08,386
Master Yan. You know nothing about how the people from Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion do things.

242
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,546
And you don't know how I do things...

243
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,886
You must be mad. By law, you'll be beheaded.

244
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,806
Xiao Bai!

245
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,526
♫  In our youthful wildness, we travel the world with ease  ♫

246
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:02,617
♫  Seeking a ray of light in the shadows  ♫

247
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:05,677
♫  You and I wander side by side, exploring the vast world  ♫

248
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,677
♫  Facing the uncertainty of life and death  ♫

249
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,509
♫  As our dark hair turns white, the time passes  ♫

250
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:12,269
Xiao Bai!

251
00:23:14,337 --> 00:23:20,437
♫  In our youth we made righteous promises, shining bright like a ray of light  ♫

252
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:28,880
The Yan Family, who runs the jade business, and the Gu Family, who owns the bank,

253
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,026
are you sure you want to kill the young master of the Marquis Mansion?

254
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:33,346
And the Xinan Circuit, are you accomplices?

255
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:36,086
There isn't a crowd here anymore. There's only a few left. They've all run away.

256
00:23:36,086 --> 00:23:37,606
Shut up.

257
00:23:39,506 --> 00:23:43,110
He caught my eye during the fight on Longshou Street.

258
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:48,046
This child is an natural martial artist.

259
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,746
Did you know about this, Miss?

260
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,726
Indeed. I've met him before.

261
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,326
 An natural martial artist.

262
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,666
Then, why did you...

263
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:19,906
I have my reasons. Elder Chen, are you doubting me?

264
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:26,146
I wouldn't dare. But, Miss, we better not miss this opportunity.

265
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:30,646
As the Yan and Gu families fight, both are bound to suffer losses.

266
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:36,746
After this fight, even with the Eight Young Masters of Beili here, they won't have much energy left

267
00:24:36,746 --> 00:24:39,286
Why not wait until the battle is about to end,

268
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:43,606
and then take the natural martial artist.

269
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:46,646
What about our agreement with the Yan Family?

270
00:24:46,646 --> 00:24:49,787
Only the strong get to set the rules.

271
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:53,586
The weak should know that they'll be abandoned one day.

272
00:24:53,586 --> 00:25:00,086
Moreover, we lost the coffin and our bargaining chip with the Yan Family.

273
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:05,186
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom how the Yan Family

274
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:09,186
can be more important than the natural martial artist.

275
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,860
You're right, Elder Chen.

276
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,226
We'll do as he says.

277
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:22,766
Yes.

278
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,906
Why does it suddenly feel like we have nothing to do with this?

279
00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:31,066
It never had anything to do with us in the beginning.

280
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:57,766
Fifth Uncle. Before today, I kept telling myself you're my father's brother!

281
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,146
My brother's uncle and mine!

282
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:04,346
What are you saying? Because I'm your uncle

283
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:09,126
I was afraid the family would fall after your brother's death!

284
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:11,706
I carefully selected the perfect lady for you.

285
00:26:11,706 --> 00:26:13,286
All right.

286
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,360
Then let me ask you this.

287
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,340
Didn't you say that my brother died of an illness?

288
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:23,786
You said he was seriously ill, died in a place far from home,

289
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:26,626
and was buried there to prevent the disease from spreading.

290
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:32,558
Then, what do you have to say about the sword cuts on my brother's corpse?

291
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:37,626
Do you... call this an illness?!

292
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:39,586
- His death sounds suspicious. 
 - Exactly.

293
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:41,606
Li Suli!

294
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,366
Gu Jianmen, stop this madness!

295
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:55,106
This is our Gu Family mansion!

296
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:59,046
I am Gu Jianmen of the Gu Family! Why should I stop?

297
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,066
The Gu Family was born in troubled times and thrived for three generations.

298
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:09,846
We have always been number one in the Xinan Circuit, second to none!

299
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,906
Why did my brother become the master of the family at the age of sixteen?

300
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:23,306
He overcame countless challenges and worked his fingers to the bone.

301
00:27:23,306 --> 00:27:28,646
As for me, why did I leave at a young age for Tianqi to learn skills?

302
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:34,726
Why did Gu Family rise to fame for our business acumen but we still use martial skills to save our reputation?

303
00:27:34,726 --> 00:27:38,866
It's so we never have to compromise.

304
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:43,746
We don't compromise with anyone. We don't compromise on anything.

305
00:27:49,546 --> 00:27:53,006
Fifth Uncle. You aren't fit to be part of the Gu Family.

306
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,946
How dare you!

307
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:58,606
Do you think you're still under your brother's protection?!

308
00:27:58,606 --> 00:28:00,526
You're wrong.

309
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,766
It's been a long time since I needed his protection.

310
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,226
Guards, seize him!

311
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,906
Why are you all standing there? Seize him now!

312
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,106
Do you think the Gu Family really obeys you?

313
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:40,266
Some people are born to be the master of the family

314
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:44,906
because they have the aura that compels people to follow them.

315
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,306
That was my brother.

316
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,386
As for me, I will now inherit my brother's position!

317
00:28:53,386 --> 00:28:56,286
Fellow members of the Gu Family, listen up!

318
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:59,726
The current master of the family, Gu Luoli, was murdered!

319
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:04,466
We shall fight to the end to avenge his death!

320
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,886
 Fight to the end to avenge his death!

321
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:15,026
You traitors. You traitors!

322
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,546
The traitor has been disposed of. Time to slay our enemies!

323
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:29,966
You think this few of you can kill me?

324
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,306
Hey, I was sure I was the main lead earlier.

325
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:45,846
Why is he getting the limelight now?

326
00:29:45,846 --> 00:29:48,666
You? All you have is your family's reputation.

327
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:53,366
As for him, look. He relies on his sword.

328
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,626
I've almost lost. Aren't you going to show yourself?

329
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:32,566
It's the Gu Family Military Aura Sword.

330
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:37,426
Gu Jianmen. Since this is the case, we'll fight until one of us dies!

331
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:14,746
No need for any thanks.

332
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:17,486
We're all friends.

333
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:25,126
Thank you, Young Master Baili, and you, spear-wielder brother.

334
00:32:25,126 --> 00:32:26,866
Don't mention it.

335
00:32:40,986 --> 00:32:44,766
- It's you again. 
 - Yes, it's me again.

336
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:47,346
Why is there another group of people?

337
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:54,286
He really does have the natural gift of martial arts.

338
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:57,346
Get him!

339
00:33:25,226 --> 00:33:26,826
Sikong Changfeng!

340
00:33:31,266 --> 00:33:34,926
No one can save you today.

341
00:33:36,886 --> 00:33:39,786
Who dares to mess with my nephew?

342
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:43,326
Who's there?

343
00:33:45,546 --> 00:33:50,510

344
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:57,546
Wen Hujiu from the Wen Family?

345
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:01,706
Even if you're right, there's no prize.

346
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,206
Instead, you might just die.

347
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:15,526
You despicable scoundrel.

348
00:34:15,526 --> 00:34:18,106
You actually poisoned me?

349
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:22,206
That was a hilarious statement.

350
00:34:26,786 --> 00:34:28,706
To stop the Wen Family from using poison,

351
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:31,846
is the same as stopping a swordsman from using a sword.

352
00:34:31,846 --> 00:34:34,046
That would be plain foul play.

353
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:49,189
Who's next?

354
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,409
Retreat!

355
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:00,469
Leaving just like that?

356
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,089
Uncle.

357
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:07,769
Xiao Baili, are you hurt?

358
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:09,609
I'm fine, Uncle. What brings you here?

359
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,029
What do you think?

360
00:35:11,029 --> 00:35:16,829
Your family knew you'd only listen to me, so they sent me to bring you back home.

361
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:21,110
Fortunately, I came, or else you'd have been abducted.

362
00:35:21,689 --> 00:35:24,909
What kind of weird friends have you got here?

363
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:26,349
How would I know?

364
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:29,529
Maybe my liquor is simply too amazing.

365
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:32,769
Had enough fun today?

366
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:36,509
It's like when I've had the first taste of an exquisite bottle of liquor.

367
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,149
- What do you think? 
 - Hey...

368
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:43,309
Naughty boy. Xiao Baili, let me see. Come on.

369
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:55,829
Everyone, you do live up to your reputation.

370
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,909
 Senior Wen.

371
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:00,089
My nephew caused you a lot of trouble.

372
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:03,389
Uncle, you were late. You didn't see what happened. I did them a huge favor.

373
00:36:03,389 --> 00:36:06,149
Indeed. Young Master Baili is both brave and resourceful.

374
00:36:06,149 --> 00:36:09,049
- He's like a celestial soldier from the skies— 
 - Hey, hey, hey... Young Master Zhuomo.

375
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:12,769
We're in a rush. Please don't say anything more.

376
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:18,109
Young Master Gu, how are you planning to deal with this today?

377
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,149
We have avenged my brother's death.

378
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:22,589
As for the rest...

379
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:27,089
That depends on what the Yan Family will do.

380
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:34,069
Yan Bietian had no regard for justice and sowed discord between our families.

381
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:37,189
He deserved to die.

382
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:44,269
From now on I, Yan Liuli, will become the master of the Yan Family!

383
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:48,329
Fellow members of the Yan Family, do you have any objections?

384
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:59,569
If that's the case, that concludes today's wedding.

385
00:36:59,569 --> 00:37:01,809
The wedding will proceed.

386
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:04,729
I just won't be marrying you.

387
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:06,709
I'm marrying...

388
00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:11,049
him.

389
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:25,229
Interesting.

390
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:31,489
Since our business here is done, we'll take our leave.

391
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:47,329
Uncle.

392
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:52,569
Hey, Young Spear Deity.

393
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:55,369
Aren't you coming with us?

394
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:04,109
 Miss.

395
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:05,609
The mission failed?

396
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:07,189
 We failed, Miss.

397
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:09,049
Where's Elder Chen?

398
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:13,309
Wen Hujiu from the Wen Family was there.

399
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:15,349
And Elder Chen...

400
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:19,009
I understand.

401
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:22,469
Xin'er. Let's go.

402
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:26,349
I thought this was a dead city.

403
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:27,789
Of course not.

404
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:30,629
The Yan family took control of the area around the Gu Mansion.

405
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:34,300
After everyone heard about what happened earlier, they felt safe enough to come out.

406
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,069
Uncle. Xiao Bai came with me on this trip.

407
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:39,449
He was a great help and got hurt.

408
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:40,969
He's resting at the tavern now.

409
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:46,489
Don't worry. Someone will take him back to the Wen Family to recuperate.

410
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:56,549
I envy the close relationship the Eight Young Masters of Beili share.

411
00:38:58,189 --> 00:39:00,449
You've never had a friend like that before?

412
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:03,509
I had one.

413
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:08,069
 Brother Yun, you're so smart and good at studying.

414
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:11,249
 I'm sure you'll inherit your family's legacy, and become a great general.

415
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,829
 Why would I want to become a general?

416
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:15,949
 When I grow up, I want to travel the Martial World

417
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:19,369
 and become a free-spirited swordsman who brings justice to the people.

418
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:21,369
 Then take me with you!

419
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:24,049
 Sure. Let's make a promise.

420
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:25,549
 What promise?

421
00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:29,109
 When I'm 20 and you're 18, we'll leave Tianqi together.

422
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:30,869
 One of us will head north and the other will head south.

423
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,769
 We'll travel the Martial World alone.

424
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:37,229
 By the time we become deities, that's when we'll meet again.

425
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:39,029
 What do you think?

426
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:40,649
 Sure!

427
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,700
He's dead, though.

428
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,300
Dead?

429
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,700
We grew up together in Tianqi.

430
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,000
He was the only son of the General's Mansion

431
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,100
and I'm the sole grandson of the Marquis Mansion.

432
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,000
He could technically be my uncle, but we're about the same age.

433
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,600
We were best friends.

434
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,300
I have one now, though.

435
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,000
Uncle. There's something else I need your help with.

436
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000

437
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:34,700
You probably want to ask me why I didn't take Baili Dongjun with me back then.

438
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,400
You read my mind, Miss.

439
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,600
Back when Beique, Xichu, and Nanjue attacked Beili together,

440
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:48,100
Nanjue suffered a resounding loss, while Xichu and our Beique perished.

441
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:53,700
Royal father took us to Tian Wai Tian to retreat, cultivate, and master the Xunian Technique

442
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,200
so we could rebuild our country.

443
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,500
Only by bringing that natural gifted martial artist back

444
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,800
and helping my father complete his cultivation,

445
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,200
can we obtain the chance to rebuild our country.

446
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:12,300
You probably saw today that Baili Dongjun may be an natural martial artist,

447
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,800
but he doesn't know any martial arts.

448
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,600
- So that's why... 
 - Yes.

449
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,900
Xunian Technique is a powerful skill.

450
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,400
Given that he has no internal strength at all,

451
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,000
he might not be able to bear the immense power of it.

452
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,430
If he dies, as a result, Beique will lose

453
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:36,200
the only natural martial artist that can save us.

454
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:01,069
Uncle, are you craving liquor?

455
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:05,689
But I don't think we can finish so many jars.

456
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:09,700
You little... all you know is drinking.

457
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,500
This isn't for drinking.

458
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,900
- Then... 
 - It's to save his life.

459
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,900
Child, you saved my nephew's life.

460
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,500
That's why I will save yours.

461
00:42:26,229 --> 00:42:27,829
Really?

462
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,200
It's been so many years.

463
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,500
I sought help from lots of people, and traveled near and far to find a way to save my life.

464
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,000
Still...

465
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,600
I don't have a solution to fully cure you...

466
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,800
but I do have temporary measures.

467
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,800
I do have a question.

468
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,900
How are you still standing right now?

469
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,500
I won't be soon.

470
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:56,029
Sikong Changfeng?

471
00:42:56,029 --> 00:42:57,829
Sikong Changfeng?

472
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:00,709
That fast? He passed out that fast.

473
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,200
Uncle. What do you have in here?

474
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,800
Floral clams, blood spiders, three-tailed scorpions, and centipedes—

475
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,700
Wait. Why do you have so many disgusting things with you?

476
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,800
You're the disgusting one here. Your mother used to carry them, too.

477
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,900
Just leave the room and guard the door. Don't let anyone come in.

478
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,000
Rest assured.

479
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,100
In two days I'll give you a healthy and strong Sikong Changfeng.

480
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,200
Go on now. Go.

481
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,500
Young man. Why are you drinking all alone outside your room?

482
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,800
My friend is receiving treatment inside. He needs some peace.

483
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:45,989
You are...

484
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,900
- That ghost? 
 - Ghost?

485
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,900
That's the first time I've heard someone call him that.

486
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,949
Where we're from, he's the coolest guy around.

487
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:09,769
I don't think he's as good as me, though.

488
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,800
Sorry, but thank you for releasing us that day.

489
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,300
No worries.

490
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,100
Well then, friend.

491
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,600
Let's... meet again if fate allows.

492
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,300
See you later.

493
00:45:37,949 --> 00:45:40,829
What a bunch of weirdos.

494
00:45:50,629 --> 00:45:52,325

495
00:45:52,325 --> 00:45:55,000

496
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:04,600

497
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:17,500
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

498
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:25,200
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

499
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:34,700
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

500
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:43,100
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

501
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,200
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

502
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,600
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

503
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:53,100
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

504
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,400
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

505
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,000
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

506
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,900
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

507
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,400
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

508
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,900
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

509
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:15,300
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

510
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,600
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

511
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:24,400
♫  I met you  ♫

512
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:08,600
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

513
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:16,400
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

514
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:25,600
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

515
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:34,000
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

516
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,400
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

517
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,800
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

518
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,100
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

519

♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

520
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,000
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

521
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,100
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

522
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,600
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

526
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,500
♫  I met you  ♫
