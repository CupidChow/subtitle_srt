and the Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

138
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,820
You're using three powerful techniques

139
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,050
at once.

140
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,660
Aren't you afraid that your meridians
might be severed?

141
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,020
Since you wish to fight,

142
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,530

167

he became a lackey of Beili.

168

He's not a lackey!

169
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,060
He's a great general.

170
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,540

171
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,700
What?

172
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,060
Ye Yu is your father?

173
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,740
Fine.

174
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,580

From now on,

179
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,420

the top martial artist in the world!

181
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,380
Don't come near!

182
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:14,900
Get out of the way!

183
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,540
Yao?

184
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,380

185
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,980
It's me. I'm Yao.

186
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,980
Yao?

187
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,740
You're my daughter, Yao?

188
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,780
Father,

189
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,980
please stop.

190
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,540
It's not too late to turn back!

191
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
It's been so many years
since you saw me.

192
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,380
And now, you're trying to stop me?

193
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,620
Yao,

194
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,020
this is the final step.

195
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,980
We're just one step away from completing

196
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,220
the plot we've been harboring
for 20 years.

197
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,380
All of our efforts
might go down the drain

198
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,500
because of your actions.

199
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,140
Yao,

200
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,020
please think twice.

201
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,700
We'll be harming Father

202
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,340
and Beique for real

203
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,340
if we don't stop him.

204
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,300
Qing.

205
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,580
We shouldn't launch

206
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,980
an irreversible war

207
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,220
that we can never win

208
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,420
for the sake

209
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,260
of a ruined kingdom!

210
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,180
Fine.

211
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,980
If you guys insist on stopping him,

212
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,900
you need to kill me first!

213
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,540
You speak too much.

214
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,180
Now, no one can stop them.

215
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,220
Only the practitioner of Xunian Arts

216
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,260
can stop it.

217
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,700
What a coincidence.

218
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,660
It just so happens

219
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,900
that I know this stupid art.

220
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,180
Who are you?

221
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,380
Your son-in-law.

222
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,700
Yun,

223
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,940
I'm here.

224
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,540
Dongjun.

225
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,540
I never expected

226
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,300
the world to change this much

227
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,300
merely

228
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,660
after 20 years of retreat.

229
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,780
There are

230
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,420
three Xunian Arts practitioners

231
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,020
in the same era.

232
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,420
Excellent.

233
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,500
Today,

234
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,700
I shall absorb

235
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,140
both of your powers!

236
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,380
In your dreams!

237
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,220
Sky, grant me water!

238
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,220
Dongjun!

239
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,140
Yao.

240
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,220
Yao, it's futile.

241
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,140
This isn't something we can stop.

242
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,980
You all are done!

243
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,820
Dongjun,

244
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,140
I've already died several times.

245
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,100
Dying right now
won't make any difference.

246
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,580
Yun.

247
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,300
Bring it on!

248
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,620
Yun!

249
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,580
Don't do this!

250
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,580
You'll die from this!

251
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,620
Did you hear me?

252
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,180
You're still doing it?

253
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,300
Is this
the will of the heavens?

254
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,020
If that's the case,

255
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,180
let me

256
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,860
impart the rest of my powers

257
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,260
to you.

258
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,580
Yue Fengcheng, have you lost your mind?

259
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,660
Yun.

260
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,380
Yun!

261
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,900
Yun, don't do this!

262
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,060
Hurry and stop!

263
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,500
You'll die from this!

264
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,540
Who... Who's calling me?

265
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,620
Hurry and stop!

266
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,660
Yun!

267
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,740
It's Dongjun.

268
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,300
Yun, wake up.

269
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,780
Don't let it cloud your mind.

270
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,860
Yun!

271
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,500
Yun, hurry and come back!

272
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,740
Come back?

273
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,740
It's too late.

274
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,700
My family members are dead.

275
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,020
My master is dead.

276
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,300
My wife has been taken away as well.

277
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,100
Yun!

278
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,060
This world

279
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,100
was never kind to me.

280
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,700
Therefore, I shall

281
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,340
return the favor.

282
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,300
Baili Dongjun,

283
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,620
sorry for this.

284
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,180
- Father?
- Father!

285
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,220
Dongjun!

286
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,540
He managed

287
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,620
to merge all three of our powers.

288
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,580
Yun.

289
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,540
It's pointless.

290
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,860
He has

291
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,060
already gone berserk.

292
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,020
You.

293
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,140
Ye Dingzhi, stop it!

294
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,780
You have to die.

295
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,940
Yun.

296
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,220
Yun!

297
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,420
Please stop.

298
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,260
Please stop!

299
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,660
Father.

300
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,620
No.

301
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,740
Dongjun...

302
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,580
Yun.

303
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,340
Yun.

304
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,100
One's prime will never return,

305
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,660
just like the morning of the day
that does not repeat itself.

306
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,740
People say

307
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,660
Lord Wuxiang of Sky's Beyond

308
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,060
is a scholar.

309
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,820
No one expected

310
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,180
this scholar

311
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,410
to be several times stronger

312
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,700
than Lord Wuzuo.

313
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,740
You deserve my very best.

314
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,700
You've been exhausted for a long time.

315
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,340
You should take a break

316
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,340
before heading to the afterlife.

317
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,660
Thank you, Mr. Jun.

318
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,460
Many years ago,

319
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,580
I was fortunate enough
to encounter Mr. Li.

320
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,660
You're his eldest disciple.

321
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,420
I don't have any complaints

322
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,220
now that I'm dying at your hands.

323
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,500
However, even if I were to die here,

324
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,260
that doesn't mean it's our loss.

325
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,180
Do you truly think

326
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,340
that my junior and the rest

327
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,740
cannot stop your plan?

328
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,740
Do you truly think

329
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,700
that Yue Fengcheng

330
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,540
can become the top martial artist
in the world

331
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,580
and destroy the world

332
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,500
after reaching
the ninth level of Xunian Arts?

333
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,980
What a joke.

334
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,100
I do not argue
with those who speak foolishly.

335
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,420
I don't mean to sound offensive,

336
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,500
but how long will it take
for you to die?

337
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,820
Mr. Jun, sorry for disappointing you.

338
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,020
The cold wind on the icy plains

339
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,500
is freezing my wound.

340
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,500
I

341
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,900
might survive for two more hours.

342
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,420
But if you strike again,

343
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,780
naturally, I won't be able to live
for even a second longer.

344
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,020
Fine.

345
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,940
Let's make a bet, then.

346
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,020
If Yue Fengcheng arrives here first

347
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,820
within the next two hours,

348
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,300
I'll treat your wound

349
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,780
and allow you to live.

350
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,340
If

351
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,820
the sect leader is here,

352
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,700
that means he has mastered
his divine arts.

353
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,580
Naturally, he can treat my wounds.

354
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,020
I wouldn't need your help by then.

355
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,540
I'll kill him first.

356
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,020
After that, I'll save you.

357
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,060
Mr. Jun,
you're truly confident in yourself.

358
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,660
What if Baili Dongjun

359
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,580
arrives here first?

360
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,900
I'll still save you.

361
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:46,940
However,

362
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,180
you need to swear upon

363
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,780
Sky's Beyond's reputation

364
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,500
that you will never
leave this place until your death.

365
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,820
At the same time, you have to give up on

366
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,020
attacking Beili forever.

367
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,740
What do you think?

368
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,500
It seems like there's no harm

369
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,220
in taking the bet.

370
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,980
All right. Let's make the bet, then.

371
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,020
Baili Dongjun.

372
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,300
Don't you understand?

373
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,540
If so, I'll explain it to you.

374
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,300
When I was practicing
Demon Deity Sword Techniques,

375
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,940
the seed of demonhood
was already planted within me.

376
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,300
Although I suppressed it,

377
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,740
it didn't vanish completely.

378
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,780
After Wenjun returned,

379
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,660
I thought everything
would turn out better.

380
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,740
But I never expected it

381
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,700
to be a plot.

382
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,580
If one isn't strong enough,

383
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,260
they'll end up as pawns.

384
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,100
That's why my father was
accused of treason

385
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,420
and his entire clan was executed.

386
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,540
That's why my wife

387
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,580
was taken away on numerous occasions.

388
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,900
I could never live in peace!

389
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,740
Therefore,

390
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,780
from now on,

391
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,020
I no longer want to be a pawn.

392
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,780
I want to be the one
who controls the pawns.

393
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,580
Baili Dongjun,

394
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,260
stop being so naive.

395
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,660
No one will remain silly and innocent

396
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,020
for the rest of their lives.

397
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,340
The pain and suffering of the world
will change you.

398
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,460
Now, I'm Ye Dingzhi.

399
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,420
I'm no longer Ye Yun.

400
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,780
If I have to keep suffering

401
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,260
as Ye Yun,

402
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,020
I guess I've seen

403
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,340
and had enough

404
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,340
of such suffering.

405
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,100
Yun.

406
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,460
Yun.

407
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,740
You can stay where you are alone.

408
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,620
Dongjun!

409
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,620
Ye Dingzhi!

410
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,500
I've gone on a retreat here
for close to 20 years.

411
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,900
I aspired to reclaim Beique

412
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,620
and attack Beili.

413
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,700
But now,

414
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,460
my aspirations will be put to an end.

415
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,820
You're excellent.

416
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,130
Now, your body possesses

417
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,900
all three of our zhenqi.

418
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,420
You have enough power to rule the world.

419
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,820
You want to be the one
who controls the pawns?

420
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,620
If so, you can lead the clans
of the Northern Regions

421
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,940
and lay waste to the Central Plains

422
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,180
with their heavy cavalries!

423
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,740
You're dying by my hands.

424
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,220
Don't you hate me?

425
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,180
As heroes,

426
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:04,100
we cannot possess such ordinary
definitions of love and hate.

427
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,340
The thing I hate the most

428
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,340
is Beili.

429
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,700
Right now, we have

430
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,820
a common enemy.

431
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,220
If so, please inherit

432
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,700
my dying wish.

433
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,060
Become the top martial artist
in the world

434
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,940
and lay waste upon Beili!

435
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,620
He's here.

436
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,860
The result of this bet

437
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,140
is much more interesting
than what I had in mind.

438
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,140
I didn't expect

439
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,060
that none of us won the bet.

440
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,820
How come?

441
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,620
How could this be?

442
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,580
He has fallen into demonhood,

443
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,580
yet he has a human heart.

444
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,580
I think

445
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,420
he's a little stronger
than the ninth level

446
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,580
of Xunian Arts.

447
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,060
Are you Ye Dingzhi?

448
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,060
I am.

449
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,820
I cannot defeat you.

450
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,740
At least

451
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,140
I cannot kill you.

452
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,380
I don't wish to fight you either.

453
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,060
I'm curious as to what happened

454
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,260
within the deep icy plains.

455
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,620
Is Yue Fengcheng dead?

456
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,860
He is.

457
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,940
How did he die?

458
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,580
I absorbed all of his internal strength.

459
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,420
Initially, I wanted to kill him.

460
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,500
But Baili Dongjun
begged me to spare him.

461
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,380
Therefore, I spared him.

462
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,940
However, his meridians
couldn't withstand the shock.

463
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
Now,

464
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,220
I suppose he's dead.

465
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,980
How is it possible?

466
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,380
How is it possible?

467
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,700
But you're not that lucky.

468
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,940
You must die at my hands.

469
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,780
I've devoted my entire life

470
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,660
to the fruition of this plan.

471
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,340
In the end,

472
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,740
everything was still in vain.

473
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,940
Your devotion to this plan

474
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,060
has nothing to do with me.

475
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,380
Right now,

476
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,540
I should be

477
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,620
in the thatched cottage
outside Gusu City.

478
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,980
That area is warm all year round.

479
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,020
It's full of plants and trees.

480
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,140
I should be there

481
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,980
instead of this icy hell.

482
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,580
Even if you were to dwell
within an icy hell forever,

483
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,780
that wouldn't be enough
to redeem you of your sin.

484
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,860
Right now, you're a huge threat.

485
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,540
I know that.

486
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,420
But instead of worrying about me,

487
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,220
why don't you worry about that fellow?

488
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,940
I've absorbed all
of his internal strength.

489
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,420
He'll die too if you don't transfer

490
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,660
some of your zhenqi to him.

491
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,020
He traveled thousands of miles

492
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
just to save you.

493
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,940
But now, he's dying.

494
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,140
And you're leaving him in the lurch?

495
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,300
My zhenqi

496
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,980
will just hasten his death.

497
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,780
I know

498
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,940
you already have an answer
to my question.

499
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,020
But I still wish

500
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,980
to ask you this.

501
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,540
Why don't you come with us?

502
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,140
I can purify your demonhood

503
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,540
for you.

504
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,580
No need for that.

505
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,020
In the end, we'll be taking
two different paths.

506
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,380
If that's the case,

507
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,620
that means a fight is unavoidable

508
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,780
if we see

509
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,860
each other again.

510
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,860
If so, we should avoid each other.

511
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,940
What about him?

512
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,260
He's your best friend.

513
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,420
I don't deserve to be his friend.

514
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,540
Master, oh, Master.

515
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,780
You're right.

516
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,300
Disappointed people

517
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,820
do litter this world of ours.

518
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,500
Soul... Soul Official!

519
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,420
We're in trouble!

520
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,460
What is it?

521
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,100
An invader suddenly attacked us!

522
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,580
He's too skilled for us!

523
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,100
No one could stop him!

524
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,140
Was it a middle-aged scholar

525
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,500
and a youth clad in white?

526
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,580
It's me.

527
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,900
Ye Dingzhi?

528
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,860
Now,

529
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,740
you only get to utter one last sentence

530
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,540
before your death.

531
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,780
I hope you cherish your chance.

532
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,380
Everything was plotted

533
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,860
by Lord Wuxiang and I.

534
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,540
Do not kill Yue Qing!

535
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:03,940
My name

536
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,500
is Ye Dingzhi.

537
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,740
From this moment onward,

538
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,060
I shall be your new sect leader.

539
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,860
Those who are unsatisfied with my rule

540
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,860
shall die.

541
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,980
Tang Lianyue has left.

542
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,860
Sikong Changfeng has left as well.

543
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,740
Ji Ruofeng's stand

544
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,820
has always been ambiguous.

545
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,500
Of the Four Guardians of Tianqi,

546
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,700
you painstakingly established,

547
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,340
only Xinyue remained.

548
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,580
Don't you think it's a shame?

549
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,180
Senior Lei, you're still around,
aren't you?

550
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,140
The successor of the Sword Heart
and the legendary Lei Mengsha.

551
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,860
I have more than enough

552
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,900
with you two alone.

553
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,460
I'm just afraid

554
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,260
that external troubles will arise again
right after internal troubles subside.

555
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,460
I think

556
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,500
Beique was the one

557
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,300
behind Yi Wenjun's disappearance.

558
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,300
You're right.

559
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,020
Elder Wangyou wrote to me.

560
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,220
She said Ye Dingzhi and the child

561
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,300
went missing

562
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,140
in the thatched cottage
outside Gusu City.

563
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
Now, Yi Wenjun

564
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,500
has shown up in Tianqi City.

565
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,420
What about Ye Dingzhi?

566
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,220
Are you saying that he will...

567
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,860
I'm trying to figure out

568
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,340
what's in it for Beique

569
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,420
for them to do so.

570
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,180
As for Ye Dingzhi,

571
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
I'm not afraid

572
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,780
that he'll invade Tianqi.

573
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,860
I'm just afraid
that he won't invade it now.

574
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,820
I've also received some news.

575
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,220
Dongjun

576
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,260
has left Xueyue City.

577
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,820
What a time of turmoil.

578
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,700
I hope that my hunch

579
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,020
isn't correct.

580
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,100
If so, why did you
let Sikong Changfeng leave?

581
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,260
I can never make him stay.

582
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,820
He'll leave eventually.

583
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,340
Tianqi City is too small for him.

584
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,780
Only the martial world

585
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,980
can withstand
a dashing tempest like him.

586
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,980
But don't worry.

587
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,140
I have a contingency plan.

588
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,500
I made a promise to them.

589
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,140
What promise?

590
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,700
We made a promise

591
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,780
that as long as they hold a pass,

592
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,020
they'll appear

593
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,260
when someone

594
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,620
needs their protection.

595
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,900
If they die...

596
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,180
Even if I die,

597
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,300
my descendants

598
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:53,980
[Vermilion Bird]
cannot discard

599
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,780
this Vermilion Bird Pass, huh?

600
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Xiao Ruofeng does
think highly of me, huh?

601
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,500
How could a person like me

602
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,660
get married

603
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,140
and have descendants in the future?

604
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,300
Let's go! Time to travel the world!

605
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,700
Is he in the same state?

606
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,060
Ye Dingzhi's descent into demonhood

607
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,060
is a huge shock to him.

608
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,420
It's not that he cannot accept

609
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,940
what Ye Dingzhi

610
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,260
has done to him.

611
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,180
He just can't accept the fact
that he has lost

612
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,220
his best buddy entirely.

613
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,860
Compared to that,

614
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,620
I'm more worried...

615
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,700
About Dongjun's internal strength?

616
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,740
Dongjun's zhenqi

617
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,780
was emptied in an instant.

618
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,140
I'm sure his innerscape

619
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,420
was seriously damaged.

620
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,740
We need to get an expert

621
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,940
to reconstruct his innerscape for him.

622
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,980
If we don't treat his condition in time,

623
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,460
I'm afraid he won't be able

624
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,140
to practice martial arts again.

625
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,180
Martial Uncle, you're very powerful.

626
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,740
Do you have any solutions to this?

627
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,420
I don't.

628
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,100
The only expert I can think of

629
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,340
is Master.

630
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,140
But now,
Master's whereabouts are unknown.

631
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,660
No one knows where he is.

632
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,060
At the immortal mountain beyond the sea.

633
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,820
The immortal mountain beyond the sea?

634
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,340
That's right.
Why didn't I think of that?

635
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,980
If so,

636
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,500
I suppose you two were there before?

637
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,780
When Dongjun and I
were still in Xueyue City,

638
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,740
we traveled to many places.

639
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,580
We were lucky enough
to travel to the immortal mountain

640
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,380
and encounter Mr. Mo Yi

641
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,500
there.

642
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,980
Mr. Mo Yi?

643
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:53,980
I'm sure

644
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,060
Mr. Mo Yi has that kind of power.

645
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,140
Excellent!

646
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,580
However, I'm afraid

647
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
I cannot head

648
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,260
to the immortal mountain beyond the sea
with you guys.

649
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,740
But why?

650
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,020
The deities there

651
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,860
will only see the people
they wish to see.

652
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,900
Years ago,

653
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,820
I committed a wrong deed.

654
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,700
Due to that,

655
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,180
whenever I'm near the immortal mountain,

656
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,700
the waves will engulf my boat.

657
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,100
Martial Uncle, what did you do?

658
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,660
Years ago,

659
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,700
I laid waste to the mountain

660
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,500
with my sword.

661
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,940
I've injured many people there.

662
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,100
I also tore down
some of the temples there.

663
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,180
In the end, I burned down the mountain

664
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,980
out of rage.

665
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,900
Mo Yi and his master

666
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,740
came from that mountain.

667
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,020
Anyway,

668
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,740
it's all in the past now.

669
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,140
We should think of a way

670
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,860
to persuade Dongjun to act.

671
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,020
Yun.

672
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,820
I don't understand.

673
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,620
I'm Ye Dingzhi.

674
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,060
I'm no longer Ye Yun.

675
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,060
If I have to keep suffering

676
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,420
as Ye Yun,

677
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,060
I guess I've seen

678
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,740
and had enough

679
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,060
of such suffering.

680
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,100
You can stay where you are alone.

681
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,260
Dongjun?

682
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,380
Dongjun.

683
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,060
Dongjun.

684
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,060
This is bad.

685
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,060
Thank you, Junyu.

686
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,460
Your innerscape has been damaged.

687
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,100
Do not attempt to regulate
your breathing on your own.

688
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,460
It's pointless.

689
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,940
Could I lie to myself

690
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,860
and say

691
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,060
that Yun spared me

692
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,500
if I had a sliver
of internal strength left?

693
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,340
Ye Dingzhi

694
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,020
did spare you, but...

695
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,980
Anyway, you're

696
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,860
in a terrible condition now.

697
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,900
Just now, Yue Yao and I

698
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,620
thought of a solution.

699
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,540
She'll join you

700
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,820
in seeking the immortal mountain
beyond the sea.

701
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,620
Both of you will seek Mo Yi's help
to reconstruct your innerscape.

702
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,420
What do you think?

703
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,340
People say that
one will lose their sharpness

704
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,700
after living in Tianqi City
for a long time.

705
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,900
I guess that's true.

706
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,180
As if!

707
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,140
What...

708
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,860
What are you doing here?

709
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,020
You didn't utter
a single word that night.

710
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,580
I... I thought you already rejected me.

711
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:42,700
Well...

712
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,220
Don't run from me!

713
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,460
Don't be angry at me.

714
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,380
I wanted to find you

715
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,500
before I left the city.

716
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,620
But I was worried
that you might find me annoying.

717
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,500
Feng Qiuyu,

718
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,580
do you fancy me as well?

719
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,340
So that Ji fellow

720
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,340
didn't deceive me after all.

721
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,340
What have our affairs

722
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,500
got to do

723
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,500
with that masked fellow?

724
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,100
Why is he making the call here?

725
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,620
No. You make the call here.

726
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,500
Let's stop and talk.

727
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,060
From now on,
I'll do whatever you say, okay?

728
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,500
Feng Qiuyu, don't run away from me!
