You're too old to be an apprentice,

189
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,380
but I have no other candidates here.

190
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,860
I'll just have to make do.

191
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,460
Farewell.

192
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,860
Fine. Six months.

193
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,420
I'll save you

194
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,500
and you keep me company
here for six months.

195
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,460
Just six months?

196
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,540
Yes.

197
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,180
Maybe after six months,

198
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,300
you'll want to stay.

199
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,660
Sure.

200
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,180
What's the matter?

201
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,580
Sir,

202
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,260
it's Mr. Zhuomo.

203
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,740
Heading to Qiandong City, Feng?

204
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,620
I knew that

205
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,700
with your temperament,

206
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,900
you would

207
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,300
rush here at once.

208
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,180
And,

209
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,300
with my wit,

210
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,780
I know that you'll pass by here.

211
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,540
What do you think?

212
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,460
Isn't my prediction

213
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,380
precise?

214
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,620
Compliment me.

215
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,020
Father.

216
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,500
I have news from Tianqi City.

217
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,180
It's about the Little Master
from the Academy.

218
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,340
My dear father.

219
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,940
The sun hasn't even come out yet.

220
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,180
What are you doing?

221
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,940
Your uncle told me
that you wanted to learn swordsmanship.

222
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,100
So get up and practice.

223
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,740
You little brat.

224
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,900
He falls asleep here.

225
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,620
How rude.

226
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,900
Carry your sword.

227
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,460
A good swordsman

228
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,820
does not put his sword away randomly.

229
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,300
Are you going to teach me?

230
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,820
Isn't it obvious?

231
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,780
I don't want you to teach me.

232
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,820
Why?

233
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,940
You don't think I'm good enough?

234
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,620
Look.

235
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,220
What do you think of this sword?

236
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,820
Celestial Level Sword
is naturally among the best ones.

237
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,580
Yes.

238
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,660
If I have the best sword,

239
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,980
I must be tutored

240
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,220
by the greatest swordsman.

241
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,380
Mr. Li from Jixia Academy

242
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,140
in Tianqi City is the strongest

243
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,660
individual at the moment.

244
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,180
Since I can't head to Tianqi City,

245
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,140
just find me

246
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,900
someone of his caliber.

247
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,060
What a brat.

248
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,220
Like I said,

249
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,500
a good swordsman

250
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,140
does not put his sword away randomly.

251
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:33,900
Give it back.

252
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,860
There you go.

253
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,220
Now, use it.

254
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,300
Sure.

255
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,140
That's how you wield a sword?

256
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,220
Again.

257
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,340
Why bother?

258
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,220
Learn how to draw it first.

259
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,700
There you go.

260
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,700
This is how you draw a sword.

261
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,540
This is the unsheathing technique

262
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,260
of my Instant Kill Sword Arts.

263
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,100
I could only master the basics

264
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,460
of the sword technique
my master taught me.

265
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,740
Yet I remember a line

266
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,260
from him.

267
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,340
You must have a reason
to draw your sword,

268
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,060
and when you sheathe, it means
you have completed your mission.

269
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,940
The sword wave must be fast
like lightning,

270
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,740
yet silent.

271
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,020
Always know

272
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,700
why you draw your sword.

273
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
From now on,

274
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,500
you will be confined

275
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,260
to this yard.

276
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,500
You may only leave

277
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,380
once your unsheathing technique

278
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,980
is strong enough

279
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,100
to slice this scarecrow in half.

280
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,140
It's just unsheathing.

281
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,620
But that looks cool.

282
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,500
[Ten Days Later]

283
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,300
I don't understand.

284
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,980
Must we

285
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,580
wear this outfit?

286
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,460
Because Master said

287
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,780
that white
best suits a refined gentleman.

288
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,580
And this is what a disciple
of the Academy should look like.

289
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,660
Unlike you,

290
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,380
I hate white.

291
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,780
The point is it's too much trouble
to wash it.

292
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,860
If it is stained

293
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,300
with dust,

294
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,380
isn't it the opposite

295
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,860
of being a refined gentleman,

296
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,540
like Master said?

297
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,740
Master knew

298
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,940
you would complain,

299
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,380
so he told me to tell you

300
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,300
that this was a ritual.

301
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,900
[Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion]

302
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,580
You and Marquis

303
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,380
forced Dongjun to practice swordsmanship
in the backyard

304
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,380
to avoid somebody, didn't you?

305
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,140
The Little Master from the Academy.

306
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,180
Little Master

307
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,700
is not that person's only identity.

308
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,220
But a mere backyard

309
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,700
cannot possibly hold Dongjun captive.

310
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,540
What if he cuts the scarecrow

311
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,660
in half with one slash?

312
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,580
Talented as he may be,

313
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,100
he can't even master

314
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,980
the basics

315
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,340
of unsheathing skill within a few days.

316
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,260
Without any internal strength
as his foundation,

317
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,740
he won't be able to do it
even after a month.

318
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,180
What if he has internal strength?

319
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,500
Hujiu, that's impossible.

320
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,500
Sir.

321
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,260
What's the urgency?

322
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,100
Envoys from the Academy are here.

323
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,100
He must be Baili Chengfeng,

324
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,940
the son of Marquis of Zhenxi.

325
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,060
He's Baili Dongjun's father?

326
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,420
He's a powerful one.

327
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,620
Sir.

328
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,780
Greetings, Little Master.

329
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,220
Internal strength?

330
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,900
How come Dongjun has internal strength?

331
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,700
He doesn't seem to be aware of it.

332
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,100
To cultivate his internal strength

333
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,460
in secret

334
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,220
by using liquor brewing

335
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,740
as a cover-up...

336
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,940
Perhaps

337
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,340
this is the Sly Path Father mentioned.

338
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,580
Baili.

339
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,580
You can't hide for long.

340
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,100
How's that?

341
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,100
But Young Master,

342
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,820
this scarecrow

343
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,340
is still the same.

344
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,140
Impossible.

345
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,580
Why is it

346
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,100
unaffected at all?

347
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,820
It shouldn't be.

348
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,620
I used

349
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,180
all my strength.

350
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,700
What stupid sword is this?

351
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,660
A Celestial Level Sword?

352
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,740
It can't even slash through a scarecrow.

353
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,220
I'm done.

354
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,940
Young Master.

355
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,820
You can't leave now.

356
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,660
After the previous time,

357
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,820
your father has begun to suspect me.

358
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,860
If I release you,

359
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,460
he'll think we collude together

360
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,740
and we will be found out.

361
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,300
Fine. I'll stay.

362
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,740
Ask my grandfather to rescue me.

363
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,860
But

364
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,700
he already dropped by this morning.

365
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,020
Grandfather came?

366
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,580
He looked at you from outside

367
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,940
and said, "Not bad",

368
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,100
before going to the camp.

369
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,220
They even bought Grandfather off.

370
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,460
Great.

371
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,860
This is irritating!

372
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,980
Rui, what do you think

373
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,820
is the best way

374
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,260
to leave this backyard?

375
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,060
Knock me out and forcibly get out.

376
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,820
Or...

377
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,420
master the unsheathing skill.

378
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,180
Young Master...

379
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,460
It's just unsheathing a sword.

380
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,100
I'll do it.

381
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,460
This is...

382
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,740
Me?

383
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,060
I'm also a disciple of the Academy.

384
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,900
However,

385
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,340
I'm not an envoy.

386
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,460
I came to Qiandong City

387
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,420
to meet a friend

388
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,100
to catch up.

389
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:47,980
Sir,

390
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,660
just pretend that I'm not here.

391
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,820
This senior brother of mine

392
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,220
comes from the martial arts world.

393
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,580
Please do not mind

394
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,540
his manner of speech.

395
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,780
So you too

396
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,660
are a disciple of Mr. Li.

397
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,300
Halt.

398
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,140
Do not be shaken

399
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,740
by that old man's reputation.

400
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,900
He's

401
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,460
just

402
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,340
an ordinary and fussy old man.

403
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,460
Do you know how fussy he is?

404
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,100
I hate to wear this.

405
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,100
But what can I do?
It's the Academy's rules.

406
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,380
Sir,

407
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,260
please don't be offended.

408
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,740
Of course, not.

409
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,940
May I know

410
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,260
how many people do you wish to take

411
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,180
from Qiandong City?

412
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,500
What if...

413
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,980
it's just one individual?

414
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,300
The Academy sure has
a strict requirement.

415
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,420
You came all the way

416
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,940
to Qiandong City

417
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,740
to recruit one person only?

418
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,700
You're mistaken.

419
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,580
Am I?

420
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,980
Tell me, Sir.

421
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,900
How many cities

422
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,060
do we have in Beili?

423
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,300
163 in total.

424
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,860
We recruited only one disciple
during a particularly

425
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,060
unfruitful year,

426
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,100
and admitted six disciples at most
during the very opposite.

427
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,620
In this vast world,

428
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,980
many people

429
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,380
want to join us.

430
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,060
Forget about the world.

431
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,020
In Tianqi City alone,

432
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,340
many prestigious families

433
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,620
and wandering martial artists

434
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,980
came to join us.

435
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:27,980
Therefore,

436
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,180
to take one person

437
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,820
from Qiandong City

438
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,340
is already quite a lot,

439
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,060
not too few.

440
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,500
Too many, even.

441
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,460
What if the person isn't here?

442
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,540
You might have to come with me

443
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,220
to Tianqi City then.

444
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,580
My master speaks highly

445
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,420
of your talent,

446
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,700
it's just

447
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,620
you're a bit old.

448
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,860
I'm done.

449
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,540
I'm so tired.

450
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,220
We'll do it another day.

451
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,540
Another day.

452
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,620
Bravo!

453
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,900
Rui,

454
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,180
bring me the liquor.

455
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,060
Marquis is back!

456
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,780
Sir.

457
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,060
Take a seat.

458
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,060
You came all the way

459
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,140
to my mansion.

460
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,740
Yet you came veiled.

461
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,860
Why? You don't want me

462
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,340
to see your faces?

463
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,740
I came to visit

464
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,100
on behalf of the Academy.

465
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,980
My son already explained to me

466
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,900
the purpose of your visit.

467
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,900
My Pofeng Army

468
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,900
has many talented individuals.

469
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,140
I shall bring them here later

470
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,580
for you to choose.

471
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,820
It's not urgent.

472
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,660
Why isn't

473
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,060
Young Master Baili here?

474
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,860
My grandson is a naughty one.

475
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,100
He left the city two days ago.

476
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,900
Little Master,

477
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,580
pay him no attention.

478
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,660
Don't say anything.

479
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,580
Listen to me.

480
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,780
It's not

481
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,220
that I don't know
how to unsheathe my sword.

482
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,300
I just

483
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,220
don't want to. Do you understand?

484
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,780
Cheers.

485
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,100
Sword...

486
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,540
Sword...

487
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,100
Where is my sword?

488
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:50,820
Sword...

489
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,420
Young Master,

490
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,620
you may rest today.

491
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,940
I'll tell your father that...

492
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,820
No need to...

493
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,340
No!

494
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,820
The timing is just right.

495
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,660
I feel

496
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,740
so full

497
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,500
of energy now.

498
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,500
Little Master,
the guest chamber is this way.

499
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,420
Can you sense

500
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,780
that formidable internal strength?

We finally meet.

516
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,180
Have we met before?

517
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,100
Who are you?

518
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,980
My surname is Xiao.

519
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,420
I am

520
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,300
Baili Dong...

521
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,540
Dong...

522
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,580
Jun...

523
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,740
I know.

524
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,860
About the Academy,

525
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,220
I think

526
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,260
I have my answer.

527
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Sir,

528
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,300
that slash from your son

529
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,100
was exquisite.

530
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,020
Finally, I failed to prevent it.

531
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,220
You should have known

532
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,300
from the beginning

533
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,740
that he cannot remain hidden.

534
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,700
It's only been ten days.

535
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,540
How did Dongjun make

536
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,100
so much progress with his swordsmanship?

537
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,180
Perhaps like you said, his body

538
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,620
houses

539
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,300
the internal strength
of a powerful fighter?

540
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,340
Rui.

541
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,500
Yes, Sir?

542
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,980
What did Dongjun do

543
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,700
before he unsheathed?

544
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,860
He didn't do anything

545
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,860
except for drinking.

546
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,460
He drank for several hours

547
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,980
and even finished all the liquor
he had hidden

548
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,980
in his chamber.

549
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,780
Just like

550
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,220
that time at Famous Swords Manor,

551
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,300
he drank a lot there.

552
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,460
It seems like

553
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,860
when he's

554
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,020
tipsy,

555
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,020
the power inside his body

556
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,900
will appear.

557
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,900
It's all his doing.

558
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:29,300
[Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion]

559
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,300
As I

560
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,380
have completed my duty

561
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,460
as Little Master,

562
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,220
it's time for me to complete

563
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,460
the task Father gave me.

564
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,100
I'll come with you.

565
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,020
You should stay and keep a close watch

566
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,340
on our future junior here,

567
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,260
in case he is hidden somewhere else.

568
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,660
Sorry, Father.

569
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,060
They discovered Dongjun.

570
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,860
He took a look and left?

571
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,180
Sirs,

572
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,300
Little Master left the mansion

573
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,140
and headed toward the court.

574
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,420
He's on the move.

575
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,740
He did say

576
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,180
that he came

577
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,940
on behalf of the Academy.

578
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,740
That means His Majesty is not

579
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,620
holding me accountable
for Western Chu's Scholarly Deity.

580
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,780
He only sent

581
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,020
his most trustworthy son

582
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,060
to deal with the Scholarly Deity

583
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,260
in secret.

584
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,060
Chengfeng, once they
are at the courtyard,

585
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,860
dispatch more men

586
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,260
to block all ingress and egress.

587
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,980
Irrelevant personnel
are not to enter or leave.

588
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,620
Quickly.

589
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
Jixia?

590
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,460
You're here on behalf of the Academy?

591
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,860
I'd love

592
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,380
to represent the Academy.

593
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,260
Unfortunately,

594
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,140
I'm here
on behalf of the imperial court.

595
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,780
So what do you want?

596
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,980
You are the remnant of Western Chu.

597
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,540
You must be detained

598
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,140
and charged
by the Court of Judicial Review.

599
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,860
Many people

600
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,180
can do that,

601
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,500
such as the local prefecture,
the Court of Judicial Review,

602
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,540
or even the Shadow Guard Office
under the Crown Prince.

603
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,260
Why you, a member of the Academy,

604
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,060
are in charge of this?

605
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,540
You must

606
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,980
have a unique identity.

607
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,460
Your surname is Xiao?

608
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,300
He asked you to come here

609
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,860
to earn some merits

610
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,380
and to earn

611
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,700
the achievement

612
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,300
of detaining a Western Chu's remnant
like me.

613
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,580
Sir,

614
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,620
you are indeed someone
who's as powerful as my master.

615
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,220
Among the princes,

616
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,180
which one are you?

617
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,740
I'm the ninth one.

618
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,660
As a swordsman,

619
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,100
I have nothing but respect for you.

620
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,100
However,

621
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,660
this has nothing to do

622
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,860
with my desire to take you with me.

623
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,380
You think

624
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,860
you can take me with you?

625
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,060
I would like to try.

626
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,740
Oh right.

627
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,300
My name

628
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,860
is Xiao Ruofeng.

629
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,260
I see.

630
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,340
Xiao Ruofeng.

631
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,060
Is that all you've got?

632
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,620
Is this the sword technique

633
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,900
taught to you by your master?

634
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,660
My master possesses a sword technique.

635
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,060
He calls it
the second-best sword technique.

636
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,020
I cannot master it,

637
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,620
nor am I strong enough to grasp it.

638
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,820
However,

639
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,060
I also have my own sword technique.

640
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,660
I call it

641
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,060
the third-best sword technique.

642
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,660
Great.

643
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,540
What a good name.

644
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,180
Now, take my sword.

645
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,060
Uncle,

646
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,940
what are you doing here?

647
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,180
Did you have a good sleep?

648
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,220
How are you, Dongjun?

649
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,460
Mengsha.

650
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,940
You're here too?

651
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:39,940
Wait.

652
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,180
Before I fell asleep,

653
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,420
did I meet someone?

654
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,660
He told me his surname was Xiao.

655
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,660
Was I dreaming?

656
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,780
He is the Ninth Prince, Xiao Ruofeng.

657
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,900
Also the Little Master from the Academy.

658
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,780
He came for my master.

659
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,780
How smart of you.

660
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,900
But he was also here for you.

661
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,260
I need to see my master now.

662
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,220
You finally admitted

663
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,500
that you have a master.

664
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,660
I need to save him.

665
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,860
Even if it means I'll die,

666
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,580
I'll save him too.

667
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,820
Uncle,

668
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,900
I'll give you ten pots
of Plum First blossom.

669
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,620
Let me go.

670
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,660
And 20 pots of Frosty Pine,

671
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,660
30 pots of Illusory Moon,

672
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,180
plus this Dustless.

673
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,060
You can have them all.

674
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,100
I don't need your sword.

675
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,620
But as for all those liquors
you mentioned,

676
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,820
you have to give me all of them.

677
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,380
Let's go.

678
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,220
Mr. Zhuomo.

679
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,380
Are you stopping us?

680
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,460
If I'm not mistaken,

681
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,620
he's in the Sovereign Sky Phase.

682
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,220
I won't be able to take him out.

683
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,980
I'll just tag along.

684
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,740
[Lord Wutian, Lord Wufa, Sky's Beyond]

685
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,820
Crushing Palm.

686
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,340
That's right.

687
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,820
Cover our back, you two.

688
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,060
You're too weak

689
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,100
to take me with you.

690
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,580
A spar with you

691
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,020
has shown me the wide gap between us.

692
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,740
Forgive my arrogance.

693
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,940
The young men should be arrogant

694
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,780
and fearless.

695
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,860
You have potential.

696
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,460
I won't kill you.

697
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,980
I am not long for this world.

698
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,940
Thus, I am no threat

699
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,780
to Beili.

700
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,340
My biggest wish

701
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,940
is to pass down my swordsmanship

702
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,020
to my disciple.

703
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,420
Then Beili
will continue to hunt you down

704
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,060
because your disciple

705
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,660
carries the surname of Baili.

706
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:10,820
Who's there?

707
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,220
I am Wufa.

708
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,780
I am Wutian.
