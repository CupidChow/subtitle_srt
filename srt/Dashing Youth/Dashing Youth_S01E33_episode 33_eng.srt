00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:15,790

2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,800
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,840
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,500
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,820
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,533
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost   ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,220
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,600

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,320

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,000

23
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,275

25
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,460
Are you still sleeping?

26
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,400
Wake up. The Martial Ranking will be announced this year.

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,300
Where would you like to be ranked?

28
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,680
Yao'er, I’ve held the top spot on the Jade Ranking for three consecutive years.

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,700
Including the two years Ji Ruofeng bragged about me, it’s been a total of five years.

30
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,820
I should definitely get into the Top-Rank List this year.

31
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,940
The Top-Rank list?

32
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,720
You're bragging.

33
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,360
When I left Qiandong City for Tianqi,

34
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,020
no one thought I’d reach the Jade Ranking, right?

35
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,560
Not to mention others, even my parents didn’t believe it.

36
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,480
Therefore, in this world, what truly scares us

37
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,300
is the fear of even daring to think about it.

38
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,460
Not to mention that I have a master who’s a great bragger.

39
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,620
As his disciple, I only want to become the greatest martial artist.

40
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,500
That's normal.

41
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,780
Yao'er.

42
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,820
You know what? Sometimes I think the title of the world’s best is just waiting for me.

43
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,500
It’s not that I’m looking for it. It’s that it’s waiting for me.

44
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,120
You used to say things like that only when you were drunk.

45
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,300
I’ve been traveling for years and have seen the vast world.

46
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,280
The liquor is already in my heart.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,100

48
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,840
You, the third on the Top-Rank List, everyone in Xueyue City is looking for you to celebrate.

49
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,400
How could you hide here and idle away?

50
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,100
What about you, Hanyi?

51
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,900
Sixth in the Jade Ranking.

52
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,100
What about the first place?

53
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,760
The top one in the Jade Ranking is Zhao Yuzhen of Mount Wangcheng.

54
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,875

55
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,240
Senior, I've never fought anyone. How did I reach the top?

56
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,550
You've gone from being the youngest contestant to the youngest top of the Jade Ranking.

57
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:46,226
Zhao Yuzhen of Mount Wangcheng.

58
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,780
You look unconvinced.

59
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,780
What are you going to do?

60
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,620
I'm thinking I need to face him and test his skills.

61
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,680
Wenjun.

62
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,540
Wenjun, what's wrong?

63
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,880
Are you all right?

64
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,060
Is the baby bullying you again?

65
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,280
I suddenly feel like eating.

66
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,940
Is it you

67
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,600
or him who feels like eating?

68
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:40,730
Little One, from now on, even if you’re hungry, don’t kick your mother’s stomach.

69
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,620
Do you hear me?

70
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,440
 Dear.

71
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,100
 Dear, this is the new pouch I made for you.

72
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,840
 Is it nice?

73
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,820
 Your sewing is getting better and better.

74
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,300
 It’s much nicer than the one you gave me when we were little.

75
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,300
Wenjun.

76
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,706
- Why are you up? 
 - Brother Yun, what's wrong?

77
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:30,400
Nothing.

78
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,200
A weasel passed by.

79
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,460
Ye Dingzhi! Yi Wenjun!

80
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,520
Ye Dingzhi! Yi Wenjun!

81
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,160
Take a rest. I'll make you noodles.

82
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,000

83
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,860
Greetings, Honorable Envoy Wuxiang.

84
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,320
What are you looking at, Honorable Envoy Wuxiang?

85
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,200
Feili, what year is it in Beili?

86
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,300
The fifth year of Mingde's era.

87
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,190
The child in the hut outside Gusu City must be two years old now.

88
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,400
Feili, what do you think?

89
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,900
Honorable Envoy Wuxiang.

90
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,920
If you hadn’t stopped me, I would already be on the outskirts of Gusu City.

91
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,500
Feizhan, what do you think?

92
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Plan and act accordingly.

93
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,420
You two may be brothers, but your personalities are completely different.

94
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,980
One of you never considers the consequences of his actions,

95
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,660
while the other overthinks and always misses the right moment.

96
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,720
Do you have any plans, Honorable Envoy Wuxiang?

97
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,860
It's time.

98
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,300
Go and look for Yue Qing.

99
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,020
Second Young Lady?

100
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,400
A woman's jealousy is terrifying.

101
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,320
Ride the horse.

102
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,460
Anshi.

103
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,580
Be careful.

104
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,260
Brother Ye.

105
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,560
Anshi. Let's see what I have brought you.

106
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,060
Come here.

107
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,080
Come here.

108
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,660
Check this out.

109
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,100
Do you like it?

110
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,760
It's yours.

111
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,000
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

112
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,480
Brother Wang, why are you so happy?

113
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,900
I almost forgot the important thing.

114
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,460
I was walking past the tea shop today. Guess what I heard?

115
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,940
Your good buddy, Baili Dongjun, is doing great.

116
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,580
But that's not the point.

117
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,360
The point is, he’s in a secluded place in Xueyue City.

118
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,940
I know you’ve been wanting to see him, but you’re worried your identity

119
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,920
might cause trouble for him.

120
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,100
But now, he has nothing to lose. You can go to him without worry.

121
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,860
But where is Xueyue City?

122
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,620
Xue... Xueyue...

123
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,260
You can ask me about it.

124
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,820
I used to be close to Mr. Li.

125
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:43,840
He once stayed in Xueyue City, so I know where it is.

126
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,020
That’s great. I’ll write to Dongjun immediately.

127
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,020
Since you’re all here, let’s have dinner together. I’ll start preparing it right away.

128
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,340
There is no need.

129
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,440
The Kunlun Summit is approaching soon.

130
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,340
I’ve been invited to attend,

131
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,800
so I’ll be leaving soon.

132
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,440
Me too.

133
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,300
I’ve been away for a long time.

134
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,080
My master requires me to return immediately.

135
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,780
I can't stay for dinner.

136
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,220
Anshi.

137
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,060
- Look. 
 - I'm leaving.

138
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,800
Be a good boy, you hear me?

139
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,460
When I’m free, I’ll come back to visit you, alright?

140
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,920
- You must keep your word. 
 - I'll keep my word. Let's make a pinky swear.

141
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,140
- Make a pinky swear. 
 - Pinky swear.

142
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,640
- You must keep your word. 
 - Good boy.

143
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,020
Whose letter is that?

144
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,620
 My buddy, Dongjun,

145
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,840
 I have settled in a hut under Hanshui Temple in Gusu City and have a son with Wenjun.

146
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,160
 Back then, I was young and all alone.

147
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,720
 But now, I have my family back, and I’m living in peace and happiness.

148
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,240
 I've put my hatred behind me for now.

149
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,260
 I heard that you're in Xueyue City, and
I'd like to invite you to come and meet me.

150
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,880
 - Your buddy, Ye Yun.  
 - What's the matter?

151
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,240
It's Brother Yun.

152
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,140
Second Young Lady.

153
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,700
Ye Dingzhi has left the mountain.

154
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,140
Wang You isn't on the mountain either.

155
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,960
I've poisoned Yi Wenjun
with the Soul-Dispersing Incense.

156
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:50,320
Now, she should be remembering many things she doesn't want to recall or face.

157
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,880
Honorable Envoy Wuxiang sent this incense at the right time.

158
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,680
Anshi.

159
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,460
Mother.

160
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,480
- I'm not your mother. 
 - No, you are.

161
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,540
S-Senior.

162
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,760
He is Xiao Yu.

163
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,640
No, he isn't.

164
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,200
- He is Xiao Yu. 
 - He isn't.

165
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,260
Mother.

166
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,540
Yu'er.

167
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,860
Now is the right time.

168
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,080
Soul Official, you once rescued Yi Wenjun with the Four Slaves of the Rain Demon.

169
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,500
It would be best if you go.

170
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,400
Wait for my news.

171
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,660
Second Young Lady, do you think my little brother can handle it?

172
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,840
After all, the game you and Honorable Envoy Wuxiang are playing is intricate and layered,

173
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,700
with each move building on the last.

174
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,980
If a mistake is made in one step, everything will become irreversible.

175
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,980
If I don't trust him, can I trust you?

176
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,360
Feizhan may be a man of few words, but when he strikes, he never fails.

177
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:56,720
Well, an honest-looking man who speaks less is more trustworthy, huh?

178
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,340
Brother Yun, are you home?

179
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,320
Miss Yi, it's me.

180
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,840
- Who are you? 
 - We've only met once,

181
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,980
but we haven’t had the chance to learn each other’s names.

182
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,460
When was it?

183
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,640
The day when you left Tianqi City.

184
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,680
We met before you left.

185
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,600
But it was a brief encounter, lasting only about half a day.

186
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,920
Are you one of Master Rain Demon's slaves?

187
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,080
No.

188
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,640
Deputy Commander Luo sent me to help you.

189
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,700
My name is Li Feizhan.

190
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,900
Luckily, your appearance is very recognizable,

191
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,180
or I wouldn’t have remembered you after just one meeting.

192
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,040
Come in and talk.

193
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,560
What brings you here?

194
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,480
So, you have a new child, Miss Yi.

195
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,620
What do you mean by that?

196
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:38,540
Honestly, Deputy Commander Luo asked me to deliver a message to you.

197
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,860
He said Prince Xiao Yu is seriously ill.

198
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,980
 Mother.

199
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,780
He may not last much longer.

200
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,440
What?

201
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,840
No wonder...

202
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,920
No wonder I suddenly dreamt of him.

203
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,240
Deputy Commander Luo asked me if you want to see the child one last time.

204
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,840
He'll arrange for you to enter and leave the city quietly.

205
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:31,160
I knew Young Master Ye shouldn't know about this, so I came after he left.

206
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,500
It's up to you whether you go.

207
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,480
Deputy Commander Luo doesn't want you to miss the opportunity

208
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,580
and regret it forever.

209
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:52,360
If you don't want Young Master Ye to worry, just leave him a letter.

210
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,900

211
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,360
Do you have any other concerns?

212
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:15,820
I’m a little worried about Anshi being all alone here.

213
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,200
When will Ye Dingzhi be back?

214
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,020
Judging by the color of the sky, he should be back soon.

215
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:33,600
Do we have to leave before he returns?

216
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,260
If he knew what you were going to do, would he let you go so easily?

217
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,720
Fine. I already know your decision.

218
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,700
That's it, then.

219
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,940
Wait.

220
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,600
Let me think about it.

221
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,580
Miss Yi, it's not that I don't want to wait,

222
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,920
but I'm afraid Prince Xiao Yu won't be able to wait for you much longer.

223
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,840
If things go badly, I'll have to return soon

224
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,760
to help Deputy Commander Luo with Prince Xiao Yu's funeral.

225
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:38,080
Anshi, I'm leaving for a while, but I'll be back soon.

226
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,000
By then, I’ll bring you an older brother.

227
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,820
I hear some movement in the distance. I think he's back.

228
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,060
Don't worry.

229
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,020
It’s just for a little while. Anshi will be fine.

230
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,700
Let's go.

231
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,700
I'm back, Dear.

232
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,160
I've been wanting to come back.

233
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,540
But Mr. Zhang, the butcher, said that the pig he killed today had no hair,

234
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,720
so he insisted I stay for a drink.

235
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,640
I thought it would be fine to have a drink.

236
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,260
As he drank, he spoke about his late wife, who died of illness.

237
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,970
Dear, I’ve bought your favorite Glutinous Rice Balls and Osmanthus Liquor.

238
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,360
It's strange.

239
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,320
Wenjun wouldn't go out at this hour.

240
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,180
Anshi, you're awake.

241
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,900
- Where is your mother? 
 - I don't know.

242
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,240
 My dear, Ye Yun,

243
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,440
 I’ve been having nightmares

244
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,500
 about Xiao Yu, who is my son with Xiao Ruojin.

245
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,430
 In my dreams, Xiao Ruojin was torturing him

246
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:46,120
 out of anger at me.

247
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,060
 I can't bear it.

248
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,940
 Senior Qingyang sent someone to help me take him out of Tianqi City.

249
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,740
 I was afraid you wouldn’t let me, so I left secretly.

250
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,980
 Please don't blame me.

251
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,600
 I'll be back soon.

252
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
 Don't worry.

253
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,820
What do you think Ye Dingzhi will do after reading the letter?

254
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,600
The hut will collapse again, right?

255
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,220
Because whatever the reason is, Ye Dingzhi
knows

256
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,840
she won’t be able to return once she goes back to Tianqi.

257
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,160
Ye Dingzhi will rush to Tianqi City like a madman.

258
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,560
That's why we have to stop him here.

259
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,600
It's been a long time.

260
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,960
Go away.

261
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,020
What a great resentment.

262
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,080
I've traveled a long way to get here.

263
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,220
Anshi, go behind a tree and wait for me.

264
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,880
- Don't come out. Go. 
 - Yes.

265
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,740
As I said, go away!

266
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,740
You are really angry.

267
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,420
Fine.

268
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,280
Then do your best to kill me,

269
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,600
if you can.

270
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,640
Soul Official, are you crazy?

271
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,300
I'm not.

272
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,650
I’m just eager to experience the power of Xunian Technique.

273
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,920
The third level of Xunian Technique.

274
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,720
Release!

275
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,180
I’m not a natural martial artist like you.

276
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:44,100
I’ve been practicing the Xunian Technique for many years, but I’ve only reached the third level.

277
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,520
But today, this third level is enough to defeat you.

278
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,560
Life, death, seal.

279
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,200
Do you think you’re a judge who can decide my fate?

280
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,000
Out!

281
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,500
Everyone advised me not to become a demon,

282
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,120
but the ways of the world are forcing me to become one.

283
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,820
Father.

284
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,000
You've become a demon, Ye Dingzhi.

285
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,126
Die!

286
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:04,366
Go die!

287
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,180
Yue Qing.

288
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,540
Feili.

289
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,300
Luckily, it's just a few broken meridians.

290
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,940
That was too bold of you.

291
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,800
If you attempt to use the Xunian Technique hastily with your body, you'll die from broken meridians.

292
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,020
It's hard to practice it secretly,

293
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,900
so I need to use and feel it once.

294
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,180
Father!

295
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,700
You killed my father!

296
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,900
You're wrong, boy.

297
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,380
Your father has become a demon.

298
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,940
Father.

299
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,400
We're the only ones

300
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,420
who can save him now.

301
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,760
Father!

302
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,680
Brother Yun, your buddy, Baili Dongjun is here.

303
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,640
Come out and welcome me.

304
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,740
We're late.

305
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,570
Dongjun, this is bad.

306
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,500
Ye Dingzhi has been taken by those from Tian Wai Tian.

307
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,160
I’ve already transferred all three levels of the Xunian Technique from my body to him.

308
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,640
When will he wake up?

309
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,920
It's not easy to absorb all three levels of the Xunian Technique in a short time.

310
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,680
What about you?

311
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,090
If I want to return to my previous state,

312
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,650
it will take about a year.

313
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,475

314
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,060
Darn Li Changsheng.

315
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,100
What did he secretly do to me that day?

316
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,180
Why haven't I recovered from my injuries?

317
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,500
What's the matter?

318
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:21,020
Envoy Wuzuo, some people from Tian Wai Tian are about to enter Xuan City.

319
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,260
- Who are they? 
 - They are the Soul Officer, Feili, and Second Young Lady.

320
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,200
But from their appearance, it seems they're being pursued.

321
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,820
- Who is pursuing them? 
 - Young Lady and Baili Dongjun.

322
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,040
Is it that Baili Dongjun from the Marquis Zhenxi?

323
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,680
Yes.

324
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,280
Good.

325
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,260
Very good.

326
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,240
I was just about to go find him.

327
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,100
I couldn’t kill him in Tianqi City that day,

328
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,680
so that darn Li Changsheng caused me a great deal of pain.

329
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,020
Yao'er, there's a city up ahead.

330
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,880
I think they're heading for the city.

331
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,720
Xuan City.

332
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,640
What has happened?

333
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,300
- He's breathing. 
 - He's still alive.

334
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,240
Are you all right?

335
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,580
Young man, what's wrong?

336
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,100
It hurts so much.

337
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,480

338
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,680
How rude.

339
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,960
Get out of the way.

340
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,840
Do you have a death wish?

341
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,260
Mister, are you traveling north?

342
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,360
It's none of your business.

343
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,940
Who are you? Why are you blocking our way?

344
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,735
I'm a scholar, and I want to visit the northernmost part of the country,

345
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:11,760
where there are miles of icy mountains and wilderness.

346
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,720
I wonder if I could hitch a ride in your carriage.

347
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,400
Mister and the lady in there, would you mind?

348
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,260
Yes.

349
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,860
Who's cursing me?

350
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,800
Fine. I must have made a mistake.

351
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,100
His looks are exactly as Master described,

352
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,760
but his temper is completely different.

353
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,540
Did Master lie to me again?

354
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,360
Forget it. I must have made a mistake.

355
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,960
I'm not coming with you.

356
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,760
You guys go first.

357
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,940
Let's go.

358
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,280
She has a bad temper.

359
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,040
Watch where you're going.

360
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,640
No manners. You've soiled my clothes.

361
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,353
How rude.

362
00:34:59,353 --> 00:35:03,760
You scoundrel. Do you have no manners?

363
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,600
You owe me a month's worth of liquor on credit.

364
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,460
You've never cleared your credit! How dare you!

365
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,000
Third Lady, no.

366
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,700
It's not that I don't have the money to pay for the liquor.

367
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,860
Think about it. If I drink and pay right away, our relationship will be over.

368
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,420
My heart aches at the thought of it.

369
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,420
It won't ache if you pay up.

370
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,980
Guys, beat him up!

371
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,860
- Third Lady, I'm a scholar. 
 - Beat him to death!

372
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,760
Let's talk this out. Let's talk—

373
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,980
Wait!

374
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,920
All the love in this world comes from the heart.

375
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,260
Third Lady, why can't you feel my heart for you?

376
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,400
Feel your heart, my foot!

377
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,380
Mate, have you practiced martial arts?

378
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,620
Is he dead?

379
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,440
He's dead.

380
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,520
Madam, what do we do now?

381
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,340
He's not dead, is he?

382
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,480
I'm fine.

383
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,320
Third Lady, you still care about me, don't you?

384
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,060
Look at you and your shameless face.

385
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,620
It hurts.

386
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:40,520
I don't have three in my name, nor am I the third in my family.

387
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,460
So, why do you always call me "Third Lady"?

388
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,020
Two graceful brows outshine a fair face threefold.

389
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,540
That's why I call you "Third Lady."

390
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,800
Well, you always speak so poetically.

391
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,220
I don't know what you're talking about.

392
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,100
Because I'm a scholar.

393
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,240
I've never seen such a slovenly scholar as you.

394
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,980
I can do it myself.

395
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,780
I think that's the right one now, isn't it?

396
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,800
Mister, can you get out of the way?

397
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,000
- We're in a rush. 
 - Mister, are you traveling north?

398
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,780
Yes.

399
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,820
I'm a scholar.

400
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,260
My greatest wish in life is to visit the northernmost part of the country,

401
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,040
where there are miles of icy mountains and wilderness.

402
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,920
It's a pity I don't have any money with me.

403
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,600
I wonder if you could give me a ride.

404
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,480
We're not going to the north for fun.

405
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,160
We could be in danger of dying.

406
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,400
It would be inappropriate for you to travel with us.

407
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,920
It's appropriate.

408
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,540
I'm looking for people like you.

409
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,720
Third Lady, I'm leaving.

410
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:24,220
Remember to pay for the liquor when you're back.

411
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,560
If I drink and don't pay, our relationship won't be over.

412
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,200
Farewell.

413
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,160
Since then, another woman is waiting for me.

414
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,240
Who are you?

415
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,280
You're Baili Dongjun, right?

416
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,160
How do you know my name?

417
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,320
Of course, I know because my name is Jun Yu.

418
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,220
"Jun" means modest gentleman. "Yu" means gentle as jade.

419
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,960
This silver ingot is enough to get you from here to the far north.

420
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,520
Get down. You can't ride in this carriage.

421
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,680
A gentleman takes only what is rightfully his. Thank you.

422
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,326
But I feel more comfortable in your carriage.

423
00:40:27,326 --> 00:40:31,160
Listen, I'm running out of patience.

424
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:36,640
Dongjun, I don't think this man is a bad person.

425
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,840
That's true.

426
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,160
How could a gentleman like me be seen as a bad guy?

427
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,440
Miss, you're the sensible one here.

428
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,560
Are you done talking?

429
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,860
Young man, you have a strong aura of hostility, don't you?

430
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,600
A man of the Academy should be a gentleman.

431
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:03,520
A gentleman should have the aura of joy, anger, dominance, elegance, and even murder,

432
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,040
but not hostility.

433
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,760
Hostility is evil.

434
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,280
One wrong step, and you'll be in deep trouble.

435
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,360
Mister, from what you've said, you must be a member of the Academy.

436
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,120
I've been taught by the Academy, but I've never entered it.

437
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,040
What a pity.

438
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,580
If not, there would be another woman in Tianqi City waiting for you, Mister.

439
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,040
Don't call me "Mister".

440
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,760
I'm a modest gentleman, as gentle as jade.

441
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,320
Look at your attire.

442
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,820
How are you a modest gentleman?

443
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,960
How are you as gentle as jade?

444
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,760
A gentleman has a form but forgets the form, with a heart as delicate as jade.

445
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,400
This man deserves to be called a gentleman.

446
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,480
But as for being like jade...

447
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,840
What's wrong? It scared the hell out of me.

448
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,760
This inner strength...

449
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,380
It's Envoy Wuzuo.

450
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:09,165
He's Zhuge Yun, whom we met at the examination in the Academy.

451
00:42:09,165 --> 00:42:10,960
Zhuge Yun?

452
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,120
But why does he look so haggard, like a different man?

453
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,520
Master once said there were two Zhuge Yuns.

454
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,480
One is hostile, while the other is gentle.

455
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,760
He killed the hostile one and spared the life of the gentle one.

456
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,080
But this man before us...

457
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,160
Did Master kill the wrong one?

458
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,360
It's not a killing mistake.

459
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,080
It's that he has placed his brother inside his heart.

460
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,320
The hearts of twins like them are always connected.

461
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,660
When one dies, a seed is planted in the other's heart.

462
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,720
A dark flower then grows.

463
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,120
That's what I meant by hostility.

464
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,160
Hostility is evil. One wrong step, and you'll be in deep trouble.

465
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,800
Eventually, he became a monster.

466
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,180
That's why we have to be gentlemen.

467
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,960
- Monsters like this are not easy to fight. 
 - You're wrong.

468
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,880
Such monsters created by hostility may look scary, but they are nothing.

469
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,000
They can be crushed with a snap of the fingers.

470
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,300
If it's that easy, you do it.

471
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,640
Why else do you think I've waited for you here for so long?

472
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,846
It's because I've been waiting for this moment.

473
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:22,140
But it's a pity that Third Lady won't be able to see what I'm about to do next.

474
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,160
Otherwise, she'd be crying and asking to come with me.

475
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,700
I'm Jun Yu of the Academy. Please give me your guidance.

476
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,360
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

477
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,561

478
00:43:55,561 --> 00:43:57,780

479
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:09,980

480
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:20,978
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

481
00:44:20,978 --> 00:44:28,820
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

482
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:37,780
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

483
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:46,520
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

484
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,667
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

485
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:52,118
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

486
00:44:52,118 --> 00:44:56,464
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

487
00:44:56,464 --> 00:45:01,020
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

488
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,400
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

489
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,260
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

490
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,980
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

491
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:14,300
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

492
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:18,760
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

493
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,985
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

494
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:27,265
♫  I met you  ♫

495
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:11,960
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

496
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:19,880
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

497
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:29,146
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

498
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:37,560
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

499
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,820
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

500
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:43,220
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

501
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:47,580
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

502
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:52,080
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

503
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,520
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

504
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,520
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

505
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,000
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

506
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,460
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

507
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,780
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

508
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,160
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

509
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,460
♫  I met you  ♫
