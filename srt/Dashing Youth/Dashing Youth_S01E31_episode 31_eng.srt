00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,271

23
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,700

24
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,075

25
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,380
It's more perfect than before.

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,840
I'm Li Changsheng.

27
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,080
You do resemble him.

28
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,240
Grandfather... I wish to return to the Academy.

29
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,760
I've been away for a long time.

30
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,820
Since I've returned to Tianqi, it's time for me to visit.

31
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,020
Dongjun, you can do it tomorrow.

32
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,280
A guest will be coming today.

33
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,900
Are you Baili Dongjun?

34
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,060
So what if I am?

35
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,980
Dongjun, keep your sword away.

36
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,260
Eunuch Zhuoqing, how have you been?

37
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,860
Greetings, Marquis.

38
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,860
I'm still alive, all thanks to you.

39
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,820
Eunuch Zhuoqing, what brings you here today?

40
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,460
You must be joking.

41
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,660
How could a humble servant like me meet you?

42
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,520
Kneel.

43
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,900
Kneel!

44
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

45
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,040
Greetings, Your Majesty.

46
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,920
Spare the formalities.

47
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,900
I've long heard about your talented grandson.

48
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,140
Now that I'm seeing him in person, he's extraordinary indeed.

49
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,833
Your Majesty, I'm a criminal.

50
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:35,060
Your Majesty, isn't it inappropriate for you to visit me like this?

51
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,900
What criminal?

52
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,700
Someone was foolish enough to be bewitched.

53
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,100
He criticized you in front of me.

54
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,780
We’ve been through many battles together,

55
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,820
and you’re guarding the west gate of the state for me.

56
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,660
Why would you rebel?

57
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,420
Don't worry.

58
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,130
All those who maligned you,

59
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,220
I'll definitely punish them severely.

60
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,000
Your act is too fake.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,980
You didn't need to reveal the truth, even though you saw through it, you know?

62
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,680
Let's talk inside.

63
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,480
Mr. Li, long time no see.

64
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,780
It seems you’ve returned to Tianqi once again.

65
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,420
Your Majesty, please.

66
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,540
Didn’t you hate having tea in the past?

67
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,440
- You said liquor was everything. 
 - Enough.

68
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,820
When I was young, I indeed liked liquor.

69
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,900
I liked it because it was strong and direct.

70
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,540
But I don't know when I suddenly began to enjoy drinking tea.

71
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,240
Although it's not strong,

72
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,760
it has a rich, lingering taste.

73
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,040
We’ve both

74
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,640
grown old, haven’t we?

75
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,900

76
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,360
 Be extra cautious this time.

77
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,660

78
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,540
 Don’t worry. As long as I’m here, the city won’t fall.

79
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,280
 You two should head back quickly.

80
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,060
 Prepare a warm pot of liquor.

81
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,620
 Get it ready and wait for my victory!

82
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,100
 Ye Yu, the Great General, was arrogant due to his achievements.

83
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,060
 He abused his power for personal gain and disrespected the emperor.

84
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,130
 Someone reported him as he was suspected of betraying the state.

85
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,880
 However, since he had protected the state in the past,

86
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,360
 his family will be executed, while his clan members will be banished.

87
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,320
 He shall be taken to see the emperor.

88
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,340
 That is all.

89
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,470

90
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,380
Are all brothers in the world destined to end up like this?

91
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,820
Luochen...

92
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,500
I'm old now.

93
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,900
Even drinking tea can make me tipsy.

94
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,060
You told me to come to Tianqi.

95
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,040
I know that you're doing it to pave the way for him.

96
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,100
Looks like you truly have great expectations for your son.

97
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,700
Of course, I'm referring to Prince Langya, Xiao Ruofeng.

98
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,686
What do you think?

99
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:13,413
He's meticulous.

100
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:14,980
He's extremely skilled.

101
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,100
He's a nice person too.

102
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,244
If he were born in a chaotic era,

103
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:24,326
he would've been the kind of general

104
00:08:24,326 --> 00:08:27,880
who could rally loyal armies with just a wave of his arm.

105
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,420
I have over ten sons.

106
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,820
But now, it seems that even if I were to combine them all,

107
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,460
they still wouldn’t compare to him.

108
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,240
Mr. Li has great expectations for him too.

109
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,560
What a shame. He has a fatal flaw.

110
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,500
He's too kind.

111
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,180
To ordinary folks, kindness is a great virtue.

112
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,180
But to a prince, that virtue

113
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,620
is unnecessary.

114
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,980
In the past, Chengfeng made the acquaintance of Prince Jingyu and Prince Langya

115
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,360
as the representative of the Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion.

116
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,200
But it wasn't me after all.

117
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,340
As for you, you were worried about that.

118
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,300
That's why you made me come to Tianqi.

119
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,213
At the same time, you made Prince Langya accompany you.

120
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:26,020
It's because you know that only he,

121
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,280
no matter what happens, as long as it's me,

122
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,940
will risk his life and keep nothing in reserve to protect me.

123
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:43,140
You also know that as long as I don't intend to rebel,

124
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,020
I'll keep protecting

125
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,360
Prince Langya.

126
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,340
You know me well.

127
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,660
I also hope that you

128
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,640
can help me out.

129
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,280
I'm truly old now.

130
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,520
Now, Chengfeng is the one handling the affairs of the Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion.

131
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,560
You will never get old.

132
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,120
You once said that even at death,

133
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,540
you would hold a sword.

134
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,420
Don't worry.

135
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,100
The past won't repeat itself.

136
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,820
Not only can you return to the Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion safely,

137
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,980
but you'll also receive another title.

138
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,320
I'll grant you the title of Marquis Yingwu. You shall guard our borders on both fronts.

139
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,600
The throne will be passed down without any interruptions.

140
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,120
It's been a while, Mr. Li.

141
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,300
You do look as dashing as always.

142
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,360
It's just that Tianqi City felt a little lonely without you.

143
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,460
Is that so?

144
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,800
For example?

145
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,500
For example, this.

146
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,600
No one can stop this.

147
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,560
It's just a petty trick.

148
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,840
With me around, Master doesn't need to lift a finger.

149
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,080
Eunuch Zhuoqing, if you're looking for a sparring partner,

150
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,540
why don't you let me spar with you?

151
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,580
Let's leave.

152
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,760
Farewell, Your Majesty.

153
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,380
How did it go?

154
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,980
Your Majesty, no one has seen Mr. Li again after he left Tianqi.

155
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,100
Just now, when I was testing him, I observed him closely.

156
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:18,680
Whether it's his voice, form, or even his tone, he really resembles Li Changsheng.

157
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,580
It's a shame...

158
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,460
that he resembles him too much.

159
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,040
It's as if he's trying too hard to be him.

160
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,760
I dare confirm that this person
isn't the real Li Changsheng.

161
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,440
His face is just a mask.

162
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,800
And Baili Dongjun intervened.

163
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:51,140
Although what he said made sense, his excuse sounded fake to me.

164
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,780
That's great. If Li Changsheng was back, it would be troublesome.

165
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,840
Baili Luochen is much more meek than before.

166
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,960
He dared scare me with a fake Li Changsheng.

167
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,920
What about Baili Luochen's grandson, then?

168
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,440
I think you were testing his skills just now.

169
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,280
- What do you think? 
 - He is fearless.

170
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,573
With time, he'll surely achieve great feats.

171
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:20,280
He does live up to his reputation as Li Changsheng's last disciple.

172
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,680
Ancient texts say that the benefits of a
virtuous man last for three generations.

173
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,840
The Baili Family has given birth to individuals who are more talented than the last.

174
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:34,320
Three generations of prosperity seems too long for a family.

175
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,480
How did it go? What did the Imperial Censorate say about this?

176
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,440
They only told us four words.

177
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,560
Why are you keeping me in suspense? Hurry and get to the point!

178
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,440
Yes, Your Highness. Please pardon me.

179
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,420
The Imperial Censorate said, "This is near impossible."

180
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,160
"This is near impossible?"

181
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,940
Could it be...

182
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,320
Could it be that Father...

183
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,540
no longer intends to kill Baili Luochen?

184
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,840
That's... That's impossible!

185
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,160
When I sought an audience with Father in the palace

186
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,780
and told him that Baili Luochen was staging a rebellion, he supported me.

187
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:39,280
How could he change his mind... just like that?

188
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,460
This is impossible.

189
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,160
Why is that the case?

190
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,180
That person wasn't willing to tell me the reason.

191
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,280
He wasn't willing to tell you?

192
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,660
Prince Qing's Mansion hasn't fallen, yet he's in a rush to cut his ties with us?

193
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,600
If so, why didn't he refuse to take our money, then?

194
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,620
You may leave for now.

195
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,280
Yes, Miss Ying.

196
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,620
Your Highness.

197
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,640
This shouldn't be possible.

198
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,940
Why are you coming back?

199
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,040
Your Highness. Miss Ying.

200
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,200
- We have a guest arriving. 
 - I'm not seeing anyone. Scram!

201
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,540
Yes, Your Highness.

202
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,540
Your Highness, looks like you're quite angry.

203
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,560
The court and its affairs are unpredictable.

204
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,420
One should not focus on temporary gains and losses when striving for lasting success.

205
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,320
At last, you've come.

206
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,100
Greetings, Your Highness.

207
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,120
You've finally arrived.

208
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,020
It's because the Grand Eunuch thinks that the time is ripe.

209
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,460
That's why he sent me here.

210
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,940
So you finally thought of visiting the Academy, huh?

211
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,180
Mr. Chen.

212
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,880
Not bad at all. Even though it's only been two years, you've changed completely.

213
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,280
Mr. Chen, you can tell the difference with just one glance?

214
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,660
Everyone has an aura around them.

215
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,580
Those who understand that concept don't need to judge people by their appearance.

216
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,600
They just need to observe their aura.

217
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,860
I suppose you came to Tianqi City because someone reported to the Imperial Censorate

218
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,820
that Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion intended to rebel, right?

219
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,500
Indeed.

220
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,603
Although it may seem that way,

221
00:17:57,603 --> 00:18:01,980
in reality, Emperor Tai'an was just trying to pass the throne to Ruofeng.

222
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,160
Seems like you've figured it out.

223
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,060
If Emperor Tai'an truly wanted to hold my grandfather accountable,

224
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,820
it could be seen as a way for him to take back his military authority by force.

225
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,160
But he didn't intend to do that.

226
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,600
Why do you think that's the case?

227
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,640
The prince who reported him to the Imperial Censorate will become the thorn in Marquis Zhenxi's flesh.

228
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,450
On the contrary, Senior, who escorted my grandfather here,

229
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,980
will be the favored candidate for Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion.

230
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,040
If Senior wins the support of Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion

231
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,620
it's better than the support of any other marquises in the world.

232
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,360
The emperor is paving a path for his son.

233
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,620
What path?

234
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,100
One path leads to success, the other to execution.

235
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,880
Have you ever considered that the emperor might actually support these factional struggles?

236
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,160
Will he use his son that way?

237
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,680
He did the same thing to obtain the throne back then.

238
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,053
Maybe, to the people, he's a good ruler.

239
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:08,720
If not, my grandfather and General Ye wouldn't have devoted themselves to his cause and served him.

240
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,760
However, once a person reaches the peak,

241
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,260
they often find themselves unable to act freely.

242
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,240
It may seem like he's in control
of the imperial court,

243
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,120
but in reality, it is the imperial court that controls him.

244
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,480
My father once told me that although political affairs are merciless, we must remain compassionate.

245
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,380
Instead of being a slave to power, it's better to be compassionate martial artists like us

246
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,840
who lead carefree lives.

247
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,280
I'm glad to see you have such insights.

248
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,740
But the Academy seems somewhat quiet now.

249
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,740
All my seniors are no longer here.

250
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,880
The situation in Tianqi City has changed.

251
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,640
Those who remain here will get tainted somehow.

252
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,660
Where's Senior Lei? I suppose he's still around.

253
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,260
Indeed. Lei Mengsha is still here.

254
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,420
But he was sent out to locate the whereabouts of Yi Wenjun, Prince Jingyu's consort.

255
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,980
Yi Wenjun?

256
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,360
Has she left Tianqi City?

257
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,120
How did she leave?

258
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,680
She was abducted.

259
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,360
The person who abducted her was highly skilled. He was very swift as well.

260
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,320
They left Tianqi City before anyone could react.

261
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,160
Could it be Brother Yun?

262
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,680
The person is extremely powerful.

263
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,840
Even the Shadow Sect's sect leader couldn't keep her.

264
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,620
I don't think it was him, but I'm sure it's related to him.

265
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,580
I'm quite sure you'll find Yi Wenjun where Ye Dingzhi is.

266
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,900
What do you think about this?

267
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,360
I have an uneasy feeling about this.

268
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,580
Ever since I parted ways with Brother Yun in Tianqi City over a year ago,

269
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,740
I have stopped receiving any news from him.

270
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,920
I, Jinxian, disciple of Grand Eunuch Zhuoqing, have returned.

271
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,140
I, Jinwei, disciple of Grand Eunuch Zhuoqing, have returned.

272
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,680
I, Jinyu, disciple of Grand Eunuch Zhuoqing, have returned.

273
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,640
 Zhuoqing suddenly summoned all of his principal disciples,

274
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,440
 who have been wandering the martial world, calling them back to the palace.

275
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,320
 I'm sure he's up to something.

276
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,740
Master.

277
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,600
Jinxian? You've returned?

278
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,700
Forgive me, Master.

279
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,720
I permitted you to wander the martial world for three years.

280
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,360
You've done nothing wrong.

281
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,360
How was it?

282
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,920
Were there any obstacles on your way back?

283
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,260
 I'm Ye Dingzhi, an unnamed swordsman.

284
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,540
No.

285
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,500
Chancellor Chen Ru, long time no see.

286
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,880
Something's off. You're not Mr. Li.

287
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,680
Mr. Li told me to come here because his Chun Art has reversed time.

288
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,800
Now, he should look like a young man.

289
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,200
Lower your volume.

290
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,840
If not, all of them will hear us.

291
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,700
Eunuch Zhuoqing. Long time no see.

292
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,640
Grand Eunuch, this is a sudden visit. What brings you here?

293
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,820
I’m here to visit the Academy because I have several questions for you, Mr. Chen Ru.

294
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,020
Since this is a visit, why didn’t you enter through the main entrance?

295
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,640
It's because they've sent their men to kill Dongjun.

296
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,120
There aren’t many skilled martial artists in Tianqi City who can help them.

297
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
He stands the highest chance by visiting our academy.

298
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,280
That's why he's here to visit you.

299
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,400
I see.

300
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,240
However, he made the wrong move,

301
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,580
as I am here as well.

302
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,400
Show yourself. You all have been tailing me all the way.

303
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,860
I picked this spot because there's no one else around.

304
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,700
I hope you all won't disappoint me.

305
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,740
Tell me your names so I know who I'm dealing with.

306
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,640
- I'm Xiao Shao. 
 - I'm Jiucheng.

307
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,533
- I'm Fenghuang. 
 - I'm Laiyi.

308
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,760
Do you all know who I am, then?

309
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,380
Cut your nonsense!

310
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,840
Brothers, attack!

311
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,300
Once, I thought that title was distant from me.

312
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,160
But when I left Tianqi last time, I ascended the stairs with a vat of liquor in hand.

313
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,180
Now that I've returned to Tianqi, I excel in both sword and blade.

314
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,700
I still remember the aspiration I had when I was young.

315
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,540
I was looking forward to announcing this title of mine.

316
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,660
Hello, everyone. I'm Baili Dongjun, the Liquor Deity.

317
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,900
After this battle, the Liquor Deity shall be known throughout the world.

318
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,340
Young Master, please stop!

319
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,680
Fenghuang and I have depended on each other for over 20 years.

320
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,900
Young Master, as long as you're willing to spare her,

321
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,400
all four of us are willing to serve as your slaves!

322
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,500
I don't need any slaves.

323
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,700
Since you all don't want to die, why are you trying to take other people's lives?

324
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,400
Everyone has who they wish to protect.

325
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,853
- In the Martial World, we have no choice. 
 - My foot!

326
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:41,780
All the martial artists I know only act on their own will.

327
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,420
Having no choice

328
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,260
is just an excuse you use to justify your greed.

329
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,620
The Martial World is vast.

330
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,620
I'm sure there's a place for you all.

331
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,980
Young Master Baili. What are you...

332
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,140
They only wish to kill me. They won't care about you all.

333
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,200
You should use this chance to escape.

334
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,860
Young Master Baili, we will never forget your kindness.

335
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,880
The Martial World is vast.

336
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,800
If there's no place for you there, go somewhere else.

337
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,480
I'll remember that.

338
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,600
 That was my first time speaking like a martial arts expert.

339
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,400
 - That was quite nerve-wracking.  
 -  Let's go.

340
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
No, you won't!

341
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,640
Are you the so-called top hit men from the Top Martial Artists Hitmen List?

342
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,600
You are useless fools.

343
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,680
I thought I only needed to observe the battle.

344
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,780
I never expected that I would have to fight.

345
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,040
Didn't you say you would let us off?

346
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:09,180
Eunuch, you killed them in your official attire.

347
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,140
Aren't you too arrogant?

348
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,886
So what?

349
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:18,280
Those who see me will not survive anyway.

350
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,440
Mr. Li and I served in the court for over a decade.

351
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:33,500
Although I don't see him often, he always leaves a deep impression when I do.

352
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,620
You resemble him a lot.

353
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,300
However, you're not him.

354
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,300
Why does that touch my heart?

355
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:50,200
Zhuoqing, do you think that Chen Ru and I, an impostor, cannot defeat you two?

356
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,240
Why don't we give it a try?

357
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,820
It seems like you're sure that I'm not Li Changsheng.

358
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,700
But I have to give you credit where credit is due.

359
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,400
You're right. I'm not him indeed.

360
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,660
It's because I'm wearing a human mask.

361
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,680
Indeed. You're not him.

362
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,920
That's right. I'm not him.

363
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,020
My name is Nangong Chunshui. I'm a young scholar.

364
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,680
Has it never occurred to you

365
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,780
that an impostor of Li Changsheng could be stronger than the real Li Changsheng?

366
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:56,900
Wait. The Academy is a place for one to study. No fighting allowed.

367
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,120
Fine, I'll heed your will.

368
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,060
After all, you're the chancellor here.

369
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,040
Those are the top four hit men on the Top Martial Artists Hitmen List?

370
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,780
I spent so much money on you.

371
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,900
What a bunch of useless fools.

372
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,740
Useless!

373
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,280
Your Highness.

374
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,080
Your Highness, please be appeased.

375
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:50,133
If they were good, the Grand Eunuch wouldn't have sent us here.

376
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,060
Baili Dongjun, your swordsmanship has exceeded my expectations.

377
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,780
I do hate killing people.

378
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,520
But today,

379
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,280
I want you dead.

380
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,000
What an arrogant statement.

381
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,040
Within the palace, I'm one of the top ten swordsmen.

382
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,880
So you're just a small fry.

383
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,860
- What did you say? 
 - So what if you're one of the top ten?

384
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,140
Moreover, only the palace is included.

385
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,280
Do you know how vast Tianqi City is? Do you know how vast Beili is?

386
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,960
Do you know how vast the world is?

387
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,240
When you face true martial arts experts, they can kill you with a single hand.

388
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,480
I only have eyes for the world.

389
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,520
Therefore, to me, you're just a small fry.

390
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,540
If so, what do you think your ranking is in the world?

391
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,500
One of the top 100 swordsmen.

392
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,860
You must be kidding me.

393
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,220
Very soon, everyone will know the name Baili Dongjun, the Liquor Deity.

394
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,160
It all depends on whether you can survive this.

395
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,240
Your Excellencies, seems like you two are in a rush.

396
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,480
Where are you heading?

397
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,880
Excellent swordsmanship.

398
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:32,420
Eunuch, your skills did make me see you in a new light.

399
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,860
Your father, Baili Chengfeng, has the nickname "Ten Fatal Strokes."

400
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,920
Do you know why?

401
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,040
You know my father as well?

402
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,020
The swift Chengfeng and his Ten Fatal Strokes.

403
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,780
His swordsmanship relies on his speed.

404
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:53,340
If he doesn't win the match after ten blows, his opponent will no longer fear him.

405
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,827
It's because his opponent will see through his moves after that.

406
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:02,260
His so-called Instant Kill Sword Arts will no longer work by then.

407
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:06,340
You sparred with me using Instant Kill Sword Arts.

408
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,740
Have you counted the number of blows we exchanged just now?

409
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:14,320
It's around 11.

410
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,520
Eunuch, are you saying that I've lost, then?

411
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,700
I'm sorry, then.

412
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,840
You won't get to deliver the 13th blow.

413
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,060
I practiced a technique by myself.

414
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,360
Even my master has no idea about it.

415
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:36,040
You should feel honored that you'll be able to witness its strength before dying.

416
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,780
What is this?

417
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
This is a technique imparted to me by Mr. Li, the top martial artist.

418
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,840
It's the Double-Handed Blade-Sword Technique.

419
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,900
19 Embroidery Sword Techniques and the Five Tigers Mountain-Splitting Blade.

420
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,120
So what if you're combining these two useless techniques?

421
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:10,840
Do you think you can kill me with the 19 Embroidery Sword Techniques alone?

422
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,960
It's raining.

423
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,760
Have you accepted your fate?

424
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,000
You're wrong.

425
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,900
 This isn't the 19 Embroidery Sword Techniques.

426
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,940
 The left blade is called Cinderless.

427
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,260
 Drunken Dream is utilized.

428
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,820
 The right sword is called Dustless.

429
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:09,580
Xichu's Sword Song is utilized.

430
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,960
Look... Even the heavens are trying to help me here.

431
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,900
Do you understand why I only have eyes for the world now?

432
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,660
I'm Baili Dongjun, the Liquor Deity.

433
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,881

434
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:11,100

435
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:23,330

436
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:34,421
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫
