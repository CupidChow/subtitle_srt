24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,260
What a bunch of weirdos.

25
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,080

26
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,320

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,460
You're awake? Come and have breakfast.

28
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,520
What happened to me?

29
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,740
What happened to you?

30
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,560
You passed out a few days ago. My uncle saved you.

31
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,260
You're lucky to know me.

32
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,680
My uncle doesn't save just anyone.

33
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,700
Why is Little Thing still here?

34
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,320
Do you have a death wish?

35
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,640
My cuties.

36
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,980
Come. Come over here.

37
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,360
Be good. Be good.

38
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,660
Uncle. That's kind of disgusting.

39
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,320
These disgusting things saved his life.

40
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,900
I...

41
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,360
Thank you, Sir. Have I recovered?

42
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,320
No. You... have been poisoned by me.

43
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,220
- What? 
 - What?

44
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,860
The reason I don't always save people

45
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,220
is because I use poison to combat poison.

46
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,300
To suppress your old injuries, I gave you the Gut-Shattering Five Poisons.

47
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,480
But I don't have an antidote.

48
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,523
Wait. Then what do we do?

49
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,963
He can't just die.

50
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,923
Go to the place marked on the map and look for someone called Xin Baicao.

51
00:04:40,923 --> 00:04:44,363
I claim that no one can escape my poison,

52
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:48,563
while this fellow claims to cure any poison in this world.

53
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:51,163
Go and show him your poisoned body.

54
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:53,563
Naturally, he'll know I sent you there.

55
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:58,703
He'll do his best to cure you to prove he's better than me.

56
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:03,285
Once the poison is gone and your old injuries flare up,

57
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:08,463
he'll think it's a trick of mine and will save you again.

58
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:15,803
Does... Xin Baicao, the King of Medicine, really exist?

59
00:05:15,803 --> 00:05:19,463
Can he... really heal Changfeng?

60
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:22,563
How would I know?

61
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:29,003
I poison others.

62
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:30,883
I'm not a physician.

63
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:34,883
Go on now. You have 10 days left.

64
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:37,063
10 days?

65
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:40,963
After that, the Gut-Breaking Five Poisons will take effect and you'll be dead in less than four hours.

66
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:45,023
It starts eroding your guts. It's excruciating.

67
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:55,463

68
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:57,043
Thank you, Senior.

69
00:05:57,043 --> 00:06:00,683
No need to thank me. Your life is still at risk.

70
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:06,263
I'm better. I used to think I'd die quietly on an unfamiliar road.

71
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:08,483
Who would've thought that Heaven would show me mercy.

72
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:11,003
To have met so many heroes before my life ends.

73
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,163
Even if I die now, it's worth it.

74
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:19,003
Sikong Changfeng, my uncle went to great lengths to bring you back to life.

75
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:24,303
Don't jinx yourself. Stay alive and wait for our next encounter in the Martial World.

76
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:27,103
You're right. I must stay alive.

77
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:31,983
With a steed, a spear, and a pot of liquor, I'll roam around freely.

78
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:35,423
You too. Go further, see more of the Martial World,

79
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:38,203
and fulfill your promise to the girl you like.

80
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,223
Of course.

81
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,803
Take this.

82
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:55,703
Until next time.

83
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:57,243
Until next time.

84
00:07:21,703 --> 00:07:24,403
Stay alive, Sikong Changfeng!

85
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:33,603
He's the type who should die honorably in the Martial World.

86
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:39,600
Uncle, do you think I should die honorably in the Martial World?

87
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,420
What are you talking about?! Of course not!

88
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,060
Quick, peh, peh! 
  (TN: word to ward off bad luck after a curse)

89
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,520
Peh, peh? Then how will I end up?

90
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,820
You'll die pathetically from your parents spanking you.

91
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,380
Uncle, let's make a deal.

92
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,940
- No. 
 - I haven't said anything yet.

93
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,820
Let's go!

94
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,840
Ye Xiaofan, it's time for lunch!

95
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,180
So noisy.

96
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,900
What do we have today?

97
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,600
Quit touching my head.

98
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,700
My sister said I can't grow tall if you keep touching my head.

99
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,580
She's lying to you. I can examine bones.

100
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,780
- I can tell you won't grow tall, it doesn't matter if I touch you or not. 
 - Peh, peh, peh!

101
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,500
If you say that again, your big bun will become mine.

102
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:58,980
You sleep all day and don't find a proper job. You won't get a wife in the future.

103
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,900
Little brat, you talk like a mother.

104
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,460
Is getting a proper job that important?

105
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,060
Of course, it is!

106
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,500
Fine, then. I'll do what you say.

107
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,560
It seems it's time to find a proper job.

108
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,560
However, I'm afraid this job can't be found in the village.

109
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,660
It's time to leave.

110
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,920
You have to return to Qiandong City.

111
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,540
If not, your mother will poison me.

112
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,100
Can mother's poison beat yours? I doubt it.

113
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,120
I can't stand it when she acts spoiled.

114
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,500
It's not that I won't go back.

115
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,300
I just want you to show me around the Martial World on our way back.

116
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,740
Not doing it. No time.

117
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,980
You're not busy. Why not?

118
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,260
Not busy?

119
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,060
I'm the Bodhisattva of Poison! I'm busy!

120
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,060
Besides, after four years, the Forest of Swords is about to start.

121
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,900
I don't want to miss it.

122
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,360
Forest of Swords? What's that?

123
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,180
It seems you're in a hurry. Is it a great assembly?

124
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,860
Swordsmen from all over the Martial World wait in the wings for four years

125
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,760
just for the opening of the Forest of Swords.

126
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,680
Tell me, doesn't that sound grand?

127
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,860
Uncle, you dote on me the most.

128
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,320
You're the best.

129
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,480
I'll brew some liquor for you.

130
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,060
Go away. Save it.

131
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,180
Let me ask you this. Has your mother taught you any martial arts skills?

132
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:55,200
No. But she got me a master to teach me fist techniques.

133
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,820
That's enough. Come back.

134
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,940
What master?

135
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,060
His name is something like Wangba?

136
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,600
- Yes, it's an interesting name. 
 - Oh.

137
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,300
Wang Batian, the Fist Conqueror?

138
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,060
Right, right, him.

139
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,620
He's someone to be reckoned with.

140
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,700
Exactly. My mother thought he could teach me well.

141
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,580
He was working so hard, so I treated him to some liquor.

142
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,460
He said he had never had such a wonderful brew in his life.

143
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,080
Then I told him he could drink it every day as long as he stopped teaching me.

144
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,140
So, my mother drove him away three days later.

145
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,360
Did you have other masters?

146
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,160
Later she thought male masters were unreliable, so she found a female master.

147
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,160
She was so beautiful. I still remember her name.

148
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,020
Su Muqing.

149
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,940
Miss Su? She's indeed pretty.

150
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,640
Not only that, she taught me diligently for three days.

151
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,180
- Luckily, it was only three days. 
 - Why's that?

152
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:06,000
Because my father came to my backyard for three consecutive days.

153
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
You can imagine what happened.

154
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,960
You only learned superficial skills.

155
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,060
So, what are you actually good at?

156
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,780
Look at me.

157
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,280
What do you think?

158
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,960
Even you think that's terrible, right? Let's go.

159
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,080
Uncle! Uncle!

160
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,420
Uncle. Where are you going?

161
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,440
Back to Qiandong City. That route is shorter.

162
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,540
You can't be serious.

163
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,260
That wasn't amazing?

164
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,200
Wasn't that your father's qinggong technique, Three Flying Cat Moves.

165
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,060
Three Flying Cat Moves? It's Three Flying Swallow Moves.

166
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,160
Don't underestimate this. It's a great fleeing skill.

167
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,760
Don't go, Uncle.

168
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,440
I was being mischievous before, but I've changed now.

169
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,940
I swear, I'm serious this time.

170
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,580
It's true, I didn't like practicing martial art skills before.

171
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,900
First, I thought fighting was boring.

172
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,180
Second, as you know, General Ye and Brother Yun have died.

173
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,720
Grandfather didn't want me to suffer the Ye Family's fate.

174
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,920
However, when I encountered the Eight Young Masters of Beili,

175
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,260
and witnessed that bloodshed...

176
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:39,680
I asked myself whether I could protect my friend when he was in danger.

177
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,480
Could I be like the Eight Young Masters of Beili, draw my weapon, and fight alongside him?

178
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,180
Uncle.

179
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,260
Who do you admire the most in the Martial World?

180
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,540
Needless to say, it's Mister Li.

181
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,440
Which Mister Li are you referring to?

182
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,200
Speaking of Mister Li, it must be that person.

183
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,000
The One-Sword Deity, Mister Li.

184
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,460
When I was 19, I was fortunate to witness with my own eyes

185
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,320
the Darting Sword From Beyond in Tianqi City.

186
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,460
 Five invincible swordsmen from Nanjue challenged Mister Li to a duel.

187
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,860
 They planned to tire him out by fighting one after another.

188
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,260
 However, Mister Li defeated them with only one sword.

189
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:32,320
 From that day forward, no one from Nanjue ever challenged someone from Beili to a sword fight.

190
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,500
Naturally, Mister Li triumphed in the Martial Rankings that year.

191
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,980
Unexpectedly, he tore the Martial Ranking apart.

192
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,740
"The lowly Martial Ranking isn't entitled to judge a deity."

193
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,400
So cool. No wonder people said Beili wield swords while Nanjue hold blades.

194
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,160
Turns out they don't dare practice swordsmanship anymore.

195
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,100
Everyone in Beili practices swordsmanship.

196
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,480
I learned it when I was young.

197
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,800
You did? Don't you practice poisons?

198
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,300
I applied poison to the sword.

199
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,640
What? Have a problem with that?

200
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,220
No.

201
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,620
All right. I've made up my mind.

202
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,140
I want to practice swordsmanship.

203
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,560
You practice swordsmanship? Do you even have a sword?

204
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,040
Forest of Swords. How can I not find one there?

205
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,640
I see. I didn't see this coming.

206
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,220
Xiao Baili.

207
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,260
All right. It's time to get you a fine sword.

208
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,660
Really, Uncle?

209
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,040
Uncle, you've grown more important to me than my father.

210
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,940
Like you respect him much to begin with.

211
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,200
You can't say that.

212
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,580
Mount up. Let's hit the road.

213
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,380
Xiao Baili, keep up!

214
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,080
Coming!

215
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,260
What? Didn't you ask me to get a proper job?

216
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,040
Now that I'm going, why the long face?

217
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,600
I'm not. You're wrong.

218
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,580
It's true. You're capable and can become a military officer in town

219
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,520
and earn enough to buy noodles every day.

220
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,020
Then all the village elders will love you

221
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,780
and bring their daughters to propose marriage.

222
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,580
You can choose the prettiest girl and marry her.

223
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:45,440
By the way, Ye Xiaofan, who do you think is the prettiest girl in the village?

224
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,260
Maybe Madam Chen. She's elegant and graceful, plump too.

225
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,540
I'm saying a girl. Madam Chen isn't a girl anymore.

226
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,220
She's married.

227
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,220
You choose one for me then.

228
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,740
What do you think of my sister?

229
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,540
All the teachers in the village say that my sister will become a beauty.

230
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,460
Do you know what "will become a beauty" means?

231
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,020
What does that mean?

232
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,380
It means she isn't yet a beauty.

233
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,180
- Besides, I'm engaged. 
 - Oh.

234
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,100
What? You're engaged? When did that happen?

235
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,520
It was when I was little that we got engaged.

236
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:37,060
I'm of age now, yet I'm still wandering outside.

237
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,580
I wonder if she... has met someone else already.

238
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,220
Why don't you go and find her?

239
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,220
I will.

240
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,680
It'll be after I finish what I need to do first.

241
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,590
Very soon.

242
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,740
All right, stop here.

243
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,750
Ye Xiaofan, though you're only going to a nearby city.

244
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,980
You're leaving the village, after all.

245
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,380
You should have one the last meal with everyone, and bid farewell.

246
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,080
I'm not going to a nearby city.

247
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,340
Not a nearby city? Where are you going?

248
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,140
I'm heading somewhere I've been wanting to go, to retrieve something.

249
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,460
After that, I'll go to a place I must go.

250
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,340
A place you must go? Where is that?

251
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,620
A faraway city called Tianqi.

252
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,060
Tianqi? Isn't that the capital of Beili?

253
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,940
It's a great distance away. I've only read about it in books.

254
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,820
Ye Xiaofan, why are you going there?

255
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm going to Tianqi to achieve something big.

256
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,140
 Perhaps I might meet a long-lost friend there, and her.

257
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,360
Ye Xiaofan, what are you thinking about?

258
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,780
How about this?

259
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,340
Stop calling me Ye Xiaofan from now on.

260
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,500
Call me Ye Dingzhi.

261
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,380
Ye Dingzhi? Why this name?

262
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,400
Because I want...

263
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,060
to wander the Martial World with my sword, and challenge Tianqi.

264
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,420

265
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,242
Practice the sword techniques I taught you.

266
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:20,880
After a few years, you'll be able to protect the village.

267
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,860
Ye Xiaofan, don't go yet!

268
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,700
How will I find you later?

269
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,720
When I become famous, and you enter the Martial World,

270
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,380
tell everyone your name is Ye Xiaofan, and I'll come to you!

271
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,820
All right!

272
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,180
 Fragrance sachets for sale!

273
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,740

274
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,620
As expected of Shenjian Town. 
  (TN: means Divine Swords Town)

275
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,060
Everyone here holds a sword.

276
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,100
Even a dog has one.

277
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,840
Uncle, could this be the legendary sword dog? 
  (TN: 'sword' and 'nasty' are homophones)

278
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,820
No name-calling.

279
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,620
Sorry about that.

280
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,280
A sword dog?

281
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,940
Uncle, you still haven't explained what the Forest of Swords really is.

282
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,220
Forest of Swords, as its name implies, gathers swords to form a forest.

283
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,380
At first, there were swordsmen thrusting swords into this land where the Sword Deity perished

284
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,180
to show their resolution in swordsmanship.

285
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:04,440
Later, whenever a famous sword is forged, or an elite swordsman perishes,

286
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,220
the new swords and the deceased masters' swords would be kept in the Forest of Swords

287
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:15,120
to await the fated one to claim them every four years.

288
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,780
Why does... this person look so familiar?

289
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,040
What an aroma.

290
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,300
Mister, what liquor is this?

291
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,620
Sword Liquor.

292
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,360
How can you come to the Forest of Swords and not taste Sword Liquor?

293
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,000
Sword Liquor?

294
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,800
 Mister, fill it up.

295
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,960
All right!

296
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,940
Xiao Baili, you only introduced your martial arts masters.

297
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,480
Why don't you tell me something about your brewing master?

298
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,620
I didn't need someone to teach me that.

299
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,360
This is a natural talent, you know?

300
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,020
Coming! Sirs, your liquor.

301
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,640
Please enjoy.

302
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:22,560
That's intense. It cuts my tongue like a sharp blade.

303
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,320
It truly lives up to its name. Nice brew.

304
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,620
Don't drink too much. You'll get drunk.

305
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,460
Uncle, we've been walking for a long time.

306
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,140
I still see no end to this forest.

307
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,480
It's becoming foggy too.

308
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,740
Uncle.

309
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,040
Uncle?

310
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,740
Uncle.

311
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,920
- Uncle. 
 - This is Qimen Dunjia Arts.

312
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,000
It's the outside area around the Forest of Swords that's accessible on regular days.

313
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,500
But here is the place, which opens only every four years, the Forest of Swords.

314
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,860
How magnificent.

315
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:42,740
Two great sects forge swords, Sword Heart Tomb and Famous Swords Manor.

316
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,900
It seems Famous Swords Manor

317
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,180
is in charge this year.

318
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,820
Speaking of which, you have connections with Sword Heart Tomb.

319
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,780
What connections? Why didn't I didn't know?

320
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,500
Lei Mengsha's wife is Sword Heart Tomb's Master, Li Suwang's daughter,

321
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,820
Li Xinyue, the heir to the Heart Sword.

322
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,860
The Martial World is big, yet small too.

323
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,780

324
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:12,820
Since all of you came here to claim swords, I won't keep you waiting.

325
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,940
Please play the music.

326
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,680
The first-level sword is the Mountain Sword.

327
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,980
Everyone, you may start.

328
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,600
Uncle, shall we?

329
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,340
Not yet.

330
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,980
There are four sword levels.

331
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,940
First, the Mountain.

332
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,380
As high as a mountain, a place ordinary swords can't reach.

333
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,420
Second, the Ocean.

334
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,220
All rivers converge into the boundless ocean.

335
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,640
Only by merging one hundred Mountain swords can you form one of these.

336
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,180
The Ocean swords. Everyone, please.

337
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,960
Third level, Cloud Sky.

338
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,860
Above the ocean, soaring in the clouds, the Nine Heavens overlook all things.

339
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,340
Only one in every 10,000 swords is one.

340
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,860
Fourth level, Celestial.

341
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,700
Beyond the Nine Heavens, a celestial palace resides.

342
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,580
It's truly a sword from beyond.

343
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,780
Whether or not it will emerge in the Forest of Swords depends on your luck.

344
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,940
If so...

345
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:57,740
Given my swordsmanship skills, claiming an Ocean one isn't a problem.

346
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,460
You should at least get a Cloud Sky sword.

347
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,080
In that case, I need to use poison.

348
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,660
See any sword you like?

349
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,780
I only know Cloud Sky lies above Ocean, and a Celestial one ranks highest of all.

350
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,300
Needless to say, I want the best sword. Otherwise, how else can I gain fame?

351
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,740
Well said.

352
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,460
Who are you?

353
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,380
I'm Wang Yixing from Mount Wangcheng.

354
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,940

355
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,400
Lu Suzhen's disciple.

356
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,980
Setting aside whether he's eloquent or not,

357
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:38,360
his naive ambition to rise to fame keeps making it difficult for me.

358
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,480
Mister Wen, with all due respect, he should claim the sword himself.

359
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,080
Mister, what did you say? Who's claiming the sword?

360
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,160
I'm saying that it's better if you claim the sword yourself.

361
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,140
Look at him. I'm sure he'll get beat up in two or three strikes.

362
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,160
Are we really going to return empty-handed?

363
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,920
Don't worry yet, Mister Wen.

364
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:17,480
I think this young man might get a fine sword.

365
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,500
- Bravo! 
 - Bravo!

366
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,940
You aren't drunk, are you?

367
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,100
The Mountain sword and the Ocean sword have all found their owners.

368
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,640
The next sword is of Cloud Sky level.

369
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,940
I named it Divine Fire.

370
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,640
It's a shard of the fiery sword, Grand Mysterious Sun, used by the Kunlun Sword Deity in battle.

371
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,620
To be more precise, it's born out of the Grand Mysterious Sun.

372
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,780
It belonged to the Celestial Palace, but fell from the Nine Heavens.

373
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,160
What a waste.

374
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,540
- I'm down. 
 - Me too.

375
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,020
I'm coming!

376
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,800
Hands off my sword.

377
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,960
Didn't you call it a waste? You hypocrite.

378
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,160
It depends on who owns the sword.

379
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,740
Swords have no levels, it's their owners that determine their value.

380
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,580
Why is the sword... flying?

381
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,120
This is the Sword Wielding Arts from Mount Wangcheng.

382
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,360
Not just wielding arts, it also contains Mount Wangcheng's secret technique.

383
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:21,500
With such cultivation at this age, he must be the top among all current disciples.

384
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,940
You truly are drunk.

385
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,160
This is Sword Liquor. It's different from ordinary liquor.

386
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,920
Mount Wancheng's Leader, Lu Suzhen's principal disciple, Wang Yixing, will claim this sword.

387
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,060
Everyone.

388
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,660
This is the only Cloud Sky level sword. Why isn't Wushuang City involved?

389
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,420
Could it be...

390
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,660
I'm not interested in swords of a higher level.

391
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,900
This sword is a perfect gift for my junior brother.

392
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,620
Everyone, thank you.

393
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,460
He mentioned "swords of a higher level."

394
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,340
Exactly. Wushuang City hasn't moved yet.

395
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,300
Is there really a fourth-level sword?

396
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,380
The fourth level, Celestial Level Sword.

397
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,020
Celestial being, please grant me this sword from beyond.

398
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,820
Xiao Baili, look. Celestial.

399
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,720
It smells great.

400
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,880
It's the fragrance of lotus.

401
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,640
I forged this sword and named it Dustless.

402
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,260
I ask for a peerless gentleman to come claim it.

403
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,900
Hopefully, this fine gentleman will journey the world with this sword

404
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,060
and let it triumph in the Record of Famous Swords.

405
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,440
This is a great sword. I want it!

406
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,120
You fool. Do you want your uncle, who uses poison, to be surrounded by all the swordsmen?

407
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,500
I, Song Yanhui of Wushuang City, wish to claim this sword.

408
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,460
Who will be my rival?

409
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,760
Who would dare compete with Wushuang City?

410
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,940
I will.

411
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,940
 Who is he?

412
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,360
You are...

413
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,500
Ye Dingzhi.

414
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,340
Ye Dingzhi?

415
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,980
I've never heard of this name.

416
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,540
He's probably some rash young man. He dares challenge Wushuang City?

417
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,500
This time, I bet he'll die here.

418
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:26,240
This guy... looks... like...

419
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,360
I can't recall it at all.

420
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,340
Such agility.

421
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,100
A natural swordsman.

422
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,940
You're indeed strong.

423
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,180
But I am stronger.

424
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,500
Uncle, are they powerful?

425
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,940
Given what they've shown, they're both in the Hard Phase of Mortals.

426
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,300
However, the difference is that the man from Wushuang City

427
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,644
is already out of his depth,

428
00:33:10,644 --> 00:33:13,980
while Ye Dingzhi hasn't fully exerted his strength.

429
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,660
He possesses such strength at this young age. That's not easy.

430
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,980
-  Wushuang City actually lost.  
 -  Unbelievable.

431
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,060
 How did this happen?

432
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,500
I concede defeat.

433
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,380
Thank you.

434
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Hold on!

435
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,260
Xiao Baili!

436
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,160
I... want that sword too!

437
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,660
May I ask your name?

438
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,980
Baili Dongjun.

439
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,980
Baili Dongjun?

440
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,960
Do we... know each other?

441
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,780
No.

442
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,240
We don't.

443
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,080
Then why did you...

444
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,000
You want to claim the sword, right? But where's yours?

445
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,980
My...

446
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,140
Right.

447
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,280
Mister, I'll lend you this one.

448
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,620
Such an embarrassment. What a disgrace.

449
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,800
I have one now.

450
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,080
He's just as silly as before.

451
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,660
Hold on. I remember it now.

452
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,960
Why do I-I think you look familiar?

453
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,540
Baili Dongjun, are you trying to cozy up to me?

454
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,900
You came to the wrong place.

455
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,700
He's incredible.

456
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,200
Are you not drawing your sword?

457
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,520
I don't know any sword techniques.

458
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,880
Young man, come down. Just surrender!

459
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,540
-  Exactly. 
 - Exactly.

460
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,960
Just quit and come down.

461
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,680
Don't get hurt. Stop fighting.

462
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,580
It seems that you're no match for me.

463
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:09,780
 This fool must be slacking off during practice like he did back then.

464
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,560
Sword?

465
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,580
Can I... wield a sword?

466
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:47,480
 Master, is this another illusion of yours?

467
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,460
 No, this is a sword technique.

468
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,620
 Pay attention. I'll only demonstrate once.

469
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,400
 I have an unrivaled sword technique.

470
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,980
 Why is it unrivaled?

471
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,600
 On this earth, from past to future,

472
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,260
 no one with this technique will ever emerge again.

473
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,660
 If someone does, it will only be from the Baili Family.

474
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,260
I have recalled it.

475
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,020
I know swordsmanship.

476
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,340
That's...

477
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,740
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

478
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,420
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

479
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,340
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

480
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,420
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

481
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,100
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

482
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,940
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

483
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,000
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

484
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,420
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

485
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,220
Xichu's Sword Song.

486
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,560
This truly is Xichu's Sword Song.

487
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,780
It truly lives up to its reputation.

488
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,840
How carefree and spontaneous.

489
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,620
Words has it that it only consists of three moves.

490
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,900
I was fortunate to witness it once.

491
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,420
It was exactly the same as Mister Baili's.

492
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,180
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

493
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,745
But his moves are complete.

494
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,000
How does Baili know Xichu's Sword Song?

495
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,060
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

496
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,080
I remember everything now.

497
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,760
Sword Song.

498
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,180
But why are there only sword moves and no song?

499
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,000
It's a shame that the singer is already dead,

500
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,220
leaving only the sword moves, Heaven's Path.

501
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:49,000
 Back then, Gu Chen, the Scholar Deity of Xichu sung

502
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,160
 and Gu Mo, the Sword Deity, wielded his sword.

503
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,140
 In Xichy's last city, at the gate of Luosang City

504
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:01,140
 with a sword and a song, they battled 9,000 Pofeng soldiers until their very last breath.

505
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,780
 Finally, Luosang was raided and Xichu was brought down.

506
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,480
 This complete sword technique became a lost art.

507
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,400
That's my nephew.

508
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,400
My nephew.

509
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,410
I didn't expect that Marquis Zhenxi's Mansion

510
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,000
would be much bolder than I imagined.

511
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,620
I thought I only came here for a sword and to gain fame.

512
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,980
Never imagining,

513
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:42,540
I'd meet you and such an interesting sword technique.

514
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,880
Liquor. Where's my liquor?

515
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,900
Catch!

516
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,780
It must be a fine brew.

517
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,780
You enjoy it so much.

518
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,840
Friend, lend me your liquor.

519
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,640
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

520
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,660
Awesome!

521
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,380
Across the Nine Heavens, I travel on my sword.

522
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,580
There's indeed a song.

523
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,660
Going afar, never to return.

524
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:51,260
Amidst the clouds I sing in wild jubilation.

525
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,320
Drinking from 30,000 jars.

526
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:02,060
I bear a free spirit within and here ends my song.

527
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,616

528
00:43:15,616 --> 00:43:17,970

529
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:30,040

530
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:41,042
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

531
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:48,838
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

532
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:59,098
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

533
00:43:59,098 --> 00:44:06,589
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

534
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:09,769
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

535
00:44:09,769 --> 00:44:12,278
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

536
00:44:12,278 --> 00:44:16,518
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

537
00:44:16,518 --> 00:44:21,012
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

538
00:44:21,012 --> 00:44:24,592
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

539
00:44:24,592 --> 00:44:27,618
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

540
00:44:27,618 --> 00:44:30,138
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

541
00:44:30,138 --> 00:44:34,558
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

542
00:44:34,558 --> 00:44:38,918
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

543
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:42,318
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

544
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:47,798
♫  I met you  ♫

545
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:32,129
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

546
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:39,933
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

547
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:50,293
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

548
00:45:50,293 --> 00:45:57,615
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

549
00:45:57,615 --> 00:46:00,941
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

550
00:46:00,941 --> 00:46:03,341
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

551
00:46:03,341 --> 00:46:07,601
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

552
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:12,201
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

♫  I met you  ♫
