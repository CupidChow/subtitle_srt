00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:33,860
You're awake.

187
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,020
Good morning.

188
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,620
Master.

189
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,020
Tell Prince Qing

190
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,340
that he can

191
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,220
begin his operation soon.

192
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,670
[Chengtian Gate]

193
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,500
Your Majesty,
Prince Qing seeks an audience.

194
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,620
Summon him.

195
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

196
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,020
Summon Prince Qing.

197
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,700
Greetings, Father.

198
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,060
Long live Father.

199
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,580
Spare the formalities.

200
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,700
Thank you, Father.

201
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,980
What do you need?

202
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,580
Tell me.

203
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,620
Father,

204
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,540
although Prince Jingyu's Mansion
has suppressed the news

205
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,180
from the public,

206
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,700
there are no

207
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,100
undiscovered secrets.

208
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,580
In my opinion,

209
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,420
Ye Dingzhi isn't capable enough

210
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,660
to take Yi Wenjun out of Tianqi.

211
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,740
I'm sure someone aided him.

212
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,740
Tell me about it.

213
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,620
I dare not do so.

214
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,500
Just speak your mind.

215
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,420
If we think about it,

216
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,500
of all the officials in the court,

217
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,100
only the Marquis of Zhenxi

218
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,860
is able to help Ye Dingzhi.

219
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,980
And, Baili Dongjun once helped him

220
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,620
when he tried to steal the bride.

221
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,660
He also escorted him out of Tianqi.

222
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,140
Father,

223
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,220
if Baili Luochen's subordinates

224
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,860
are able to enter the capital
and abduct the princess consort,

225
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,500
they might be able to storm the palace

226
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,620
and steal the throne in the future.

227
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,620
It's not about

228
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,460
whether or not he can do it.

229
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,500
It's about
whether or not he wants to do it.

230
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,980
Xie.

231
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,900
Yes, Father.

232
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,060
I'll leave that to you.

233
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,180
Yes, Father.

234
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,300
I won't disappoint you.

235
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,860
It's late at night.

236
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,980
What are we doing?

237
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,740
Censor Zhang?

238
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,780
You see,

239
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,100
it's midnight.

240
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,940
Why did His Majesty

241
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,940
summon me to the court?

242
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,760
[Zhang Chengzhong, Hu Bufei,]
I have no idea either.

243
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,500
[Seven Imperial Censors, Beili]
I have no idea either.

244
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,940
Let's hurry.

245
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,700
Well...

246
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,100
Is my hat tilted?

247
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,980
Not at all.

248
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,140
Last night, the Seven Imperial Censors
were summoned

249
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,500
in the middle of the night.

250
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,900
Seems like something huge
is going to happen.

251
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,740
Ruofeng,

252
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,860
do you think

253
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,580
we're their target?

254
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,020
I'm sure this is related

255
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,980
to Prince Qing seeking an audience
with Father.

256
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,300
Prince Qing's largest foes

257
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,220
are us.

258
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,340
It's hard to say.

259
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,500
Logically speaking,

260
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,900
it's most likely

261
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,100
that Prince Qing is targeting us.

262
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,820
However,

263
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,940
I have a feeling
that something else is happening.

264
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,340
What is it?

265
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,540
By the Mandate of Heaven
and the Emperor decrees,

266
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,690
Baili Luochen, the Marquis of Zhenxi,

267
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,740
is accused of treason.

268
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,740
Effective immediately,

269
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,060
the Seven Imperial Censors

270
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,660
are ordered
to jointly investigate this matter

271
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,380
Thus ordered.

272
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,460
Your Highness!

273
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,340
Your Highness.

274
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,620
What is it? Why are you panicking?

275
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,780
Eunuch Li is here.

276
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,620
He also brought
an imperial edict with him.

277
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,860
So what?

278
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,540
I'm Prince Jingyu.

279
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,740
Imperial edicts are
nothing special to me.

280
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,420
Your Highness,

281
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,220
although the imperial edict

282
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,620
was delivered
to Prince Jingyu's Mansion,

283
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,460
it wasn't for you.

284
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,500
Eunuch Li.

285
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,860
Greetings, Prince Jingyu.

286
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,740
Greetings, Prince Langya.

287
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,340
Eunuch Li, what do you mean

288
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
by that?

289
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,860
What do you mean when you said

290
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,900
it was delivered

291
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,340
to my mansion,

292
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,820
but it wasn't for me?

293
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,380
Seems like

294
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,980
the imperial edict was for me.

295
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,220
Indeed, Prince Langya.

296
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,500
Both of you were
always close to each other.

297
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,140
Just now,

298
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,860
I went to Prince Langya's Mansion.

299
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,420
I couldn't find you there,
Your Highness.

300
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,460
I knew

301
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,220
that you would be
in Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

302
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,900
Your Highness, since I've found you,

303
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,620
you should receive the edict.

304
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,740
Your Highness, this is a secret edict.

305
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,380
Although His Majesty sent me here
to deliver the edict,

306
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,020
I have no idea

307
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,380
what the edict is about.

308
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,620
Your Highness,
you should read it yourself.

309
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,780
Eunuch Li,

310
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,580
this edict is quite troublesome.

311
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,940
Although I don't know

312
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,260
what the edict is about,

313
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,300
I know that His Majesty was frowning

314
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,020
when he wrote the edict.

315
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,660
He was pondering for a long time.

316
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,340
Eunuch Li,

317
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,740
your words are
making me more nervous here.

318
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,940
If so, I shall take my leave.

319
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,900
I'll stop troubling you, Your Highness.

320
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:56,860
Ruofeng.

321
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,940
What did it say?

322
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,260
According to the edict,

323
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,020
there are already 600 Jinwu Guards

324
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,780
waiting outside of Tianqi City.

325
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,100
Waiting outside of Tianqi City?

326
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,100
What is Father up to?

327
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,620
He ordered me
to depart for Qiandong today.

328
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,180
I am to bring Baili Luochen,
Marquis of Zhenxi,

329
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,180
back to Tianqi City.

330
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,860
Yao, whose letter was that?

331
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,540
My maidservant wrote to me

332
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,740
that the emperor

333
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,300
is summoning Marquis to the palace.

334
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,420
He was branded with the crime

335
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,220
of treason.

336
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,620
You mustn't go.

337
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,060
If I don't go,

338
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,300
what should you do, then?

339
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,300
Father, I...

340
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,140
Dongjun, what are you doing here?

341
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,420
Who is this lady?

342
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,140
Grandfather, we can
talk about that later.

343
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,580
I heard that...

344
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,340
Baili Dongjun, head back.

345
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,100
I won't.

346
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,300
I'll say this again.

347
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,580
Head back.

348
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,020
Didn't you say

349
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,220
I could come out once I defeated you?

350
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,220
Sir,

351
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,340
today, I'll show you

352
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,340
the meaning of defeat.

353
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,420
Come, show me

354
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,980
how much you've improved

355
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,580
over the past year.

356
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,820
You transformed sound to sword qi.

357
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,300
That's right.

358
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,300
Miss.

359
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,540
How should I address you?

360
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,700
My name is Yue Yao.

361
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,260
Yue Yao?

362
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,380
If so, who is Yin Fengcheng,
the city lord of Beique City

363
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,940
to you?

364
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,060
He's my father.

365
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,010
I knew it.

366
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,980
To Beili,

367
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,700
I'm a fugitive from Beique.

368
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,180
Sir, will you capture me

369
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,660
and hand me to the emperor of Beili?

370
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,620
I'm too old for this.

371
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,540
I don't care
if you're a fugitive or not.

372
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,260
As long as you're someone
who Dongjun likes,

373
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,420
as long as he brings you back,

374
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,900
you're part of this family.

375
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,500
Sir.

376
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,140
Using guqin as your weapon, huh?

377
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,300
It's an excellent technique indeed.

378
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,980
I've never seen

379
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,060
such sword techniques before.

380
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,980
However, you lack training.

381
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,700
You should head back and train.

382
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:13,860
Is that so?

383
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,940
You brat.

384
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,900
Sir, what do you think?

385
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,580
You were taken by surprise

386
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,180
by your Instant Kill Sword Arts.

387
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,380
Grandfather,

388
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,860
I'll show Yao around.

389
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,540
Let's go.

390
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,860
He has grown up.

391
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,860
Look at that brat.

392
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,820
In the past,

393
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,900
whenever

394
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,660
you poured me the liquor you brewed,

395
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,260
you would keep showing off.

396
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,420
But today,

397
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,300
you've grown mature.

398
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,100
You've grown up.

399
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,420
Grandfather,
if you wish to listen to my prattle,

400
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,340
I shall

401
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,420
gladly oblige.

402
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,740
Dongjun,

403
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,700
since young,

404
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,980
your father kept you in check.

405
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,580
Your mother kept you in check.

406
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,340
The only person

407
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,620
who spoiled you was me,

408
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,620
your fearsome grandfather.

409
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,900
Do you know why?

410
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,020
It's because you don't want me

411
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,220
to be like you and Father.

412
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,380
You don't want me to lead a tough life.

413
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,700
Grandfather, you wanted me

414
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,660
to be carefree.

415
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,940
You're too intelligent.

416
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,660
Once we grow old,

417
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,940
we'll think about

418
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,700
the many things
that we had missed out on

419
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,940
when we were young.

420
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
But I want my children
and grandchildren,

421
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,660
especially you,

422
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,180
to obtain what I missed out on.

423
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,020
But Grandfather,

424
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,540
there are two different ways
to be carefree.

425
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,500
They're different.

426
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,860
How are they different?

427
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,140
I love to be carefree indeed.

428
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:02,860
But not as

429
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,420
a carefree noble heir of the marquis.

430
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,420
I want to be

431
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,420
a carefree martial artist.

432
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,300
- A martial artist?
- Yes.

433
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,940
I want to draw my sword for my friends,

434
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,900
for love,

435
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,940
and for injustice.

436
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,420
Although I'm carefree,
I still have a sense of duty.

437
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,900
Although I don't obey the rules,
I have my own principles.

438
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,900
Grandfather,

439
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,460
now, the Baili Family is in trouble.

440
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,540
And I, your grandson,

441
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,580
am ready to face the trial.

442
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:38,820
Come.

443
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,780
Sir, do you want to buy some?

444
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,940
Please take a look.

445
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,860
Have you heard?

446
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,700
The Marquis of Zhenxi
has plotted a rebellion.

447
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,420
That's impossible.

448
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,060
Of all the times to do it,

449
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,180
why would he do it

450
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,220
when the state is this peaceful?

451
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,100
You're right.

452
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,620
Thank you, Miss Yi.

453
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,460
Elder Wangyou.

454
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,260
Sir,

455
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,980
do you need anything from us?

456
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,900
It's nothing major.

457
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,580
Miss Yi has been here for some time.

458
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,740
I happened to descend the mountain,

459
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,900
so I came to check on you two.

460
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,700
Thank you for your concern.

461
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,940
Since both of you are doing well,

462
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,060
I shall take my leave, then.

463
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,180
Wait, sir.

464
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,420
What's the matter, Yun?

465
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,300
To be honest,

466
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,340
I heard

467
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,260
people saying

468
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,980
that the Marquis of Zhenxi
has plotted a rebellion.

469
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,220
His Majesty has sent an envoy

470
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,700
to capture him at Qiandong.

471
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,260
Sir,

472
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,540
is that true?

473
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,580
That's right.

474
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,820
The rumor I heard was incomplete.

475
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,620
Sir, can you tell me the details?

476
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,540
I don't know the details either.

477
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,500
I can only make assumptions.

478
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,500
The Marquis of Zhenxi

479
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,540
has been stationed on the western side
of the state for a long time.

480
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,100
He has a strong foundation there.

481
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,100
And, it's very far from Tianqi City.

482
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,460
The emperor wishes to intervene,
yet his reach is limited.

483
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,740
Over time, he became

484
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,580
a thorn in the emperor's flesh.

485
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,380
And, regarding

486
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,060
Miss Yi's escape from Tianqi City,

487
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,860
although Prince Jingyu's Mansion

488
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,020
has suppressed the news

489
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,500
and prevented them
from reaching the people,

490
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,300
those who are keeping

491
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,820
Prince Jingyu and Prince Langya
under surveillance

492
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,380
under His Majesty's nose

493
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,980
will definitely

494
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,300
find out

495
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,860
as long as they want to.

496
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,060
This event gave those

497
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,260
who harbored sinister intentions
an opportunity to act.

498
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,620
They could twist the facts
and influence the emperor

499
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,460
by saying that the Marquis of Zhenxi
played a role in her escape.

500
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,980
It must be Prince Qing.

501
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,460
It's all because of me.

502
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,500
Miss Yi,

503
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,420
don't blame yourself too much.

504
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,820
Even if you didn't escape,

505
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,620
they would still find other excuses

506
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,420
to topple the Marquis of Zhenxi.

507
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,300
Moreover, that was just my assumption.

508
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,300
It might not be accurate.

509
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,780
Elder Wangyou is right.

510
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,420
Wenjun, don't blame yourself for this.

511
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,820
If so, I shall take my leave first.

512
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,060
Thank you, sir.

513
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,020
Thank you, sir.

514
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,580
I suppose you've made up your mind.

515
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,060
Yes.

516
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,700
Actually,

517
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,260
I've made up my mind

518
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,380
when I heard the news.

519
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,740
But everyone in Tianqi City
is out to get you.

520
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,260
There are plenty of people
in Tianqi City

521
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,780
who I wish to kill as well.

522
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,140
You mustn't be impulsive.

523
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,220
Don't worry.

524
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,020
I'm only heading to Tianqi

525
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,140
to help the Marquis of Zhenxi

526
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,940
overcome this ordeal.

527
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,020
As for Prince Qing,

528
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,940
as long as
the Marquis of Zhenxi is fine,

529
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,780
he'll be utterly useless.

530
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,420
All right.

531
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,340
Wenjun,

532
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,060
since I'll be heading to Tianqi,

533
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:20,660
do you need me

534
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,660
to accomplish anything for you?

535
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,580
Wenjun?

536
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,580
Wenjun, what's wrong?

537
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,260
I'm fine.

538
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,340
Well, Yun,

539
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,420
if you see Senior
when you're back there,

540
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,140
please send my regards to him.

541
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,460
All right.

542
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,540
The imperial edict has arrived!

543
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,100
Your Lordship,
the imperial edict has arrived.

544
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,660
Such audacity!

545
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,540
Why aren't you kneeling
upon seeing the imperial edict?

546
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,260
You should head back to Tianqi

547
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,700
and ask the one who drafted the edict

548
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,340
why I'm not kneeling.

549
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,540
Why haven't you withdrawn yet?

550
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,780
The Marquis of Zhenxi has rendered
countless military merit.

551
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,620
He already received
His Majesty's grace a decade ago.

552
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,060
He may bring his sword with him
to the palace

553
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,100
and not kneel in front of His Majesty.

554
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,900
What do you know

555
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,900
at your age?

556
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,740
Even so,

557
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,340
his son still needs to kneel.

558
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:39,980
Shut up!

559
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,540
So, it's you, Eunuch Cheng.

560
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,420
It's been a long time since we met.

561
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,820
Years ago, I had the honor of

562
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,460
of making Your Lordship's acquaintance
on several occasions.

563
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,300
I never expected you

564
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,180
to still remember me.

565
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,660
I'm honored.

566
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,980
Qiandong City is located
in a remote region.

567
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,100
It's very far from Tianqi.

568
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,780
As I recall,

569
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,540
I haven't received
an imperial edict in ages.

570
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,860
Eunuch Cheng,

571
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,460
I'm sure the imperial edict
is heavy to hold.

572
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,540
You may announce it.

573
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,060
Yes, Your Lordship.

574
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,660
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees:

575
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,540
the Imperial Censorate
has submitted a memorial

576
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,100
accusing Baili Luochen,
the Marquis of Zhenxi,

577
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,460
of conspiring with traitors

578
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,260
and attempting to rebel.

579
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,380
This is a grave act of treason.

580
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,620
Considering his past contributions

581
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,460
in quelling the rebellions,

582
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,980
he is not to be detained at this time.

583
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,380
Effective immediately,

584
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,740
he is to follow the envoy
to the capital for trial.

585
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,220
Thus ordered.

586
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,220
Excellent.

587
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,380
Interesting.

588
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,620
This is interesting indeed.

589
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,340
Sir,

590
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,700
which army is this?

591
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,900
How dare they ride their horses
in Qiandong City?

592
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
It's the divine bird flag.

593
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,460
They're the Jinwu Guards.

594
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,600
[Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion]

595
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,860
Your Lordship,

596
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,020
you should receive the edict.

597
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,180
Father,

598
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,380
should we receive it?

599
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,540
Eunuch Cheng, what did he mean by that?

600
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,380
If they don't,

601
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,060
does that mean they're going
to start a rebellion?

602
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,180
If so, can we still
leave this place alive?

603
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,380
Chengfeng.

604
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,940
Receive the edict.

605
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,820
The Marquis of Zhenxi thinks

606
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,700
he's a big shot, huh?

607
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,380
We're envoys from Tianqi.

608
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,340
How dare he make us wait this long?

609
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,500
Even if

610
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,380
he ignores the fact
that we're envoys of Tianqi,

611
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,060
Baili Luochen

612
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
should come out and receive you,

613
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,900
the seventh prince.

614
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,580
Hush.

615
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,500
He's a marquis.

616
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,900
Why is he wearing a red robe?

617
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,860
Is he in a hurry to be married off?

618
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,140
The Marquis of Zhenxi
had plenty of nicknames back then,

619
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,420
his most notable ones being God Killer

620
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,540
and Bloody Robe Marquis.

621
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,700
When he's wearing

622
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,180
his red robe,

623
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,180
that means

624
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,500
he doesn't wish to kill.

625
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,380
Of course,

626
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,020
he doesn't mind
dealing with small fries either.

627
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,540
Smart people

628
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,460
wouldn't want to offend him

629
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,660
when he's in this state.

630
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,460
We're envoys of Tianqi.

631
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,540
Don't tell me he dares kill us?

632
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,740
I've heard that the Jinwu Guards
were a bunch of useless fools.

633
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,540
Now that I'm seeing you all in person,

634
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,380
the rumors are certainly true.

635
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:12,860
Marquis of Zhenxi.

636
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,900
Prince Langya,

637
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,820
let's talk inside.

638
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,020
Your Highness,

639
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,660
I still remember

640
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,500
that my son

641
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,220
had a pleasant chat with you
in Tianqi over a year ago.

642
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,380
I never expected things

643
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,500
to end up like this.

644
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,900
The imperial court and its situation

645
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,620
are ever-changing.

646
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,340
Your Highness, last time,

647
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,860
you took my son away from me here.

648
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,260
This time,

649
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,380
you're going to take my father away.

650
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,060
Last time,

651
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,180
I returned your son to you in one piece

652
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,860
after bringing him home.

653
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,140
This time,

654
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,980
I'll surely do my best as well,

655
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,500
as long as

656
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,540
the Marquis of Zhenxi didn't do it.

657
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,980
If I did do it,

658
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,100
Your Highness,

659
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,900
you would've been dead by now.

660
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,140
Marquis of Zhenxi,

661
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,620
when do you plan to depart?

662
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,100
Tomorrow.

663
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,260
Thank you, Marquis of Zhenxi.

664
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,100
Yun.

665
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,100
This will be a perilous trip.

666
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,740
Don't worry.

667
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,900
Just wait at home.

668
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,380
If you need anything,

669
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,860
go and find Elder Wangyou.

670
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,620
Take good care of yourself.

671
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,900
I'll return soon.

672
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,540
Take care.

673
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:24,820
Wait for my return.

674
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,660
I assume Prince Langya

675
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,220
has received

676
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,180
the Marquis of Zhenxi at this moment.

677
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,260
Excellent.

678
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,580
This time,

679
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,940
I'll make sure

680
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,020
that old Marquis of Zhenxi

681
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,780
and that despicable Baili Dongjun

682
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,940
stay here

683
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,100
forever.
