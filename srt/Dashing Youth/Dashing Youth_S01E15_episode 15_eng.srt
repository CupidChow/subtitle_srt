1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:16,020

2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,180
♫  Holding onto life and death in the face of danger  ♫

4
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,771
♫  I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,827
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:51,940
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,400
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,540
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,220
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,820
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,540
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,280
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,960
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,920
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,600

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,420

22
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,271

23
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,180

24
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,680
- I've never seen him before. 
 - Take a closer look.

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,860
- I've never seen this person. 
 - Let's go.

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,620
Seems like someone has become a wanted criminal yet again.

27
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,400
I wonder what he did.

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,550
The world now is far from being peaceful.

29
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,340
Xie Xuan.

30
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,020
The rebel is quite handsome.

31
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,540
A remnant from the former General's Mansion.

32
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,994
Maybe he was once a young general.

33
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:38,125

34
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:43,740

35
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,060
 When I'm 20 and you're 18, let's leave Tianqi together.

36
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,980
 One of us will head north while the other will head south.

37
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,900
 We shall travel the Martial World alone.

38
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,160
 Once we both become a Sword Deity and a Liquor Deity, then we shall meet again.

39
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,660
 May I know your name?

40
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,240
 I'm Baili Dongjun.

41
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,020
 Baili Dongjun?

42
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,540
 I never expected you to be this knowledgeable.

43
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,560
 It's because I've almost died many times.

44
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,350

45
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,500
Ye Dingzhi.

46
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,440
Original name, Ye Yun.

47
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,980
Remnant of General's Mansion.

48
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,980
So it's him.

49
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,380
Drunk, I stroll leisurely on the terrace,

50
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,540
the sound of geese startles me as I turn my head.

51
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,620
 Chasing the geese down the cold path,

52
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,060
 I suddenly remember our parting between life and death.

53
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,540
 What a mistake.

54
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,520
 Looking back, I cannot see where I came from.

55
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,263
Right.

56
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:49,030
Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

57
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,400
I'm going to look for him.

58
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,100
Don't be impulsive.

59
00:04:56,523 --> 00:05:02,383
Don't reveal his whereabouts. Now, he's a wanted criminal.

60
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,160
Yes, you're right.

61
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,130

62
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:52,728
He's awake.

63
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,160
My master, he...

64
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,320
He left.

65
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:12,883
- He left? 
 - That's right.

66
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:15,643
- How is that possible? 
 - Why would I lie to you?

67
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:20,463
Your master, Rain Demon the Sword Deity, engaged Mister Li in a fight on the rooftop of Diaolou Tavern.

68
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,083
Both of them disappeared.

69
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,163
After that, only Mister Li came back.

70
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:30,903
He said your master, the Rain Demon, has returned to Nanjue.

71
00:06:30,903 --> 00:06:32,420
That's good.

72
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:38,560
Senior, I wish to speak with him in private.

73
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,084
All right.

74
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:09,830
Miss. Are you still angry about what happened today?

75
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,071
I didn't intend to leave at all.

76
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:16,543
Now, even my master has left. I'll tell you the entire story.

77
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,940
Don't be upset.

78
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:29,604
Even now, you're still not willing to tell me the truth?

79
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:36,229
Even now, you're still addressing me as Miss?

80
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,798
Brother Yun.

81
00:07:40,383 --> 00:07:42,220
W-What?

82
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:48,350
I said, even now, are you still unwilling to acknowledge me, Ye Yun?

83
00:07:58,223 --> 00:08:00,210
How did you find out?

84
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:05,503
I'm not the only person who knows about this.

85
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:07,323
His Majesty knows about it too.

86
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:10,503
The entire city, and even the whole world, will know about it.

87
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:11,479

88
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:23,520
Seems like... this is my fate.

89
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:27,930
I cannot escape from it.

90
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:36,323
Wenjun, I...

91
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:38,200
Brother Yun!

92
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,680
Brother Yun.

93
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,920
I really missed you!

94
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,843
I really missed you so much!

95
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:48,600
I thought...

96
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,860
I thought I could never see you again.

97
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:03,748
♫  If the world were destroyed at my fingertips  ♫

98
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:08,828
♫  In this mortal world, there would be nothing left to care about  ♫

99
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:13,583
There, there. Stop crying. Stop crying.

100
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,190
Look.

101
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:19,584
Look.

102
00:09:20,183 --> 00:09:22,278
I'm back, aren't I?

103
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:32,928
♫   Love and resentment are entangled, and I'm still frozen in the past  ♫

104
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:39,123
That's right.

105
00:09:39,123 --> 00:09:44,543
My dear Brother Yun... has come back in one piece.

106
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:51,948
♫  Memories seep into my mind, filling it with love and longing  ♫

107
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:57,708
♫  Alas, sighing at a fate that is so sorrowful  ♫

108
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:03,348
♫  Because of you, the gratitude and grievances stir yet remain unsaid  ♫

109
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:09,148
♫  Longing, longing for karma that won't come  ♫

110
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:14,748
♫  Balancing on a thin line, why am I afraid to close my eyes  ♫

111
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,288
♫  What I can't bear most  ♫

112
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:21,128
♫  Is that from now on, you're alone in this world  ♫

113
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:26,330
 So, this is Ye Dingzhi's real identity.

114
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,703
 I suppose he was stopped by Yuji when he took that path.

115
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:37,083
 Could it be that Yuji and the rest were the ones who spread the news?

116
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,203
 Miss.

117
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:41,209
 What else?

118
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:47,515
 Nothing.

119
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:54,930

120
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:05,323
Why didn't Lord Wuxiang notify Prince Qing

121
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:08,923
about Ye Dingzhi's presence at Prince Jingyu's Mansion?

122
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:10,771
It's because...

123
00:11:11,883 --> 00:11:16,901
Lord Wuxiang's goal isn't to let Beili capture Ye Dingzhi.

124
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:20,243
- Are you saying that... 
 - That's right.

125
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:23,503
He's forcing Ye Dingzhi to leave Tianqi.

126
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,443
There are too many troublesome matters in Tianqi.

127
00:11:27,443 --> 00:11:33,980
Only when he leaves Tianqi, can we can take advantage of the situation.

128
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:49,723
Initially, I thought he died when I was young.

129
00:11:49,723 --> 00:11:52,723
How could he possibly survive under such circumstances?

130
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:55,243
But he did.

131
00:11:55,243 --> 00:12:01,452
Not only did he survive, but he also became a powerful martial artist.

132
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:07,343
And, fate has led us to meet each other again.

133
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:10,963
We became good friends who went through life-or-death experiences.

134
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:18,763
Don't you think my long-lost best friend's return is something worth celebrating?

135
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:32,203
But you're still young.

136
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:35,343
How can you say that he is your best friend for life?

137
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,783
Yes. I know it.

138
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:44,883
From the past to the present, to the future,

139
00:12:44,883 --> 00:12:51,783
and to the time I die, he'll surely be my best friend for life.

140
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:58,883
Maybe I'll encounter other friends after this.

141
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:02,243
Maybe they'll know me well and are my close friends.

142
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:04,963
But none of them can be my best friend.

143
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:11,923
If so, in your terms, what's a best friend?

144
00:13:22,263 --> 00:13:24,510
To me...

145
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,140
encountering the person whom

146
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,443
you can never forget,

147
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,636
that can be defined as my best friend.

148
00:13:34,643 --> 00:13:39,500
After that, no matter where the others

149
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,370
come from, they are not as close to me as him.

150
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:01,049
But...

151
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:07,044
But now, I think he's in trouble.

152
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,500
But it's fine.

153
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:15,083
I'm no longer the past me. I'm very powerful now.

154
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:20,423
I'll surely protect him.

155
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:26,623
What happened in the past won't happen again.

156
00:14:30,163 --> 00:14:32,243
I'll make sure it doesn't happen.

157
00:14:47,243 --> 00:14:52,503
It's nice to be your best friend.

158
00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:34,850
You're still alive.

159
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:37,223
Excellent.

160
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:40,923
Senior Luo.

161
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:44,779
Wenjun, she...

162
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:53,950
As you noticed, she doesn’t like Prince Jingyu.

163
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,910
But she needs to be married to him.

164
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,726
In six months.

165
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:22,434
Ye Yun.

166
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:27,968
If only you had shown up...

167
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:31,307
just a little sooner.

168
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,135
It's not too late now.

169
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:47,008
Senior Luo... It's never too late as long as I'm here.

170
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:28,236
Lei'er, are you saying that Ye Dingzhi is at the side chamber of Prince Jingyu's Mansion?

171
00:17:30,243 --> 00:17:32,443
Master, you must be drunk.

172
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:35,475
I clearly explained it to you last night.

173
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:41,483
How could that be?

174
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:43,643
Although my brother never liked Prince Qing,

175
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:48,403
he once promised me that he wouldn't drag the Academy down.

176
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:52,403
This should have nothing to do with my brother.

177
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:54,523
Why don't I ask him directly?

178
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:56,883
No need for that.

179
00:17:56,883 --> 00:18:03,023
Since we hope that he can have a safe place to hide and since that place is safe,

180
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:05,883
there's no need for us to go through additional trouble.

181
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:08,243
You're right, Master.

182
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:16,350
However, it's inappropriate for him

183
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,640
to stay there for long.

184
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,413
According to what I know, besides Senior Luo from the Shadow Sect,

185
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:30,368
my future sister-in-law is also at that side chamber.

186
00:18:32,203 --> 00:18:37,963
Don't worry. Since we all know where he is, I'll bring him back.

187
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:41,348
You can stay out of this.

188
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,563
Dongba, have a good rest for the next few days.

189
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:51,343
I'll take you to meet your friend in a few more days.

190
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:54,325
After that, I'll see him off.

191
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:00,003
Why are you trying to send him away?

192
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:02,003
I haven't been able to catch up with him yet.

193
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:03,603
Catch up with him?

194
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:05,943
You can catch up with him in Nanjue.

195
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:08,003
Everyone is trying to arrest him now.

196
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:11,523
Which do you think is more important? His life? Or you catching up with him?

197
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:13,663
Dumb disciple.

198
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:17,121
Of course, it's...

199
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:20,677
Fine.

200
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,243
You had to cook for me for the past few days.

201
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:29,283
Today, you can try my cooking.

202
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:31,703
- I have a nickname. 
 - I know.

203
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,383
The Steppe's God of Cooking.

204
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,272
You actually remember?

205
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:40,311
Brother Yun, I remember every word you said.

206
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:42,718
Hurry and try it.

207
00:19:56,243 --> 00:19:58,043
It's delicious.

208
00:19:58,043 --> 00:20:00,020
If so, you should eat up.

209
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:02,043
The beef here isn't good.

210
00:20:02,043 --> 00:20:05,202
The cattle raised on the steppe is the best.

211
00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:08,723
It's a shame that I can't try it.

212
00:20:08,723 --> 00:20:11,999
You can try it if you want to. You can try everything you want.

213
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:19,603
If you wish to try it, you can visit the steppe.

214
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:22,563
If you wish to pray to Buddha statues in the Buddhist States.

215
00:20:22,563 --> 00:20:26,403
If you wish to try the herbal tea of Nanjue, you can head to Nanjue.

216
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:32,143
If you want to travel east by boat, you can head to the largest port in the east and set sail.

217
00:20:34,243 --> 00:20:38,143
The world is vast. It's not like Tianqi, which is just a cage.

218
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:47,123
Brother Yun. I... I can't visit those places.

219
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:50,643
You can visit those places because I'll take you there.

220
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:54,264
No.

221
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:05,117
What's wrong, Wenjun?

222
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:08,272
Brother Yun.

223
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:11,203
Ye Yun, listen to me.

224
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,903
Five years ago, Prince Jingyu took a liking to me.

225
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:18,883
Since then, I've been trapped in this cage.

226
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:21,703
Back then, I was still writing to Dongjun.

227
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:24,423
Initially, I wanted to tell him about it.

228
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:27,603
But Father tampered with my letters.

229
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:31,857
He lied to Dongjun that I left Tianqi and was traveling the world.

230
00:21:32,963 --> 00:21:38,643
My marriage became a marriage alliance between Prince Jingyu and the Shadow Sect.

231
00:21:38,643 --> 00:21:41,914
They have set up layers of defenses to keep an eye on me.

232
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:48,157
And Senior Luo... is the first layer of defense.

233
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,163
I wasn't willing to submit to fate.

234
00:21:52,163 --> 00:21:55,043
I tried to escape this place using all kinds of methods.

235
00:21:55,043 --> 00:21:59,864
When you appeared suddenly that day, I thought there was hope.

236
00:22:09,323 --> 00:22:12,343
- If so, why are you... 
 - I know you're very powerful.

237
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:16,823
I got to know your temperament during our interactions.

238
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:22,563
If I requested that you take me with you, I'm sure you'd agree.

239
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:26,863
And everything could go according to my plan.

240
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:31,861
That is... if you weren't Ye Yun.

241
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:40,587
But you are.

242
00:22:41,683 --> 00:22:44,343
You're the person I love with all my heart.

243
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:46,728
That's why I cannot implicate you.

244
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:53,023
Just leave. Leave Tianqi now.

245
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:54,813
I'm not leaving.

246
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,378
It's either we leave together or we stay here together.

247
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,443
The weather today is great.

248
00:23:06,443 --> 00:23:12,635
It's appropriate for a trip, especially a long trip that we'll never return from.

249
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:22,203
You two won't be able to leave.

250
00:23:22,203 --> 00:23:24,001
Senior Luo.

251
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,223
Even if I do let you two leave, you won't be able to leave Tianqi City.

252
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,963
Junior. You know this too.

253
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,965
If so, Senior Luo...

254
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,682
Pardon me for the offense.

255
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,900
Have you lost your mind? You haven't recovered yet!

256
00:24:08,463 --> 00:24:13,363
I think I've lost my mind as well. But I have no choice.

257
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:17,503
Young man, you should take care of your body.

258
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:21,783
Why are you acting like your master? You shouldn't risk your life just to win.

259
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,003
Mister Li.

260
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:39,343
Very well. Although your master, Old Yi, is a useless fool, you're pretty good.

261
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:43,323
Mister Li, may I ask what brings you here?

262
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:45,430
I'm here to take him away.

263
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:48,590
I'm not leaving.

264
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,563
You really enjoy being here together with this beauty, don't you?

265
00:24:50,563 --> 00:24:55,483
Your master has already attacked Tianqi City. Are you sure you can stay here in peace?

266
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:58,883
Luckily I didn't take you as my disciple, because I'd be so angry at you.

267
00:24:58,883 --> 00:25:02,083
- But I... 
 - But what?

268
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:06,043
You wish to take her with you? You might not be able to defeat this man in front of you.

269
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:10,743
Even if you do defeat him, you still have to go through Shadow Sect's Four Bodyguards in Tianqi.

270
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:14,403
And also her father, Yi Bu, the Shadow Sect leader.

271
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:16,907
Do you think you can defeat all of them?

272
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:24,163
Listen. In Tianqi City, there's only one way for you to take her with you.

273
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:26,828
- What way? 
 - What way?

274
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:30,920
Mister Li, please tell me.

275
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,998
That is for me to take action.

276
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,700
Mister Li, do you mean...

277
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,980
You can keep on dreaming. Naturally, I'm not going to take action.

278
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:48,040
What I meant is, if you want to achieve your wish, you have to become the strongest.

279
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,020
Beauty, don't you agree?

280
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,920
Mister Li, you do have a point.

281
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,260
You're an exquisite beauty indeed. You're really beautiful.

282
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:04,397
I think I wouldn't be able to resist my urge to take you with me if I were 100 years younger.

283
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,220
You do have a good taste.

284
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:14,400
Enough already. I promised your master that I would leave Tianqi with you in three days. Let's depart.

285
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,900
But I...

286
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,940
Brother Yun. You should hurry and leave.

287
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,563
Six months. Wait for me for six months. I will return.

288
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,284
Sure.

289
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,643
Mister Li, wait.

290
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:10,183
What? You still can't bear to part with that beautiful lady?

291
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:16,403
Actually, I came to Tianqi because I had something to accomplish.

292
00:27:16,403 --> 00:27:20,403
I don't wish to leave without accomplishing it.

293
00:27:20,403 --> 00:27:23,003
Do you intend to kill Prince Qing?

294
00:27:23,003 --> 00:27:25,009
Sir, you know about it?

295
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:30,143
Right. You're Mister Li, who knows everything.

296
00:27:30,143 --> 00:27:31,843
- You're just being stupid. 
 - I'm not.

297
00:27:31,843 --> 00:27:35,583
Don't refute me yet. Back then, General Ye's subordinates risked their lives to rescue you.

298
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,443
And now you intend to kill Prince Qing? With what identity?

299
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:42,363
As one of the remaining rebels? Or as an escaped criminal of Beili?

300
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,723
If so, Prince Qing would die an honorable death.

301
00:27:46,723 --> 00:27:52,663
He punished the Ye Family rebels to uphold justice, yet died for the state because someone sought revenge.

302
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,923
What should I do, then?

303
00:27:58,123 --> 00:27:59,983
Prince Qing should be killed.

304
00:27:59,983 --> 00:28:04,403
However, you shouldn't be the one killing him. You should let people of the Martial World kill him.

305
00:28:04,403 --> 00:28:10,683
If you kill him, General Ye will never have his name cleared.

306
00:28:10,683 --> 00:28:13,483
But don't worry. Regarding the case of the General's Mansion,

307
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:17,523
Ruofeng has been secretly investigating for years, gathering evidence to prove your family's innocence.

308
00:28:17,523 --> 00:28:20,663
However, this is a major case.

309
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:24,323
It has deep implications. We still need time.

310
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,643
I understand now.

311
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:36,603
My father and the whole mansion must have their reputations cleared.

312
00:28:36,603 --> 00:28:41,703
We must make the people turn on Prince Qing.

313
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,800
All right. I trust you and Little Master.

314
00:28:49,663 --> 00:28:55,363
Smart boy. All right now. I'll take you to your friend.

315
00:28:55,363 --> 00:29:00,123
Although they're gone, you still have a friend left in this world.

316
00:29:12,443 --> 00:29:15,683
 When an old friend leaves, one should offer a willow branch as a farewell.

317
00:29:15,683 --> 00:29:20,283
 Firstly, it's a sign of their reluctance to part. Secondly, it's to remember the bond.

318
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,943
I should forget it. This is too embarrassing.

319
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,985
Brother Yun.

320
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,268
Dongjun.

321
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,334
Dongjun!

322
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,643
Brother Yun. You're alive.

323
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,428
This is great.

324
00:30:47,563 --> 00:30:53,203
You shouldn't look so upset whenever you mention my name.

325
00:30:53,203 --> 00:30:56,013
If one should die, you should die first.

326
00:30:56,843 --> 00:31:00,173
If not, we can die together.

327
00:31:00,173 --> 00:31:05,683
When gentlemen part ways, a brief chat is enough. Don't be so long-winded.

328
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,114
Dongjun, I know how much I mean to you.

329
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:18,163
Dongjun. That's all for now.

330
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,323
Now that we're parting ways, I don't know when we'll meet again.

331
00:31:23,323 --> 00:31:29,865
I hope that I'm already the Sword Deity, and you're the Liquor Deity when we meet again.

332
00:31:29,865 --> 00:31:34,403
When we meet again, I'm sure we'll still be the same us.

333
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:37,697
How sentimental.

334
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,948
See you.

335
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:47,821
Brother Yun, wait.

336
00:31:56,403 --> 00:31:58,149
This is for you.

337
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,989
A willow branch as a sign of farewell?

338
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,787
I've only read about this in the books, you know?

339
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,653
Brother Yun.

340
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,578
Take care.

341
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:21,603
Dongjun. Take care.

342
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,483
You'll get yourself another sworn friend soon.

343
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:10,623
I've got one. However, I think he's close to dead.

344
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:13,823
It's been a long time since I received a letter.

345
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,960
Who was jinxing me?

346
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,720
Seems like you don't pay much attention to that friend of yours.

347
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,520
Master, you're pretty dumb too. I was just joking with you.

348
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,200
That friend of mine is very lucky. He won't die easily.

349
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,500
Did you just call me dumb?

350
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,449
Let's go.

351
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,920
Master, what took you so long?

352
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,920
It's a long story. I'll summarize it for you.

353
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,560
Even heroes have a weakness for the charms of a beautiful woman.

354
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,240
What does that mean?

355
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,500
Dongba, do you have a girl you fancy?

356
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,660
I do. We promised to meet each other again.

357
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,740
- When? 
 - When I make a name for myself.

358
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,520
Why do you fancy her?

359
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,812
Because I fell for her at first glance.

360
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:19,120
But you don't know her age, personality, or background. Did you fall for her at first sight?

361
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,344
It's not that complicated to fall for a person. Isn't love at first sight enough?

362
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,280
She's the first girl I truly fancied.

363
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,000
Even if I meet others in the future, I'll remind myself that I already have someone I like.

364
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,820
You're right. I actually can't refute your words.

365
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,540
Master, what about you? Do you have a girl you fancy?

366
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,580
- I do. 
 - Where is she?

367
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,380
All of them are dead. It's because I've lived too long.

368
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,927
That's why all of them are dead.

369
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,562
Wait. Them?

370
00:34:51,562 --> 00:34:53,080
That's right.

371
00:34:53,080 --> 00:35:00,360
When my first wife passed away, I swore I would never marry again.

372
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,020
But after that I thought that since so many ladies were in love with me,

373
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,004
I would be letting them down if I didn't appreciate their love.

374
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,360
There are many stories about them.

375
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,420
It breaks my heart when I think about it.

376
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,878
It breaks my heart indeed.

377
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,488

378
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:37,100
Someone saw Mister Li leaving with Ye Yun, also known as Ye Dingzhi.

379
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,987
Word travels fast.

380
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,460
General Ye is a good person.

381
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,900
He's a loyal minister as well.

382
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,820
Ye Dingzhi is a good person as well.

383
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,323
He takes after his father.

384
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:56,840
Ruofeng. Now that Mister Li is intervening, don't you think it'll...

385
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:02,140
Brother, don't worry. Mister Li doesn't intend to get involved in the court power struggle.

386
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,020
Brother, I still have things to do at the Academy.

387
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,900
I shall take my leave for now.

388
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:45,400
Ruofeng... if a person has a guilty conscience,

389
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,362
what do you think will terrify them?

390
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,672
Fools!

391
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,240
All of you are useless fools!

392
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,380
So many of you searched the city for many days.

393
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,540
Even so you couldn't find Ye Yun.

394
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,960
And now? He was taken by that old geezer!

395
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,340
The world is vast.

396
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,240
Who can predict where he is right now?

397
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,415
You... do you know where he is?

398
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,133
You?

399
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,420
You know where he is, right? Tell me! Tell me!

400
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,400
I...

401
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,280
Tell me! Tell me where he is! Tell me!

402
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,985
Your Highness!

403
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,800
No one knows.

404
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,412
No one knows where he has gone.

405
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,180
No one knows when he'll return either.

406
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,660
Yingxian. You know what?

407
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:16,640
It feels like there's an executioner's blade hanging above my head all the time.

408
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,840
I can see it every day.

409
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,440
It's sharp and scary.

410
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,746
However, I have no idea when it'll land on my head.

411
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,366
I worry and live in fear every day.

412
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,693
I can never sleep well.

413
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,602
Your Highness, don't be afraid.

414
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,165
I'll always stay by your side and protect you.

415
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,890
- Senior Lei. 
 - Senior Lei.

416
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,700
- That's him, right? 
 - I think so.

417
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,400
Dongba.

418
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,060
In the past, I've heard about a people called bookworms.

419
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:19,836
Initially, I was dismissive of them until I got to know Mister Xie Xuan.

420
00:39:19,836 --> 00:39:22,717
Young Master Xie, what are you reading today?

421
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:25,540

422
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,520
"Luminous Moon Sword Techniques."

423
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,880
Are you reading a sword manual?

424
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,600
Second Senior, do you practice swordsmanship as well?

425
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,140
I'm a member of the Lei Clan, you know?

426
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,299
Of course, I don't.

427
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,540
But your sister-in-law, Xinyue, is the successor of Heart Sword.

428
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,760
Therefore, I heard about the Luminous Moon Sword Techniques.

429
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,320
These are highly advanced sword techniques that are almost lost to time.

430
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,420
Xie Xuan, you're only reading about it without practicing. Can you even master it?

431
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,860
Who said I wasn't practicing it?

432
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,755
I'm practicing it in my heart.

433
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,320
You think that I'm just reading a book.

434
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,880
However, I practice each technique in my heart as I read it.

435
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,900
Once I'm done, I'll master the techniques.

436
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,440
Young Master Xie, I never expected you to be a martial arts expert too.

437
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,640
I've never been in a fight. My sect always treats people with courtesy and respect.

438
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,940
Most of our sect members don't know martial arts.

439
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,500
What do you do if you encounter unreasonable people then?

440
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,240
I'll beat them up until they regain some sense.

441
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,240
But you said you didn't know any martial arts.

442
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,760
I said, most of us.

443
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,840
By that, I mean some of us do know martial arts.

444
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,640
For example, one of my martial uncles is very knowledgeable.

445
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,335
His martial arts level is as high as his intelligence level.

446
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:52,540
It's been so long since I saw him. I do miss him now.

447
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,740
 Their liquor is very famous here.

448
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,620
 - Is that so? 
 - Let's go and try it.

449
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:05,923

450
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,180
It's been so many years.

451
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,195
Even so, the writing is as beautiful as ever.

452
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:16,504

453
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,942
Second Senior, I have a question.

454
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,760
I'm now considered an official disciple, right?

455
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,860
Of course. The ceremony is over.

456
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,220
Why am I getting myself a master?

457
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,120
- To learn martial arts. 
 - If so, where's my master?

458
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,140
Even Luoxia has moved to Senior Liu Yue's residence to learn martial arts from him.

459
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:55,080
But my master? He's busy with everything except teaching me martial arts.

460
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,580
Although you have a master in order to learn martial arts,

461
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,240
Master didn't say that he was going to teach you, right?

462
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,040
Disciples have to learn the skills by themselves.

463
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,440
If so, what's the use of having a master?

464
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,982
Of course it's for you to say his name and terrify your foes

465
00:42:12,982 --> 00:42:14,980
when you're being bullied outside.

466
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,940
This is so boring!

467
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,940
I'll bring you somewhere that's not boring, then.

468
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,260
Dongba?

469
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,720

470
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,700

471
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:41,000

472
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:52,221
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

473
00:42:52,221 --> 00:43:00,041
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

474
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:09,321
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

475
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:17,912
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

476
00:43:17,912 --> 00:43:20,892
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

477
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:23,354
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

478
00:43:23,354 --> 00:43:27,801
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

479
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:32,152
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

480
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:35,632
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

481
00:43:35,632 --> 00:43:38,592
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

482
00:43:38,592 --> 00:43:41,212
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

483
00:43:41,212 --> 00:43:45,632
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

484
00:43:45,632 --> 00:43:49,992
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

485
00:43:49,992 --> 00:43:53,192
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

486
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:59,105
♫  I met you  ♫

487
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:43,407
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

488
00:44:43,407 --> 00:44:51,056
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

489
00:44:51,056 --> 00:45:00,616
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

490
00:45:01,764 --> 00:45:08,921
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

491
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:11,981
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

492
00:45:11,981 --> 00:45:14,381
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

493
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:18,761
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

494
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:23,241
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

495
00:45:23,241 --> 00:45:26,681
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

496
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:29,753
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

497
00:45:29,753 --> 00:45:32,261
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

498
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:36,721
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

499
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:41,041
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

500
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:44,421
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

501
00:45:44,421 --> 00:45:50,131
♫  I met you  ♫
