00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,840

2
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Holding onto life and death in the face of danger  ♫

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,800
♫  I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,740
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,860
♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,500
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,540
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,220
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,920
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,640
♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,280
♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost   ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,520
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,200

21
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,620

22
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:48,420

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,620
As expected, it's a spirit screen slope.

25
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,780
Will this route lead us to the formation's core?

26
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,540
Precisely.

27
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,960
This Lone Void Formation originally belonged to the military art.

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,080
It mysteriously helps channel fortune to one's side, thereby overwhelming the enemy.

29
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,360
The demonic sect lays the Ghostly Formation, but the solution to break it is quite similar.

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,900
The art of Ghostly Formation relies on concealment.

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,060
Naturally, the formation's core lies in a place that gathers abundant energy in the mountains.

32
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,780
On the northwest side of the mountain,

33
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,580
there is a boundless graveyard burying Han Xuan and the entire Han Army.

34
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,140
Han Xuan's rebellion failed, leading to his death.

35
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,300
Doesn't Ye Dingzhi want to do the same?

36
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,760
Soldiers have their energy.

37
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,380
As time passes, their energy accumulates and the mountain becomes a natural place for it.

38
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,940
Very well.

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,460
Will you continue to use your sword energy to clear a path for me?

40
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,560
My pleasure.

41
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,360
This is indeed a nice sword. What's its name?

42
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,540
Principles in life are written into a tome of a thousand volumes.

43
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,140
So, it's called the Thousand-Volume Tome.

44
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,180
With such a fine sword to clear the path, victory is assured.

45
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm joining you.

46
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,640
No.

47
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,020
If you go, no one can keep an eye on Xie Xuan.

48
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,860
His sword is clearing the path for me.

49
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,980
If enemies come, he might die here.

50
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,340
You should wait here.

51
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,180
Once I break the formation, head eastward to stop your best friend.

52
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,580
But you are all alone.

53
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,040
Don't worry.

54
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,540
Before we met I was on my own.

55
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,980
I'm off.

56
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,160
No need to worry.

57
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,560
In Beili, swords are favored, while in Nanjue and Man State, blades dominate.

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,640
Only a few in this world use spears.

59
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,540
That's why people have forgotten that the spear is the king of all weapons.

60
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,140
What demonic beings fear the most are spears.

61
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,700
During my stay here this place has been unusually cold.

62
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,220
Turns out it's because it's the soldiers graveyard.

63
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,800
Sleeping beside this military tomb every day was indeed quite disrespectful.

64
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,140
I, Sikong Changfeng, am a wandering martial artist.

65
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,900
As I wander here among the heroes, I have no incense to offer.

66
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,220
Instead, I present this long spear as a token of respect to honor your noble spirits.

67
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,040
Darn it.

68
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,600
I forgot to ask that darned scholar what to do after finding the formation's core.

69
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,980
There are so many graves here.

70
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,580
Do I have to dig them all up?

71
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,560
Lost Spirit Grass?

72
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,760
Why do I see the stone in the formation's core flickering?

73
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,780
Someone is approaching the formation's core, Elder.

74
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,120
Never mind.

75
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,020
So what if they approach it?

76
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,580
They can't break the formation anyway.

77
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,060
I have to rely on myself in a situation like this.

78
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,300
The King of Medicine once said that Lost Spirit Grass

79
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,860
grows among the graveyards in the wilderness where the soil is well-fed.

80
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,320
The area where all energy converges should be flourishing with it.

81
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,940
I have a spear technique named Dragon Transformation.

82
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,020
It was taught by my master, Li Changsheng,

83
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,340
but I won't use it today.

84
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,740
I also have another spear technique that, when executed, can stir up a commotion.

85
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,020
I won't use that one either.

86
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,000
I have a daughter.

87
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,700
She has a lovely name.

88
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,560
It's Sikong Qianluo.

89
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,480
I miss her very much,

90
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,520
so I created a new technique named Qianluo.

91
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,800
Fellow soldiers, watch closely.

92
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,340
Elder!

93
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,780
Whose spear strength is this?

94
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,000
It's continuous and tremendous.

95
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:00,260
I, Sikong Changfeng, hereby offer my 1,000th spear move to return all soldier spirits to their homes.

96
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,700
Fall!

97
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,920
The formation is broken. Charge!

98
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,020
I'm bushed. When I meet Baili Dongjun and Xie Xuan later,

99
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:54,000
I must tell them I used only one move, not a thousand.

100
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,120
 Sikong Changfeng!

101
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,320
I'm still breathing! Mission completed.

102
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,600
I should get going.

103
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,760
Thank you.

104
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,720
 Don't disappoint me!

105
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,800
I will not.

106
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,580

107
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,540
Yuzhen, where's my mule?

108
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,860
Over here, Senior. One moment.

109
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,840
Be quick. I won't be able to leave the mountain if I'm late.

110
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,200
I asked you to pack my baggage. You could've just packed lightly.

111
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,180
Here you go, Senior.

112
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,980
Let me see what you packed for me.

113
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,280
I grew these peaches myself.

114
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,620
I don't like peaches as much as you do.

115
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,820
Besides, are these peaches really for me?

116
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
What are you talking about? Give them back if you don't want them.

117
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,060
You can't take the peaches back after giving them away.

118
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,580
All right, I'm leaving.

119
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,180
Wait, Senior.

120
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,580
Forget about it. You're not coming with me.

121
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,820
Just stay on the mountain.

122
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,280
Those who want to go can't, while those who don't want to go are forced to.

123
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,160
How annoying.

124
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,560
Getting back his own wife is only right and natural. But why must we get involved in this?

125
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,180
Well, it's all because of our sect's rules that forbid marriage.

126
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,440
A bunch of stubborn old geezers with no sense of romance ruins others relationships.

127
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,540
What a sin.

128
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,700
Yuzhen, don't learn from them.

129
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,600
If you ever meet a girl you like in the future, marry her even if you have to fight.

130
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,140
Since you can't leave, I'm afraid that chance is gone.

131
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,870
Senior, are you going or not?

132
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,360
Right. Yes. I'm leaving.

133
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,260
Goodbye.

134
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,830

135
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,060
Senior, take care. Come back soon.

136
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,660
This mountain marks the boundary. Don't think you can overstep it you demonic sect.

137
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,440
Like we'd ever listen to you.

138
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,100
I think it's up to us.

139
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,240
I didn't expect the lands beyond the northern borders to have so many skilled martial artists.

140
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,500
Most importantly, they came in large numbers. They came one after another.

141
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,380
It's not that they're in large numbers, but you are too soft-hearted.

142
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,860
You injure them instead of killing them.

143
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,120
They go back to heal up in a day and then attack you the next day.

144
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,020
That's why they came one after another.

145
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,780
Who's there?

146
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,080
It's you, the Dark River.

147
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,580
Exactly. I wonder if we are welcome here my righteous friends.

148
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,580
They are dropping like flies. I see no reason they would push us away.

149
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,860
Xiao Changhe was right.

150
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,740
You so-called righteous sects are simply hypocritical.

151
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,620
They are coming for your lives so you should retaliate.

152
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:01,140
If not, they might think you are idiots.

153
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,500
- You! 
 - I don't think the Dark River came here just to tease us, right?

154
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,630
Of course not.

155
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,200
Although the Dark River used to kill solely for money,

156
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,080
this time it's our first act that has nothing to do with profit.

157
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,800
It's because our Top Leader said the invasion of the demonic sect into Beili

158
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,920
wouldn't do us any good and might affect our already struggling business.

159
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,000
Hence, we were sent here to help you.

160
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,540
What gimmick are you up to?

161
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,860
The Dark River may be an assassination organization,

162
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,880
but deep inside we value our country.

163
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,160
Su Changhe, the Undertaker of the Dark River.

164
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,780
Su Zhe, the Conical Hat Ghost of the Dark River.

165
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,780
Isn't there still one missing? I remember he was always inseparable from Su Changhe.

166
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,120
Do you mean him? He has become the Kui. Of course he's not with me.

167
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,560
But don't worry. He's coming. And he's the main force.

168
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,240
The Kui of the Dark River.

169
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,560
Judging by this lineup, are you planning to kill us off after helping us?

170
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,600
Take it easy.

171
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,020
We won't kill our own unless someone pays us to.

172
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,420

173
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,500
Jinxuan, have today's military reports arrived?

174
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,120
Your Majesty, they just arrived.

175
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,700
- Read them. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

176
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,780

177
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,980
"All towns occupied by Nanjue's army have already been reclaimed by the Langya Army."

178
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,920
"Though Nanjue's army hasn't retreated, they cannot achieve anything more."

179
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,640
"We won."

180
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,380
The current attack from Nanjue is merely a bluff from the beginning.

181
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:29,050
Besides, with Ruofeng personally leading the army to repel them, it's an easy feat.

182
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,340

183
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,860
"The West. The vicious mob in the Western Regions has been suppressed."

184
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,260
"There have been a few skirmishes with wandering rogues but they won't develop into a big threat."

185
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,240
"We won again."

186
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,680
Sending the Pofeng Army to suppress these wandering rogues is indeed a waste of their talents.

187
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680

188
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,000
As for the North...

189
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,880
Keep it as short as possible.

190
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

191
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,300
"The army of the northern tribes is extremely terrifying."

192
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,600
"Though their numbers are fewer than Nanjue's, they are ten times more ferocious."

193
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,960
"They are a force to be reckoned with."

194
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,100
"Fortunately, thanks to the valiant Langya Army, and some great help,"

195
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,800
"so please rest assured, Your Majesty."

196
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,000
"Great help?"

197
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,160
According to the military report, his name is Junyu.

198
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,500
He's from the Academy and a disciple of Mister Li's.

199
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,860
Mister Li?

200
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,200
Even though the top martial artist, Mister Li, has disappeared for so long,

201
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,490
his influence remains.

202
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,140
What about the Northwest?

203
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,900
What about that place?

204
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,420
We also received news from the Northwest.

205
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:01,660
We sent martial artists to keep the Northwest in check,

206
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:07,160
but this Wushuang City, being a martial city appointed by the founding Emperor,

207
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,840
has the responsibility to defend the country.

208
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,760
How come the missive is so informal?

209
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,780
Your Majesty, this isn't sent from Wushuang City.

210
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,220
It's from Sikong Changfeng of Xueyue City.

211
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,820
I see. It's the Vermillion Bird.

212
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,660
That explains it. What does the missive say?

213
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,400
Here's what it says. "The army of the demonic sect has been intercepted,"

214
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,460
"but only one person broke through and he is heading to Tianqi City."

215
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,920
"We are asked to guard the imperial city and protect Your Majesty."

216
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,400
Does this person have the nerve to come here to assassinate me alone?

217
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,820
What a joke.

218
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,600
This person is called Ye Dingzhi.

219
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,560
Your Majesty.

220
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,780
Jinxian?

221
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,760
Why are you here?

222
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,160
You seem anxious.

223
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,580
Did you receive the news that someone is heading here to assassinate me?

224
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,240
Please take shelter in the Heavenly Sword Pavilion.

225
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,660
No.

226
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,880
Your Majesty...

227
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:59,920
Jinxian, how long do you think until the assassination attempt?

228
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,160
I'm afraid it will be today.

229
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,560
White Tiger and Azure Dragon are waiting at the Qingyun Terrace.

230
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,420
Very well.

231
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,340
Let's meet him there.

232
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,050
Since he wishes to kill me, let him try.

233
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,790

234
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,160
He's approaching quickly.

235
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,680
The Heart Sword has a soul within.

236
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,100
Is it in fear?

237
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,140
No, it's excitement.

238
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,100
Your Majesty.

239
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,460
It's dangerous here. Please hurry and leave, Your Majesty.

240
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,580
It's too late.

241
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,320
The successor of Heart Sword from Swordheart Tomb.

242
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,960
Nice sword.

243
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,260
What a great sword core.

244
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,620
That's powerful. Which phase is he in now?

245
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,260
Truth be told, he's not inferior to Mister Li.

246
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,240
You know I came to kill you, why didn't you hide?

247
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,540
Such audacity.

248
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,260
I have done nothing wrong, so why would I be afraid of a thief like you?

249
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,640
A thief?

250
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,840
Who is the thief that stole someone else's wife?

251
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,640
Consort Xuan has long been married in Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

252
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,920
It was you who fooled and abducted her.

253
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,400
How am I the thief?

254
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,100
Consort Xuan?

255
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,480
Yi Wenjun is my wife.

256
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,920
We were betrothed and we have always been in love with each other.

257
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,160
Xiao Ruojin, you coerced her into marrying into the imperial family.

258
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,080
Beili has made her a sacrifice in your power struggle.

259
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,180
- You! 
 - Master Ye, I would hate to fight you.

260
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,320
But given that I'm right here, I can't just stand by and watch you kill the Emperor.

261
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,700
So bring it on!

262
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,420
I don't want to say this, but I have to.

263
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:11,140
Ye Dingzhi, do return to the correct path!

264
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,400
Nonsense!

265
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,240
There is more than just one path.

266
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,800
My path is to safeguard the little hut outside Gusu City.

267
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,180
Your hut is ruined!

268
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,920
But she is still alive.

269
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,420
As long as she is alive, I can rebuild the hut.

270
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,920
Xinyue!

271
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,080
That's enough.

272
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,740
Ji Ruofeng, you're proficient in the martial arts of all schools.

273
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,900
Ye Dingzhi is so powerful now.

274
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,420
Has he attained the Mental Phase of the Unknown?

275
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,300
No.

276
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,420
Only martial artists who follow the correct path are classified into four phases of the first stage.

277
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,700
He has strayed into the Sly Path, which is beyond the four phases.

278
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,340
Judging by his power, he should be in the Malevolence Phase.

279
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,420
Who else will stand in my way?

280
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,380
Transcended the suffering world of Yin without manifestation of immortality.

281
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,300
Held no name in the Netherworld nor among the Three Deities Mountains.

282
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,130
He's already above the Carefree Phase of Heaven.

283
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,380
In a sense, it's equivalent to the Mental Phase of the Unknown

284
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,740
It's just that he has deviated into the Sly Path due to his obsession.

285
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,580
He may seem powerful, but he's filled with heinous energy.

286
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,620
Those I have seen who fell into the Sly Path have lost their sanity.

287
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,180
How come Ye Dingzhi looks so sober?

288
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,860
He may seem so, but is trapped by his obsession.

289
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,120
If the State Preceptor hadn't left Tianqi for a long journey,

290
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,400
his obsession might have been dispelled.

291
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,680
However, that wouldn't happen.

292
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,500
Your technique can suppress my internal strength.

293
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,700
I didn't know that someone in Beili practiced the Xunian Art.

294
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,520
You are mistaken. The Xunian Art is passed down within Beique.

295
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,520
The one that remains in Beili is the Xuhuai Art.

296
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,580
Both arts originated from the same source.

297
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,120
They mutually reinforce and restrain each other.

298
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,100
Your real energy is damaged, giving me the upper hand.

299
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,380
You have lost.

300
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,420
They mutually reinforce and restrain each other?

301
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,500
It only happens when our phases are equal.

302
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,640
You've only just started your ascent, while I am already among the clouds.

303
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,040
You are way too far from your master, Zhuoqing,

304
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,480
who is locked away in the Imperial Mausoleum.

305
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:49,300
Back then, Yue Fengcheng and Baili Dongjun inserted their internal strength into my body,

306
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,220
I fully absorbed it.

307
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:58,860
Who are you to think you can compete with my internal strength?

308
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,490
 You stole my inner strength, yet you are boasting about it.

309
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,920
Who is that?

310
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:27,700
Don't worry. It's the grandson of the Marquis Zhenxi, Baili Dongjun.

311
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,760
You are here.

312
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,900
Long time no see.

313
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,740
No longer than the 10 years I thought you were dead.

314
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:54,460
Even though you weren't with me those 10 years, our hearts were still together.

315
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:59,280
But now, we are against each other.

316
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,700
So, are you finally going to draw your sword against me?

317
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,960
Do it, then.

318
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,120
Baili Dongjun, when you followed Ruofeng to Tianqi back then,

319
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,500
you were an immature lad when I saw you from the rampart.

320
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,100
Now you do seem like the young master from the Marquis's mansion.

321
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,840
Do not step over this sword. Leave Ye Dingzhi to me.

322
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,380
Brother Yun, mend your ways.

323
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,720
All people killed by the demonic sect did nothing wrong.

324
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:58,080
Brother Yun. I don't wish to fight you.

325
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,800
 When I grow up, I want to be the White Feather Sword Deity.

326
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,260
 When I grow up, I want to be the Green Feather Liquor Deity.

327
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,980
 When I grow up, I want to... be free and fight bad folks.

328
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,720
 When I grow up, I want to... focus on brewing liquor

329
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,720
 - and roam the Martial World with you! 
 - Roam the Martial World with you!

330
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,640
19 years ago the apricot blossoms were just as beautiful.

331
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,340
Back then you were fond of the cool so you changed into a lighter robe.

332
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:05,100
Unexpectedly a late spring cold brought you down.

333
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,260
I promised that once you recovered

334
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:14,280
I would take you and Wenjun to watch the apricot blossoms.

335
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,860
It's a shame that everything has changed.

336
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,560
We lost the chance.

337
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,880
This is my regret.

338
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,760
Now is the perfect time.

339
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,020
Let's go and watch apricot blossoms as promised.

340
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,120
Brother Yun, think about those innocent people.

341
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,040
Mend your ways.

342
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:52,880
Dongjun. I want to live for myself just once.

343
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,320
I'm sorry.

344
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,920
All right.

345
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,260
If so, I will fight you until you change your mind.

346
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,200
We have known each other for years, yet we haven't had a real duel.

347
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,400
I heard that after you lost all your cultivation you encountered a great opportunity.

348
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,160
Well,

349
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,640
I would like to see that.

350
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,680
What an imposing internal strength.

351
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,560
It's more powerful than the Autumn Water Technique.

352
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,640
I created this internal strength technique, called Hanging Sky.

353
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,300
Very well.

354
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,580
Who's there?

355
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,880
Senior.

356
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,140
Junior. It has been a long time.

357
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:43,540
I was told that after I left, you requested to be sent to Muliang City.

358
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,560
Why?

359
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,860
Someone wrote me a letter.

360
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,920
Qingyang. I think I heard the sound of the Pavilion Moon.

361
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,740
It's him, isn't it?

362
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,640
Yes, it's him.

363
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,540
He's back. I will take you to him.

364
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,200
To think that two young geniuses show up at the same time.

365
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,460
If they didn't oppose each other, the martial fortune of Beili would've surpassed Nanjue's by a hundred years.

366
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:36,940
The duel between them may seem confusing, but Ye Dingzhi has definitely got the upper hand.

367
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:41,720
If Baili Dongjun fails, we have no choice but to fight to the death.

368
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,540
No one can get away with this.

369
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,287
As of now, they are still testing each other. They haven't resorted to their strongest moves yet.

370
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:51,280
The showdown between two experts requires no more than one sword move.

371
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,300
And I'm waiting for it.

372
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,960
This liquor is named Xuyu.

373
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,980
I made it when I first entered the martial arts world.

374
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,740
Ye Dingzhi, as its name implies, life and death are as fleeting as a thought.

375
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,540
Attack and retreat are decided by a thought. The world comes into being within a thought.

376
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,260
This sword move inherits the divine aura of my master.

377
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,820
Do watch closely.

378
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:56,520
My sword move is the final move my master launched at Dongyue Lake.

379
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,920
Neither deities nor demons, only death can cease it.

380
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,460
I have never seen such a desperate move.

381
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,140
Is this Ye Dingzhi's strongest move you mentioned?

382
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,460

383
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,690

384
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:50,070

385
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:01,601
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

386
00:36:01,601 --> 00:36:09,420
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

387
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:19,080
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

388
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:27,100

389
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,420
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

390
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,780
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

391
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,120
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

392
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,580
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

393
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,060
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

394
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,120
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

395
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,540
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

396
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:55,060
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

397
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:59,422
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

398
00:36:59,422 --> 00:37:02,820
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

399
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,100
♫  I met you  ♫
