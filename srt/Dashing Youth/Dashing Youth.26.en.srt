00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:43,780
but he even sends

377
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,340
an old man to follow him when he leaves.

378
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,620
Second Young Lady,

379
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,820
it seems

380
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,700
it's not the right time

381
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,780
to take Ye Dingzhi away.

382
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,220
Send someone to follow him

383
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,580
and see where he's going.

384
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,900
We can take our time to plan.

385
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,820
There's nothing I want

386
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,260
that I can't have.

387
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,020
Master, I can't hold on any longer.

388
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,060
You can't hold on

389
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,980
with such a small bag?

390
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,780
Master, I can't bear

391
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,780
the thought that I'll have

392
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,660
to walk hundreds of li

393
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,820
with this bag on my back.

394
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,860
Are we practitioners

395
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,980
afraid of this?

396
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,900
We practitioners

397
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,380
can't eat this

398
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,180
or that,

399
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,380
so why must we suffer this?

400
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,580
Do you think I'm going to stop

401
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,700
after what you've said?

402
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,820
You're more stubborn

403
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,300
than that big black bull

404
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,900
down the hill.

405
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,980
If you say you're going, you're going.

406
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,700
Then why are you still complaining?

407
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,860
Can't I just express my thoughts?

408
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,300
Wuchan,

409
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,620
do you know

410
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,660
there's a Gusu City under that mountain

411
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,940
we're going to?

412
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,060
So what?

413
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,540
Can it compare to Tianqi?

414
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,780
I've seen a lot of fun

415
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,260
in Tianqi City.

416
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,580
Although Gusu City

417
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,660
is not as big as Tianqi City,

418
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,660
it's much more interesting

419
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,180
than Tianqi City.

420
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,780
In spring, there are flower selling
in the streets, shrimp fighting,

421
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,740
board jumping, and juggling.

422
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,060
Everything you like is there.

423
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,260
Besides,

424
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,540
candied hawthorns there

425
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,580
are especially good.

426
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,300
When we get there,

427
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,220
I'll buy you two skewers,

428
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,660
one to eat and one to watch.

429
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,580
What do you think?

430
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,900
Say no more.

431
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,100
Master, let's go now.

432
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,980
Quick!

433
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,330
[Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion]

434
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,180
Yu.

435
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,540
Yu.

436
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,100
You'll have to get a hold

437
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,460
of yourself later.

438
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,140
Don't worry, Father.

439
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,660
I won't go too far.

440
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,540
Father, I'm back.

441
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,900
My dear!

442
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,580
Dear!

443
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,060
Dear, please talk nicely.

444
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,700
Tell me.

445
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,380
Should I

446
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,260
punish you with Three-inch Ash

447
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,300
or kill you?

448
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,340
Dear, please spare my life.

449
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,180
Didn't you say

450
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,780
you wouldn't go too far?

451
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,500
I let you attend the wedding banquet

452
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,460
in Tianqi City.

453
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,580
Did I tell you to beat up our son?

454
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,780
Did I tell you
to bring our son back here

455
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,700
and lock him up?

456
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,580
What's wrong with him robbing a bride?

457
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,700
If you hadn't robbed a bride,

458
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,660
would you have him now?

459
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,060
No.

460
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,980
Didn't you always say he's no good?

461
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,020
He's following
in his father's footsteps,

462
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,420
and you're not satisfied?

463
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,380
Now, go

464
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,460
and release him.

465
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,700
No way, Dear.

466
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,020
It's important to keep him locked up

467
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,980
for a while to help him grow up.

468
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,780
He's not a kid anymore.

469
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,980
Fine.

470
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,180
Then I'll let you grow up too.

471
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,460
Three... Three-inch Ash.

472
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,100
Dear, don't act rashly.

473
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,580
You two can settle this

474
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,940
between yourselves.

475
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,900
I'm waiting to talk to Chengfeng.

476
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,500
I don't want to see you fight.

477
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,700
I'll wait for you
in the backyard tonight.

478
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,100
I... I'll sleep in the barracks tonight.

479
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,660
Fine.

480
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,820
Then you'll

481
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,340
stay in the barracks
for the rest of your life.

482
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,020
It really freaked me out.

483
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,380
Father, why didn't you do something?

484
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,500
She almost

485
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,740
killed your son just now.

486
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,860
Dongjun's temper

487
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,220
is all because she's spoiled him.

488
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,140
And me, too.

489
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,740
Regarding the bride snatching
in Tianqi City,

490
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,980
is the man Dongjun helped

491
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,700
really a descendant of Ye?

492
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,300
I've spoken to Prince Langya in private.

493
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,180
His identity is confirmed.

494
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,940
He's indeed

495
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,420
the little Yun who escaped

496
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,220
from the extermination of the Ye family.

497
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,940
He's changed his name now.

498
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,220
He's called Ye Dingzhi.

499
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,420
Ye Dingzhi.

500
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,820
What a good name.

501
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,340
I didn't expect Ye to

502
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,260
have a descendant

503
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,420
after he passed away

504
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,380
for so long.

505
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,340
Yes.

506
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,460
Heaven knows what's in store for us.

507
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,500
Is he safe now?

508
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,940
Prince Langya said

509
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,020
he had sent him

510
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,860
out of Tianqi in secret

511
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,820
and promised me to keep him safe.

512
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,940
The words of the imperial family
are not to be fully trusted.

513
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,260
I think we need

514
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,060
to get someone to protect him in secret.

515
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,300
After all, we couldn't

516
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,060
save Ye back then.

517
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,740
At least, we need

518
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,180
to protect his lineage now.

519
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,860
I understand.

520
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,460
However,

521
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,420
I tell myself

522
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,340
that Xiao Ruofeng

523
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,820
is trustworthy.

524
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,820
He can be trusted,

525
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,620
but what about Xiao Ruojin?

526
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,860
Father, as you said,

527
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,620
he's a member of the imperial family.

528
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,940
Prince Langya is a man of great talent

529
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,780
and virtue.

530
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,260
But usually, such people

531
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,540
don't wish to be an emperor.

532
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,820
Only someone like Prince Jingyu

533
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,180
is eager to seize power.

534
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,300
We must be careful.

535
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,340
Yes.

536
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,580
Shouldn't we

537
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,700
go and check him out?

538
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,900
It's the first time I've seen Dongjun

539
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,140
stay in one place for so long.

540
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,180
Forget it.

541
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,660
I don't think he wants to see me.

542
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,740
If you didn't do anything,

543
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,580
he and Yun would be dead.

544
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,220
You

545
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,140
should at least tell them,

546
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,740
let them know.

547
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,340
They're kids.

548
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
They won't listen.

549
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,820
Kids?

550
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,500
I think I heard someone say

551
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,780
he's not a kid anymore.

552
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,860
You...

553
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,740
Wuchan,

554
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,060
do you remember everything

555
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,740
I just told you?

556
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,260
I don't listen to a turtle chanting.

557
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,540
I'm a turtle

558
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,340
and you're a little turtle.

559
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,020
Master, you don't even have a map.

560
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,460
If we just walk like this,

561
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,380
can we make it to Gusu City?

562
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,300
No rush. We've got
some important things to do.

563
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,900
It's him.

564
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,740
Isn't he the one
who's been living in our yard

565
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,140
for a few days?

566
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,620
I heard

567
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,340
that he's going to be killed
if he's caught.

568
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,620
What a coincidence

569
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,660
that you're here too, Mr. Ye.

570
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,700
Since we've crossed paths,

571
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,580
let's travel together.

572
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,420
Crossed paths?

573
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,340
That's a nice way of putting it.

574
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,300
Elder Wangyou, I've heard that
you're a profound practitioner

575
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,620
who doesn't care about worldly affairs.

576
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,180
When did you

577
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,540
become the accomplice
of the imperial family of Beli

578
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,220
and start stalking me?

579
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,460
You've been stalking me

580
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,820
all the way here.

581
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,620
So it's time to stop, isn't it?

582
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,580
Mr. Ye, that's not true.

583
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,820
It's because

584
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,340
I don't like Tianqi City

585
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,380
that I'm leaving.

586
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,260
It's just that the journey is boring

587
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,580
and I don't know martial arts,

588
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,460
so I'd like

589
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,380
to travel with you.

590
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,660
I hope you

591
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,980
can take care of us.

592
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,020
Master,

593
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,340
you didn't say
we were going to traveling with him.

594
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,100
Shut it.

595
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,620
But why should I

596
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,060
travel with you?

597
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,340
That's scary.

598
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,580
How interesting.

599
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,860
The master doesn't know martial arts,

600
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,020
but his disciple
is a future martial expert.

601
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,580
Mr. Ye, you must be joking.

602
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,140
I don't need any companions.

603
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,460
I'll walk

604
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,940
my own path.

605
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,420
Mr. Ye, be patient.

606
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,860
How dare you say
you don't know martial arts?

607
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,740
Mr. Ye,

608
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,300
I really don't know martial arts.

609
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,340
I can only dodge, run

610
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,500
and...

611
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,060
What else?

612
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,940
As expected.

613
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,340
Bore Bell of Heart, drop.

614
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,060
I can trap people.

615
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,620
Master.

616
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,140
Mr. Ye,

617
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,100
you'd better travel with me.

618
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,820
Why

619
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,540
is this happening?

620
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,740
Demon Deity Sword Techniques

621
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,180
are the ways of the demon after all.

622
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,860
Before, you had a firm heart,

623
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,260
so there was no harm.

624
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,340
But now you can't get

625
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,900
what you desire,

626
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,580
so your mind is unstable.

627
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,860
If your mind is unstable

628
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,100
and the barrier is broken,

629
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,540
the demonic thoughts
will penetrate your body

630
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,220
and this is the result.

631
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,940
That's why I insist

632
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,540
on traveling with you.

633
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,740
It's only for two years.

634
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,260
After two years,

635
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,660
your mind will be stable

636
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,540
and you won't be afraid
of the demonic power's repercussions.

637
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,740
Why are you helping me?

638
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,860
Aren't we practitioners

639
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,620
supposed to help people in need?

640
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,100
I meet you

641
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,300
when you happen to be in trouble,

642
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,900
so I help you.

643
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,620
What reason do I need?

644
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,020
To be honest,

645
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,940
I have no destination in mind

646
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,500
adn don't know where I'm headed.

647
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,940
I thought

648
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,460
I could take her away from Tianqi

649
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,580
and we could go back to Nanjue together.

650
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,540
I have a hut there,

651
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,340
surrounded by bamboo,

652
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,820
mountains

653
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,460
and a river.

654
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,100
We'll live

655
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,140
a carefree life together.

656
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,660
There's a mountain outside of Gusu City.

657
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,060
It's

658
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,500
perfect for hermits like us.

659
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,540
That's where

660
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,100
I'm going.

661
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,260
Gusu City is good,

662
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,660
and so is the mountain.

663
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,140
Since you

664
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,500
don't know where you're going,

665
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,060
why don't you

666
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,380
follow me there?

667
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,860
It's far away from Tianqi City

668
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,980
and no one will disturb you.

669
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,020
It's only for two years, right?

670
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,660
Two years, tops.

671
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,780
After two years,

672
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,540
my Demon Deity Sword Techniques

673
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,900
won't have any more repercussions?

674
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,900
Not only will it not have repercussions,

675
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,500
but it will also advance
to a higher level.

676
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,500
All right.

677
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
Master,

678
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,300
so you're really good.

679
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,060
I can't believe

680
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,300
you made a big bell out of no where.

681
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,020
Master, can you make
a candied hawthorn skewer

682
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,660
out of no where?

683
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,340
No.

684
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,540
Qing,

685
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,540
you're back.

686
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,220
Yes,

687
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,460
I am.

688
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,940
But why are you here?

689
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,460
I...

690
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,820
I heard them say

691
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,780
you were going to give up
on the restoration.

692
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,660
You lied to me.

693
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,500
You've betrayed us.

694
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,340
Qing,

695
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,340
I...

696
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,060
Yao,

697
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,780
you're so heartless.

698
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,420
Have you forgotten

699
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,860
the death of Mother?

700
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,700
I haven't.

701
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,180
It's because

702
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,940
I saw the death of Mother

703
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,860
and experienced

704
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,660
the pain of separation

705
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,620
that I don't want this

706
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,460
to happen to anyone else.

707
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,620
War

708
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,700
requires countless innocent lives

709
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,660
to pay for it.

710
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,660
Our country is history.

711
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,700
Why don't

712
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,460
we rebuild a new home?

713
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,300
It's only because

714
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,500
you're in love with Baili Dongjun.

715
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,180
You're doing it
for your own selfish reasons.

716
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,020
Don't make yourself

717
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,140
sound so great.

718
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,420
Yes.

719
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,580
I am in love with Baili Dongjun,

720
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,100
but that has nothing to do
with my decision.

721
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,020
You expect me to believe that?

722
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,140
In your heart, is love,

723
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,580
such a vague feeling,

724
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,580
worth trusting with your life?

725
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,940
Yue Yao,

726
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,180
stop with the jokes.

727
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,420
To him, you're a liar.

728
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,140
You're just

729
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,020
an enemy of his nation.

730
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,180
Of course our relationship

731
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,660
is worth trusting with our lives.

732
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,140
Qing,

733
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,100
that's because
you haven't encountered it yet.

734
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,380
So what if it's worth trusting
with your life?

735
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,300
In the end, there's nothing
you can do about it.

736
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,860
What did you say?

737
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,460
Baili Dongjun

738
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,900
helped his good friend, Ye Dingzhi,

739
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,020
to rob his bride.

740
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,820
But they failed in the end,

741
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,180
and his whereabouts are unknown.

742
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,060
Perhaps he's already dead.

743
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,780
Dongjun.

744
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,340
No.

745
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,220
If only I had someone

746
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,660
to keep me company.

747
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,260
Why don't I play the guqin

748
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,020
Master left me first?

749
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,020
What? Can't you stand it anymore?

750
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,620
You sound like

751
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,180
you just woke up.

752
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,140
Sir,

753
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,100
you're here to laugh at me, aren't you?

754
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,260
I'm curious

755
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,620
to see you accepting your punishment

756
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,580
without saying a word

757
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,580
and staying here.

758
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,940
Have you learned your lesson

759
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,500
or are you trying to challenge me?

760
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,820
Now it seems neither.

761
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,660
You're just hiding out here
to slack off.

762
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,180
Who's slacking?

763
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,980
I've been practicing
my guqin and sword.

764
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,260
If you're so capable, come in

765
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,260
and let's have a fight.

766
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,060
Who wants to fight with you?

767
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,100
I'm here to ask you

768
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,380
if you've thought

769
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,220
about why you've been locked up.

770
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,460
Because I was robbing a bride
for a friend of mine,

771
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,460
and the one I was robbing from

772
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,820
was the Prince of Tianqi City.

773
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,100
My surname is Baili.

774
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,020
I can't just think for myself.

775
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,580
I have

776
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,020
the entire Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion
behind me.

777
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:57,980
Rubbish!

778
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,700
I think what you learned from Mr. Li

779
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,460
has been for nothing.

780
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,740
Yun is your childhood friend,

781
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,060
and your friend for life.

782
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,540
when you grow up.

783
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,420
It's not wrong for you
to help your buddy

784
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,260
to rob his bride.

785
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,980
Even if the entire
Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion

786
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,940
is implicated, as you said,

787
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,940
you're still not wrong.

788
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,140
If we live in the world

789
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,780
just for fame and fortune,

790
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,260
and have no regard for integrity,

791
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,300
then what kind of men are we?

792
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,500
What's wrong with you

793
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,620
is that you overestimated yourself.

794
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,860
Overestimating yourself

795
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:41,980
is when you do

796
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,020
something you can't yet do

797
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,340
and can't bear

798
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,580
the consequences of your failure.

799
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,260
However,

800
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,380
you're not bad for being my son.

801
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,660
I also robbed a bride before

802
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,860
when I was young.

803
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,180
Back then, I wanted
to marry your mother,

804
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,820
but her father refused

805
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,140
because he had already betrothed her

806
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,260
to the eldest son
of the Xu family in Lingnan.

807
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,580
So on their wedding day,

808
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,340
I went to rob the bribe.

809
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,420
Your grandfather
didn't support me either.

810
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,580
Your grandfather had an army
of thousands of soldiers,

811
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,300
but he let me rob the bride

812
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,380
by myself with a sword.

813
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,500
But that's fine.

814
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,500
From the eldest son of the Xu family,

815
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,620
to the head of the Xu family,

816
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,860
to the Xu family's altar,

817
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,740
they all fell under my sword.

818
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,100
I was able to take your mother

819
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,540
not only because we were in love,

820
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,420
but also because
I am capable of doing so.

821
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,660
Do you think

822
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,020
you are competent?

823
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,500
That's the real reason

824
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,700
why I've grounded you here.

825
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,820
You also know

826
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,540
that today's Emperor Tai'an

827
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,020
is no longer

828
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,780
the same buddy who fought

829
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,620
alongside your grandfather
and General Ye Yu.

830
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,540
The righteousness of the past

831
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,060
can't stand up

832
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,620
to a heart hardened by power.

833
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,580
That's why your grandfather didn't want

834
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,780
you to get involved

835
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,300
in this complicated matter.

836
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,260
But since you chose to get involved,

837
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,060
you must be prepared.

838
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,020
There's no sentiment
in the imperial court,

839
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,060
but we have to have it.

840
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,460
You can leave here anytime you want.

841
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,900
But...

842
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,700
How?

843
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,140
Tell these soldiers outside the door

844
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,780
you're ready.

845
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,380
There's only one chance.

846
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,900
I'm not a man of leisure.

847
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,660
I don't have time to come here

848
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,620
and talk to you all the time.

849
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,660
Anyway, remember,

850
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,940
if you want to get out early,

851
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,500
have someone pass me a message.

852
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,780
I expect

853
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,100
to see

854
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,620
what you're truly capable of

855
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,700
when you come to me.

856
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,420
Sir.

857
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,420
You brat, stop calling me that.

858
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,540
I'm your father.

859
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,140
Baili Chengfeng.

860
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,180
You brat, I...

861
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:17,900
Father!

862
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,700
Thank you.

863
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,580
Thank you so much

864
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,740
for saying that to me.

865
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,820
Enough, you brat.

866
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,220
Keep practicing.

867
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,820
He just likes to talk tough.
