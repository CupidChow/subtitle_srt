to steal the bride,

59
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,180

Therefore, his attempt
at stealing the bride

65

isn't without merit.

66

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,620

102
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,340
whether or not I would draw my sword

103
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,540

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,140
I admire you.

190
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,300
If it's possible,

191
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,500
Dingzhi,

192
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,980
you should stop here.

193
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,180
Stop the fight.

194
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,180
There's a lady waiting for me inside.

195
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,780
I don't wish to disappoint her.

196
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,180
You're no match for me.

197
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,220
Even so,

198
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,500
I won't know unless I give it a try.

199
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,260
Haoque Sword,

200
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,500
ranked eighth out of the top ten

201
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,220
in Record of Famous Swords.

202
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,620
It's known as

203
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,300
The Sword of Righteousness.

204
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,860
But, Little Master,
do you think your action today

205
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,220
is worthy of its title?

206
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,060
Power, the bigger picture,

207
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,260
are those truly

208
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,540
more important than her will?

209
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,380
Sorry for this.

210
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,180
You're much stronger than you were

211
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,940
six months ago.

212
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,620
It's because I spent the past six months

213
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,460
preparing for this day alone.

214
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,100
Did you learn
the Demon Deity Sword Techniques?

215
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,380
So what if I did?

216
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,980
Learning that technique will cause

217
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,180
great stress to one's body.

218
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,340
You're still young.

219
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,180
You shouldn't have learned that.

220
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,300
You shouldn't repeat

221
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,100
your master's mistake.

222
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,340
It won't be a mistake

223
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,060
as long as I win today.

224
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,420
It's over!

225
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,380
You've underestimated me.

226
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,060
That's the Xiao Family's

227
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,820
Lieguo Sword Technique.

228
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,940
You thought you could win.

229
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,940
Since you learned
the Demon Deity Sword Techniques,

230
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,700
that proves that you know

231
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,260
you can't win.

232
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,140
You knew

233
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,180
that you couldn't win.

234
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,820
That's why you're
risking everything you have

235
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,500
to learn this move.

236
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,020
Rain Demon could never win
against Mr. Li,

237
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,140
just like you can never win against me.

238
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,300
Dingzhi,

239
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,100
leave

240
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,020
or die.

241
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,580
How dare you talk back to your father

242
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,460
when this is all you have?

243
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,380
Baili Chengfeng!

244
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,180
You're not the one getting married here.

245
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,980
Why are you spending
so much effort here?

246
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,820
I just want to let you know

247
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,940
that when youngsters like you

248
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,260
try to go against adults,

249
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,460
they need to think about

250
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,780
whether or not they're strong enough

251
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,900
to overcome the hurdle.

252
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,740
If they're not strong enough,

253
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,620
they can still afford to wait.

254
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,580
That's not enough.

255
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,860
I don't wish to miss out
on that sword technique.

256
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,780
I don't wish

257
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,140
to regret that I didn't get
to see that sword technique today

258
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,020
after losing everything

259
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,020
I have.

260
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,420
It's pointless

261
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,260
even if you see it.

262
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,860
It's just like how Rain Demon

263
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,460
can never defeat Li Changsheng.

264
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,380
That's right.

265
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,180
I thought I couldn't win.

266
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,660
That's why
I'm risking everything I have.

267
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,620
But I'm different from Master.

268
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,460
If he can't win,

269
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,740
he'll wait for his next chance.

270
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,300
This is my only chance.

271
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,740
If I can't win,

272
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,380
I will continue to think of solutions.

273
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,620
I'll think of solutions
and keep on winning!

274
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,940
Immovable

275
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,660
Lord

276
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,260
Technique,

277
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,700
now!

278
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,580
If I keep waiting,

279
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,980
the girl he loves

280
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,500
will belong to someone else.

281
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,700
I will never let them achieve

282
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,540
their dirty goals.

283
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,340
Dongjun,

284
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,260
if she's the girl you like,

285
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,540
I'll resist the world together with you

286
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,780
even if everyone is against us.

287
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,180
I'll beat them up
until they agree with you.

288
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,860
It's a shame that she's not.

289
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,620
You're here to steal a bride
on a stranger's behalf.

290
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,740
He's not a stranger.

291
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,300
He's Yun.

292
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,340
You once promised me

293
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,540
that you would protect the Shadow Sect.

294
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,300
But Wenjun shouldn't be

295
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,500
the sect's sacrificial lamb!

296
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:04,900
Don't do it!

297
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,820
You've already used
Demon Deity Sword Techniques.

298
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,100
If you use Immovable Lord Technique now

299
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,540
and activate both sinister skills,

300
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,780
you'll die at any time!

301
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,900
There's no way back now.

302
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,700
Anyway, I won't leave.

303
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,940
At most, I'll just die here.

304
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,940
Ye Dingzhi,

305
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,820
why are you putting yourself
through this?

306
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,380
Rumor has it that
Prince Langya, Xiao Ruofeng,

307
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,660
is open-minded and righteous.

308
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,540
He's the most magnanimous person

309
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,020
among the princes.

310
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,020
But can't you tolerate

311
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,460
the love of a couple

312
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,900
when you're this magnanimous?

313
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,340
This wedding

314
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,140
is a marriage alliance

315
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,620
between the Shadow Sect
and Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

316
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,180
I can't just...

317
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,300
If Prince Qing gains influence,

318
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,620
the world will be in turmoil.

319
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,860
So, for the sake of the world,

320
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,540
you'll sacrifice

321
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,900
the relationship
of a loving couple, right?

322
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,340
Just like how my family was slain

323
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,140
to achieve world peace, right?

324
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,460
Sorry about this.

325
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,540
Die!

326
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,740
The auspicious hour is nearing.

327
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,220
Young Lady,

328
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,860
if you don't move now,

329
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,900
when the steward gets angry, I'll be...

330
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,820
I wish to wait a little longer.

331
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,780
Young Lady, what are you waiting for?

332
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,900
What's your name?

333
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,500
My name is Die.

334
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,900
Can you sing?

335
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,260
I can.

336
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,860
Do you know how to sing
the most popular song

337
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,940
in Tianqi City,

338
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,340
"Butterfly Lovers"?

339
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:01,700

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,100
It's your win.

347
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,420
Ye Dingzhi,

348
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,780
even if you defeat me,

349
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,780
you won't be able to leave Tianqi.

350
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,500
If you go berserk,

351
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,300
you'll become wasted
for the rest of your life!

352
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,780
You should give up!

353
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,780
Give up?

354
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,060
I no longer wish

355
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,380
to give up on anything.

356
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,420
I will never give up.

357
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,660
I won't stop

358
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,980
until I die!

359
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,620
Ye Dingzhi!

360
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,540
The auspicious hour has arrived.

361
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,460
Play the music. Welcome the newlywed.

362
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,500
This is bad.

363
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,300
He has lost his mind.

364
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,660
I won.

365
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,100
I...

366
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,740
I won.

367
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,460
Young Lady, we're just waiting for you.

368
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,100
Are there

369
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,180
still no movements
outside the residence?

370
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,740
Nothing's changed.

371
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,740
Everything is fine.

372
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,660
All right, then.

373
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,860
Let's not wait any longer.

374

Small kindness benefits individuals,

558
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,540
while great kindness benefits the world.

559
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,300
Good people practice small kindness,

560
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,340
while a wise ruler
practices great kindness.

561
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,020
When there's a wise ruler,
a prosperous era will usher.

562
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,060
However,
if a good person rules the nation,

563
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,540
the world will be plunged into chaos.

564
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,020
As I don't practice great kindness,

565
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,740
I don't pay attention
to small kindness either.

566
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,260
But Ruofeng,

567
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,780
he's different.

568
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,540
Your Majesty, Prince Qing
requests an audience.

569
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:52,980
Summon him.

570
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

571
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,700
Summon Prince Qing.

572
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,380
Xie,

573
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,780
What brings you here today?

574
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,340
I'm not busy today anyway.

575
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,020
Father, I can visit you every day

576
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,980
as long as you're willing.

577
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,540
You're not busy today, huh?

578
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,620
But I heard

579
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,780
that you didn't even attend
Ruojin's wedding.

580
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,980
I didn't attend it

581
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,020
as I was afraid I might embarrass him.

582
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,540
Not only did you not attend it,

583
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,700
but you're also saying that
you might embarrass him if you do?

584
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,100
Initially, I was planning to attend it.

585
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,380
But I heard that someone
was going to steal the bride.

586
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,980
It was a prince's wedding,

587
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,140
yet crooks were trying
to steal his bride.

588
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,300
If I do witness the event,

589
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,540
I'm sure Ruojin will be embarrassed.

590
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,140
Why have I not

591
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,100
received any news about it?

592
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,620
I'm afraid

593
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,860
someone swept it
under the rug on purpose.

594
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,780
Father,

595
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,020
they have no respect

596
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,140
for you at all.

597
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,500
That's enough.

598
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,420
Tell me, then.

599
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,460
Who's daring enough

600
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,460
to sabotage the marriage
that I've granted?

601
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,820
Of course

602
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,020
it's Ye Yun, the survivor
of the wretched Ye Family.

603
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,460
Not only did he do it himself,

604
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,420
but he also called his best friend,
Baili Dongjun,

605
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,420
to join him.

606
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,500
Of course, with Ruofeng around,

607
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,180
they were unable to do anything.

608
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,220
Baili Dongjun?

609
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,900
Are you saying

610
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,620
that Ruofeng

611
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,420
was the one who handled it in the end?

612
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,220
About that,

613
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,460
I don't know the details either.

614
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,940
The lass from the Shadow Sect

615
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,180
was indeed betrothed
to the General's Mansion.

616
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,620
But

617
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,740
that was a long time ago.

618
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,060
So,

619
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,140
they actually have such a relationship.

620
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,380
Where are they?

621
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,260
They vanished.

622
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,620
But I saw

623
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,260
one of Marquis of Zhenxi's carriages

624
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,420
leaving Tianqi in secret after that.

625
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,380
And there were two individuals
in the carriage.

626
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,420
Are you saying

627
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,460
that the Marquis of Zhenxi
took them away?

628
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,300
It does make sense
when you think about it.

629
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,820
After all, the Marquis of Zhenxi

630
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,020
were great friends

631
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,020
with Great General.

632
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,020
They're close indeed.

633
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,500
Although they've been separated by death

634
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,340
for many years,

635
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,900
he's still protecting that son of his.

636
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,500
You're wrong.

637
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,700
I,

638
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,140
Baili Luochen,

639
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,700
and Ye Yu

640
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,820
were sworn brothers.

641
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,340
Pardon me for the offense.

642
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,660
[Muyun Abode]

643
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,660
You're awake.

644
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,860
What time is it?

645
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,980
You don't need to worry.

646
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,300
You've been unconscious for two days.

647
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:23,980
Who are you?

648
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,940
I have the same surname as you,
which is Ye.

649
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,300
My name is Ye Xiaoying.

650
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,900
But don't misunderstand me.

651
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,420
I'm not related

652
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,740
to you by any means.

653
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,740
I was born

654
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,780
in an ordinary village

655
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,820
called Ye Village.

656
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,460
I grew up listening

657
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,700
to tales of General Ye.

658
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,660
I admire him a lot.

659
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:44,860
Who are you?

660
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,140
Didn't I make myself clear?

661
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,420
Fine. I'll be more specific.

662
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,100
Now, I'm a centurion,

663
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,380
leading a squad.

664
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,380
It's called Ye Camp.

665
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:52,820
I came up with that name.

666
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,500
That's right.

667
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,380
I want my Ye Camp

668
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,700
to be just like the legendary Ye Camp.

669
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,460
We'll dominate the battlefield.

670
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,300
Stop using your zhenqi.

671
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,820
You'll die for real
if you keep using it.

672
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,820
But don't worry.

673
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,740
My boss is wealthy.

674
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,380
He fed you over ten kinds

675
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,140
of pills and elixirs.

676
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:12,820
You'll recover

677
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,180
in around ten days or so.

678
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,980
But I have some pieces
of advice for you.

679
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,900
Do not use

680
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,900
Immovable Lord Technique and
Demon Deity Sword Techniques again.

681
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,260
Why did you stop me

682
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,820
without killing me?

683
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,780
It's because my boss

684
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,540
is a good person.

685
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,660
He just has a scumbag for a brother.

686
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,780
I'll tell you this again.

687
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,340
My name is Ye Xiaoying.

688
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,580
Now, I may be a nobody.

689
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,860
But I'll be a great general

690
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,620
in the future.

691
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,460
You should quit being a general.

692
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:44,940
It'll be a shame.

693
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,300
You should strive to become
the top martial artist in the world.

694
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,580
All right. He's here.

695
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,100
Take care of yourself.

696
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,980
May we see each other again.

697
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,220
Xiao Ruofeng!

698
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,060
You must hate me to the core.

699
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,140
What do you think?

700
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,820
Even if I didn't stop you,

701
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,300
you would still have no chance to win.

702
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,140
The ending would still be the same.

703
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,620
However,

704
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,540
there would be no turning back.

705
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,060
Is that your excuse?

706
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,340
Do you think Tianqi City

707
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,780
is beautiful?

708
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,580
Tianqi City

709
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,060
is known as the best city of all cities.

710
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,820
It's a city that gathers

711
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,820
all the glory and wealth
of the world into one.

712
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,820
However,

713
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,780
the more beautiful something is,

714
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,420
the more fragile it is.

715
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,380
To some,

716
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
it consists of

717
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,700
32 music houses,

718
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,220
64 liquor parlors,

719
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,180
the legendary gambling parlor,
Qianjin House,

720
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,580
and the legendary Changyu House.

721
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,220
But to me,

722
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,020
it consists of

723
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,460
one imperial palace,

724
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,700
three princes' mansions,

725
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,300
the Five Grand Eunuchs,
the Bureau of Astronomy,

726
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,380
Marquis of Huaiyu's Mansion,

727
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,820
the Six Ministries,
the Grand Preceptor's Mansion,

728
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,700
Jinwu Guards, who patrol the city
on the surface,

729
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,940
and the Shadow Sect,
which lurks in the dark.

730
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:16,700
And,

731
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,540
it also consists of the Imperial Guards
stationed outside the city.

732
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,540
There are many forces here,
and their relationships are complex.

733
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,340
Due to that,

734
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,300
I cannot judge an issue or event

735
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,340
based on my preference most of the time.

736
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,100
Are you going to tell me

737
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,580
that you can't do anything because
you're controlled by the court?

738
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,140
Why are you being silent?

739
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,500
Because you're right.

740
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,100
I can't do anything
when I'm being controlled by the court.

741
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,900
I'm different from other princes.

742
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,860
I have loved to spend time
in the military camp since young.

743
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,820
General Ye

744
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,020
taught me a lot of things back then.

745
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,540
I was on my first expedition

746
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,340
when the tragedy befell General Ye.

747
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,620
Everything

748
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,060
had already been decided

749
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,340
when I rushed back to Tianqi City
upon hearing the news.

750
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:28,980
I know.

751
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,980
Back then, Dongjun idolized me.

752
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,380
And I

753
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,700
once idolized you as well.

754
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,060
Look,

755
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,620
barbarians are located
to the north of Beili.

756
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,940
They excel at combat

757
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,940
and are ferocious.

758
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,900
Nanjue is located to the south of Beili.

759
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,700
They have just achieved unification.

760
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,220
They're raring to achieve greater feats.

761
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,180
But Beili?

762
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,500
The greatest general and his clan
were executed.

763
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,060
The most influential marquises

764
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,580
left the imperial court.

765
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,220
My father, the Emperor, is getting old.

766
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,540
The princes are having
an internal struggle.

767
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,620
Tianqi City may look prosperous,

768
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,860
but it's on the brink of collapsing.

769
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,220
At this moment,

770
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,460
someone has to stand up

771
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,380
and stabilize the situation.

772
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,100
Do you wish to become

773
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,740
that individual?

774
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,900
It's not that I wish to do so.

775
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,060
It's that I have to do so.

776
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,580
Our backgrounds

777
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,540
aren't as noble as the other princes.

778
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,860
We don't have influential forces
backing us up.

779
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,220
Therefore, we have no choice

780
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,860
but to ally ourselves with other forces.

781
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:47,700
For example,

782
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,060
the Shadow Sect.

783
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,980
This marriage

784
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,580
is just an alliance

785
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,500
between the two forces.

786
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,180
Dingzhi,

787
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,820
I wish to help you out as well.

788
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,140
I wish to draw my sword

789
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,340
and side with you as well.

790
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,460
But I cannot.

791
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,060
It's because

792
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,140
I'm Prince Langya.

793
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,180
I'm Prince Langya
of the Xiao Family in Beili.

794
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:18,900
I know.

795
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:19,900
In the end,

796
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,460
we ruined your happiness

797
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,060
for the sake of our interests.

798
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,220
I...

799
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,540
I've let you down.

800
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,380
But Dingzhi,

801
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,540
in this world,

802
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,660
who can truly live

803
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,420
with a clear conscience?

804
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,540
Ye Yun,
regarding the case of General Ye,

805
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,460
I'll give you my promise.

806
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,180
I'll definitely overturn his case.

807
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,620
I'll also uphold justice

808
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,620
for the entire General's Mansion.

809
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,380
So,

810
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,220
farewell.

811
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,220
From now on,

812
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,900
I hope you can

813
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:05,860
live on.

814
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,980
Do you think I'll take pity on you

815
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,420
because of what you said?

816
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,940
Actually, I understand everything

817
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,500
you said just now.

818
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:27,740
After all,

819
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,500
I was born in the General's Mansion.

820
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,660
I've seen plenty of cases

821
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,740
where people forsake small matters

822
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,660
for the so-called greatness.

823
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:36,620
And my father

824
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,220
could've staged a rebellion back then.

825
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,980
But he chose to die

826
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,740
for the sake of the greater good.

827
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,460
Although I understand
where he was coming from,

828
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,420
I don't agree with it.

829
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,570
[No animals were harmed
during the filming of this drama.]

830
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,050
