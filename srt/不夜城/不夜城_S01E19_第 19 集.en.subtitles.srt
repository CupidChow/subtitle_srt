1
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,477
There is only one person who would do

2
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,615
something this bold.

3
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,585
I have to go after Yi-kyung,
after I take care of Mr. Jang.

4
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,790
If I leave her alone,
she'll swallow up everything.

5
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,560
Where did you go yesterday?
I didn't see you all day.

6
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,696
I went to Busan on business.

7
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,167
What business did you have in Busan?

8
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,170
I attended a funeral on Mr. Park's behalf.

9
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,272
It was one for
which I couldn't just send a gift.

10
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,741
I had to send her and show my respect.

11
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,832
EPISODE 19

12
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,049
What's going on?

13
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,386
-Sorry?
-You looked like you wanted to talk.

14
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,822
Not really.

15
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,458
Should I pretend to fall for it?

16
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,164
I just felt a bit down.

17
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,435
I heard Mr. Kang was called in
by the prosecutor

18
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,871
right after the press release.

19
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,039
Yeah.

20
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,978
It feels like they were all for nothing.

21
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:30,049
Approval ratings, popularity,
things like that.

22
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,685
People aren't interested in reality.

23
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,755
They fall for the illusions
they want to believe.

24
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,395
They'll investigate the non-profit bank.
Will you be okay?

25
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,365
There's no trace of my involvement.

26
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,835
Chunha Financing managed everything.

27
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,773
Then Ma-ri's dad...

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,209
He'll be punished according to his greed.

29
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,946
He can run away,
if he doesn't want to be punished.

30
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,124
There you go again,
needlessly worrying about others.

31
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,960
I'm worrying about you.

32
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,633
You're making enemies everywhere you go.

33
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:26,372
Those people will not sit back
and watch you succeed.

34
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,175
Don't worry about it.

35
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:35,682
I worked and split up with people
like that. That's how I got here.

36
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,485
What about Gun-woo?

37
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,055
Did you decide to split up?

38
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:46,059
We both got what we wanted.
There's no reason not to split up.

39
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,562
Why?

40
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,965
I liked the two of you

41
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,834
working together.

42
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,572
I won't do something I don't like,
just because you liked it.

43
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,109
Once I'm finished with Mr. Jang,

44
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,212
I'll have to deal with Moojin, too.

45
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,760
But why did you come today?

46
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,196
To compliment you.

47
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,634
Everyone said you did beyond expectation.

48
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,855
Mi-yun Jung's sister just called.

49
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:52,358
She thinks her sister is staying
at a friend's place in LA.

50
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,629
The trip to Jeongseon paid off.
Did you get her number?

51
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,301
She said she'd let me know after
she finds out what her sister wants to do.

52
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,339
Tell Mi-yun Jung that we will give her
anything she wants.

53
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,208
It's not just about money.

54
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,547
She doesn't want to get involved
with her ex-husband or Collins Co.

55
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,284
She'll change her mind
if the sum is large enough. Keep trying.

56
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,221
Once she comes to Korea,
the prosecutors will get involved.

57
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,323
I understand.

58
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,193
Also,

59
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,397
what did you tell Se-jin
about the business trip?

60
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,199
I told her I went to Busan.

61
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,967
You said it was a wedding, right?

62
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:39,872
Oh, I said I went to a funeral
in your place.

63
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,844
SPECIAL PLANNING TEAM
JUNG-HEE MOON

64
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,845
PASSWORD

65
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:56,789
Hello.

66
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:03,396
You should've taken a few days off.
There's nothing urgent to do.

67
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,698
There's nothing to do at home anyway.

68
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,968
Thanks for all your hard work on this.

69
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:10,703
Not at all.

70
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,543
Here. It's a bonus.

71
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,280
I wish I could give you more,
but it's a small token of appreciation.

72
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:25,284
You don't need to.
I did it because I wanted to.

73
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,522
Once we acquire Korea Works,
our company will see huge profits.

74
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,424
This is nothing compared to that.

75
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,859
Take it.

76
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,197
Buy me lunch instead. I haven't eaten yet.

77
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,969
Okay. Let's go eat something good.

78
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,682
After you.

79
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,486
Thank you. Please take care.

80
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,321
-Thanks, you too.
-Thank you.

81
00:07:53,706 --> 00:08:00,246
Assemblyman Jung hasn't changed a bit.
He is overly greedy for his abilities.

82
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,616
It'll make it easier for you
to control him.

83
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,656
Once he leaves the party with his people,
we will have him join the new party.

84
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:19,131
Before that, we'll have to keep Yi-kyung
in check first.

85
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,070
She must be determined to get in my way.

86
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,575
Do you have something in mind?

87
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,149
She shows no obvious weaknesses.

88
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:42,054
I want you to look into it.

89
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,557
Yes, sir.

90
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:52,164
I think Mr. Jang will support
Assemblyman Gi-taek Jung as his candidate.

91
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,968
I'm sure. He wanted him
from the start, anyway.

92
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,403
Should I dig into him?

93
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,171
There's no need.

94
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,040
He's a worn-out politician.

95
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,911
Once Mr. Jang falls,
he will be buried along with him.

96
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,446
Would Mr. Jang take the bait easily?

97
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,782
They'll be determined to find my weakness.

98
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,385
We should leak it
at just the right moment.

99
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,288
-How are preparations going?
-It's almost done.

100
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:21,894
I think the moment he takes the bait,
we should dig him a grave.

101
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,966
We should finish him for good this time.

102
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,368
What about Gi-tae Son?

103
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,404
He was banned from leaving the country
before he fled.

104
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,173
He seems to have hidden well.

105
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,409
Even Chairman Son doesn't seem
to know where he is.

106
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,678
Follow Ma-ri Son.

107
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,313
Ma-ri Son?

108
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,483
He isn't brave enough
to be on the run by himself.

109
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,787
He may be afraid of his father,
but he'll contact his daughter.

110
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:49,889
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,859
Chairman Son must be quite stressed.

112
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:59,498
All of Chunha's money that went into
the non-profit bank must've been seized.

113
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,072
Are you here to rub it in?

114
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:11,143
Don't get mad at me. Your son signed
the contract on behalf of the company.

115
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,047
I'm just here to collect the money
he promised.

116
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:19,318
Do you take me for an obsolete old man?
You sold borrowed accounts to Gi-tae

117
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,721
and stamped a seal on the contract
with a different name.

118
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,089
And now, you're demanding payment.

119
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:28,327
If you're upset, bring your son.
I'll talk to him.

120
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,595
Look here, Chairman Song!

121
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:34,166
Calm down, Chairman Son.
Your blood pressure is going to rise.

122
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:43,109
Look over the contract carefully
and give me a call.

123
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,627
Who is it?

124
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,295
It's me. Who else?

125
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,764
Did you come alone?

126
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,500
I said to open up.

127
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,638
Shoot.

128
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,740
Seriously.

129
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,112
Why don't you have housekeeping come?
Are you bragging that you're on the run?

130
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,981
Must you talk like that?

131
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,720
You're driving me nuts.

132
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,457
Stop whining. Did you bring the cash?

133
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,126
I'm talking about the money.

134
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:11,964
You're so annoying.
I told you to use my credit card.

135
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,436
That's like saying, "Come and get me."

136
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,805
If not the prosecutor,
your grandpa will come for me.

137
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,009
I'm going to check out from here, too.

138
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,012
It's too risky to stay at the same hotel
for more than three days.

139
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,616
Just turn yourself in
and submit to investigation.

140
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,987
You can just say
that Mr. Kang ordered you to do it.

141
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,892
You didn't just do
as you were told, did you?

142
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,730
You did something behind their backs,
didn't you?

143
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,967
Dad!

144
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:53,339
Stop nagging and go.
I'll call you in a few days.

145
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,876
If you get a call from a blocked number,
pick up.

146
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,379
I should just turn you in!

147
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,614
Ma-ri.

148
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,283
Ma-ri!

149
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,120
You won't turn me in, will you?

150
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,523
I trust my daughter.

151
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,530
Shoot.

152
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,372
Yi-kyung Seo.

153
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,208
Do you think I'll go down alone like this?

154
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,911
Not a chance.

155
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,852
I'm worrying about you.

156
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,390
You're making enemies everywhere you go.

157
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:50,696
Those people will not sit back
and watch you succeed.

158
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,844
I thought you were off
the Neo City Project.

159
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,747
I can't give up such a big business.

160
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,750
I put it on hold
because there was something more urgent.

161
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,687
Let Gallery S participate
as an outside investor.

162
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:53,659
You can't get involved
just because you have money.

163
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,495
The conditions are very strict
and difficult.

164
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:02,034
Gun-woo is so thorough,
even I can't get my way.

165
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:05,604
If you've received something, you should
think about the repayment.

166
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:12,044
I know that you played a big part
in acquiring Korea Works.

167
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:16,715
But the Neo City Project is led
by Gun-woo. What can I do?

168
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,452
You can harass me,
but I can't give you the answer you want.

169
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,756
I didn't want to be jerked around
by you and Mr. Jang,

170
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,925
so I passed the authority to Gun-woo.

171
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,296
Yi-kyung.

172
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,966
Give up on the Neo City Project,

173
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,203
and let's look for another business
you and Moojin can collaborate on.

174
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,708
And if you get annoyed,
you'll use Gun-woo as a shield again?

175
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:47,346
Come on. I had no choice this time.

176
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,783
You just don't have the will to do it.

177
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,721
I've heard enough of your excuses.

178
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,559
Don't be too disappointed.

179
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,396
Sorry, but I am plenty disappointed.

180
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,836
Since she couldn't participate
in the second tender,

181
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,938
I figured she'd try to become
an outside investor.

182
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,174
You should've passed it onto me.

183
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,277
Obviously, I acted as if
I didn't know anything about it.

184
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,512
She said she was disappointed and left.

185
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,716
She retreated as a strategy.

186
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,185
She'll be back when she has another plan.

187
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,521
I'll keep saying I know nothing.
You handle it.

188
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,190
Okay.

189
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,262
Did you check?

190
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,499
There's nothing suspicious yet.

191
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:47,506
Do you really think
she is acting as a spy?

192
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,881
That is not the person I saw in Se-jin.

193
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,085
I'm not sure, either.

194
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,056
She gave up the documents on Collins Co.
to save Se-jin.

195
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,292
But she still won't have her
work at the gallery.

196
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,429
There must be a reason for that.

197
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,341
Found it. That's where she hid it.

198
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,778
-Where?
-You wouldn't know it even if you see it.

199
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,948
She acted all superior,
but she's one level below me.

200
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,385
What did she plant on my computer?

201
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:37,623
It's a monitoring software.
She can see everything you're doing,

202
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,793
from your emails, documents,
and Internet searches.

203
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,962
Then she'll see what you just did.

204
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,965
Come on. What do you take me for?

205
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,234
I sneaked in and out without her knowing.

206
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:55,707
Se-jin?

207
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,243
Yes?

208
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,745
Should I delete it for you?

209
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,948
No. Just leave it.

210
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,986
If you delete it, she'll know I noticed.

211
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,022
What? What do you mean?

212
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:19,865
This will make it difficult to find,
but not utterly impossible.

213
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,800
It's the perfect level of difficulty.

214
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,803
-We'll begin right away.
-Good.

215
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,010
SE-JIN, NO SUBJECT

216
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,818
Gun-woo Park is investigating Collins Co.

217
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:50,896
What is this?

218
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,600
It's proof that I'm your spy.

219
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,570
Are you sure?

220
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,610
Okay, Ms. Moon. Let's talk tomorrow.

221
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,582
He won't kick me out.

222
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,584
Why not?

223
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:18,023
Gun-woo will do anything
for his company right now.

224
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,194
It's suspicious how he's investigating
Collins Co. behind your back.

225
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:26,131
He probably wants to pressure Mr. Jang
and tie me to him.

226
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,070
If he knows I'm a spy,
he'll try to use me.

227
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:38,310
He'll either try to get information
from me, or give me false information.

228
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,614
So you got caught intentionally?

229
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,383
Yes.

230
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,818
I never told you to spy on Gun-woo.

231
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,121
This is my choice.

232
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,959
If he suspects me,
I should use that suspicion.

233
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,863
-Se-jin--
-If I get caught, I'll handle it.

234
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,932
You don't need to worry.

235
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,668
Don't hate Gun-woo
just because he suspected you.

236
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,773
He is just being true to his ambition
and objective.

237
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:12,344
I know. I don't hate or resent anyone.

238
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,447
I should use my emotions sparingly.

239
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,817
That's right, since this is business.

240
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,154
Yes, it's business.

241
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,737
Yi-kyung is already
in the Neo City Project?

242
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:16,942
Yes. There are several foreign investors
that Chunha is in contact with.

243
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,912
One of them, whom I trust, tipped me off.

244
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,915
Gun-woo Park is interfering
with the official routes,

245
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,550
so she can't join the investor's group.

246
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,321
She must've invested
through another company.

247
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,391
There may be a problem legally.

248
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,593
-Is that right?
-However,

249
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,530
Moojin must get involved
in order for her to get in trouble,

250
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,766
since they are the party involved.

251
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:48,507
I think you should meet
with Chairman Moo-sam Park.

252
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,977
He passed all authority regarding
the Neo City Project to Gun-woo Park,

253
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,046
and is not getting involved at all.

254
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,718
Even if I meet with Gun-woo Park,
he will not believe me.

255
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:04,222
It's a golden opportunity to get Yi-kyung.

256
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,870
I've thrown the bait
to Mr. Jang and Mr. Nam.

257
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,038
How did they respond?

258
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,307
They looked like this was
what they were waiting for.

259
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,610
I didn't get to hear
what he plans to do, though.

260
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,612
That's more than enough.

261
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,817
Yi-kyung. Keep your promise.

262
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,552
Don't worry about your son.

263
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,789
As soon as my people find him,
we'll send him safely abroad.

264
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:43,061
Of course, we can arrange it for you
if you'd like to see him.

265
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,566
He can't be on the run for long.
Please find him soon.

266
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,168
Goodbye.

267
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,540
Where is he staying now?

268
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,944
Dongsung Hotel, room 2001. He checked in
under a fake name last night.

269
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,446
Check on him constantly.
We'll need him soon.

270
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:02,581
I will.

271
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,083
What should we do about Se-jin?

272
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:11,089
Gun-woo Park suspects her,
so we should tell her to leave him.

273
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:16,128
He suspects her? Why would he do that?
Did you have her do something?

274
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,697
-Quiet down.
-Ms. Seo.

275
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:24,770
Don't make trouble trying to help.
Se-jin can take care of herself now.

276
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,544
Going down.
Stand clear of the closing doors.

277
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,442
Why did you come yourself? I could've sent
the research documents tomorrow.

278
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:07,846
I thought you'd be bored.
It's torture being alone all day long.

279
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,781
This is nothing.

280
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,818
Once, when I was working
at the convenience store,

281
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,153
I worked for 24 hours straight
when the boss had an emergency.

282
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,155
Everything else is okay?

283
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:21,159
Yes. Hold on. I'll get them for you.

284
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,761
Take your time.

285
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,258
I didn't get a separate escort car.

286
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,597
There's no need to draw attention.

287
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:03,635
It won't be good
to have people notice us, anyway.

288
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,204
Will you be all right?

289
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,946
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

290
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,658
It's been a while.

291
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,295
You look well.

292
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,731
How have you been, Mr. Chairman?

293
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,803
I will let you two talk.

294
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,249
Stop glaring at me and sit.

295
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,820
If we were still young,
we could duke it out,

296
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,757
but we're old now.

297
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:17,042
I kept putting it off and finally came.
Forgive me, Moo-il.

298
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,778
Don't give me your bull.

299
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,982
What are you up to? Just get to the point.

300
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:29,020
I know that you are upset with me.

301
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:34,960
But I never once considered you
or Moojin Group as anything but family.

302
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,263
Are you going to keep talking gibberish?

303
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,333
Then I'm done listening.

304
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,101
Bong-soo's daughter

305
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,739
is about to cause trouble.

306
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,481
You've met her before.

307
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:02,454
Why did she say she came to Korea?

308
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,458
Her ambition knows no limits.

309
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,095
She wants to reach the top of the world.

310
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,898
No way. That is an excuse.

311
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,837
She came to get revenge

312
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,441
on both you and me.

313
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:27,445
Revenge? Did you say revenge?

314
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,381
She said she'd drag me down

315
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,218
and reclaim everything
that was taken from her father.

316
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:38,957
That child is planning
to swallow up Moojin Group whole.

317
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,946
You can't leave her alone.

318
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:08,253
Did you say Bong-soo's daughter joined
the Neo City Project as an investor?

319
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,089
I am sure the amount is huge.

320
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:16,961
One wrong move,
and she may take over your pet project.

321
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:23,168
Moojin's Neo City Project was a business
I gave to you as a gift.

322
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:28,339
We can't let a random person squander it.

323
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,341
Tae-joon.

324
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,146
Let's at least set the record straight.

325
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:36,948
A gift?

326
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:44,122
You screwed over my company in Russia,
so you felt bad and gave it to me.

327
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,662
You are still mistaken.

328
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,364
I am not mistaken.

329
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:58,903
I remember very well
what kind of a person you are.

330
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:06,044
You kicked out Bong-soo, and now,
you want to kick out his daughter?

331
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:12,016
Do you think you'll live forever
like that?

332
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,455
I'm done talking,

333
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,125
so it's up to you to decide.

334
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,164
Tae-joon.

335
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,040
Stop being greedy and let it go.

336
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,681
When I'm near death, I'll let it go,

337
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,185
but not yet.

338
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,737
Would he believe you?

339
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,907
I didn't go to get him to believe me.

340
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:14,212
If I got him to suspect her,
that's more than enough.

341
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:20,485
I know how Moo-il thinks.

342
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,405
Huh?

343
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,877
The office is clean.

344
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,646
Did Ms. Seo send you?

345
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,481
No. I came on my own.

346
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,685
She said you'll take care of it,
and to leave you alone,

347
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,721
but I was too worried.

348
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,092
You've grown up.

349
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:40,198
Ms. Kim gave me the gear.
She's always worrying about you.

350
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,938
Are you leaving now?
I'll give you a lift if you are.

351
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,809
Then what, were you going to go alone
in this cold weather?

352
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:03,221
Tak.

353
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,189
What?

354
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,460
You don't need to worry about me anymore.

355
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:17,468
I'll ask for help if I need it,
and I'll ask you to come if I'm nervous.

356
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,739
But if I don't,

357
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,742
that means you don't need to worry.

358
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,715
Don't you trust me?

359
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,017
I trust you.

360
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,720
Do you really?

361
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,923
I wouldn't if you were the same
as when I first met you.

362
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,161
But now, you've grown up, too.

363
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,132
Still, stay away from anything
that seems dangerous.

364
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,168
That's common sense.

365
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,270
Okay.

366
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,509
If you get in a fight against five people,
don't fight. Just run.

367
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,418
Yi-kyung Seo is funding
the Neo City Project?

368
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,619
That's right.

369
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,422
I was paged early this morning,
so I went to see Moo-il.

370
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:12,790
That's what he said.

371
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,193
-Where did he hear that?
-Mr. Jang.

372
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,131
Mr. Jang visited Moo-il yesterday.
He heard it from him.

373
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,667
And Father believes him?

374
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,702
He says to check again to be safe.

375
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,872
He wouldn't have visited him
with something unsubstantiated.

376
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,277
I also thought it was strange
that Yi-kyung backed off so easily.

377
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,818
-What?
-If we're lucky, we can take down

378
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,222
both Mr. Jang and Yi-kyung Seo
at the same time.

379
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,329
Get me a list of all foreign investors
for the Neo City Project

380
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,097
and their company information.

381
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,236
What is it?

382
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,573
Soo-yun Jung called.

383
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,776
Did her sister respond?

384
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:10,681
She said she will not cooperate regarding
Collins Co., no matter what we offer.

385
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,784
And she has no intention
of returning to Korea.

386
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,823
Then we'll need a new plan.

387
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,994
Let's go straight for Yi-kyung,
without going through Mr. Jang.

388
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:26,063
But Mr. Park, how...

389
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,167
Get me the list of investors first.
The answer will be in there.

390
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:35,173
Also, make Se-jin think
we are still looking into Collins Co.

391
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,941
I'll do that.

392
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,246
It's been confirmed
that Mr. Jang went to the prison.

393
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,450
It's obvious what they talked about.

394
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:49,854
They probably used their old friendship
as an excuse to discuss my weaknesses.

395
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,758
Moojin will start looking
into the investors.

396
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,962
If it goes as planned, Ocean Investments
in Hong Kong will draw their attention.

397
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:01,933
The investment is very large compared
to their size.

398
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,736
Moojin will think the money came from you.

399
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,308
Take a look at this.

400
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,644
Ocean Investments.

401
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,814
If you look at the funds
from the second and third quarters,

402
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,483
the fluctuation is too large.

403
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,754
In stage two, they'll see
the flow of Ocean's funds.

404
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,124
Don't make it too easy to find.

405
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,759
Of course not.
I made it just difficult enough.

406
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,665
Are you still stuck?

407
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:41,906
It's spread out

408
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:47,745
into several routes,
but we'll find it as soon as possible.

409
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,350
Divide it up and give me some.
I'll look as well.

410
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,627
In stage three, they need to see
a connection to the gallery.

411
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,895
Okay.

412
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,030
They'll find it within two to three days.

413
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,420
Ms. Moon.

414
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,361
Do you know this company?

415
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,164
Kuroda Investment Bank.

416
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,868
Was this the starting point?

417
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:47,138
Ilhan Finance created this company.

418
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,574
Ilhan Finance?

419
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,745
The late Chairman Bong-soo Seo.
His Ilhan Finance.

420
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:59,951
Yi-kyung, you hid well, but I found you.

421
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,693
Ms. Seo.

422
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,064
Is this where you work?
It's smaller than I expected.

423
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,868
You can't be here.
What if someone sees you?

424
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,249
What are you afraid of?

425
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,251
Sorry?

426
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,622
Can I not be here because you're my spy?

427
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,625
They may deduce the opposite.

428
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:44,762
They may think I showed up
to act like there's nothing suspicious.

429
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:51,168
Anyway, it isn't good
to have people see you. Let's go.

430
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,006
Ms. Seo.

431
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,408
You need to do something for me.

432
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,914
Will you keep standing? Sit.

433
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:10,788
I just...

434
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,692
need to have Gun-woo find that file?

435
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,763
It may be a little shocking,
but he'll believe it.

436
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,800
Even if you move the barrel
of the gun ever so slightly,

437
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,137
the gap between the target
increases significantly.

438
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:31,475
It'll end up becoming a fight
between Moojin and Mr. Jang.

439
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,278
Who...

440
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,914
will win?

441
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:40,918
Both will lose.

442
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:45,923
Ms. Seo.

443
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,096
Once this is done,

444
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,033
your plan will be over, right?

445
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,240
Nothing is over

446
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,344
until it's over.

447
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,481
Why? Will you try to stop me again?

448
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,284
No.

449
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:20,925
I don't care how many closed doors
there are. I'll open them all for you.

450
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:25,596
Then you will reach the top

451
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:28,699
that much sooner.

452
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,845
It's me. Send Se-jin the file.

453
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:41,946
Okay.

454
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,510
Use Ma-ri to meet with Chairman Son.

455
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,779
The details are in the file.

456
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:23,521
Mr. Park.

457
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,562
What time is it?

458
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,031
You need to take a look at this.

459
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,334
JOINT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

460
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:46,277
Yi-kyung Seo sent an email to Se-jin.
This was attached to the email.

461
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,748
The attachment states
that Kuroda Investment Bank

462
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:54,885
is related to Chairman Son's
Japanese loan sharking business.

463
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,855
Matching the transaction details
and the amounts.

464
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:02,526
They'll think they found
what they were looking for. What a shame.

465
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,862
Will that file be enough?

466
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:09,567
We'll let them get worked up.
We'll close it out then.

467
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,469
Now that we're done,

468
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,772
why don't you tell Se-jin
to leave that office?

469
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,274
Where's Tak?

470
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,292
What are you doing? Let's go.

471
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:40,598
How long will you live on the run?
Just go to Grandpa and beg.

472
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,235
Do you want to see me die? I said go.

473
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,304
Where to this time?

474
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,964
So it wasn't Yi-kyung, but Mr. Jang
who illegally invested in the project?

475
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:19,436
That's right. The Japanese investment bank
was Ilhan's subsidiary,

476
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,406
but I think they secretly started working
with Chairman Son.

477
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:26,710
So they secretly put in TJ's money
into our business?

478
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,580
They probably wanted to frame
Yi-kyung for the illegal investment

479
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:32,016
and get involved in the Neo City Project.

480
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,653
That old man is crafty.

481
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,189
He made us run around like a dog
chasing its tail while he benefited.

482
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:43,661
What will you do now?

483
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,196
We'll have to report them to the FSS
or the prosecutor.

484
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,634
We'll freeze the illegal investment
and disqualify them.

485
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:57,141
That won't help the project, though.

486
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,210
What do you mean?

487
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,913
If they start investigating
the investment,

488
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,615
the original investors are one thing,

489
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:08,519
it'll obviously hurt our attempt
at proposing the business in the future.

490
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,754
-Uncle.
-Don't draw attention to this.

491
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:12,189
Let's do this.

492
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:18,162
Send a message to Mr. Jang
to withdraw his money and leave quietly.

493
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:26,503
That way, we'll both be safe. Do as I say.

494
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:29,607
-Are you afraid he might retaliate?
-What?

495
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:33,577
Are you afraid he'll go public
with the rebate documents he has on you?

496
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,647
Yes, I am afraid.

497
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,917
I'm afraid I'll lose my chairman position
because of something

498
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,186
from ancient history, okay?

499
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:45,189
What? Do I look like a coward
because I want to survive?

500
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,659
-Uncle.
-Do whatever you want,

501
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,661
if you want to see us brothers
in prison together.

502
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:34,571
Are you cleaning?

503
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:41,011
It was dusty everywhere
except where I work.

504
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,414
I mopped there. You can sit.

505
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:48,786
Would you like tea?

506
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,527
What is it?

507
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,564
There is some trouble in the company.

508
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,835
There is a problem
and I'm facing a dilemma.

509
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:13,744
Is it serious?

510
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,280
It's serious only for me.

511
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:22,319
I need to act for the company's sake,
but I'm hesitant because of my family.

512
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,659
I'm sorry, I can't help.

513
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:37,568
You cleaned for no reason.
You don't need to come in anymore.

514
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,073
Why not? Why so suddenly...

515
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,577
You've been very helpful.

516
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:51,915
If you keep working here,
I may keep expecting help like that.

517
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:54,852
Thank you for everything.

518
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,251
Stop sighing.

519
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,320
Our smart little Se-jin.

520
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,489
What was that for?

521
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,658
Why is life so complicated?

522
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:39,263
Why is there so much to think about
and why are there so many excuses?

523
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,765
Is it about your dad?

524
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:43,667
My dad, grandpa and so on.

525
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:48,639
Look at this.

526
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,641
It lost all elasticity.

527
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:54,645
My skin's all damaged
because I'm so stressed out.

528
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,615
You look fine. Chin up.

529
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,317
It'll work out.

530
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:02,586
What about you? Is it going well?

531
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:03,954
What?

532
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:05,489
Anything.

533
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,561
Yeah, I think so.

534
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:13,864
Good. I'm glad it's going well for you.

535
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,434
It's too late for me.

536
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:30,614
Okay. You would've had
to leave them soon, anyway.

537
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,216
Gun-woo...

538
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,952
looked tired.

539
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,088
He can't be tired already.

540
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,891
He'll have much more to get over with.

541
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:42,659
Ms. Seo.

542
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,127
Go on.

543
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:49,299
Even if I quit working at that office,
I won't go back to the gallery.

544
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:56,306
I want to find
something I can do on my own.

545
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,409
Okay.

546
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,113
Are you angry?

547
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:07,517
But make me one promise.

548
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:11,054
If I tell you to come,
you must come right away.

549
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:16,860
I will.

550
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,477
Hey! Wait!

551
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,503
Hey.

552
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:04,808
I thought you'd be coming by soon.

553
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:08,779
I knew you'd be waiting.
I've been very busy.

554
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,081
Because of Tae-joon?

555
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:22,993
Is that right? The foreign investments are
all Tae-joon's ploy?

556
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,494
Yes.

557
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:29,599
He used me to harass you?

558
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:38,408
I suspected
that he was after that from the start.

559
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:42,145
I think Chairman Moo-sam Park
and Gun-woo plan to bury it.

560
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:50,087
Sure. They probably have no other choice,
if they don't want to harm the company.

561
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,024
It isn't your first time.

562
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,595
When you kicked out my father,

563
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,732
the two of you worked together
just like this.

564
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,568
Mr. Jang instigated,

565
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,872
and you played along
as if you had no choice.

566
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,642
Look here, Yi-kyung--

567
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,211
What will you do this time?

568
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:18,482
"I had no choice
because of my friend's greed."

569
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,685
Will you make excuses again?

570
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:32,562
Do you know how humans differ from beasts?

571
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:38,001
They do not make the same mistake twice.

572
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:44,174
If you do the same thing,
knowing it is wrong,

573
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:50,180
you're not a human being. You're a beast.

574
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:55,585
My father would've been happy
to hear that.

575
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,193
I'll be waiting.

576
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:08,231
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

577
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,012
I'll need your help one more time.

578
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,048
What happened to my son?

579
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:26,983
Are you even looking for him?

580
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,887
He keeps switching hotels.

581
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:33,323
We'll bring him in safely very soon.

582
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:38,762
Mr. Chairman?

583
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:43,366
If anything happens to Gi-tae,
you'll be sorry.

584
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:47,904
Stop the meaningless threats

585
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:50,240
and listen to what you need to relay
to Mr. Jang.

586
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,382
Stop being greedy and let it go.

587
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:06,990
When I'm near death, I'll let it go,

588
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,627
but not yet.

589
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,535
What will you do this time?

590
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:22,205
"I had no choice
because of my friend's greed."

591
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,509
Will you make excuses again?

592
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:37,187
KOREA-JAPAN CO-OP NIGHT
1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS

593
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:40,016
Aren't you the prosecutor
who investigated Gun-woo and Mr. Jang?

594
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:44,221
Collins Co. ended without much success.

595
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:47,557
Mr. Chairman, how did you...

596
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:51,528
You can hide all you want,
but you're in the palm of my hand.

597
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:55,232
There are numerous prosecutors
that won Moojin's scholarships.

598
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,305
Mr. Choi, was it?

599
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,741
My name is Dong-suk Choi.

600
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,678
You want to succeed, don't you?

601
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,381
Pardon?

602
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:16,920
If a past president and the chairman
of a conglomerate worked together

603
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:18,922
to leak confidential
government information,

604
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,491
wouldn't that be a huge case?

605
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:27,797
The exclusive Neo City development rights
exchanged hands in payment,

606
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:31,134
so it's a huge incident.

607
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,137
What do you think?

608
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,207
Tempting, isn't it?

609
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:46,516
-I'll see you again.
-Okay.

610
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:48,885
Mr. Son.

611
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,021
As you can see, today is...

612
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,091
We're in trouble.
I must see him right away.

613
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:02,399
The Attorney General gave a special order.

614
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,035
Everyone is being hush-hush
about the case,

615
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:08,505
but they're gathering the top prosecutors
and sending them to the prison.

616
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:13,076
They plan to go public with
how Chairman Moo-il Park obtained

617
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,279
the Russia gas pipe contract
and the Neo City Project rights.

618
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,381
Mr. Jang did not do it alone.

619
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:19,949
Chairman Moo-il Park--

620
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,419
Can't you see what's going on?

621
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,954
Chairman Park plans to take
Mr. Jang down with him.

622
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:36,166
I'll contact everyone I can for now.

623
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,634
Mr. Park.

624
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,270
What is it?

625
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:17,440
Moojin Group's Chairman Moo-il Park's
final trial for his appeal

626
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:20,210
has been postponed this morning.

627
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:22,645
Incarcerated for embezzling
over a hundred billion won,

628
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,649
breach of duty and tax evasion,
Chairman Park

629
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:30,553
notified the court through his attorney
that he'd forfeit his appeal.

630
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:34,357
Chairman Moo-il Park's legal team
says they will drop the appeal

631
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:37,861
and that they will await
the court's decision.

632
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,296
Furthermore, Chairman Park confessed that

633
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:43,867
the former president,
Tae-joon Jang, and himself

634
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:46,469
were involved in bribery
and extortion to win the contract

635
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:52,475
for the Russian gas pipe project and
the government's natural energy project.

636
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,178
Moojin Group,
which suddenly received the news,

637
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,581
called an emergency board meeting
to discuss how to proceed,

638
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,917
but they are unable to hide their shock.

639
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:03,987
They will be giving
their official statement soon.

640
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,524
The past president Tae-joon Jang's
representative also appears

641
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,292
to be in shock over the news

642
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,328
and has not made
an official statement yet.

643
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:28,812
Mr. Jang.

644
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:32,215
I won't need it for a while,

645
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:35,452
so keep it safe.

646
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:38,855
I want you

647
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,791
to look after it every so often.

648
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:44,260
I've booked a flight for you.

649
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:47,831
You should avoid the situation first.

650
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,532
Before the prosecutor comes...

651
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,469
Look here, Nam.

652
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:56,473
I will take the punishment later.
Please do as I say this time, sir.

653
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:05,348
Not long ago,
I was the President of Korea.

654
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,886
Just because I look bad

655
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,057
and I am ashamed of what I've done,

656
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:20,196
I cannot flee from my own country,
now can I?

657
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,400
Mr. Jang.

658
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,770
Of course not.

659
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,842
Not you, of all people.

660
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:36,246
I had faith you wouldn't avoid the crimes
that you had committed.

661
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,781
-Ms. Seo.
-Nam.

662
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,985
Wait outside.

663
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,254
-Sir.
-Go on.

664
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:10,413
Yi-kyung.

665
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:16,052
Did you plan all of this?

666
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:17,654
Yes.

667
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:20,490
I see.

668
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:25,061
I thought so.

669
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:30,567
But even if Moo-il and I go down,

670
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:36,606
you cannot guarantee
the world you dream of.

671
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:40,276
You will see with time.

672
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:44,147
I was right, wasn't I?

673
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:51,754
Bong-soo raised his daughter very well.

674
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:56,926
Have a safe trip, sir.

675
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,302
Yeah.

676
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:40,803
You racked your brain,

677
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,508
but it'll be tough for you, too.

678
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:50,246
-Is that so?
-You tied my father to Mr. Jang.

679
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:51,948
You won't be safe by yourself.

680
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:56,185
-You figured it out quickly.
-Not quickly enough.

681
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,390
If I had, I would've stopped my father.

682
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:22,478
Even if you had,
you couldn't have stopped anything.

683
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:26,082
They put an end
to their bad blood themselves,

684
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,618
so we should end ours as well.

685
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:33,589
I'm sad. I didn't think
it was that bad between us.

686
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:37,060
When you think you've accomplished it all,
you will lose everything.

687
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,327
I'll be waiting.

688
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:39,862
Sure.

689
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,856
I'm looking to expand my business
into Korea.

690
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:11,094
Can I really meet these people
on the list?

691
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,496
Let me know which of them
you'd like to meet.

692
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,899
Then I'll meet with them first
and relay your wishes.

693
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,368
I'd appreciate it
if you'd give me material

694
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:20,870
that I can use to talk up your company.

695
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,573
You're like a coordinator, of sorts.

696
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:28,111
Yes, "Connections is also money."
That's what I learned.

697
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,550
I have a call.

698
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:42,258
Hello, Ms. Seo.

699
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:43,526
Where are you?

700
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,995
You'd be shocked if you knew.

701
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,564
I'm not in Korea.

702
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:53,269
But what's going on?

703
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,739
You need to come back right away.
We have a problem.

704
01:02:58,508 --> 01:02:59,475
A problem?

705
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:03,112
Se-jin, I need your help.

706
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:34,977
Father's generation may be done,
but we are not.

707
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:37,046
It's easy because they know nothing.

708
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,815
We can easily fabricate crimes.

709
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:41,184
After a secret investigation,
the Special Planning Team

710
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,319
found proof of illegal insider trading.

711
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:47,156
Ms. Seo will not stop. That makes me sad.

712
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:49,826
It would be less tiring for both of us
if you'd give up now.

713
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:53,362
I think what old feelings
remained are gone now.

714
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:56,299
Gallery S will be destroyed
and it won't be able to recover.

715
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,768
Now, our only option is to knock him down.

716
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:05,875
