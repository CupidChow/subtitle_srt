1
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,303
I'll get you something to drink.

2
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,643
EPISODE 10

3
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,744
Ma'am.

4
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,384
The chairman's awake.

5
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,420
That's a relief.

6
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:01,554
I'll get going.

7
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:02,956
You should go in.

8
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,191
You're not supposed to see me

9
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,826
at the hospital,

10
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,029
since you don't know about Gun-woo and me.

11
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,965
You said he's awake.

12
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,500
That's good enough.

13
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,636
Didn't you come to apologize?

14
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,972
-Apologize?
-To say you feel bad

15
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,640
about that day.

16
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,175
I don't know.

17
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,612
I never felt bad or wanted to apologize.

18
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,782
I wanted to see
what he looked like lying there.

19
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,719
He probably doesn't know
the group has a new owner.

20
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,120
I do pity him.

21
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,124
I know you don't really mean it.

22
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,927
On the inside, you--

23
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,129
How would you know, when I say I mean it?

24
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,766
Don't jump to conclusions.

25
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,437
It looks like Gun-woo
is letting you take the final step.

26
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,306
Keep pushing forward.

27
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:54,741
There are still

28
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,943
other things you must get through.

29
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,295
How's the chairman?

30
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,429
He's sleeping.

31
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,364
I'm going in to see him.

32
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,700
Go in, then. I'll leave now.

33
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,335
Earlier,

34
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,940
I was able to maintain the dignity
of a corporate heir, thanks to you.

35
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,008
I almost broke down

36
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,711
crying like a little boy.

37
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,147
Thank you.

38
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:37,817
In the end,

39
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,587
you might not thank me after all.

40
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,382
Goodness. Good morning everyone.

41
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,284
MOOJIN GROUP

42
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:45,885
Hello, Mr. Park.

43
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,512
CHAIRMAN MOO-SAM PARK

44
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,455
The louder the scarecrow,
the more effective it is.

45
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,891
If Chairman Park becomes drunk
with power and starts to waver,

46
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,993
people will focus only on him.

47
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,964
Meanwhile, you and I can
quietly take what really matters.

48
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,703
You replaced Moojin's chairman.

49
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,604
With that big accomplishment,

50
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,974
you can act a little more arrogant.

51
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,910
It is nothing but a mere milestone.

52
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,912
We have a long way to go.

53
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,817
Bong-soo raised his daughter well.

54
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,922
Please get your people to take action now.

55
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,258
There is no need to hold back

56
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,828
Moojin's Neo City Project.

57
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,830
The larger the business,

58
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,299
the funds required

59
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,202
would be astronomical.

60
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,837
Once the regulation is repealed,

61
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,940
Chairman Park will accelerate the project.

62
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,510
Once the funds start to flow,
we will form a new foundation

63
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,214
to serve as your trustworthy coffer.

64
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,150
Okay.

65
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,152
So what's the next problem?

66
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:27,954
It is you.

67
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,259
-What?
-Because you gave me half of the key only.

68
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,464
Singapore, Monaco, and the Virgin Islands.

69
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,134
You should give me the accounts

70
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,269
in these regions as well.

71
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,075
That can't be.

72
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,612
There must have been a mistake.

73
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,647
I'll check--

74
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,949
I don't need it, if it's only the half.

75
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,954
If you can't trust me,
trust in my abilities.

76
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,459
I'm sure there are more hidden accounts.

77
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,828
Find as much as you can.

78
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,063
Will he hand them over
just because we find them?

79
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,533
What about Baeksong's Mr. Nam?

80
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,268
He's trying everything to get him out.

81
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:20,106
I'm sure they're trying to pressure
the previous director to take the fall.

82
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,343
He plans to give me half only

83
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,180
and give the rest back to Jong-gyu Nam
when he gets out.

84
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,918
He wants to show who's really in control.

85
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,053
He doesn't seem like a pushover.

86
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,456
He's a worthy opponent.

87
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,192
It'll get more interesting, too.

88
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,894
Tell Se-jin to come up.

89
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,030
Well...

90
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,500
She hasn't come in yet.

91
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,013
There are no rules to this fight.

92
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,816
If I don't knock him down,
I'll be the one attacked.

93
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,220
Even if I resent them after I fall,

94
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,889
the victors do not hear a thing.

95
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,902
The father commits all the terrible sins

96
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,505
and the son receives the punishment.

97
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,476
I'm sorry for putting you through that.

98
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,247
You listened to all of that?

99
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,117
You should've told her to shut up
and kick her out.

100
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,986
When you think about it,

101
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,722
she's a victim too.

102
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,259
It isn't her fault she became

103
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,595
so vicious and cold hearted.

104
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,232
It's because the world was not generous

105
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,302
and people were vicious, that she changed.

106
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,640
Gun-woo.

107
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,608
Yes?

108
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,745
Did you like her a lot?

109
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,215
Briefly, when I was young.

110
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:10,616
Not anymore?

111
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,823
You can't do it?

112
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,360
It's more accurate
to say "I don't want to."

113
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,229
Think of all the effort you've put in.

114
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,631
Are you wavering now?

115
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,000
When I saw the chairman lying there

116
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,570
and Gun-woo yesterday, I regretted it.

117
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,374
If I made the wrong decision,
I should fix it even if it's late.

118
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,211
Since you mixed insincerity,

119
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,447
you truly began to feel for him,

120
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:43,683
is that it?

121
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,053
No. Gun-woo is a secondary reason.

122
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,056
I want to stop for you.

123
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,092
I don't quite understand.

124
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,661
If I continue with it,

125
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,197
you will keep being damaged.

126
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,967
Gun-woo is getting hurt without knowing,

127
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,471
but you'll knowingly become crueler,

128
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,841
as you did to the chairman yesterday.

129
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,144
I started this for you,

130
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,614
but if it will rather become a poison,

131
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,283
I should stop here.

132
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,192
Go ahead.

133
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,962
If you want to stop, stop.

134
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,300
It'll be hard for Gun-woo
to make a comeback anyway.

135
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,203
What did you do to--

136
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,104
One more thing.

137
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,007
Whether you start or stop something,

138
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,775
don't use me as an excuse.

139
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,778
Don't throw in some lame reason, either.

140
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,869
GENERAL BUSINESS TEAM

141
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:29,588
I'm Gun-woo Park.

142
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,225
I was transferred here
to the General Business Team.

143
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,461
Where's my desk?

144
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:36,729
This way, sir.

145
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,265
Yes. Please. Here.

146
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,666
Over here.

147
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,814
It's uncomfortable for me, too,

148
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,982
but it must be more awkward for you.

149
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,853
Let's hang in there as long as we can.

150
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,322
The chairman's assistant?

151
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,192
I've seen you ever since you worked
for Moo-yi,

152
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,194
so I know what you're capable of.

153
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,597
I need you to help me from now on.

154
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:12,898
But...

155
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,236
It is so sudden.

156
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,338
Did you hear Gun-woo
was sent to the General Business?

157
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,641
-Yes.
-He doesn't need an assistant

158
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,276
to help him write his resignation.

159
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,513
You're strictly professional,

160
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,417
so you'd never betray your new boss

161
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,518
for your old one.

162
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,289
-Of course, not.
-That's right.

163
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,860
Please help me a lot going forward.

164
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,829
Ms. Yi-kyung Seo of Gallery S
is here to see you.

165
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,332
Send her in.

166
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,745
My goodness.

167
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,615
I was very disappointed.

168
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,750
I expected you
at my inauguration celebration,

169
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,286
but you merely sent flowers.

170
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:10,990
It's gloomy, isn't it?

171
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,828
I'm thinking of redecorating completely.

172
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,196
Don't change it.

173
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,100
Maintain the decor and the personnel

174
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,035
exactly as they are.

175
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,203
What do you mean?

176
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,138
You kicked out your big brother.

177
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,941
The sentiment in the company
must be the worst.

178
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,076
You shouldn't take unnecessary risk.

179
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,281
You must announce that
you will follow Chairman Moo-il Park's

180
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,717
management philosophy and take over
the people as well as the business as is.

181
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,769
Our new chairman was smart.

182
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,039
It was obvious you'd help me
if he left you alone,

183
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,742
so he's making you his assistant
so you can't do anything.

184
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,013
I was surprised as well.

185
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,182
He figured you out.

186
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,852
That you do your best,
no matter who your boss is.

187
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,386
I am sorry.

188
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,688
I don't think...

189
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,658
I can help you anymore.

190
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,361
There's no need anyway.

191
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,165
Why would I need an assistant here?

192
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,702
You don't deserve this.

193
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:30,936
It's because I lost.

194
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,206
My uncle, Mr. Jang

195
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:35,641
and Yi-kyung.

196
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,778
The victors have no reason to be generous.

197
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,582
I lost, so I rolled down to the bottom.

198
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,686
But I'll do whatever it takes
to climb back up.

199
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,688
Ms. Yi-kyung Seo

200
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,624
is here.

201
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,861
Look, what are you talking about--

202
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,597
Mr. Jo is very capable.

203
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,599
And he's highly qualified.

204
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,969
Still, how could I make him an adviser
for the Neo City Project?

205
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,804
That's a different story.

206
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,408
A temporary adviser's role should suffice.

207
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,577
He'll help out only during meetings.

208
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,481
And I have someone at the gallery,
Ms. Kim,

209
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,683
who's a network expert.

210
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,254
She'll need authority to freely share
information that only high executives

211
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,557
such as company presidents can access.

212
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,562
I'll stop there for today.

213
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,797
Ms. Seo.

214
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,067
It would've been difficult for me
to become chairman

215
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,069
without your help.

216
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,104
I give you that, I do,

217
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,707
but I'm uncomfortable having you

218
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,375
tell me how to run the business.

219
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,977
-So?
-What?

220
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,046
I understand you're uncomfortable.

221
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,915
But what does that have to do

222
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,684
with what I asked?

223
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,653
Are you saying you'll treat me
like a puppet from the outset?

224
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,858
I am the chairman of Moojin Group,
the greatest corporation!

225
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,299
You obtained the position that you wanted.

226
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,236
So now, you should do what I want.

227
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,906
That was always the condition of our deal.

228
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,514
I'll have to reconsider
such difficult demands.

229
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,316
It was difficult to make you chairman,

230
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,385
but it's easy to remove you.

231
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,155
Don't test my abilities,

232
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,657
sir.

233
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,513
Isn't the chairman's office nice?

234
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,882
It doesn't suit my uncle, though.

235
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,118
He'll adapt to make himself fit in.

236
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,487
You'll get used to the basement, too.

237
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,722
I heard from my father.

238
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,959
I considered running over
and duking it out with you,

239
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:08,694
but it was funny.

240
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,296
How desperate was the great Yi-kyung Seo,

241
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,066
that she used
the stale first love sap story?

242
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,901
I'm relieved that he's recovered.

243
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,703
I'm sure it's a great relief to you.

244
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,906
If anything had happened to my father,

245
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,608
I wouldn't have forgiven you.

246
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,744
I wish I could be frightened,
but I'm busy.

247
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,379
Bye.

248
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,249
Yi-kyung.

249
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,621
Just wait. It won't take long.

250
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,757
Take a good look around.

251
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,126
You won't be back once you resign.

252
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,404
Jong-gyu Nam, the director of Baeksong
Foundation, who was in custody

253
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,573
for extortion of donations
for the foundation

254
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,275
was released this morning
for lack of culpability.

255
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,212
The prosecutor states the illegal
activities of the foundation

256
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,281
were actually performed by the previous
director, Gi-chul Jung,

257
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,350
and that they plan to expedite
the investigation.

258
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,220
Meanwhile, Jong-hyuk Nam, who was
being investigated for corruption,

259
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,154
plagiarism...

260
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,495
I thought you'd take a few days off.
You shouldn't push yourself.

261
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,563
I was inattentive due to my carelessness,

262
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,931
so I must do my best.

263
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,869
I heard you helped a lot in the interim.

264
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,173
You may take it slowly now.

265
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:05,043
I heard your brother
found a very good attorney.

266
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,745
I'm happy for him.

267
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,792
These accounts were kept safe separately.

268
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,829
So our employees were not aware of them.

269
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,131
What did I say?

270
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,235
Without Mr. Nam, nothing gets done right.

271
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,771
Now that he's back,

272
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,141
you can trust him with the business here.

273
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,012
One is missing.

274
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,782
You should give me the account
for the Cayman Islands, too.

275
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,318
That's...

276
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,059
Bring it.

277
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,763
It isn't here. It is being kept elsewhere.

278
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,632
I'll have it delivered to you.

279
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,501
Bring it yourself.

280
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:03,702
Right this instant.

281
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,588
I don't feel great

282
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,890
after what happened to Moo-il.

283
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,659
I wonder

284
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,897
how Gun-woo is doing, too.

285
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,532
Don't concern yourself.

286
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,601
Gun-woo Park

287
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,970
doesn't have any more moves to make.

288
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,240
Is that right?

289
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,245
Doesn't it feel like musical chairs?

290
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,748
Put your guard down for a moment,

291
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,850
and you lose your chair.

292
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,454
Yi-kyung is very greedy, too.

293
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,428
I heard you lost your chair as well.

294
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,663
My dear.

295
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,532
Did the news reach Seongbuk already?

296
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,005
Where is the document
on my uncle taking rebates?

297
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,510
You may have refused my visit,
but don't refuse the transaction.

298
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,949
It'll be obvious where you got
the document. I won't dig my own grave.

299
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,887
I'm sure you didn't come all the way here
to tell me that.

300
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,157
You must have other transactions in mind.

301
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,632
Chairman Man-ho Song was recently removed

302
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,269
from association chairman.

303
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,173
If you use him well,

304
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,108
even if you can't take Ms. Seo's chair,

305
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,244
you may be able to shake it a little.

306
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,950
How is Mr. Jang doing?

307
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,387
The foundation's current state looks good.

308
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,892
These numbers are wrong.

309
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:08,627
Fix it.

310
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,932
This is insane. How can I prepare
a project proposal

311
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,703
for a new foundation in such a short time?

312
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,573
I'm not saying I won't do it.

313
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,043
Yi-kyung is too demanding.

314
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,678
Does she think

315
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,513
she's the commanding general or something?

316
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,515
What happened to Chairman Song?

317
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,520
"I lost my position as chairman
of the association,

318
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,889
and you expect me to donate
to the foundation, too?"

319
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,225
He kept whining so much,

320
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,194
so I made sure he understood.

321
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,363
You didn't do anything silly?

322
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,597
Father,

323
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,699
I'm not a thug.

324
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,904
What's going on here? Is there a war?

325
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,374
Hey! Is the company your playground?

326
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,142
Why do you keep coming?

327
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,211
Dad.

328
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,356
Are you visiting your friend again?

329
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,959
I came to see you.

330
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,535
You hate Ms. Seo, don't you?

331
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,073
I do.

332
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,812
She didn't need to go that far.

333
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,281
She was too harsh on you.

334
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,519
She doesn't know

335
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,655
she's bruising herself by doing that.

336
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,224
No.

337
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,460
She does it knowing she is.

338
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,963
She said she'd become a villain.

339
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,902
She's just keeping her promise.

340
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,104
She doesn't need
to keep a promise like that.

341
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,072
My sentiments exactly.

342
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,376
We're talking about Yi-kyung again.

343
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,549
I heard you were transferred
to a new department.

344
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,418
That's why
I have a lot of time to kill now.

345
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,087
And I found a weapon worth fighting with.

346
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,456
A weapon?

347
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,591
What is it?

348
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,194
So you can tell Yi-kyung?

349
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:23,595
Gun-woo.

350
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,497
I don't know yet.

351
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,233
I need to look into it more.

352
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:31,403
Will you

353
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,105
use that weapon and become a villain, too?

354
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,841
I'll have to do much worse.

355
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,510
It'll piss me off
to haul down my flag now.

356
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:39,945
Do you fight for pride?

357
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,848
Do you fight to show others?

358
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,351
You can just give in.

359
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,321
What is wrong with both of you?

360
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:54,025
Just because one person keeps running,
the other doesn't need to be dragged--

361
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,026
Se-jin.

362
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,398
I know you're concerned for Yi-kyung,

363
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,435
but you should convince her, then.

364
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:09,674
Gun-woo.

365
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,554
Are you insane?

366
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,956
You call me out to the car
to discuss a secret,

367
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,858
and you're talking about Gun-woo Park?

368
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,159
You respect Ms. Seo, right?

369
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,695
What does that have to do
with him wasting his time?

370
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:31,963
You want

371
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,100
her business to do well
without a glitch, right?

372
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,637
Don't you want to sleep well
when you go to bed?

373
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,039
Why are you asking the obvious?

374
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,941
It's like dominoes.

375
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,644
-What?
-Gun-woo

376
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,114
will cause a problem,
from the look of things.

377
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,349
If Ms. Seo finds out,

378
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,451
she won't just sit back.

379
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,021
I don't know who will win,

380
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,657
but both of them will fall in danger.

381
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,327
How can you stop it?

382
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:03,828
You need to help me.

383
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:04,796
Hey, punk.

384
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,831
What if Ms. Seo finds out?

385
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,570
-I've been fired once already.
-So have I.

386
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,271
I know it's risky,

387
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,807
but it's for Ms. Seo.

388
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,876
Forget it. Don't bother.

389
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,411
Don't even think about it.

390
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:20,645
Tak.

391
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,780
I didn't hear anything.

392
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,337
What is that punk Gun-woo planning to do?

393
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,841
Those thieves.

394
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,310
I won't just take this.

395
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,181
I'll do whatever it takes to take revenge.

396
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:01,453
So,

397
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,590
you were locked up by Chunha Financing's
president Gi-tae Son?

398
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,227
He said if I didn't donate
to the foundation, I was dead.

399
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,862
Which foundation?

400
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,932
Chairman Eu-sung Son
is creating a foundation.

401
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,002
It's supposedly

402
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,638
for maintaining Mr. Jang's slush fund
or something.

403
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,775
Chairman Son is nothing but a puppet, too.

404
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,144
The one behind the curtain

405
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,413
controlling him
is that witch, Yi-kyung Seo.

406
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,816
Do you mean Yi-kyung Seo from Gallery S?

407
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,818
They're all in it together.

408
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,589
I won't forgive them.

409
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,991
They created the foundation
in such a rush.

410
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,427
There are countless shady things about it.

411
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,062
Please

412
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,998
go into more detail in front of my lawyer.

413
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:51,936
Why does Moojin Group care about this?

414
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,339
It's Chairman Moo-sam Park's
secret orders.

415
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,709
We need to know the situation inside
in order to work with them

416
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,678
and maintain a relationship.

417
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,046
Oh.

418
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:03,782
Will you help?

419
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,164
23BU 9630

420
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,645
23BU 9630

421
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,123
RUNNING VEHICLE REGISTRATION
FROM OUTSIDE SOURCE

422
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,024
What?

423
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,097
Bring me the documents Moojin sent.

424
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,099
The Neo City documents? They're ready.

425
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,436
Did you send Tak on an assignment?

426
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,240
He was running a license plate just now.

427
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,112
Where's Se-jin?

428
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,348
Huh? She was here a minute ago.

429
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,606
Are you still angry?

430
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,342
I was never angry.

431
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,310
Are you at the hospital?

432
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,213
I just visited my friend
and was about to leave.

433
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,552
Hello?

434
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,989
Yes. I'm at the hospital too.

435
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,323
I'm on my way down.

436
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,293
I see you now.

437
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,207
You visit your friend often.
You must be close.

438
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,009
She's such a nag.

439
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:14,012
She complains if I don't visit,
but still complains when I do come.

440
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,313
She's so annoying.

441
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,849
What did you say was wrong
with your friend?

442
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,019
She had some sort of infection
and got surgery.

443
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,487
Recovery is taking a while.

444
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,523
Would you like a ride?

445
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,826
That would be better than a cab.

446
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:28,993
Let's go.

447
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,407
Right, you know,

448
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,175
that matter you said you'd look into.

449
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:45,844
How did it go?

450
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,246
I'm not making any progress.

451
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,315
Would you like to help me?

452
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,484
No.

453
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,722
I work for Gallery S

454
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,224
and I respect Ms. Seo.

455
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,559
Calm down. I was kidding.

456
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,733
But don't do anything too dangerous.

457
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,271
It may become less dangerous
if you'd help.

458
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,609
Do you want to know what it is?

459
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,412
I think we're here.

460
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,623
Take care.

461
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,791
Thank you for the ride.

462
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,460
Bye.

463
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,799
-What is it?
-Ms. Seo found out everything.

464
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,869
Everything you and Tak have been doing.

465
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,463
Tak did nothing wrong.

466
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,933
He only helped because I kept begging him.

467
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,936
So please forgive him.

468
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,304
I should give him a bonus.

469
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,640
I have no reason to tell him to leave.

470
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,044
The information Tak found is crucial.

471
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,048
The person Gun-woo met
was Chairman Man-ho Song.

472
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,386
He must have a grudge after losing
his position as the association chairman.

473
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,523
I'm sure he was going to go public
about how the foundation is being founded.

474
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,659
Then...

475
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:16,561
Good work.

476
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:18,896
Keep it up.

477
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,499
I won't give you orders on what to do.

478
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,239
Ma'am.

479
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,442
I know.

480
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,013
You want to make excuses,
that you did it for me.

481
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,883
You told me your justification last time,
so I know already.

482
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:42,186
You are neither a monster nor a villain.

483
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,423
Goal, plan, business.

484
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,058
They are all important.

485
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:50,428
But you don't need to hurt people

486
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,896
in order to pursue them.

487
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:56,367
That isn't your image
that I want to reflect.

488
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:03,074
You're more complicated than you seem.

489
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,978
You make me think
annoying things every so often.

490
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,148
"Did I misjudge her?"

491
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,818
"Was she meant to remain a cheap mirror?"

492
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,655
Don't get in my way.

493
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,391
Don't do anything stupid
behind my back, either.

494
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,927
Then

495
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,529
you can become me.

496
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,265
I plan

497
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,967
to reconsider that decision.

498
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,236
Keep it short.

499
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:33,871
The best answer is through action.

500
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,226
When do you have time?
I need to tell you something

501
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,966
When do you have time?
I need to tell you something

502
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,671
So funny.

503
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,474
Seriously.

504
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,984
Yes. Okay, I'll see you there.

505
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,157
Hello, Ms. Moon.

506
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:35,700
What is it?

507
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,035
-Sit.
-I have an appointment.

508
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:42,607
Hey, punk.

509
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,277
What's more important than a meeting
with the chairman?

510
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,445
I said, sit.

511
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,085
You didn't redecorate.

512
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,921
I'm not as big a jerk as you think.

513
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,657
I'd like to believe you,
but I've experienced too much.

514
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,895
Sure, you did suffer a lot.

515
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,363
I know that.

516
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,533
If you wanted to see how your nephew
was doing, you could've texted.

517
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,903
Go to New York
and let go of what happened.

518
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,072
You'll get your new appointment
by tomorrow.

519
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,508
It's urgent,
so you'll need to leave right away.

520
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,477
You've worked in New York before, right?

521
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,379
I'm sure you know many people there,

522
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,680
so it won't be too hard.

523
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:26,184
-Uncle.
-I did this for you.

524
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,620
What could you possibly do here?

525
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,455
People will be talking behind your back.

526
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:35,893
I won't go.

527
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,763
You'll refuse an official appointment?

528
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,565
I can't leave my father alone.

529
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,099
I'd rather resign.

530
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,434
And then?

531
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,637
You'll think about how to stab me
in the back?

532
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,773
Or will you look for
Mr. Jang's weaknesses?

533
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,277
I have an appointment to get to.

534
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,946
That appointment was canceled.

535
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,650
-Excuse me?
-That Chairman Song or whatever.

536
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,220
He won't show up.

537
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,456
I heard

538
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,827
he decided to zip his mouth shut.

539
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,532
So don't waste your time

540
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,601
and go to New York.

541
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,139
Why do you keep pressuring me
to be a bad son?

542
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,876
Even if I resign,
I have to stay with my father.

543
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,346
If you don't go to New York,

544
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,882
Moo-il will have to return to prison.

545
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,852
His sick bail will be canceled, punk.

546
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,559
That's what you call
being a bad son, don't you think?

547
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:05,983
Mr. Jang made many phone calls
and gave it special attention.

548
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:09,954
It isn't easy to change the assigned
judge on a case

549
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,355
without special circumstances.

550
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,258
Now, we can cancel his sick bail
anytime we want.

551
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:19,497
You said we must use Moo-il
in order to make Gun-woo obey,

552
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:20,865
so I had no choice.

553
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,635
I was busy with other things
and didn't tend to Gun-woo Park.

554
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,404
We almost

555
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,874
hit a big stumbling block in getting
the foundation established.

556
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:34,979
You really need to send Gun-woo
that far to feel safe?

557
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,814
The long march is ahead of us.

558
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,685
We should shake out the pebble in the shoe
before we start.

559
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,666
Hey, your boss, Yi-kyung Seo.

560
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:59,003
Because of that woman, my dad and grandpa

561
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,173
are way too busy.

562
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:05,109
I don't think that's right.

563
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,245
Who does she think she is,

564
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:12,283
that she makes my dad treat me
like I don't matter?

565
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,251
Is she that great?

566
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,586
Is she that smart?

567
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:16,987
She is great.

568
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,123
And smart.

569
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,993
So what? She's a total douche bag.

570
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,062
I get sick just being next to her.

571
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,130
Watch your mouth.

572
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,165
She signs my paycheck.

573
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,901
Wow. Look at that loyalty.

574
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,205
Hey. Look at you.

575
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,408
Are you pouring for yourself?

576
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,149
It seems we are friends, right?

577
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:49,220
I felt down, so I called just in case,

578
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,390
but I didn't think you'd actually come.

579
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,159
I felt down too.

580
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,995
If you didn't call, I'd be drinking solo.

581
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,098
Yeah, what are friends for?

582
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,801
We can pour each other drinks

583
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,736
and vent to each other.

584
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,972
That's what friends are for.

585
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,507
Let's drink.

586
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,150
Sorry, Se-jin.

587
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,052
I'm a total evil witch.

588
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,491
I had no idea you were such a nice person,

589
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,928
and I've been terrible to you.

590
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,630
Why are you crying?

591
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,765
Don't cry.

592
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,134
I'm a total witch.

593
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,937
The truth is,

594
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,007
when I asked you to be friends back then,

595
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,210
it was because my dad made me.

596
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:51,315
I knew...

597
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,651
Huh? What?

598
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,053
You visit your friend often.
You must be close.

599
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,223
What did you say was wrong
with your friend?

600
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,865
It may become less dangerous
if you'd help.

601
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:10,568
Do you want to know what it is?

602
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,806
What? Do you need to use the bathroom?

603
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,146
Se-jin!

604
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,647
Hey!

605
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,049
Where are you going?

606
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,421
That's not a bad idea.

607
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,192
It'll be better by the time you come back.

608
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,864
Did you talk to your uncle?

609
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:41,765
Yes.

610
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,367
He said he'd transfer me.

611
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,538
A bad son is a bad son
no matter what he does.

612
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:49,740
Forgive me.

613
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:50,774
No.

614
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:55,713
I'll get much better
by the time you get back

615
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:58,315
and stop eating hospital food.

616
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,921
You don't need to worry about me.

617
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:19,904
What brings you here so late?

618
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,039
You knew everything, didn't you?

619
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,544
You knew everything,

620
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:28,279
didn't you?

621
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:31,782
How did you know?

622
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:32,816
Does that matter?

623
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,922
-I'm sorry.
-You should be.

624
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,258
You should be very sorry.

625
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,494
But my concern for you

626
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,195
is real.

627
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:46,997
I can't believe someone who lied to me.

628
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,502
I'm

629
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:53,871
being kicked out to New York.

630
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,107
Yi-kyung worked very hard.

631
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:02,646
But leaving my sick father behind
is making me lose my mind.

632
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,950
And yet, you want me to believe you?

633
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:07,384
Gun-woo.

634
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,987
If I stop, the fight will end.

635
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:13,724
You got your wish.

636
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,032
Gun-woo.

637
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,270
Don't go.

638
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,440
You said you'd stop Ms. Seo.

639
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,076
I'll help you.

640
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,700
With what we have so far,

641
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,169
TJ Cultural Foundation
should be approved without a problem.

642
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:36,306
Moojin's Neo City Project
shouldn't have a problem, either.

643
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,309
We will have a meeting in Seongbuk.

644
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:40,444
With that,

645
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:43,380
larger businesses and greater funds
will be moved around.

646
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:44,948
From now on...

647
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,089
Gun-woo is going

648
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,158
to a branch abroad.

649
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,226
Let's end the meeting here.

650
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,297
You made that happen.

651
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:04,068
Because you need to remove any obstacles.

652
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,438
-Am I wrong?
-Hey. You...

653
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:08,772
The chairman backed off, too.

654
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,575
And Gun-woo was assigned
to a useless post.

655
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,912
You don't need to corner him any further.

656
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:18,882
Do you know why Gun-woo is leaving?

657
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,320
If he doesn't, his father's sick bail
will be canceled.

658
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:26,957
What's more interesting is,

659
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,694
as soon as Gun-woo leaves,

660
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,298
Chairman Park will be sent back to prison.

661
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,636
You should remove
all the obstacles at once,

662
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:42,439
so they can't get in your way again.

663
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,381
Gun-woo knows...

664
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,385
that I was deceiving him.

665
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:56,854
I knew you'd get caught.

666
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,324
You've become very careless.

667
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:01,959
Let him stay with his father.

668
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,427
I expected too much.

669
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,630
You became careless and weak.

670
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,066
Don't go this far.

671
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,502
Gun-woo lost already.

672
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,140
Ma'am.

673
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:20,978
I like doing something a human can't do.

674
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:26,550
My goal is to reach the top
where no one has been before.

675
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:32,556
That doesn't give you the authority
to make others miserable.

676
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,126
You said you wanted to pass me
and rise to the top of the world, right?

677
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:38,195
Then throw it away.

678
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,732
You have to throw away everything
that gets in your way.

679
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,468
If you can't do that,

680
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:48,005
you'll just be a poor person
struggling to make ends meet.

681
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,474
I said I wanted to be the best.

682
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,243
I don't want to become a monster.

683
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,211
I told you

684
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,880
that a moment will come
when you'll have to choose.

685
00:46:58,415 --> 00:46:59,283
A universal key

686
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:01,485
or an obstacle.

687
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:05,022
You choose which to become.

688
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:07,291
I don't decide it for you.

689
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,131
Please stop.

690
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:16,200
Not a chance.

691
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:17,467
You can stop here.

692
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:18,802
It's just getting started.

693
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,239
You will

694
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,308
lose me.

695
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,011
I told you, it's your choice.

696
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,546
I don't want to leave you.

697
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,714
Don't be a child.

698
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,684
You can't have everything
just because you want it.

699
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,389
I never forget something I once wanted,

700
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,159
whether it be clothes or people.

701
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,496
Everything you do from now on
will be in my place.

702
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,599
Stop being a fake
who lied about your name.

703
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,269
Fight as the real Se-jin Lee.

704
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,440
Don't be nervous.

705
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,342
Don't be anxious.

706
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,046
You are the universal key
that I kept hidden,

707
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,448
and the mirror that reflects me.

708
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,050
Have me do anything.

709
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,119
I'll do well in your place.

710
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:46,590
You said you'd make me like you.

711
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,793
You said you'd use me thoroughly.

712
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:08,879
I'm not afraid at all.

713
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,148
I'm not anxious, either.

714
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,950
I'm not nervous.

715
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,554
Just as you said before,

716
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,724
I am still a cheap mirror,

717
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:23,994
but

718
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,729
I want to reflect...

719
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,566
your true image, at least a little.

720
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,510
My goal is to reach the top
where no one has been before.

721
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,414
That's doesn't give you the authority
to make others miserable.

722
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,884
You said you wanted to pass me
and rise to the top of the world, right?

723
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,120
Then throw it away.

724
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,288
I want

725
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,156
all of those lights.

726
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:57,260
I will look down from the highest place.

727
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:58,929
You can't do that.

728
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,299
There is only one person who can reach

729
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,368
the top of the world.

730
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:09,373
I said I wanted to be the best.
I don't want to become a monster.

731
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,041
I told you

732
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:14,011
that a moment will come
when you'll have to choose.

733
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,279
A universal key

734
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:18,615
or an obstacle.

735
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,974
SE-JIN

736
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:53,517
Hello, Se-jin.

737
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,057
It's the largest private enterprise
to date.

738
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:04,227
The brains of the company have been
working every night.

739
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:07,564
Don't worry
about the foundation's stability.

740
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,533
We went through three levels of accounting

741
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,569
to make it difficult to trace
or shut off the funds.

742
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:17,541
Good work, everyone.

743
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:21,511
Especially Ms. Seo. Good job.

744
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:26,183
It would've been impossible to accomplish
this much in this short a time

745
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:27,951
if it weren't for her.

746
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,152
Of course.

747
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:30,787
She is the best contributor.

748
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:47,304
GUN-WOO.

749
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,644
I didn't think you'd call to say bye.

750
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:56,880
I need to see you right now.

751
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:58,615
I'm at an important meeting.

752
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,118
This is more important.

753
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:05,755
I have my uncle's rebate document.

754
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,049
Ignore what you saw.

755
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,784
-You didn't see that.
-Se-jin.

756
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,360
Let me go.

757
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,996
If you do this, it's over.

758
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,998
You can't undo it.

759
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:50,667
Will you be okay?

760
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,335
I'm sorry

761
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,238
for stopping you
when you were leaving everything behind.

762
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,040
What happened between you and Yi-kyung?

763
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,545
Se-jin.

764
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:03,780
What did she say?

765
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:06,149
She made me realize...

766
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,753
who I really am and what it is...

767
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:12,656
that I truly want.

768
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,262
Goodbye.

769
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:42,986
Se-jin.

770
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,698
MS. SEO

771
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,532
Were you in the middle of something?

772
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,134
I'm unemployed now.

773
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,937
That's good for me. Get in.

774
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,253
Maybe it's because the year is ending,

775
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:52,255
but I have a lot on my mind.

776
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:56,593
Will you be my friend for a day?

777
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,003
We never once ate out together.

778
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:08,772
You've been busy.

779
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:11,508
I had an important meeting today.

780
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:13,109
I think it'll go well.

781
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,644
That's great.

782
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:18,148
There was an annoying happening
in the middle of it,

783
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,183
but it was resolved well.

784
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,586
It would've been nice
if I could've helped.

785
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,089
I didn't think of that.

786
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:28,692
I'll help you next time.

787
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:32,028
Sure. I could trust you to do a good job.

788
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,065
It's because you taught me well.

789
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:37,100
That's good to hear.

790
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,269
I should buy you something good.

791
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:45,342
Since we're being friends,

792
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,344
do you want to drink, too?

793
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,546
Aren't you driving?

794
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,815
I can call a designated driver.
Let's drink.

795
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:04,454
Se-jin.

796
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:07,657
Yes, ma'am.

797
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,027
I know what you're trying to do.

798
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:12,929
But

799
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:14,964
you will fail.

800
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:19,736
I'll make you stop.

801
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:22,972
Because...

802
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:26,209
I like you.

803
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,038
Your world

804
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,541
will become hell from now on.

805
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,585
