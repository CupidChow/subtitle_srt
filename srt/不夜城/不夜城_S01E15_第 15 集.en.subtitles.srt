1
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,078
I've obtained evidence on the true owner

2
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:46,679
of Collins Co.

3
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,083
It's Mr. Jang, isn't it?

4
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,685
Finish this fight for good.

5
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:57,824
You will sit as the king's father,
as planned.

6
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,325
I will make that happen.

7
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,627
What?

8
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:05,231
But you must follow my orders completely.

9
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,033
Are you telling me to obey you?

10
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,635
Obey and get down on your knees.

11
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,504
Otherwise, the documents on Collins Co.

12
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,973
will be shared with the world.

13
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,309
Weren't you

14
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,280
going to hand the Collins' document
to the prosecutor, media or someone?

15
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:26,252
You never gave up anything from the start.

16
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:30,423
You probably used that document
to strike a deal.

17
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,094
You're proceeding with your plan
as planned.

18
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:37,797
Am I right?

19
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,288
EPISODE 15

20
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,389
Wait.

21
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,024
There's no need.

22
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:06,759
Open the gate.

23
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,468
Mr. Jang introduced him to politics.

24
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,937
Then he was elected
as a party representative.

25
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:22,008
He held important posts
while Mr. Jang was in office.

26
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,945
He is currently the third favorite
presidential candidate

27
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,548
by a small margin with the second.

28
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,653
He's a has-been.

29
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,555
There is no novelty in him.

30
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,363
He has great connections
regardless of the political party,

31
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,565
and gets along with everyone.

32
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:50,069
Just because he's good to everyone
doesn't make him someone we need.

33
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,774
We need someone with a new image,
even if he lacks political experience.

34
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,178
Clearly,

35
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,415
you already have a candidate in mind.

36
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,484
Who is it?

37
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,921
If I tell you, will you oppose?

38
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,633
From now on, Mr. Jo will come see you
unless it's a special matter.

39
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,435
I look forward to working with you.

40
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,572
Still, you should meet
with Mr. Jang yourself.

41
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,641
He is more than capable
of handling the general matters.

42
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,510
-Ms. Seo.
-At one point,

43
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,912
I considered getting rid of you.

44
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:37,283
I let you stay because I felt like
you are still useful to Mr. Jang.

45
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,787
So please, do not give me an attitude.

46
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,155
It is annoying.

47
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,534
Congratulations on returning
to the company.

48
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,370
You too.

49
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,505
You can't go anywhere else again.

50
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,443
I'm sure they kept the office the same
even while you were away.

51
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,013
It's nice, there's no mold.

52
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,383
The second tender is on Thursday.

53
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:47,654
Go through each company's documents
thoroughly. Don't miss anything.

54
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,656
I'll run the final check.

55
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,125
Will you disqualify Geo Construction?

56
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:57,297
Of course, since they were
previously in collusion.

57
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:03,169
I think Yi-kyung joined hands
with Mr. Jang again.

58
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,471
I doubt that.

59
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,843
I bet she twisted his wrist,
rather than taking his hand.

60
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,647
She'll push forward with her plan
from now on.

61
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,551
The Neo City Project
may get caught in the draft.

62
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,687
I came back to prevent that.

63
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,391
I won't let Yi-kyung control Moojin Group.

64
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,228
I'll prepare the documents.

65
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,974
-This is Gun-woo.
-Hello.

66
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,810
I'd like to meet.

67
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,929
The seal is about this big.
Check everywhere you can think of.

68
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,199
It isn't at home,
so he must've kept it here.

69
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,534
-Hey, Do-kyung.
-Yes?

70
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,803
-Check behind the plant.
-Okay.

71
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,644
Gi-tae.

72
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,616
Remove the IV.

73
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,685
It's good for you. You need it.

74
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,255
By the way,

75
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,191
where did you put the chairman's seal?

76
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,960
I couldn't find it anywhere.

77
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,064
I need it to approve reports
and proposals.

78
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,732
We need to conduct company business.

79
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,635
Did Yi-kyung put you up to this?

80
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,505
Seriously, what are you talking about?

81
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,341
You fool.

82
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,879
Don't let that woman

83
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,548
use you.

84
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,185
I'm sure I'll find the seal.

85
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,387
Take care of yourself.

86
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,856
Gi-tae.

87
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,891
Gi-tae...

88
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,372
We got rid of the directors
that may have caused trouble.

89
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,342
Some of them are still here.

90
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,078
We'll take our time
and conquer them one by one.

91
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,047
Did you find the seal?

92
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,683
No, not yet.

93
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,186
We searched his office
and the house, but--

94
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,187
Mr. Son.

95
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,056
I know. If we don't get
the documents in order,

96
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:41,093
he can always have me removed.
I'll find it as soon as possible.

97
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,231
But

98
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,366
I'm worried about Ma-ri.

99
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,438
She's adamant
about seeing her grandfather.

100
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,841
She has the Son family blood
running through her veins,

101
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,910
so once she blows a fuse,
she's impossible to control.

102
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,480
-Mr. Son.
-Yes?

103
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,316
I don't have time to advise you
on child-rearing.

104
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,118
That's not what I meant.

105
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,489
Mr. Jang will choose
a presidential candidate soon.

106
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,593
We must obtain the funds
for TJ Foundation before then.

107
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:19,398
In other words, there are many matters
more important than your daughter.

108
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,234
I see.

109
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:22,969
I understand.

110
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,912
Is Se-jin still hanging out with Ma-ri?

111
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:34,981
I'm not sure.

112
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,683
Should I have Tak find out?

113
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,454
No, it's okay.

114
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,897
Working holiday?

115
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,768
They say it'll be very physical,

116
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,871
so I figured if I work like crazy,
time will fly.

117
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,840
-That's why--
-You're being a coward.

118
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,576
You're trying to escape.

119
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,213
Why can't I escape?

120
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,083
I'm so worried about Ms. Seo.
I want to stop her.

121
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,219
But I can't.

122
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:20,359
Rather than being helpless and stressed,
I'd prefer to run away.

123
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,297
Why can't I be a coward?

124
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,467
Let us be honest with each other.

125
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,305
When I said I'd stop Yi-kyung
out of concern for her,

126
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,173
it was all bull.

127
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:40,279
I said that, but protecting my family
and our company took priority.

128
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,449
I just needed a decent justification.

129
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,552
Don't be too honest.

130
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,056
You'll regret it later.

131
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,457
I plan

132
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:56,262
to be honest about my greed
and my true intentions.

133
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,065
That's why I wanted to meet.

134
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,403
If you truly want to make Yi-kyung stop,

135
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,307
you need to stop whining and fight

136
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,977
until one side falls.

137
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,145
I don't want to destroy her.

138
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,614
I told you to be honest.

139
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,416
If Yi-kyung doesn't fall,

140
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,252
how can you stop her?

141
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,851
You said this was your dream.

142
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,153
But you gave it up.

143
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,223
You can't even save your own dream,

144
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,859
but what, you'll stop me?

145
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:05,297
Gun-woo, you can't win this fight.

146
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,902
A monster can't lose

147
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,339
to a human.

148
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,478
Please stop.

149
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,480
You can stop here.

150
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,481
Not a chance.

151
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,116
Because the moment I stop,

152
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,351
I will die.

153
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,122
I don't want to

154
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,124
breathe a single minute,

155
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,460
a single second, if I'm dead.

156
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:12,698
I can't leave you behind,
when it'll get so dangerous.

157
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,937
Run away while you can.
Both you and Gun-woo.

158
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,742
If you truly want to make Yi-kyung stop,

159
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,779
you need to stop whining and fight

160
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,315
until one side falls.

161
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,769
-Hello.
-Hi.

162
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,205
-Yank the parking brake hard.
-Yes?

163
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,339
-I understand.
-Okay.

164
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,447
Are you the person who wanted to meet...

165
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,449
I'm Yi-kyung Seo.

166
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,386
It's nice to meet you. I'm Jae-hyun Kang.

167
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,722
I came ten minutes early to avoid
being late, but you came even earlier.

168
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,257
Let's go inside.

169
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,104
Where's Ms. Seo?

170
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,173
She just met Jae-hyun Kang
and went in with him.

171
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,311
But are you sure he's an IT tycoon?

172
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:06,645
What do you mean?

173
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,115
He looks like your next-door neighbor.

174
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,952
Read the paper once in a while.

175
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,422
Do you know how much his company
stock is worth and their annual sales?

176
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:20,726
His personal assets add up
to hundreds of billions of won.

177
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,728
The new generation's leader
voted by young men.

178
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,697
He's been winning for years now.

179
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,004
I don't do politics.

180
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,039
You're not a very good liar.

181
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,243
The article about my being
the next presidential candidate

182
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,645
was something the reporters made up
on their own

183
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,580
just because I'm popular
in the online community.

184
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,416
It's a headache
and everyone criticizes you.

185
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,086
Why would I do politics?

186
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,622
I'd rather use that time
to develop a new program.

187
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,290
Then develop a new program.

188
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,059
We have nothing else to talk about.

189
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:58,530
My wife is interested in art.

190
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,033
I came to ask you for recommendations

191
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,535
for good pieces or artists.

192
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,408
If I like the artist,
I may buy immediately.

193
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,078
There is one person.

194
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,214
There is?

195
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:17,950
Who?

196
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,785
Tae-joon Jang.

197
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,926
I've heard of him before, too,

198
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,194
but I'm not a fan.

199
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,463
His style is too rough and old.

200
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,500
On the flipside, he is broad and stable.

201
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,169
I'm a first-generation venture capitalist.

202
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,306
If I pursued stability,
I wouldn't be this successful.

203
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,508
When you're young,
taking risks is an opportunity,

204
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,544
but you should find
internal stability now.

205
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:56,088
If by chance, much later on,

206
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:00,592
I decide to consider politics,
I'll give you a call first.

207
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,063
What a shame.

208
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,701
Next time, let's discuss business
rather than politics.

209
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,837
For me, this is business.

210
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,795
He's very modest for a multi-millionaire.

211
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,464
He isn't arrogant, either.

212
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,166
Don't be fooled by the cover.

213
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,236
If he reached the top in his industry,

214
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,206
it means he is standing
in a pool of blood.

215
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,275
Countless competitors and opponents

216
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,945
probably fell at his feet, bleeding.

217
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,349
I'm sure he's running calculations
in his head right now,

218
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:02,788
to decide with whom he should work
in order to claim the presidency.

219
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,459
We'll have to help him
speed up his decision.

220
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,548
I wanted to hear the details of your plan.

221
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,650
After I hear your honest thoughts.

222
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,020
Collins Co. documents.

223
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,489
That's when I realized

224
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,893
that Ms. Seo will not stop,
no matter what happens.

225
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,797
Even if she becomes a monster,

226
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,234
she will climb toward the top
until the bitter end.

227
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,904
I can't give up on her.

228
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,641
I will not run away
and I won't have any regrets.

229
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,111
I'll make her stop,

230
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,081
even if I have to knock her down.

231
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,326
The Special Planning Team uses this office
for outworking.

232
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,729
They won't need it for a while,
so you may use it.

233
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,964
What should I do?

234
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,936
A Yi-kyung task force.

235
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,707
Gallery S, Mr. Jang,
and TJ Cultural Foundation.

236
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,844
Investigate everything that Yi-kyung
is associated with.

237
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,348
Ms. Moon and I will stop by often.

238
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,586
I'll provide all material and funds
that you need.

239
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,720
That won't be a problem.

240
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,092
If Yi-kyung implodes at this rate,

241
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,763
you and I may not get another chance.

242
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,535
I know.

243
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,951
Hi, Tak.

244
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,586
What are you up to?

245
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,288
I'm working.

246
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,423
Did you get a job? Or a part-time gig?

247
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,226
You'd be shocked if you heard,
so it's best you don't know.

248
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,063
Why? Is something wrong with Ms. Seo?

249
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,233
Can't I call if it isn't about her?

250
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,503
I haven't seen you at all,
so I thought you were out of the country.

251
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,605
I almost did go.

252
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,473
What do you mean?

253
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,143
-Tak.
-Yeah?

254
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,880
Even if you and I conflict later on,
don't be too shocked.

255
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,650
I'll do my job. You do yours.

256
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,285
Are you starting a rebellion or something?

257
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,820
Why are you trying to sound cool?

258
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,056
Try not to call, either.

259
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,091
You'll get in trouble with Ms. Seo.

260
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,427
Hey, Se-jin.

261
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,628
Bye.

262
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,142
-Thank you for dinner.
-My pleasure.

263
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,554
He was meeting with Assemblymen
from the Minwoo Party.

264
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,691
Good job.

265
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:03,528
What?

266
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,164
I think Se-jin started at a new job.

267
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,067
She didn't tell me what or where.

268
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,669
So?

269
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:16,008
She said she and I may conflict, and that
we should do our own thing.

270
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,544
Did you call her? Or did she?

271
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,247
I did.

272
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,982
-Don't call anymore.
-But--

273
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,385
She insisted on going alone,
although I gave her an opportunity.

274
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,420
Let her do whatever she wants.

275
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,689
Let's see what she can do.

276
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,360
I found it.

277
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,901
He has accounts overseas
in a relative's name.

278
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,204
If you add it all up, it must be
at least a hundred million dollars.

279
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,473
Who? Jae-hyun Kang?

280
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,210
Yeah, the clunker-driving guy
who pretends to be a commoner.

281
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,081
Tak, you'll have to get up early tomorrow.

282
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,551
What is that?

283
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,420
I don't know.
Someone said to give it to you.

284
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,022
Okay, let me see it.

285
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:48,800
Damn it.

286
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,017
I have some funds in overseas accounts.

287
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,286
They're under borrowed names,

288
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,490
so they'd be difficult to explain
if people were to find out.

289
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,291
And?

290
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,559
But...

291
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,997
someone sent me documents
on those accounts.

292
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:23,935
I think it was a warning of sorts.

293
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,874
I'm sure it was an offer.

294
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,344
If those documents reach the Minwoo Party,

295
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:37,149
all of the networking
that you've been doing will go to pot.

296
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:42,020
Even if you try to contact other parties,
the result will be the same.

297
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:47,225
I am the only person who will accept you.

298
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,799
You shouldn't threaten me like this.

299
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,168
I just said it was an offer.

300
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,006
Money overseas that may disqualify you
from being a presidential candidate

301
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,809
should be laundered and made untraceable.

302
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:08,313
I can help you with that as well.

303
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,319
Stop by Seongbuk.

304
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,957
I heard Seongbuk has a new master.

305
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,293
I guess it was true.

306
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,928
I draw the picture.

307
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,996
He simply colors it in.

308
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,404
Why did you choose me?

309
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,107
Your extreme ambition.

310
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,811
Your greed is unparalleled.

311
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,316
That is a great virtue
for a partner to have.

312
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,554
Did you say Jae-hyun Kang?

313
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,323
Yes.

314
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,392
Ms. Seo said to schedule a meeting.

315
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,576
He has Tae-joon
in the palm of her hand, too?

316
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,913
Yes. I don't know what she has on him,

317
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,516
but the word's out
that Seongbuk has a new master.

318
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:23,221
She made even Mr. Jang her puppet.
I never stood a chance.

319
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,457
Is that why you dumped it on Gun-woo?

320
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,862
He's highly capable.
He's doing his job well.

321
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,000
He's busy preparing for the second tender.
That's why I came instead.

322
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:39,704
I just can't understand.

323
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:42,641
Don't worry about anything else.
Focus on your health.

324
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,244
You know, about Bong-soo's daughter.

325
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:51,983
Just how far does she want to climb
that she's doing all this?

326
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,620
I just don't get it.

327
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,125
I can't find it anywhere.

328
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:02,928
What should I do?

329
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,596
You're a disappointment.

330
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,967
Without the seal, there's a limit
to your filling in as chairman.

331
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,836
You can't turn your back on me now.

332
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,406
I did this because I trusted you.

333
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,777
I'm looking for a way,

334
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,179
but it's...

335
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,483
If the best won't work,
there's always the worst.

336
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:28,853
The worst?

337
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,924
Submit a request to the court
to become the chairman's legal guardian.

338
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:36,595
Do you mean,
have my father declared incompetent?

339
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,130
Once you restrict his property rights
and become his guardian,

340
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,801
Chunha Financing will become yours.

341
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:47,405
Why?

342
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,975
Do you feel a belated sense
of filial piety?

343
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,980
I'll think it over.

344
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,882
It's so sudden.

345
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:01,286
If you hesitate when you should run,
you end up falling.

346
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:08,793
Whether or not you fall,
I'll continue running at my pace.

347
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:14,199
You decide whether you will
keep pace with me or fall.

348
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,087
Is this company not participating
in the second tender?

349
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,823
It's Geo Construction.

350
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,992
The company Yi-kyung pushed
during the initial tender.

351
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,763
I see. The company that she colluded with.

352
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,199
We'll have to remove the traps
that she set up within the group, too.

353
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,169
Don't get pushed around.

354
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:53,872
Of course not.

355
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,844
Mr. Jo.

356
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,850
You do not need to attend
the meetings anymore.

357
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,720
The emergency adviser position
has been terminated.

358
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,455
Thank you for everything until now.

359
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,757
-Let's go.
-Sure.

360
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,093
-About the file I sent you...
-Yes?

361
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,330
My system access has been revoked as well.

362
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,200
The administrator deleted
my account entirely.

363
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,236
It's not like I can't hack
into their system, but still.

364
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,741
I think Chairman Moo-sam Park
is completely off the Neo City Project.

365
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,944
Gun-woo Park is commanding
everything right now.

366
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,715
I understand. You may be excused.

367
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:26,064
I just want to see my grandfather!
Move. Get out of my way!

368
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,265
Ma-ri!

369
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:28,900
Dad.

370
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,102
What are you doing? I told you,
you can't visit him.

371
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,838
I'll just look at his face and go.
Just one minute.

372
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,007
Not until the doctor says it's okay.

373
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,409
That's ridiculous!
I want to talk to that doctor.

374
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:41,146
-His granddaughter wants to see him!
-Keep it down!

375
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,614
You're being louder!

376
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,550
Why that...

377
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,163
Ma-ri.

378
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,498
Grandpa needs his rest.

379
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,175
Grandpa.

380
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,511
Please wake up.

381
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,046
Okay?

382
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,990
Father. How could you do this?

383
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,559
Shut up! Drag him out of here.

384
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,662
Father. Let go! Have you lost your mind?

385
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,898
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

386
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:37,669
Father.

387
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:38,803
A shift in generations.

388
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,940
I said it's time for Chunha Financing
to get a new owner.

389
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,510
Don't dream. Make it a reality.

390
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,239
Se-jin!

391
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,341
Here.

392
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:20,879
Here. Come on.

393
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,618
How much did you drink?

394
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,219
It's because you wouldn't come.

395
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,121
I called like crazy.

396
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:31,789
I was working.

397
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,324
Is work more important than your friend?

398
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:34,659
Bad girl.

399
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,861
You're a terrible friend.

400
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,431
Sit.

401
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:44,135
If you sit and drink with me,
I'll forgive you.

402
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,373
Forget it. Stop drinking. Get up.

403
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,876
Nope! I'm going to drink more.

404
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,912
Let's drink until we die.

405
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,613
-Goodness.
-No.

406
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,382
-I don't want to.
-Come on.

407
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,150
Careful. Are you okay?

408
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,518
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

409
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,086
How much did you drink?

410
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,895
Are we going for round two?

411
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,265
Yeah, we're going for round two.

412
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:15,600
Nice!

413
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,869
Let's go to T-Rex in Hongdae.

414
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,938
I heard it's totally hot there.

415
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:23,174
Not bad. You know things like that too?

416
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,810
You told me before.

417
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,446
Did I?

418
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,556
Are you okay? Do you feel sick?

419
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,526
He was sleeping like a baby.

420
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,594
My grandpa.

421
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,465
Did you get to see him?

422
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,367
I thought you couldn't.

423
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,069
A hospital isn't a prison!

424
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,172
There were too many of my dad's men there,

425
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,174
so I kicked them in the knee and ran in.

426
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,210
Good job.

427
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,715
Grandpa

428
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,785
keeps sleeping like a baby.

429
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:10,722
Dang it.

430
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,376
You know Ma-ri's grandfather
is in the hospital, right?

431
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,444
Do you know how he's doing?

432
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,179
She's very worried.

433
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,081
Don't worry on other people's behalf.

434
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,883
You'll make your life more tiring.

435
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:47,225
Chairman Eu-sung Son?

436
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,061
Yes, Mr. Son of Chunha Financing.
Ma-ri's grandfather.

437
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,530
I think he's being held captive
at the hospital.

438
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,802
Ms. Seo may be controlling his son.

439
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,071
Why do you suspect that?

440
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,574
I wouldn't put it past her to tell someone

441
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:05,977
to lock up his own father.

442
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,981
Ms. Seo is a little...

443
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,152
No, she's very different now.

444
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,555
Okay.

445
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,757
Let's talk about that again later.

446
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,026
-We can't push it off.
-Se-jin.

447
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:26,197
It's urgent that we choose a construction
company for the Neo City Project.

448
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,869
You said you'd gather allies
and split up the enemy.

449
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,807
We can turn Chairman Son into our ally.

450
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:40,645
I know, but right now,
the second tender is more urgent,

451
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,613
and you need to help with it.

452
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,058
-I'll go to the office.
-Se-jin.

453
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,846
Let Geo Construction participate
in the second tender.

454
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,616
Ms. Seo, this is out of line.

455
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,252
You became the chairman thanks to me.

456
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,055
You can't say I'm out of line.

457
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,959
I am simply demanding my fair share.

458
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:29,627
So,

459
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,697
if I refuse to comply,

460
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,869
you'll do the same to me
as you did to Chairman Son?

461
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,203
There are many ways.

462
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,974
Mr. Jang has the documents
on your rebate matters,

463
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,778
and we have the foreigner
who can handle it much more swiftly.

464
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:53,651
Do not underestimate other people's greed.

465
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:22,980
Ma'am.

466
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,483
What are you doing here?

467
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,085
And what are you doing here?

468
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:30,988
I had forgotten.

469
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,324
You like playing detective.

470
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:37,094
Are you having fun digging into me
with Gun-woo?

471
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,097
I am digging into you,

472
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,433
but it isn't fun,

473
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,837
since I have to knock you down.

474
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,207
Knock me down? You two?

475
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,443
That sounds exciting.

476
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,345
I won't stop you anymore.

477
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,814
It's not like you'd listen, anyway.

478
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,083
It's not like you'd win,
just because you fight.

479
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,986
Even if I lose, I won't regret it.

480
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,660
I like the look in your eyes.

481
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,196
It's similar to when I first met you.

482
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,235
I enjoyed our chat,
but I have another appointment.

483
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,071
You should go, then.

484
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,540
I'll be waiting.

485
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,077
It'll hurt.

486
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,169
What's on the agenda?

487
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,539
Jae-hyun Kang will accompany Mr. Jang
in giving out food

488
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:59,744
to the underprivileged tomorrow
and announce their solidarity.

489
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,184
What a nice picture.

490
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,321
If you two join together,
it'll stir up the presidential election.

491
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:14,859
It'll represent a union of generations
and harmony between left and right.

492
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,450
I'll be coming frequently.
Let's skip the inspections.

493
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,819
I opened my arms and my legs.

494
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,622
It's quite insulting.

495
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:48,225
It's our security protocol.
It's out of my hands.

496
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,361
Get home safely.

497
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,166
Politics is a business, too.

498
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:01,172
Even if you don't like someone, if it will
bring a profit, you should hide it.

499
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,241
Is it because you worked
only with Mr. Jang?

500
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,143
You are too blatant about disliking me.

501
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:08,779
I won't walk you out.

502
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:28,532
You refuse qualified candidates
and bring him, instead?

503
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,335
He became the best in his industry.

504
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,537
He has a high profile and preference.

505
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,775
The presidential election
is not a popularity contest.

506
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,445
What can you do with just a shell?

507
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,282
To me, you are also nothing but a shell.

508
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,487
Help Mr. Kang and put up the sign.

509
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,790
You just need to follow my plan
thereafter.

510
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:02,733
I'm saying he's weak, that's why.

511
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,970
If you have a complaint, write.
That's what you like to do.

512
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,840
You should control your rage
before tomorrow.

513
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,696
CHAIRMAN MOO-SAM PARK

514
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:44,909
Uncle.

515
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,911
Are you asleep?

516
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:51,615
What is it?

517
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:53,751
The second tender is tomorrow.

518
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,453
I've excluded Geo Construction.

519
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,290
Yi-kyung won't sit still.

520
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,891
So? What can she do?

521
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,405
Take care of it. You're the one in charge.

522
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,307
Are you okay?

523
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,145
I'll take care of myself.

524
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,614
You should go.

525
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:43,100
I understand. Okay.

526
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,338
It was Geo Construction.

527
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:52,443
They were notified that they cannot
participate in the Neo City second tender.

528
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,313
Gun-woo refused to give in.

529
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,449
I told them to wait
until the results tomorrow.

530
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,631
Please take a look.

531
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,211
2017 MOOJIN NEO CITY SECOND TENDER

532
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,494
I'm surrounded by so much love
that it could melt away the cold front.

533
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:22,566
This event providing food
to the handicapped and underprivileged

534
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,202
is being sponsored
by TJ Cultural Foundation.

535
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:30,441
Along with former President Tae-joon Jang,
Jae-hyun Kang, the god of the IT world

536
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,644
and other influential people
from various circles are here.

537
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,946
Let's meet some of them now.

538
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:37,848
Please enjoy.

539
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,950
Come back for more.

540
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:41,251
TJ FOUNDATION "FOOD WITH LOVE"

541
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,762
Mr. Jang looks good with an apron on.

542
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,333
Let's speed it up. Hurry.

543
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,068
I'm hungry. Hurry.

544
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:38,042
Wait. Hold on.

545
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:40,711
I'm sorry, Se-jin.

546
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,047
The second tender is in ten minutes,
so I'm in a rush.

547
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,348
That's what this is about.

548
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:48,452
Why don't you wait inside?

549
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:56,427
What is it about?

550
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,229
Ms. Seo knows that Geo Construction
can't participate, right?

551
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,934
I'm sure they called her, since
she backed them since the initial tender.

552
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,202
So what happened?

553
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,238
What do you mean?

554
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:11,108
Did Ms. Seo or that company
do anything since?

555
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:16,747
We notified them that they cannot
participate. What could they do?

556
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:20,250
Even if they tried, it would be useless
if I didn't play along.

557
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,988
The Ms. Seo that I know
would never give up.

558
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:29,259
She wouldn't give up on a company
she worked so hard to push.

559
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,401
You did great today.

560
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,844
I'm so tired.

561
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,515
Mr. Jang didn't sit yet.

562
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:53,917
Please show some respect.

563
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,921
There are plenty of seats here.

564
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,833
The technology is an excuse.

565
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:16,273
I heard you made big money
by selling stock and merging companies.

566
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:22,946
It doesn't compare to your real estate
policy while you were in office.

567
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,316
I heard the property tycoons who benefited

568
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,620
are still singing your praises.

569
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,587
Mr. Kang.

570
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:33,824
What is this?

571
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,828
I didn't call you together
so you can argue.

572
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:42,833
You must make it clear to the reporters
that you are on the same side.

573
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:48,071
If you don't like my plan,
you may get up and leave.

574
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:57,414
If the teamwork is this poor,
I should start from scratch.

575
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:01,819
There are plenty who can replace you.

576
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,656
If you don't like my plan,
I'll take you out.

577
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:13,897
Hello, Mr. Jo.

578
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,966
The Neo City Project's second tender
has been postponed.

579
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,171
You were right.

580
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,808
Yi-kyung and Geo Construction
were planning to play games.

581
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,845
They chose companies
that would be top contenders,

582
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,246
and once one of them was selected,

583
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:32,182
Geo Construction was going
to acquire them right away.

584
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,017
Which company was it?

585
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:37,821
The Special Planning Team is investigating
a few companies that they suspect.

586
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:41,758
If they were conspiring with them,
those companies will be excluded as well.

587
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,462
Thank goodness.

588
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,964
It's unfortunate for Yi-kyung.

589
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,301
It is no longer attack and defend.

590
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,204
We will just attack each other.

591
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,109
The fight has already begun.

592
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,485
Hack into Moojin's system.

593
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:12,556
Get copies of every document that was
updated regarding the Neo City Project.

594
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:13,891
Yes, ma'am.

595
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:17,728
Tell Geo Construction's president
and executive director to come here now.

596
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,162
I'll call them.

597
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:21,565
Go to Mr. Son at Chunha Financing.

598
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,567
Find out whether the funds

599
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,736
for Geo Construction's acquiring
were properly delivered.

600
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:26,670
Yes, ma'am.

601
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:53,697
Se-jin.

602
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:56,600
We're ready. Let's go.

603
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,537
I chose the most trustworthy people
from the Special Planning Team.

604
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:02,706
You don't have to go,
if you don't want to.

605
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,608
I'm done working for the day.

606
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,944
This is strictly personal.

607
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:13,083
When we investigated Collins Co.,
your friend Ma-ri helped us out.

608
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,652
I should repay her.

609
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:19,823
SUNGHA MEDICAL CENTER

610
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:36,406
I'll go ahead.

611
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,507
Thank you.

612
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:40,711
Wait in the car.

613
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:41,712
I'll go up too.

614
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:44,314
You said Mr. Son's men are there.
It's dangerous.

615
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,050
If the chairman wakes up,
I need to calm him down.

616
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,619
-Se-jin.
-I'm done with work for the day, too.

617
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,988
This is personal for me as well.

618
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,679
Se-jin.

619
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:27,457
Tell Yi-kyung not to be so suspicious.

620
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:31,028
Becoming an adult's legal guardian
is very complicated.

621
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:34,998
Do you know how many documents
we need to prepare for the court?

622
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:36,733
I have no time to have second thoughts.

623
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,235
I don't know anything.

624
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:41,671
She told me to check on the delivery,
so I'm following orders.

625
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,175
It's fine.

626
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,611
I told you, it's fine.

627
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,951
I'm going to head to the hospital now.
What is it?

628
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:59,356
Fumigation? Why the sudden fumigation?

629
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:00,624
I don't know.

630
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,860
They say they need to replace
the bedding and everything.

631
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:05,462
Ask hospital administration.

632
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:07,597
We're doing that now.

633
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:16,206
It's nothing serious.
It's just out of precaution.

634
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:19,342
Yes. That's right.

635
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:21,378
Okay.

636
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:33,590
They've confirmed.

637
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,092
Okay.

638
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,360
You may go in.

639
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,498
You should keep as much of a distance
as possible.

640
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:44,201
What? Will I catch something?

641
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,002
If you're unlucky.

642
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:49,239
Hey.

643
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:14,898
Hello, ma'am.

644
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,100
The acquiring funds are fine.

645
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:18,635
Where's Mr. Son?

646
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:19,936
He's headed to the hospital.

647
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:22,906
He was complaining about some fumigation.

648
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,509
-Fumigation?
-They're fumigating all the rooms.

649
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,246
How far away is the hospital?

650
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:58,808
Sir.

651
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:06,316
Don't worry. I'm Ma-ri's friend.
Hang in there, okay?

652
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:46,957
Wait for the fumes to dissipate.

653
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,886
-Hello, Mr. Son.
-Check on my father!

654
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,623
And don't let those fumigators go.

655
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,397
Shit.

656
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,433
Hey! Stop them!

657
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,635
-Get them!
-Shit.

658
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:51,421
Gun-woo?

659
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,891
You guys are all dead. Stay right there!

660
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,594
There they are. Hey! Stop!

661
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:58,595
Stop!

662
00:54:58,962 --> 00:54:59,963
Hurry.

663
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,834
Why you...

664
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:13,943
-Hey. Why are you pulling out?
-Se-jin, get in!

665
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,813
Hey! Get them!

666
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,847
Hurry!

667
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:19,115
Hey!

668
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,029
Hey!

669
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,397
-You punk!
-Hey!

670
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:35,899
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

671
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,233
Back up!

672
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,469
-Back up! Now!
-Back up!

673
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:40,804
Back up, you rat!

674
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:42,839
Back up!

675
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,572
I won't stop you anymore.

676
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,475
It's not like you'd listen, anyway.

677
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,377
It's not like you'd win,
just because you fight.

678
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,313
Even if I lose, I won't regret it.

679
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,282
It'll hurt.

680
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,190
Oh my gosh. What did you do?

681
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,394
What will you do about your people?

682
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,729
One steals my father,

683
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:41,965
and the other gets in our way
so that we can't catch her.

684
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,800
Was it Se-jin?

685
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:45,535
Yes.

686
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,170
Gun-woo was there too.

687
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:48,605
Keep it down.

688
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:52,175
Chairman Son will return
after a few days' rest.

689
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,911
That's the problem.

690
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,546
He can't just kick you out,

691
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,716
since you gathered company stock
during that time.

692
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:03,753
That's not the problem.
Once my father starts yelling, I'm dead.

693
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,222
Then you should die,

694
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,925
if getting yelled at will kill you.

695
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,193
Yi-kyung!

696
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,328
Treat Tak's wounds.

697
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,432
Come up when you're done.

698
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,752
You people...

699
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,420
We moved you to another hospital.

700
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:39,088
You're safe now.

701
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,264
You're getting a drug to help you recover,
so you'll feel better in no time.

702
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:50,200
Ma-ri is on her way.

703
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,506
I owe you a lot.

704
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:05,882
Make sure no one goes in.

705
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:07,550
Yes, sir.

706
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:11,688
Se-jin.

707
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,056
Yes?

708
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,659
Do you think Tak will be okay?

709
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:19,562
I'm not sure.

710
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:23,967
Ms. Seo cares a lot for him,
so she may scold him and end it at that.

711
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:30,073
-Se-jin.
-Hi.

712
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,208
-How's Grandpa?
-He just woke up.

713
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,278
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

714
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:36,980
I didn't.

715
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,781
You said to keep it a secret
from my dad, too.

716
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,150
He's in room 1101. Go on.

717
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:44,954
Thank you. Thank you so very much.

718
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,798
Grandpa.

719
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:57,100
Yeah.

720
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:02,539
How could you do this?
I thought you were really going to die.

721
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,174
I won't die.

722
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:07,176
Of course not.

723
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,253
I was really worried.

724
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,856
I thought it was going to be the end.

725
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:22,258
Grandpa.

726
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:27,163
Don't get hurt again, okay?
Promise for my sake.

727
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,265
You promised, okay?

728
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:40,577
Jae-hyun Kang Enters the Presidential Race

729
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:42,378
Tae-joon Jang Announces
He Will Support Him

730
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:47,216
Yi-kyung

731
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,886
got that far already.

732
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,389
I guess her next goal has been decided.

733
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,001
Mr. Jang.

734
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:11,441
If it isn't urgent, let's talk tomorrow.

735
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,378
I'm exhausted.

736
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,015
Chairman Son apparently escaped
from the hospital.

737
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,388
Escaped?

738
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,623
Yes.

739
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:32,261
I think Gun-woo was behind it.

740
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:40,737
Gun-woo?

741
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,541
He's challenging Yi-kyung?

742
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:53,850
Why did you let them hit you?

743
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:55,952
They outnumbered me by too much.

744
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,287
I said to be careful.

745
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,223
I'm sorry.

746
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:04,160
So, did Se-jin get away safely?

747
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,229
-Gun-woo, too?
-Yes.

748
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,831
You saw how pissed off Gi-tae Son was.

749
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,036
With his ability,

750
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,338
he couldn't have kept him
locked up much longer anyway.

751
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:22,278
But I didn't know
Se-jin would move so quickly.

752
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,647
Why did you tell me to save her?

753
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:26,616
Was it protection again?

754
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:31,220
Protection?

755
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:33,856
Like last time, when you told me
to protect her.

756
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:34,957
It's bait.

757
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,728
She'll feel like she owes you.

758
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:45,034
She'll blame herself for what I do to you,
whether I fire you or punish you.

759
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,637
That's how she is.

760
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:51,941
Must I deceive her?

761
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:54,377
If needed.

762
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:07,623
Your words. Your actions.

763
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,326
She won't suspect any of them.

764
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:13,329
Not just Se-jin. Gun-woo, too.

765
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,435
Why? Do you have a problem with that?

766
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,505
Se-jin is no match for you.

767
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,941
Even if she's working with Gun-woo Park.

768
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:26,909
I don't think you need to--

769
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,712
Moojin's Neo City second tender
was postponed.

770
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:34,117
The strategy to have Geo Construction
acquire the winning company is void.

771
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:39,222
I'm positive it was Se-jin's doing.

772
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:41,858
How could she...

773
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:48,397
She's starting to copy me,
since she said she'd reflect me.

774
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:56,839
Then I should show my respect
and trample her.

775
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:25,835
Just remember whom it is we are fighting.

776
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:29,372
Ask whether she wants to get hurt
or give up if she's scared.

777
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:30,473
Don't you get tired?

778
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,842
No. I don't want to lose Ms. Seo.

779
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:36,145
If we lose now, the company
and the project will shake.

780
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,648
We need to catch Yi-kyung
before she pushes harder.

781
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,683
I think they want to meet Jae-hyun Kang.

782
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,785
This is a trap.

783
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:44,954
Will Se-jin be hurt too?

784
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:47,390
We must eliminate Yi-kyung Seo.

785
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,892
Did you give the order to get rid of me?

786
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,632
