1
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:41,975
Gun-woo Park

2
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,611
is working under

3
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:46,446
Mr. Jang.

4
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,648
Leave this place.

5
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,951
That'll be the beginning

6
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,320
of your repentance toward my father.

7
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,623
The Department of Justice stated
that his health worsened

8
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:00,193
due to his high blood pressure,
pneumonia, depression...

9
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,328
EPISODE 7

10
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,564
Since we dragged the old lion
out of its cage,

11
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,699
the bloody fight will begin now.

12
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:10,837
Father.

13
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,475
In order to fight,

14
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,078
you must become

15
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,181
absolutely necessary to someone.

16
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,750
Pardon? To whom?

17
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:25,819
Gun-woo Park.

18
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,823
Steal him.

19
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,030
You're kidding, right?

20
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,569
I was too stunned

21
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,939
that I even forgot to laugh at your joke.

22
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:53,580
Ma'am.

23
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,516
Even if his father is back, Gun-woo...

24
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,421
won't be able to leave Mr. Jang
that easily.

25
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,424
That's how he is.

26
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,595
Once he makes a decision,
he doesn't look back.

27
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,431
For a while,

28
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,800
or perhaps longer,

29
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,768
he'll block my way.

30
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,874
I need to remove him.

31
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,611
Otherwise, my business and my plan

32
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,713
will all come to nothing.

33
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,615
I'm not sure

34
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:33,453
what you mean exactly, by "steal" him.

35
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:36,990
Make him yours.

36
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,293
Make him completely

37
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,128
yours.

38
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:45,932
Hold...

39
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,568
Hold on.

40
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,271
But he used to like you

41
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,805
and I know those feelings

42
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,240
aren't completely gone yet.

43
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,844
How can I deceive someone like that?

44
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,853
Is it that you can't do it,
or you don't want to?

45
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,789
I'm not sure which it is.

46
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,226
I think it may be both.

47
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,962
-Fine.
-Don't be mistaken.

48
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,532
I'm not saying I refuse no matter what.

49
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,471
But it's obvious
he'll suspect me if I approach him.

50
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,876
And even if I make him believe me,

51
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,479
to use someone's feelings like that...

52
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,518
I know your plan is important.

53
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,056
Let me think about it for a day.

54
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,225
Fine. Do as you please.

55
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,334
You may go.

56
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,003
I'm sorry. It was just so sudden--

57
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,071
I said fine.

58
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,019
What did she say?

59
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,287
About what?

60
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,488
The hidden card.

61
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,790
She called you her hidden card.

62
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,327
That means she should've given you
a very important mission.

63
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,631
She said to steal.

64
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,932
Steal what?

65
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,237
Your herb tea brewing know-how.

66
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,839
Hey, Se-jin.

67
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:33,973
She didn't say much.

68
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,183
Gun-woo.

69
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,620
I know you did that because of Moo-sam.

70
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,890
I'll get reports here, give my approvals

71
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,158
and do everything from now on.

72
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,860
I won't let Moo-sam become the chairman

73
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,996
and I'll prevent the group
from falling apart.

74
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,497
So--

75
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,432
I'll come back.

76
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,903
After I repay Mr. Jang for the debt I owe
because of Moo-sam.

77
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:42,408
Hey!

78
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,644
Gun-woo!

79
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,586
Did you check?

80
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,455
The day she came to the office,

81
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,391
Ms. Seo visited the chairman.

82
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,429
I wondered what the big gift was.

83
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,932
Yi-kyung is impressive.

84
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,067
She got my father to give in.

85
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,604
I'm sure she has an axe to grind.
She must have an ulterior motive.

86
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,341
Still, I'm relieved.

87
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,480
I feel better seeing him
in a hospital gown

88
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,315
instead of a prison uniform.

89
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,125
Why are you still up?

90
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,960
Huh? I was about to.

91
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,897
-Is something wrong at work?
-What do you mean?

92
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,666
I'm doing too well. That's the problem.

93
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,470
Be good to your boss.

94
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,407
She is our family's savior.

95
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,361
I'll do it.

96
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,263
I'll try.

97
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,465
Forget it.

98
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,734
It's not about filling in
for me for a day.

99
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,770
It'll take a toll emotionally
and tug at your conscience.

100
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,940
If I push you into it
when you don't have the conviction,

101
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,309
you'll end up giving up.

102
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,078
That's worse than not doing it at all.

103
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:27,914
I can do it.

104
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:33,085
If your plan fails, I'm screwed too.

105
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,823
I have a long way to go.
I don't want to stop here.

106
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,427
I'll do what you order.

107
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,615
He is invited too.

108
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,628
I have a question.

109
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,397
Do you...

110
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,300
really not care?

111
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,938
He's a good person,

112
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,441
and they're nice memories.

113
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,576
But that is all.

114
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:32,945
There's nothing else.

115
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,884
Right now, he's just
one of the obstacles in my way.

116
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,895
Your father must have been desperate.

117
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,466
He must've thought he'd lose his son.

118
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,971
That's why he even gave up on Dubai
and took the sick bail.

119
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,573
I told my father

120
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,175
that I can't go back until I repay you.

121
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,178
Repay me for what?

122
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,514
I didn't do anything.

123
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,217
You may go now, if you want,

124
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,253
and nurse Moo-il back to health.

125
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,422
Sir.

126
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,292
Okay.

127
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:34,340
Do you know why I chose you
instead of Bong-soo's daughter?

128
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,844
I've watched you grow up
and know your character,

129
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,615
but I can't read her mind,

130
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,151
although she seems talented.

131
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,053
Do you

132
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,621
not trust me?

133
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,175
He's been stressed ever since
he heard about the chairman's release.

134
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,945
He's telling me to discard my filial love
and demonstrate my loyalty.

135
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,248
What a roundabout way to say that.

136
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,150
Did you receive the invitation?

137
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,553
It's a place

138
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,489
where Mr. Jang's nephew gathers
other young financial leaders.

139
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,392
Please go and represent Moojin Group.

140
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,129
I'll go now.

141
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,864
I will be on the second floor
with Ms. Seo.

142
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,066
I'll contact you in between.

143
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:42,902
Hello.

144
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,571
I'm Hyun-il Jang, the host.

145
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,206
Excuse me, but...

146
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,547
I'm Se-jin Lee from Gallery S.

147
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,949
Ms. Seo was busy, so I came in her place.

148
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,752
It's nice to meet you.
Please come this way.

149
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,103
Chairman Son has arrived.

150
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,309
Gun-woo.

151
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,555
Hello. I'm here.

152
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:37,757
Hey. I'm glad you came.

153
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,325
It's good to see you.

154
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,498
I heard the chairman is on sick bail.

155
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,199
That's great.

156
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,169
The old men may fight,
but there's no need for us to.

157
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,203
Right?

158
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,405
Let me introduce you.

159
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,642
This is Gun-woo Park from Moojin Group.
He went to my college.

160
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,678
And this is Se-jin Lee from Gallery S.

161
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,414
I know.

162
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:04,784
We've met before.

163
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,418
You have?

164
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,054
Wow, Gun-woo.

165
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,258
I thought you were buried in work.

166
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,760
When did you meet such a pretty lady?

167
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,830
I'm blessed when it comes to women.

168
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,431
Hyun-il.

169
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,566
Dong-hyun.

170
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,568
Excuse me for a minute.

171
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,538
Let's go.

172
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,410
You use your real name now.

173
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,279
You're no longer Yi-kyung's double?

174
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,648
She trusts me.

175
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,650
Why did you drag Se-jin into it?

176
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,854
-Yi-kyung, this was--
-This is our fight.

177
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,057
Don't touch her.

178
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,093
Then

179
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,963
you must be here to do
something important.

180
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,334
Are you here to get information
from Mr. Jang's nephew?

181
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,270
Or are you here to seduce a wealthy man?

182
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,405
Guess.

183
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,974
Whom do you think I'm here to seduce?

184
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,027
I believe you've heard.

185
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,929
Mr. Jang

186
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,665
put Chairman Man-ho Song
in charge of the association.

187
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,168
Did you call us here

188
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,036
to add salt to the wound?

189
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,707
Chairman Song is enough to qualify as

190
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,175
Mr. Jang's loyal dog.

191
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:40,779
Hey.

192
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,315
He will do as he is told

193
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,352
and even play dead when ordered to.

194
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,288
Are you telling me to go to Mr. Jang

195
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,790
and be his dog?

196
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,360
He wouldn't even see you.

197
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,930
You've already outlived your usefulness.

198
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,132
Hey, Yi-kyung!

199
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,167
-Please be respectful.
-What was that?

200
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,335
Mr. Jo.

201
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,438
-Yes, ma'am.
-It's too loud.

202
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,474
Wait outside.

203
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,009
You wait outside too.

204
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,246
Father, don't fall for
this woman's antics.

205
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,281
I said, wait outside!

206
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,057
You haven't handed over

207
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,994
Mr. Jang's accounts to Chairman Song,
have you?

208
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,033
-That's--
-Give me the hard drive

209
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,302
with the encoded account.

210
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,171
I'll use it to make you

211
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,040
a severance package.

212
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,545
You seem to be mistaken.

213
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,847
You can't access the account

214
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,482
just because you have the hard drive.

215
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,086
There are two hard drives
with the same code.

216
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,089
One is with the association,
the other with Mr. Jang.

217
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,526
Both must be connected simultaneously
in order to access the account.

218
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,595
I'm not saying I'll withdraw
from the account.

219
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,098
If we cut off a major source of funding,

220
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,468
Mr. Jang will get desperate
and will hand it over himself.

221
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,471
Ten percent of what's in the account

222
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,406
should be

223
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,243
a sufficient severance package
for being discarded.

224
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,917
Do you think Mr. Jang
will permit it that easily?

225
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,921
No transaction comes to fruition easily.

226
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,491
I'll have to make him consent.

227
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,296
You've lost your reputation.
You should at least make a profit.

228
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,266
Just give me the hard drive.

229
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,703
I'll take care of the rest.

230
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,668
Excuse me.

231
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:56,809
What's wrong?

232
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:58,877
It was nice.

233
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,452
Gun-woo.

234
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,755
That song.

235
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,658
You played it before, haven't you?

236
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,227
For Ms. Seo.

237
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,103
Yi-kyung really must trust you.

238
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,039
She doesn't let many people near her.

239
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,259
Ms. Seo.

240
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:48,894
What is it?

241
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,264
I can't do it.

242
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,568
Gun-woo

243
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,637
still has feelings for you.

244
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,873
A lot.

245
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,543
I don't think it's right

246
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,713
to use his feelings like that.

247
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,717
I'm sorry.

248
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:19,958
I didn't expect much.

249
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,961
I just wanted to confirm

250
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,264
what your limit was.

251
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,565
Ms. Seo.

252
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,151
Yi-kyung Seo.

253
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,587
Can we trust her?

254
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,993
I've already been discarded.
Might as well reap the benefits.

255
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,129
If it works out, I'll get a huge payout.

256
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,766
Even if it fails,
Yi-kyung will take all the blame.

257
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,774
Don't worry.

258
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,845
You won't be harmed in any way, Chairman.

259
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,467
Hello!

260
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,136
Hey. Come in.

261
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,638
It's so cold outside.

262
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,845
What is all of this? How pretty.

263
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,946
Yeah.

264
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,281
It's the year-end.

265
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:57,916
We should be festive too.

266
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,085
We're having a wine party later, too.

267
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,320
Can I help?

268
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,622
Yeah. Get me that box from there.

269
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,029
Ms. Seo, would you like some tea?

270
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,365
I already had some.

271
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,035
Okay.

272
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,046
It's okay. It's okay.

273
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,248
I don't know what it is,

274
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,284
but you know how Ms. Seo is.

275
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,854
After the icy blast,
it will be calmed again.

276
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,717
Good work for the past year.

277
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,087
Let's work hard for Ms. Seo
next year as well.

278
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:10,455
Cheers!

279
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,791
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

280
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,566
It may be a small gathering,
but still it's Gallery S' year-end party.

281
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,168
We should have Ms. Seo say a few words.

282
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:24,536
Ms. Seo?

283
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,413
There is someone I'd like to acknowledge.

284
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,351
She wasn't here for long,
but she worked harder than anyone.

285
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,488
Se-jin, stand up.

286
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,429
It must've been difficult,
but you did well.

287
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,499
No, I wasn't good enough
and wasn't much help.

288
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,902
What you've done so far is plenty.

289
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:00,472
Go back now.

290
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,408
Sorry?

291
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,877
You're done, so you may go now.

292
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,649
Ma'am, what do you mean?

293
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,084
You're fired.

294
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,692
-But--
-Continue with the party.

295
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,434
Why?

296
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,340
Why are you firing me?

297
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,008
Because I don't need you anymore.

298
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,445
I have to keep wanting you,

299
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,380
but there's no need anymore.

300
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:46,618
I can't stand weak people.

301
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,889
Is it because of Gun-woo?

302
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,025
Of course, that's part of it too.

303
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,230
You said you'd make me like you.

304
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,367
You said you'd use me thoroughly.

305
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,568
I planned to.

306
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,137
Then I found out it won't work.

307
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,374
I make mistakes at times, too.

308
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,410
You said you'd reflect my true image,

309
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,679
but you're not prepared to.

310
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,815
You were all talk.

311
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,252
Our transaction ends here.

312
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:47,913
Se-jin!

313
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:53,919
You can't go like this.

314
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:55,820
Let's go back.

315
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:58,757
Go back?

316
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:00,625
Where?

317
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,260
To whom?

318
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:25,917
She must have been shocked.

319
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,289
Do you think she'll return?

320
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,025
If she can't realize her true ambition,

321
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,396
it's meaningless even if she does.

322
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:43,768
It'll be her final test.

323
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:56,748
I'm sorry,

324
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,917
but he refused the visitation.

325
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,218
I'm his son.

326
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,087
That's why you can't go in.

327
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,062
Just seeing you will make him angry.

328
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,098
Think about your father's blood pressure.

329
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,866
You must feel so secure,

330
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,903
having such a powerful heavyweight
in your corner.

331
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,406
It's not just me.

332
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,775
Moo-il must feel like
he gained a thousand troops.

333
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,679
Thanks for the gift.

334
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,482
How did you convince my father?

335
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,653
What are you doing? Why aren't you
running Mr. Jang's errands?

336
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,924
Moo-il, it's me, Moo-sam.

337
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,705
You're doing well, step by step.

338
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,307
You made it this far already.

339
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:00,879
He's my father's friend.
I should visit him when he's sick.

340
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,616
How is the other friend?

341
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,052
Stop asking questions
you know the answer to.

342
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:12,157
You even sent someone to the gathering
the other day to spy upon his movement.

343
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:14,793
Se-jin Lee.

344
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:16,895
Is that it?

345
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,130
Tell her to work hard.

346
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,000
Hyun-il is obsessed with women.

347
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,168
I fired her.

348
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,638
She's greedy and smart,

349
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,673
but she has too much of a conscience.

350
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,408
You know.

351
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,211
A conscience, honesty, ethics.

352
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,847
I hate terms like that,

353
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,582
which have no monetary value.

354
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,350
That's why I fired her.

355
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,095
Guess.

356
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,831
Whom do you think I'm here to seduce?

357
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,467
Gun-woo.

358
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,402
That song.

359
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,305
You played it before, haven't you?

360
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:02,741
For Ms. Seo.

361
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,510
Ma'am.

362
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,689
Ms. Moon. Look into something for me.

363
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,392
Find out everything you can on Se-jin Lee,

364
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,661
who worked for Gallery S.

365
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,899
Yes. My father is fine.

366
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,970
Anyway, look into Se-jin Lee
as soon as possible.

367
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,179
I'm sorry.

368
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,217
That'll be 3,500 won.

369
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,621
-Do you need the receipt?
-No, thank you.

370
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:51,790
Thank you.

371
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,670
Don't get the wrong idea.
Ms. Seo didn't send me.

372
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,778
Tae-joon, that punk.

373
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,147
Do you know why he's rushing?

374
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:20,118
The next presidential election
is coming up,

375
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,254
but his funds are drying up.

376
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,558
He tried to eat up

377
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,562
Moojin Group while I was in prison.

378
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:36,267
But now that I'm out now
with my eyes wide open,

379
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,236
he doesn't stand a chance.

380
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:39,771
Of course, not.

381
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,974
I'll take on Gun-woo's role
and take good care of you.

382
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,476
I gave you an inch

383
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,612
and you took a mile, you punk.

384
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,748
Come on, Moo-il.

385
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,152
The auditing team kept saying
you should be fired,

386
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:55,954
but I barely stopped them.

387
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,289
Even crap may be useful at some point.

388
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,325
You've made the correct decision.

389
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,961
If you plan to go up against Mr. Jang,

390
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,963
you need to put together a team.

391
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,499
Gather people you need. Cut off funding.

392
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,635
You have much to do.

393
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,470
Then eventually,

394
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,707
Gun-woo will look for the right timing
to come back.

395
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,146
Wait outside.

396
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,886
You heard me. Get out already.

397
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:29,454
Okay.

398
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,895
Let's not keep secrets from teammates.

399
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:47,739
I'm doing this because of my company
and my son,

400
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,642
but what are you up to?

401
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,245
Are you taking revenge on Tae-joon?

402
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,382
I'm not interested in meaningless
reasons like that.

403
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,553
Power and wealth,
that you and Mr. Jang stole

404
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,355
from my father.

405
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:08,426
I want to see what it's like
and hold it in my hands.

406
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:15,033
That's all nothing.

407
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,770
They are useless.

408
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,837
I'll tell you

409
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,373
how I feel after I've possessed it.

410
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:50,969
What's going on?

411
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,705
Did you get everything from Chairman Son?

412
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:55,440
Of course.

413
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:08,920
What brings the new association chairman
to my humble office?

414
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,621
Where's the chairman?

415
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,856
He isn't in his office.

416
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:15,293
He was too depressed
and went out for some air.

417
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,729
-What?
-He went to Japan to see some friends

418
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:18,997
and get some rest,

419
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,833
so it'll be at least a week.

420
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:27,839
What is it about?

421
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,874
He gave me garbage.

422
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,979
Where's the real one? Huh?

423
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,484
Yes, just a moment.

424
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:42,754
It's Baeksong Foundation.

425
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:49,093
This is Yi-kyung Seo speaking.

426
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,663
Mr. Jang had a good laugh and enjoyed it.

427
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:57,168
He says to return the item you have
to its rightful owner now.

428
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,504
I think ten percent of the account balance

429
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,739
for Chairman Son's severance pay

430
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,611
and 300% of the penalty
for my cut would be appropriate.

431
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:12,016
I didn't include the loss we took
because of the audit.

432
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:16,587
Mr. Jang will be displeased.

433
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,156
He'll keep being displeased.

434
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,725
His major source of funding was cut off

435
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,827
just before the presidential election.

436
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,962
Well, then.

437
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,369
Do you think it's negotiable?

438
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,972
I'm not negotiating. I'm making a threat.

439
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,445
Money isn't the objective anyway.

440
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,953
That impertinent brat.

441
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,789
I'll think of a way
to get her to make a deal.

442
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,126
-Mr. Nam.
-Yes, sir.

443
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,031
Give a handful of breadcrumbs
to a pigeon in the park.

444
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:02,533
Then

445
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,471
within seconds, it'll be trapped
by the flock of other pigeons

446
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,306
and it will be unable to go anywhere.

447
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,509
They will flutter their wings

448
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,811
and peck at each other.

449
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,282
You never

450
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,919
should've given it the breadcrumbs.

451
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,189
I'll use the National Tax Service
or the prosecutor to pressure her.

452
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,558
That'll only have a contrary effect.

453
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:31,996
I know

454
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,564
Ms. Seo a little.

455
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,902
If the opponent stabs her with a dagger,
she'll shoot with a gun.

456
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,509
Leave her to me.

457
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,244
I'll use this

458
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,045
to repay my debt to you.

459
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,515
Have a good night.

460
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,489
I'll drive you home.

461
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,629
-Get out of my way.
-Let's go to Ms. Seo.

462
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,899
I'm sure she's not angry anymore.

463
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:09,834
Just go talk to her.

464
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,235
Are you stupid?

465
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,404
She isn't angry.

466
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,039
She doesn't need me anymore.

467
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,741
Then make her need you.

468
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,711
Why must I do that?

469
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,181
Tell me.

470
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:26,817
Why must I cling onto someone
who doesn't even want me?

471
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:29,287
Didn't you

472
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,622
want to become like her?

473
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,094
Then whatever she says,
you can't give up here.

474
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,951
The electricity bill,
water bill, gas bill.

475
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:04,655
They rob you blind.
How are we supposed to live?

476
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:10,294
Song-mi needs a new winter coat, too.

477
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,866
-Auntie.
-Yeah?

478
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,802
Buy it if you need to.

479
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,370
Stop whining.

480
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,606
Do you know how much it costs?

481
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,208
That's the poor man's mentality.

482
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,446
You're afraid it'll go away
if you spend it,

483
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,348
so you're even afraid to spend 1,000 won.

484
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,253
Will you live like that all your life?

485
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,321
Se-jin.

486
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,767
I have to keep wanting you,

487
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,836
but there's no need anymore.

488
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,707
I can't stand weak people.

489
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,168
-What?
-Where do you keep going every day?

490
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,703
Ms. Seo wants you.

491
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,340
Okay.

492
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,944
Gosh.

493
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:28,999
Welcome...

494
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:32,870
What time do you finish?

495
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,976
I need to talk to you.
Make some time for me after work.

496
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,114
Se-jin.

497
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,650
I have no time and I'm not interested.

498
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,018
I promise you'll change your mind.

499
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,676
I heard you were fired from Gallery S.

500
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:13,744
As you can see.

501
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:15,880
It's a shame.

502
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:17,982
That'll be five thousand won.

503
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,351
Aren't you going to return to Gallery S?

504
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,453
Do you have a discount card
or a points card?

505
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,524
There's something
I'd like you to help me with.

506
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,126
Sir, I'm helping you check out.

507
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:31,896
Will you let your life end

508
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,098
just being used by Yi-kyung?

509
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,101
Why are you doing useless things?

510
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,736
I went during my personal time.

511
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,838
You have no personal time.

512
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:44,308
You're on call 24 hours a day.
That's the term in your contract.

513
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:45,342
Did you forget?

514
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,479
Se-jin is working at a convenience store.

515
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:50,714
So?

516
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,984
I thought you'd want to know
what she's doing and where.

517
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,719
Not because you wanted to know?

518
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,959
Don't do things
I don't tell you to anymore.

519
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,961
I saw Gun-woo Park.

520
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,698
He came to the store where Se-jin works.

521
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,706
Yi-kyung isn't interested in other people.

522
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,342
And she doesn't like receiving interest.

523
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,344
But you're different.

524
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,948
And yet, I was fired.

525
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,618
If you ask for another chance,
she'll take you back for sure.

526
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,855
Then I can be your spy?

527
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,756
I'll compensate you generously.

528
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,760
I didn't think you made deals like this.

529
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,698
You're different from what I thought.

530
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,201
I'm surprised at myself too.

531
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,906
Your old feelings for her are separate
from your desire to beat her,

532
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,040
is that it?

533
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,376
I want

534
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,512
to stop Yi-kyung.

535
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:58,749
If she keeps at this pace,

536
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:00,885
she'll fall eventually.

537
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,654
Isn't that hypocritical?

538
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,156
You're trying to hire me,

539
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,526
who worked for her, to betray her.

540
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,831
I see why you're special to her.

541
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,166
You have a lot in common.

542
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,203
She was like that too, before.

543
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:20,971
She was good

544
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,907
at saying things that hurt.

545
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,709
She never let anyone intimidate her.

546
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,114
You just had the same look in your eyes.

547
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,253
Anyway, I refuse.

548
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:38,589
Se-jin.

549
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,724
I was used enough by Ms. Seo.

550
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,361
I don't want to get used
by someone else again.

551
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,364
Situations change
and so do your convictions.

552
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,000
Call me if you ever change your mind.

553
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:57,841
MOOJIN GROUP
GUN-WOO PARK

554
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:10,521
MOO-SAM PARK

555
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,264
Yes?

556
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:21,999
Did you do something wrong?

557
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,234
What do you mean?

558
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,904
My mole in the Seoul District
Prosecutor's Office called.

559
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,440
He said they have a search warrant
for Gallery S.

560
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,409
It's for fake transactions.

561
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,179
Our company name was on the list too.

562
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,349
Didn't you clean up
the special transaction matter?

563
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,217
Don't worry about that.

564
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,320
They made that claim
to justify the warrant.

565
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:44,421
Are you sure?

566
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:45,956
Can I trust you?

567
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:47,791
Then why--

568
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:48,726
Bye.

569
00:43:58,535 --> 00:43:59,837
We're from the prosecutor's office.

570
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,174
SEARCH WARRANT

571
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,677
We have a warrant to search your premises
regarding the charge

572
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:10,114
of forging fake art deals
with Moojin Produce's foreign branch.

573
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:11,348
Please cooperate.

574
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,782
The nature of enlightenment cannot be seen

575
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,125
I told you

576
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,861
to leave Yi-kyung Seo to me.

577
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,933
I promised I'd find the account.

578
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,335
We sent the search team to find it.

579
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,506
If they find it before you do,
you wouldn't have to waste your time.

580
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:12,309
Gun-woo.

581
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,717
Do you know why she's playing these games?

582
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:22,886
Money?

583
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,589
That's what I thought at first,

584
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:28,692
but the amount is unclear.

585
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:35,299
But she can't access my account

586
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,701
with just that one key.

587
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:44,808
She wants me to look at her,

588
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,947
and see what a nuisance she is.

589
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,229
The hard drive is secure.

590
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:11,101
The auditing team last time,

591
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,203
the prosecutor this time.

592
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,675
Even a toothless tiger has sharp claws.

593
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:25,716
Should we clean up?

594
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,750
Later.

595
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:33,857
What?

596
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:37,728
Okay.

597
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,838
I guess you wasted your time at Gallery S.

598
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,674
You'll get an earful from Mr. Jang.

599
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,220
If you can't hit the mark
on your first shot,

600
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,490
don't take aim at Yi-kyung.

601
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,394
I'm sure I warned you last time.

602
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,033
You're the only one I can rely on now.

603
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,469
May I expect good news for Mr. Jang?

604
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:20,871
Don't get your hopes up.

605
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:22,940
You never know now.

606
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,343
Let me know if you need any help.

607
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:27,611
It's okay.

608
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,446
I'll do it my way.

609
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,049
Although I'm deviating this time.

610
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:56,306
Hey, Ma-ri.

611
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,543
You should thank my eyesight
and friendship.

612
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,119
Se-jin! Long time no see.

613
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:13,790
I couldn't reach you, so I thought
you went to Paris to buy our items.

614
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,095
You must've scammed a lot more people,
to afford this store.

615
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,598
Wait, you don't work here, do you?

616
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,202
I'm working. Let's talk later.

617
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,741
Later when? So you can change your number
and disappear again?

618
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,409
My friends are pissed off.

619
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,911
If you're not buying anything, leave.

620
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,114
Hey. Do you think I'm an idiot?

621
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,149
Yeah, a big idiot.

622
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,984
Have you lost your mind?

623
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,389
What? What's wrong with you?

624
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,024
How much did that coat cost?

625
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,027
The boots look expensive too.

626
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,398
Will you get lost or do you want a shower?

627
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,828
Hey, Se-jin.

628
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,631
What took you so long?
We've been waiting for you.

629
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,635
It's a total mess, isn't it?

630
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,370
The prosecutor came and made a big mess.

631
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:17,074
She's here. Hold on.
I'll call her on the intercom.

632
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:38,228
You look tired.

633
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:39,930
So do you.

634
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,265
Do we still have business left?

635
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,735
Keep it short. I was about to rest.

636
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:48,972
Gun-woo Park.

637
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,208
I'll steal him.

638
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,711
I'll steal him and make him mine.

639
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:56,546
There's no need to push yourself now.

640
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,049
I'm not saying I'll do it
because you ordered it.

641
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:01,785
You said before

642
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:04,054
that I must look up for the answer.

643
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:09,159
If I can make a corporate heir mine,

644
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,262
my life will be totally different too.

645
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:15,966
You seem confident.

646
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,569
-How will you do it?
-He came to me first.

647
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,874
He wants to use me too, just like you.

648
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:27,611
That's where I plan to start.

649
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:28,979
Starting is easy.

650
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:30,914
The difficult part comes after.

651
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,717
If it were easy,
you wouldn't have ordered me to do it.

652
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,421
So you're saying you need my help,

653
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:42,259
since you're only useful
if you're by my side.

654
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:46,363
You were waiting,

655
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,733
wondering when I'd return.

656
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:52,869
I came back on my own,

657
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,105
so you can just take me in.

658
00:52:56,139 --> 00:53:00,210
I'm sure I said you should be prepared
for rejection when asking for help.

659
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,578
There's no way you'd refuse,

660
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,048
since I am the universal key

661
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,350
that you need for your plan.

662
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,224
This is the proof.

663
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,661
If you planned to never see me again,

664
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:21,531
you would've taken back the loan
that is more precious than life itself.

665
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,244
How did you

666
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:36,947
change your mind?

667
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:39,883
I was sick of it.

668
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,053
Being used like an idiot.

669
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:45,922
Both you and Gun-woo

670
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,358
see only your own greed.

671
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,027
You use money

672
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:54,564
and sweet words to use people
to fill that greed.

673
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:57,968
I can't be the only one
being dragged around.

674
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:01,871
I'll use thoroughly as well.

675
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:05,075
Gun-woo, for sure.

676
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,178
And you too, if necessary.

677
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,215
Do you think that's possible?

678
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,750
Even if you discard me,

679
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:15,885
I won't give up.

680
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:18,922
Do you want to see?

681
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:30,567
Gun-woo Park speaking.

682
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:32,035
This is Se-jin Lee.

683
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:33,603
What happened? I went to the store--

684
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,338
I'm back at Gallery S.

685
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,777
I can't talk for long.

686
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,379
What do you need help with?

687
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,182
There's something I need to find.

688
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,551
It's a hard drive with a coded account.

689
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,353
Send me a picture, if you have one.

690
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,289
Also,

691
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,860
I want triple the pay you were thinking.

692
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:59,362
No negotiations. What do you say?

693
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:05,035
-Gun-woo?
-I'm listening.

694
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,069
Okay.

695
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,405
Let's do that.

696
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:10,273
I'll be in touch.

697
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:22,352
Sit down.

698
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,830
I bet he's looking for this.

699
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,969
There's enough money in here

700
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,005
to buy an entire city block.

701
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:46,042
But it's only half a key, so it's useless.

702
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:48,678
What Mr. Jang has is the same.

703
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,316
Give this to Gun-woo.

704
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,585
Directly from you.

705
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,222
If he can bring this,

706
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,125
Gun-woo can leave Mr. Jang
with a clear conscience.

707
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,995
And it'll create
a solid connection for you.

708
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,067
It's quite useful for half a key.

709
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:15,672
Did you predict that Gun-woo
would approach me

710
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:17,841
from the start?

711
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,611
Is that why you fired me?

712
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,646
No, I was only half sure.

713
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,716
You could've returned...

714
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,787
or you could've given up completely.

715
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,791
Because if I just approached him,

716
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,061
Gun-woo wouldn't have trusted me.

717
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,265
So you were thorough.

718
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,437
Don't mix in sincerity
when dealing with people.

719
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,374
Whether it's Gun-woo or someone else.

720
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:54,911
If there is any sincerity,

721
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,181
everything else that is fake
will become evident.

722
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,388
I knew from the look in your eyes

723
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,223
when you walked in,

724
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:10,427
that the final test

725
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:12,962
was already completed.

726
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,134
Welcome back.

727
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,706
I knew from the look in your eyes

728
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,709
when you walked in,

729
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:02,278
that the final test

730
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,714
was already completed.

731
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,294
The weapon he can use on Tae-joon Jang.

732
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,531
If you want to win, you must use
that emotion as a weapon, too.

733
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:57,100
It may sound strange, but I love you.

734
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:00,236
With great risk comes great reward.

735
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,738
We're just sprinkling some embers

736
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,973
between two dried up sheaves of rice.

737
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,509
It's a cold fight where you take and lose.

738
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:09,178
If you caused trouble,
you should be spanked.

739
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,380
Were you behind it?

740
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,482
Please don't take issue with her anymore.

741
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:15,585
I won't let something like this
stagger me.

742
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,391
