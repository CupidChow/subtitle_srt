1
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:42,842
Se-jin.

2
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,178
Yes, ma'am?

3
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,081
I know what you're trying to do.

4
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:49,649
But

5
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,418
you will fail.

6
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,487
I'll make you stop.

7
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,689
Because...

8
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,825
I like you.

9
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,730
Your world

10
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:07,067
will become hell from now on.

11
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,004
She made me realize

12
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,841
who I really am and what it is

13
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,343
that I truly want.

14
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,151
The basement must be damp.
Take care of your health.

15
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,220
I'm dizzy being high up here.

16
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,121
EPISODE 11

17
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,356
Please make it brief,
so that I may go back.

18
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,726
You and Ms. Seo are both third parties.

19
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,062
You shouldn't make deals
with someone else's weakness.

20
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,531
Give me the rebate document.

21
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,067
Then I will let you return
to the Special Planning Team,

22
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,570
or if there's any affiliate
you want to work at, just tell me.

23
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,440
It's actually very tempting,
but I won't take the offer.

24
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,576
Don't worry about Moo-il's sick bail.

25
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,078
No matter what Ms. Seo does,

26
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,980
I'll stop her from sending him

27
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,482
back to prison.

28
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,217
Everyone in the company is talking.

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,120
They think someone is controlling you.

30
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,922
The Neo City Project.

31
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,259
Yi-kyung's right-hand man was listed
as an adviser.

32
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,062
You'll end up giving her
the chairman's office.

33
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,864
I asked her to send him.

34
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,434
I didn't want to discuss everything
with her, so I asked her to send someone.

35
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,035
You report everything to her?

36
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,239
Then you can't guarantee
Father's sick bail.

37
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,241
-Gun-woo.
-Sitting in the chairman's office

38
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,408
doesn't make you a chairman.

39
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,279
A business card saying you're a chairman
doesn't make you one.

40
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,114
The final decision-maker.

41
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,151
If you cannot make final decisions,

42
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,786
you are just Yi-kyung's puppet.

43
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,823
The mold in the basement must be waiting.

44
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,359
Go on down.

45
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,877
I don't see Mr. Kang today.

46
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,137
BUSINESS CONSENT FORM
FOR RECOVERING FROM IMF CRISIS

47
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,215
These are the director candidates
for TJ Cultural Foundation.

48
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,951
A former UN ambassador, a writer

49
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,186
and a past assemblyman.

50
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,621
There are three in total.

51
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,123
They will all be easy to control.

52
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,925
You choose.

53
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,829
You know Mr. Heo, the past president

54
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,932
of Baeksong University.

55
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,268
What does he do to kill time these days?

56
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,170
I hear he's been writing ever since

57
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,972
he resigned as university president
last year.

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,942
He is a good man.

59
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,211
He and I see eye to eye on matters, too.

60
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:08,815
Let's make him

61
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,618
the director.

62
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,153
I will look it over.

63
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,356
I am not telling you to look it over.

64
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,959
-Mr. Jang.
-The people are what matters.

65
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,428
I'm sure I have

66
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,665
a better eye for people than you.

67
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,269
Let's do as I say.

68
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:40,813
Has it been decided?

69
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,849
Gi-sun Heo was chosen.

70
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,817
Good thing you reached him before this.

71
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,787
He'll think it's going as he had planned

72
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,822
and Mr. Heo will think

73
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,958
I had nominated him.

74
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,727
Now that the director is in our hands,

75
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,297
it'll be easy to operate the foundation.

76
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,265
Let's go to Yeoksam.

77
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,700
Will you be all right?

78
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,437
You've had business
at four different locations already.

79
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,074
Perhaps you should return
to the gallery to rest.

80
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,743
My apologies.

81
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,323
There will be a meeting about the change
in layout for Moojin's Neo City Project.

82
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,725
Analyze the attendees whether they would

83
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,361
agree, disagree or be neutral.

84
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:32,465
We must pick out anyone
who will oppose Chairman Park.

85
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:33,866
Yes, ma'am.

86
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,770
Mr. Jang will send us Baeksong's
management details for the past ten years.

87
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,639
The numbers will be inconsistent.

88
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,207
I'll track them.

89
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,243
Tak, prepare the shipment as always.

90
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,549
Tak.

91
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,786
Do you not care?

92
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,289
Se-jin left like that,

93
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,091
and you act like she was never here.

94
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,259
None of you care?

95
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,694
She left on her own.

96
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,096
She even betrayed Ms. Seo.

97
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,163
Ms. Kim.

98
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,332
We'll see her again.

99
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,603
She said she'd stop me,

100
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,405
so she'll show up sometime.

101
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,294
I'll make you stop.

102
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,563
Because...

103
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,866
I like you.

104
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,405
When I was in high school, a kid
in my class was top 0.3% in the nation,

105
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,340
and she was just like you.

106
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,076
She was on study mode
whenever she wasn't sleeping or eating.

107
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,546
Eventually, she cut down on sleep time
and studied while eating.

108
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,449
Guess what happened to her.

109
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,719
She was hospitalized
on the day of the college entrance exam.

110
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,423
I'm not trying to jinx you.

111
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,758
I just want you
to consider your health, too.

112
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,569
In April, the price of cement just...

113
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,172
There isn't any problem with this region.

114
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,275
This region will require
a separate construction permit.

115
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,076
Is it being prepared?

116
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,778
We will get the permit this week.

117
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,447
I see. Please report to me
once you get it.

118
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,448
Yes, sir.

119
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,194
Did you find out anything?

120
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,963
There's no legal problem.

121
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,199
So the stock transfer is possible.

122
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,167
A clause prohibits giving it
to a third party,

123
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,169
but direct family is an exception.

124
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,939
Did you at least talk to your father?

125
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,008
-Not yet.
-Be cautious.

126
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,145
The gift tax will be quite hefty.

127
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,248
-How much?
-Half the shares.

128
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,353
Although he's in a rush,
he wouldn't just cut it in half.

129
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,791
How much is that in cash?

130
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,393
He won't give up all that money

131
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,095
just to ensure his co-management rights.

132
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,297
That will be too reckless.

133
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,934
I put someone on him just in case,
but it was useless.

134
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,539
Anyway, I didn't call you about Gun-woo.

135
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,141
I need to talk to you about something.

136
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,311
It's about your man.

137
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,347
Take him back now.

138
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,515
He will help with the project.

139
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,917
He doesn't help me.

140
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,419
I hear people whispering, too.

141
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,190
When you are on top,
misunderstandings and criticism follow.

142
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,627
You must endure the weight of the crown.

143
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,498
I endure the weight,

144
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,433
and you take the riches?

145
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,235
You, Mr. Jang

146
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,236
and I

147
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,105
will take our shares evenly.

148
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:07,079
You said
we should not threaten each other,

149
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,382
but discuss.

150
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,484
Let's not forget that.

151
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,488
We'll have to discuss
Gun-woo Park's matter again first.

152
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,565
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS ANNULMENT
CONSENT FORM

153
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,168
When did you prepare this?

154
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,437
Get Chairman Moo-il Park to sign it,

155
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,940
whether through discussion or threats.

156
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,611
I told you not to worry about Gun-woo.

157
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,380
You don't know about him as much as I do.

158
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,716
He will definitely give up

159
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,385
on the half of his shares
to obtain co-management.

160
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,123
He will do whatever it takes.

161
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,858
To get you.

162
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,628
And especially if he can get in my way.

163
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,165
This is a copy of the consent form
and required documents.

164
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:00,733
This should suffice.

165
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,569
The chairman must sign
the letter of intent.

166
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,404
Thanks.

167
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,307
It's nice having a friend
in the legal department.

168
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:10,843
Are you really sure?

169
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,448
Even if you gain co-management rights,
you'll lose half your shares.

170
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,553
It's what it takes to say goodbye
to the mold in the basement.

171
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,556
I know I have upset you in many ways.

172
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:58,791
Forgive me.

173
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,264
The Neo City Project
will be initiated soon.

174
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,602
It was your long-cherished project.
You should see it get completed.

175
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,072
Focus on your health.

176
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,877
One thing I'm worried about...

177
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,746
is Gun-woo.

178
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:27,286
He has experience and he's old enough,
so I want to give him an affiliate.

179
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,155
You'll make Gun-woo

180
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,058
president of a company?

181
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,593
Yes. I think Moojin Tech

182
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,596
would be appropriate for him to manage.

183
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,099
But before that...

184
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,304
Hey. Bring in the document.

185
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,508
Yes.

186
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,811
I'm on my way to the hospital.
Did anyone visit?

187
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,523
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS ANNULMENT
CONSENT FORM

188
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,861
Even if he gives up on his shares
and obtains co-management rights,

189
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,663
it would be a big loss for him.

190
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,432
It will be much better for Gun-woo

191
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,769
to run a solid subsidiary instead.

192
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:24,243
If we get rid of the old document,
he won't get any silly ideas.

193
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,984
Please sign it.

194
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,460
This is all for Gun-woo.

195
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,532
Just sign there.

196
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,240
CONSENTER: MOO-IL PARK

197
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,250
Father.

198
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,520
You're here.

199
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,322
What did you do?

200
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,525
What did you sign?

201
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,327
Don't work so hard.

202
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,030
The consent form is garbage now.

203
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,299
Your uncle says

204
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,769
he'll give you Moojin Tech.

205
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,739
-Right?
-Yes, of course.

206
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,875
Prepare for your transfer.

207
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,979
I won't eat the rotten meat
that you throw at me.

208
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,817
The workers there would be offended
to hear you say that.

209
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,287
If you don't want it,
there's nothing I can do.

210
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,125
Good night, Moo-il.

211
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,243
Good work, sir.

212
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,812
I'll see you in Seongbuk tomorrow.

213
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,447
Okay, then.

214
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,320
You didn't want to let go?

215
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,458
You signed that because you didn't want
to lose the shares I'd give up

216
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,027
in exchange for management rights.

217
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,264
Gun-woo.

218
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,567
You've fed your greed enough already.

219
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,570
I can give it up.

220
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,906
Why can't you?

221
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,909
Once you let one thing go,

222
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,247
you lose everything one by one.

223
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,117
Things

224
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,220
you think are a given.

225
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,857
How do you think it'll be
if you lose it all?

226
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,859
I'd start over from scratch.

227
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,461
From scratch?

228
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:58,597
Sure,

229
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,334
I was like you too, once.

230
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,204
But Gun-woo,

231
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,707
if I go back to that time,

232
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,876
I can't do it again.

233
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,812
No way.

234
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,530
I rented it for my photography business,
but I got sick of it quickly.

235
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,769
I tried painting, disk jockey
and other things,

236
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,837
but it's been vacant for a while.

237
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,744
Still, it's nice and quiet.

238
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,214
It's perfect for preparing
for the civil service exam.

239
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,017
But is this okay?

240
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,118
Of course.

241
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,389
But I can't pay much in rent.

242
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,358
What do you mean, rent? We're friends.

243
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,026
Forget it.

244
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,564
Thank you, Ma-ri.

245
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,634
But why did you quit the gallery?

246
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,336
You were doing well there.

247
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,639
I was never doing well.

248
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,908
I only thought I was.

249
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,179
It's okay. Forget it. Just study hard.

250
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,170
SE-JIN

251
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,716
Welcome back.

252
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,356
Come here.

253
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,096
What is Se-jin up to?

254
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,832
-I don't know.
-You don't?

255
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,101
You didn't go to see her?

256
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,603
No.

257
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,575
Keep it that way.
Don't do anything stupid.

258
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,628
Hi. Come in.

259
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,630
You were almost late.

260
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,235
We got rid of a big headache,
thanks to you.

261
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,003
Just in the nick of time.

262
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,605
What is that about?

263
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,741
It's nothing you need to concern
yourself with. It's a company matter.

264
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,348
Please come inside.

265
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,357
What

266
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,693
did you just say?

267
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,028
TJ's inauguration ceremony

268
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:53,665
will also be where you announce
your return to politics.

269
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,534
Ms. Seo.

270
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,336
Mr. Jang will return to politics

271
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,539
at the publication ceremony
for his autobiography. To do it now--

272
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,607
Is too late.

273
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,311
You must use the inauguration ceremony
to gain interest

274
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,347
and make the future candidates

275
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,382
come to you themselves.

276
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,585
It will take a long time to find

277
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:14,953
the person that you want.

278
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,925
I believe you haven't finished

279
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,396
filling my coffer yet.

280
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,131
I will discuss a big matter

281
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,934
with Chairman Park soon.

282
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,506
Oh, that.

283
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,342
She is correct.

284
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,478
Please do not worry.

285
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,247
Chairman Son is doing his best

286
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,650
to make sure
that the misunderstandings and errors

287
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,686
that Baeksong Foundation suffered
will be not repeated.

288
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,054
Of course.

289
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,190
Do not worry.

290
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,894
You are moving very quickly.

291
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,864
I am getting dizzy.

292
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,767
Everything is progressing without a hitch.

293
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,368
All you must do

294
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:04,770
is take

295
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,306
one step forward at a time.

296
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,989
What big matter did you mean?

297
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,326
Let's discuss that separately.

298
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,194
We are family now.

299
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,529
Are you excluding me?

300
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,898
If you get to know something
you shouldn't know,

301
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,533
it becomes difficult to manage.

302
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,325
You remembered the code.

303
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,063
Wow.

304
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,232
How did you get a space like this?

305
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,734
My friend helped me.

306
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,402
Would you like coffee?

307
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:11,770
No.

308
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,739
Let's sit.

309
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,545
I tried to reclaim

310
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,447
the co-management rights,

311
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,683
but I lost it.

312
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,818
I'm still tied down in the basement.

313
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,489
That's all?

314
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,157
So what?

315
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,493
I know nothing and have nothing,

316
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,194
but I'm doing this to stop Ms. Seo.

317
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:40,866
You really don't want coffee?

318
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,605
First, I'm investigating under the guise

319
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,940
of one of Gallery S' businesses.

320
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,679
It's based on what I could find online,
so it's limited,

321
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,180
but drop by drop fills the tub.

322
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,616
You organized it well in folders.

323
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,284
Shall we get started for real, now?

324
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:30,916
Ma'am.

325
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,584
Ma'am?

326
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,626
Why don't you go to bed?

327
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,063
Tell Se-jin to bring the tea...

328
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,237
I'm going to take a break.

329
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,415
I'm going home.

330
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,383
She is so cold.

331
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,722
I mean Se-jin.

332
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,924
After she left like that,

333
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,059
couldn't she call to ask how we are,

334
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,028
and say how she's doing?

335
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,264
Why don't you call yourself?

336
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:54,966
She's your responsibility.

337
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,201
Why is she...

338
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,169
Why would I?

339
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,705
Look into her when you have time.

340
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,577
There will be oppositions
within the company.

341
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,280
Quietly quash them individually.

342
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,458
You're lasting long.

343
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,526
I thought you'd go against my orders

344
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,361
and check on Se-jin by now.

345
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,629
I don't intend to.

346
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,432
And you intend to if I order you to?

347
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,243
We have a tail.

348
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,880
Check and lose them.

349
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,167
Fine.

350
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,105
They got caught,

351
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,740
so they left.

352
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,642
Those careless punks.

353
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,477
Should we try again later?

354
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,280
Why don't you put up a sign
that it's Chunha's doing?

355
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,716
She ordered us around
when forming the foundation,

356
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,418
and now they whisper behind closed doors.

357
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,288
They plan to share among themselves.

358
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,156
Everyone has a weakness.

359
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,191
Even Yi-kyung

360
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,761
must have one if we look.

361
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,396
How?

362
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:06,598
Call Japan.

363
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,302
Plant a mole with Chairman Bong-soo Seo.

364
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,803
With Yi-kyung's father?

365
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,819
It's almost done.

366
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,987
Sit down.

367
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,912
Has the sale of Moojin Tech

368
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,814
been decided?

369
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,716
There is opposition within the company,

370
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,918
but it'll proceed,
since it is the chairman's decision.

371
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,353
Sure.

372
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:02,887
The hierarchy

373
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,590
is the most important thing
within an organization.

374
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,392
-We'll do our best.
-Good.

375
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,036
Wasn't that

376
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,071
Moojin Tech's president?

377
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,476
What's with the sudden sale?

378
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,746
If you sell a company
as profitable as Moojin Tech,

379
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,947
it's a loss for the group.

380
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,949
It only looks profitable.

381
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,218
It's been in the red for years.

382
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:36,087
You must invest because the cost
of research and development is high.

383
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,756
When you consider the long run--

384
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,324
Hey, Gun-woo.

385
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,326
This is the chairman's office.

386
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,962
A mere low-level employee

387
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,630
should not run in here and yap

388
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,099
about a decision made by the group.

389
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:52,103
It's been decided with the executives,
so drop the attitude.

390
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,472
That's why you wanted to send me there.

391
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,641
You told me to take over Moojin Tech

392
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,677
because you planned to sell it anyway.

393
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,380
To act like you were generous by making me
company president for a month.

394
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,818
That was just a coincidence.

395
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,820
Please take back

396
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,155
the sale of Moojin Tech.

397
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,557
This is not right for the group.

398
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,964
Leave. I have a meeting to get to.

399
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,506
CHAIRMAN MOO-SAM PARK

400
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,754
From now on, your image
will be the politics itself.

401
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,490
You must appear friendly

402
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,792
and approachable to the general public.

403
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,496
First, you must be active on social media.

404
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,032
Create a social media team.

405
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,935
Post short and clear messages
and be active in giving feedback.

406
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,838
You must create a young image

407
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,773
targeting young voters.

408
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,978
Second, lose the oppressive image you had
when you were the president.

409
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,348
Act like you are for the average person,
not those in power.

410
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,084
Always wear a smile on your face.

411
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,986
You must be thoroughly prepared.

412
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,489
Mr. Jang is not the one
running for the election.

413
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:20,625
Third, meet with politicians
and important people privately.

414
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,162
Invest all of your public appearances
in meeting the people.

415
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,465
Traditional markets, factories,
schools and hospitals.

416
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,035
Visit them as much as time allows.

417
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,905
Are you saying

418
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,107
I should gather the votes myself?

419
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,843
The times in which politics was just
about spending money is gone.

420
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:42,013
You must gather votes with your image

421
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,182
for the presidential candidate.

422
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,251
That is how

423
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,020
you will become the king's father.

424
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,698
Why do you think they are suddenly
selling a company with such potential?

425
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,134
Who knows?

426
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,670
The buyer is a foreign company.

427
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,106
The CEO is Michael Kang.

428
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,408
A third generation Korean-American?

429
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,776
Michael Kang?

430
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:14,345
Michael...

431
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,716
He is a third-generation Korean-American.
He went to Yale School of Management.

432
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,685
He has a close friend from school
named Hyun-soo Kim.

433
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,921
How do you know all of that?

434
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,557
I memorized it.

435
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,127
But who is Hyun-soo Kim?

436
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,061
He is

437
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,963
the nephew of Tae-joon Jang's wife.

438
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,602
Where did you hear such nonsense?

439
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,337
The sale of Moojin Tech

440
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,106
was requested by Yi-kyung.

441
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,310
You are the group's chairman,

442
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,878
but you agreed.

443
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,647
You punk. How would she make profit

444
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,850
by selling our business?

445
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,385
She would make profit,
and I know the reason.

446
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,223
You'd pocket your share of the sale,

447
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,825
and Yi-kyung would use Mr. Jang's nephew

448
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,729
to put the lucrative company's profits
into Mr. Jang's safe.

449
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:10,735
What?

450
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,837
Mr. Choi, Moojin Tech's president,
is here to see you.

451
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,005
Tell him to wait!

452
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,507
Why is he bugging me again?

453
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,383
Moojin Tech has over 800 employees.

454
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,052
They must be afraid of reorganization
and downsizing

455
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,988
because of the sudden sale.

456
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,390
Whatever the process,

457
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,827
you are the chairman of Moojin Group,
not Yi-kyung.

458
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,030
Don't make your family anxious

459
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,599
because you're busy pleasing her.

460
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,835
Please.

461
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:48,673
Gun-woo.

462
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:52,076
While I crawled through
all sorts of landmines

463
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,878
on my way to the chairman's office,

464
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,080
my only ally

465
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,316
was Yi-kyung.

466
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,052
We developed a bond through war.

467
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,588
Do you think your words could split us up?

468
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,723
You probably still have use
for each other.

469
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,027
I hope you will continue
to be useful to her

470
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,662
for a very long time.

471
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,042
The chairman's opposition is taking action
because of this.

472
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:28,046
The employees in general
dislike him as well.

473
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,616
They say the chairman did something absurd
in order to pad his own pockets.

474
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,020
Gun-woo is skilled at being a nuisance.

475
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,556
Tell Tak to come in.

476
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,885
How did it go?

477
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,990
We agreed this is a time of crisis,

478
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,325
and to gather all the executives

479
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,961
and shareholders possible
to stop the sale.

480
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,063
We will hold the first meeting this week

481
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,566
and come up with a specific strategy.

482
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,571
How do you know Assemblyman In-sook Kang?

483
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,006
Oh.

484
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,108
I met her once before.

485
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,510
Although she knows me

486
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,746
as a career woman who studied abroad.

487
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,850
Anyway, she said she'd be watching
the sale matter with interest.

488
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,686
You are more surprising,
the more I get to know you.

489
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:44,622
Thank you.

490
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,359
Let's not say that anymore.

491
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,194
It's awkward.

492
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,246
This is a list of company presidents
who may attend the first meeting.

493
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,614
Thank...

494
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,321
Se-jin!

495
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,192
You should've called first.

496
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,396
She's the friend who lent me this place.

497
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,167
Oh, Chunha Financing's granddaughter?

498
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:30,768
I've heard a lot about you.

499
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,770
Gun-woo Park from Moojin Group.

500
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,241
Why is a corporate heir
taking the civil service exam?

501
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,066
How could you lie to me like that?

502
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,635
Sorry.

503
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,737
It was too complicated to explain.

504
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,675
I knew, ever since you made me spend
five million won on a mirror.

505
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,877
Hey, that was so long ago.

506
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,046
I was pissed when I broke that mirror.

507
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,083
It should be quite expensive,
since a Japanese artisan made it.

508
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,386
It isn't that expensive.

509
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:24,822
Less than a hundred thousand won?

510
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,025
It isn't really close to that, either.

511
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,560
Was it made by a Japanese artisan?

512
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:32,964
Dongdaemun market.

513
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,367
You con artist! You liar!

514
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:37,802
Just kill me, why don't you?

515
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,103
I'll grant you your wish.

516
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:41,739
Hey.

517
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,040
Gosh.

518
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:48,479
Sorry.

519
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,582
I was really desperate back then.

520
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,286
I did anything and everything for money.

521
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,989
I was the opposite.

522
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,825
I did anything to spend money.

523
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:03,628
What about now?

524
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,096
Will it make you money

525
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,898
digging into your old boss?

526
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,067
-No.
-Then why are you doing it?

527
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,004
You should just tour eateries
with the corporate heir.

528
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,605
Because I have to.

529
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,011
I owe Ms. Seo a lot.

530
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:45,970
It's been a while.

531
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,807
If you're here,

532
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,343
I guess that means Ms. Seo knows too.

533
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:54,912
Tak.

534
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:02,787
What are you doing?

535
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,488
And what are you doing with Gun-woo?

536
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:06,557
Did he seduce you?

537
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,594
To become a billionaire's girlfriend
and screw over Ms. Seo?

538
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,796
Choose your words carefully.
Don't regret it later.

539
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,099
I already regret it.

540
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,302
When you stole the document,

541
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,472
I should've smacked some sense into you.

542
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,608
I was too weak to do that.

543
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:28,246
You laugh?

544
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:33,184
I just thought it wouldn't hurt
even if you hit me.

545
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,054
How are Ms. Kim and Mr. Jo?

546
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:38,956
Are they doing well?

547
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,360
And Ms. Seo, too?

548
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,165
You're still angry.

549
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,201
Angry?

550
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,237
Forget it.

551
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,007
Tak.

552
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:57,975
What?

553
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,611
I'm not fooling around with him.

554
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,016
He's worried a lot about Ms. Seo too.

555
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,585
So am I.

556
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,490
We're just trying to stop her
from going too far...

557
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,793
to where she can't turn back.

558
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,195
Bullshit. I'm not stupid.

559
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,399
Gun-woo wants to reclaim what he lost,

560
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,502
and you're jealous
because you can't be like Ms. Seo.

561
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,937
I'll give you that.

562
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,674
It can appear that way.

563
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,610
I can't explain every little thing

564
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,812
to prove that isn't how I really feel,

565
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,049
so you can think what you want.

566
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,486
I...

567
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,389
like

568
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,258
you.

569
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:53,731
You knew,

570
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,366
but you ignored it.

571
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,969
It's up to me to like you,

572
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,673
and up to you to ignore it,

573
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,875
so that doesn't matter.

574
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:09,814
You may have left like that,

575
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,252
but I don't want to hate you.

576
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:18,789
I still feel the same.

577
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:21,992
-Tak.
-But...

578
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,197
if you get in Ms. Seo's way

579
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:27,865
and cause trouble,

580
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,404
I'm on her side all the way.

581
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:36,774
Just know that.

582
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:41,779
I know.

583
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,749
And I'm glad.

584
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,284
I mean it.

585
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,593
Se-jin is working with Gun-woo?

586
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:56,761
Why?

587
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,229
Don't tell me...

588
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,298
Is she trying to stop Ms. Seo?

589
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,800
Is that it?

590
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,202
Good work.

591
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,608
Tell me more.

592
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,209
Tak.

593
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,672
I'll go straight to the gathering.

594
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:15,673
I'm sorry.

595
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,642
It's my aunt's birthday,

596
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,345
so we're going shopping
and then to dinner.

597
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,314
I can't...

598
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,615
There's nothing to do anyway.

599
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,485
Do you want to freeze to death? Bundle up.

600
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:30,020
No. The kids say I look like a bear
when I wear that.

601
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,122
-Hey, bears are cute.
-It sounds like a happy family.

602
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:33,090
Take that off.

603
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,193
I'm sorry.

604
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,862
I envy you, that's why.

605
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,396
I'll text you afterward.

606
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,632
Don't worry. It'll go well.

607
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,668
Wish her a happy birthday.

608
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,741
You're driving me crazy.

609
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,809
What?

610
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:53,978
Let's go.

611
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,788
See? It falls apart on its own.

612
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,058
There's no need
to pull the trigger myself.

613
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,763
Anyway, they were digging up the ground.

614
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,865
I thought they were farming.

615
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,168
I'm sorry.

616
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,771
If no one comes to the birthday party,

617
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,307
it would be traumatic for the child.

618
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,844
At least an uninvited friend came.
That helps.

619
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,113
But I don't think we can eat here.

620
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:06,016
The room is too big
for just the two of us.

621
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,518
Why didn't you call Se-jin?

622
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,889
She's just immature, sure.

623
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,625
But you shouldn't be like this.

624
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:22,967
Not at all.

625
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:26,136
Se-jin wants to prove it in her own way

626
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,706
that if you keep racing down this path,

627
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,408
you'll fall over a cliff.

628
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:32,610
She's a smart kid.

629
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:37,948
Her life would've changed
if she could've overcome herself.

630
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,150
She was afraid she'd turn into you.

631
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,921
She said she wanted to be like me
not long ago.

632
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:46,256
That was before she knew the real you.

633
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,025
Be good to her.

634
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,361
It'll get harder from now on.

635
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:54,031
It's partly your fault she lost her way.

636
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,033
You made her do it.

637
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,769
No need to thank me.

638
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:05,209
If everyone had come,
it would've been quite threatening.

639
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,013
It's too soon to relax.

640
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,883
Se-jin and I will keep going.

641
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,525
Gun-woo.

642
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,662
You should realize by now

643
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,133
the reason you can't win this fight.

644
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,072
You're nothing without the label

645
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,843
of being the son of the chairman
of Moojin Group.

646
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,182
You tried to use the consent form
to gain management rights, but failed.

647
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,053
You meet your father's followers
and appeal to their sympathy.

648
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,122
You've relied on what your father has.

649
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,160
You've done nothing on your own.

650
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:58,629
Yi-kyung.

651
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,468
I'm not like you.

652
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,605
I've been on my own
and started with what was mine.

653
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,909
I fought to the death from the start.

654
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,143
What about you?

655
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,513
You grew up behind
your father's shadow, pampered.

656
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,450
Now, you act righteous and just.

657
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,286
Gun-woo.

658
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:25,923
You just talk big. That is all.

659
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:30,427
This time, it hurts.

660
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,163
Don't use Se-jin for your greed.

661
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,463
Don't use Se-jin for your greed.

662
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:08,198
You're

663
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:09,700
nothing without the label

664
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:14,505
of being the son of the chairman
of Moojin Group.

665
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:18,709
You tried to use the consent form
to gain management rights, but failed.

666
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:22,412
You meet your father's followers
and appeal to their sympathy.

667
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,784
You've relied on what your father has.

668
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,621
You've done nothing on your own.

669
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,017
SE-JIN

670
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,725
POWER OFF

671
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,501
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

672
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,339
Moojin Tech Sold to a Foreign Corporation

673
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,821
BAEKSONG FOUNDATION OPERATIONS

674
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,399
I heard from Ma-ri

675
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,635
that Chunha Financing

676
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,071
pretty much created
TJ Cultural Foundation.

677
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,340
Why do you care?

678
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:59,776
May I see its formation documents?

679
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:00,844
What?

680
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:04,414
Baeksong Foundation was investigated
for corruption.

681
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:08,785
I wonder how you prepared for that
with the new foundation.

682
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,455
Hey, I guess you came to the wrong place.

683
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,624
This is Chunha Financing.

684
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,693
We're getting along well with Yi-kyung.

685
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:21,164
What's with that look?

686
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,668
I could tell while I was at Gallery S.

687
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,437
Both you and Chairman Son

688
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,473
are very bitter at Ms. Seo.

689
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,042
You were forced to help
with the foundation.

690
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,478
You are a bold one.

691
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,913
I'll keep the source a secret.

692
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,081
Please show me the documents

693
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:39,917
on TJ Foundation.

694
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,721
I will never

695
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:48,458
let you or the chairman be harmed.

696
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,297
Go back for now.

697
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,532
I'll think it over and call you.

698
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,260
What are you doing?

699
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:26,363
I want to move somewhere else.

700
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:30,233
I thought about it,
and this building belongs to Chunha.

701
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:33,236
It's weird planning to break them
in their building.

702
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:35,572
It's okay. Ma-ri's father said he'd help.

703
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:41,144
I think we can get the documents
on TJ Foundation.

704
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:42,446
He said he'd think it over.

705
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,686
There was nothing you could do
about the Moojin Tech sale.

706
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,189
Some things are just impossible.

707
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:55,892
Let's dig into the foundation now.

708
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,761
Someone who does bad things once

709
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,796
is bound to do the same thing
over and over.

710
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,102
I'll take care of it.

711
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:09,873
What do you mean?

712
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:13,243
Leave it to me, and take a step back.

713
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:15,979
Aren't we a team?

714
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,015
We're partners.

715
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:19,883
We are.

716
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,554
But I'm saying let's take a breath.

717
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,390
I won't give up.

718
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:28,625
Se-jin.

719
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,761
I won't take a step back,

720
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,829
and I won't take a breath.

721
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:38,468
I was determined not to give up
when I turned my back on Ms. Seo

722
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,804
and gave you the document I stole.

723
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,641
So let's fight together.

724
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:48,678
Eventually, we will win on more days
than we lose.

725
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,794
Thursday at 6 p.m. at Garnier.

726
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,679
We're meeting on Thursday at 6 p.m.
at Garnier.

727
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,930
It's been four years.

728
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,433
Look here, Nam.

729
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:18,401
Yes, sir.

730
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,405
Once the new foundation is stable

731
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:27,277
and the next presidential candidate
has been selected...

732
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:29,546
Yes?

733
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,214
I should

734
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:34,751
discard her, right?

735
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,287
You have other plans?

736
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,723
Aren't you going
to the inauguration ceremony?

737
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,292
I don't feel like being
with sickening people and faking a smile.

738
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:44,794
Tae-joon Jang.

739
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:48,165
Let him enjoy this day.

740
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,837
At the Grand Ballroom at Hwayoung Hotel,

741
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:56,840
TJ Cultural Foundation will hold
its inauguration ceremony,

742
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,875
wherein it will inaugurate Gi-sun Heo,

743
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,677
the previous president
of Baeksong University.

744
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:03,947
TJ Foundation was established
and registered this month.

745
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,684
It will train manpower for various
businesses that will become diversified,

746
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:11,421
and will create networks
in various fields.

747
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,481
You seem disappointed
that I'm here instead.

748
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:43,486
How

749
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:45,255
have you been?

750
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:47,190
I've been okay.

751
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,492
Sit down.

752
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,331
Gi-tae Son is not coming.

753
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,836
I thought you'd come with Gun-woo.

754
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,106
He had somewhere else to be.

755
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,399
I saw the news
about the foundation's inauguration.

756
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,368
You must've been busy.

757
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,836
You were the busy one,

758
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,138
looking for my weakness.

759
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,375
It isn't going as well as expected.

760
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,578
You are smart, Se-jin.

761
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,446
And diligent.

762
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,315
Keep trying.

763
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:48,318
You are too thorough for me.

764
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:50,654
See? I failed again today.

765
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:56,092
Oh, you wanted documents
on the foundation, right?

766
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,630
CASHIER'S CHECK
ONE BILLION WON

767
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:34,631
It's yours.

768
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,301
You can keep it.

769
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:41,971
No, I...

770
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:46,142
Why are you giving me this much...

771
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,045
Severance, allowance,

772
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,081
or a windfall.

773
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,583
Call it whatever you want.

774
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,919
There are no conditions and no provisos.

775
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,254
Just take it.

776
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,023
It's your money.

777
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,563
CASHIER'S CHECK
ONE BILLION WON

778
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,609
I understand what you mean.

779
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,613
Whether or not I accept this,

780
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,783
you already got what you wanted.

781
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,552
If I take it,

782
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,455
I'll stop what I've been doing.

783
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:37,560
Looking for your weakness
wouldn't be justifiable.

784
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,029
I'd be bought, pretty much.

785
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:49,639
If I don't take it,

786
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,575
I'll regret it forever.

787
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,813
Every time I need money or hit hard times,

788
00:56:57,981 --> 00:56:59,649
I'll wish I took the money

789
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,684
and wonder if I should ask for it again

790
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:03,920
and have all sorts of pathetic thoughts.

791
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:09,092
You still write essays in response
to a math question.

792
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,461
It isn't a difficult calculation.

793
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,530
It's like a right or wrong quiz.

794
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,099
Take the check.

795
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,334
Don't take the check.

796
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,172
If it's too hard to decide,
shall I set a time limit?

797
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:23,606
How's ten seconds?

798
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:25,875
Decide within that time.

799
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,446
The offer will be withdrawn afterward.

800
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:33,316
Ten.

801
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,219
Nine.

802
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:39,189
Eight.

803
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:42,492
Seven.

804
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,694
Six.

805
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,197
Five.

806
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,299
Four.

807
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,302
Three.

808
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,707
Two.

809
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,959
CASHIER'S CHECK
ONE BILLION WON

810
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,729
That looks like a new game. It looks fun.

811
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:25,235
Se-jin, may I play too?

812
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,271
We're just getting started.

813
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,940
Everyone I like is here.

814
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:33,910
Welcome.

815
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:16,519
The people you're working with
will betray you.

816
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,388
Luckily, I trust no one.

817
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:21,391
I'll do whatever it takes
to get back what's yours.

818
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:24,527
Do you think Yi-kyung is involved?

819
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:26,329
I'll keep Yi-kyung in check.

820
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,599
You want to have the Park family
join together and protect the group?

821
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:30,500
Please help me.

822
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,169
You're confident you won't lose
what you have.

823
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,505
I know you're anxious because of Yi-kyung.

824
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:37,307
Don't struggle so much alone.

825
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,579
