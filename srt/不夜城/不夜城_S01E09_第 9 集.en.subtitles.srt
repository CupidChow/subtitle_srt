EPISODE 9

2
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,586
Are you up already?

3
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,757
Did you not sleep at all?

4
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,827
You have a busy day today.

5
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,361
You should sleep a little.

6
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,498
The documents on the new foundation
are there. Sort them.

7
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:54,214
When I was in high school, a kid
in my class was top 0.3% in the nation,

8
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,249
and she was just like you.

9
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,853
She was on study mode
whenever she wasn't sleeping or eating.

10
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,922
Eventually, she cut down on sleep time
and studied while eating.

11
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:05,658
Guess what happened to her.

12
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,862
She was hospitalized
on the day of the college entrance exam.

13
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,665
I'm not trying to jinx you.

14
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,001
I just want you
to consider your health, too.

15
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,040
-Any update on Gun-woo?
-We texted a few times about the earring.

16
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,408
There's been nothing since.

17
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,680
I dropped it in the car on purpose,

18
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,782
since I'll need an excuse
to see him again.

19
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,023
Don't worry.

20
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,026
I'm sure he'll call.

21
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,396
This is the most important time.

22
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,031
Don't miss a thing.

23
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,666
I won't miss anything.

24
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,539
That girl who was hospitalized

25
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,708
went to an ivy league the following year.

26
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,610
I'll become a villain.

27
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,681
I'll climb to the top

28
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,450
and look down on the world.

29
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,354
So that I won't be framed again

30
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,557
or be anyone's prey.

31
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,366
Hi. You're here.

32
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,268
You're early.

33
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,271
I'm here to see Mr. Jang.
I can't be even a second late.

34
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,307
Wow. I haven't been here in a while.

35
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,910
Before he and Moo-il severed ties,

36
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,813
we'd come by time to time
and talk about life and stuff.

37
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,622
Gosh.

38
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,425
You like tea, don't you?

39
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,529
They say this is
Secretary Jin-tao Hu's favorite tea.

40
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,566
Thank you.

41
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,743
It's been about seven
or eight years, right?

42
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,080
I have always been waiting
for you to call me.

43
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,784
It is all thanks to Yi-kyung.

44
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,788
She said if I want to do something great,
it must be you.

45
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,825
She was too stubborn.

46
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,862
She is very talented.

47
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,597
So,

48
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,933
what do you plan to do now?

49
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,368
Pardon?

50
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,605
What do you mean?

51
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,573
Will you stab me in the back

52
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,575
as you did

53
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,078
to Moo-il?

54
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,614
What? Sir...

55
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,082
I...

56
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,686
You even betrayed your own family.

57
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,121
You will probably do
the same thing to me too.

58
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,760
That concerns me about you.

59
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,998
What do you think?

60
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:36,235
A relationship in which each side's goals
are clear is not severed easily.

61
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,773
Mr. Park will fulfill his duties
that you need him to perform.

62
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,411
Of course. Without a doubt.

63
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,785
She must have made

64
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,822
several plans for you.

65
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,658
You two can handle the details.

66
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,193
And whenever you need my help,

67
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,196
don't hesitate to ask.

68
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,500
Thank you so much for offering such thing.

69
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,535
Thank you, sir.

70
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,283
He blabbed everything to Gun-woo,
but look at him play dumb.

71
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,153
What an old cunning bastard.

72
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,721
It's not like he made it up.

73
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:29,956
Ms. Seo.

74
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,557
Let's clear away the past.

75
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,292
We have much to do.

76
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,430
Are you sure you can remove Moo-il?

77
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,731
I suppose...

78
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,768
there's a quite old document
in Moojin Group.

79
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,149
Tak!

80
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,122
Hey!

81
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,724
If you came, you should go in. Don't run.

82
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,959
Let go. You'll warp the door.

83
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,060
Let it warp.

84
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,762
-I won't let go.
-Se-jin.

85
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:10,797
Yes, that's my name.

86
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,100
Let's go in. Hurry. I'll freeze to death.

87
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,680
Seriously.

88
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,620
I brought home the runaway child!

89
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,255
Hi!

90
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,358
Welcome back.
I thought it was time for you to return.

91
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,827
You made me wait for so long.

92
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,829
I just dropped in while passing by.

93
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,133
Sure. Drop in every day
and do some work too.

94
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,067
Okay?

95
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,002
Do you know how worried she was about you?

96
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,738
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

97
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,475
How about some hot tea?

98
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,109
-Sounds good. I'll brew it.
-Okay.

99
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,511
Where's...

100
00:07:58,945 --> 00:07:59,946
She went out.

101
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,047
She should be back now.

102
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,415
There she is.

103
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,386
Hello.

104
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,722
Take Se-jin to Chunha Financing.

105
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,458
Stop by the Yeoksam office
and pick up some documents.

106
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,093
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,161
Bring me some tea.

108
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,662
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,983
Meet with the punks
who opposed the new city project

110
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,818
and work on them one by one.

111
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,355
Even if they are Tae-joon's people,

112
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,825
no one can resist money in their face.

113
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,861
Finish your breathing exercises.

114
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,896
What? Oh.

115
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,536
About Uncle...

116
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,073
Do you still suspect him?

117
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,677
That was Tae-joon messing with you.

118
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,481
Don't waste your energy

119
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,984
and focus on the new city project.

120
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,789
Uncle

121
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,991
met with Mr. Jang,

122
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,126
along with Yi-kyung Seo.

123
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:59,131
The head driver for Moojin Produce
is actually one of our people.

124
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,802
He said the three of them met
in Seongbuk today.

125
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,638
It's obvious what they discussed.

126
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,240
"I'll be the new chairman.
I'll back you up."

127
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,476
It must have been pleasant.

128
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,777
What are you talking about?

129
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:12,745
Uncle...

130
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,847
has been after the chairman's seat,

131
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,916
since the day you were arrested.

132
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:19,952
Come in here!

133
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,255
-Yes, sir.
-Tell Moo-sam to come right this instant.

134
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,557
Yes, sir.

135
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,193
Wait. But

136
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,496
why would Bong-soo's daughter
work with Tae-joon?

137
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,966
She couldn't do that, considering her dad.

138
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,176
They look good.

139
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,078
I'll report it to Ms. Seo.

140
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:50,116
She wants to move as quickly as possible
to establish the foundation as well.

141
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,652
You've grown.

142
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,722
You were on your knees, begging and crying
at the hospital.

143
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,391
You're a big shot now, aren't you?

144
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,127
Thank you.

145
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,330
Mr. Jang will be calling you soon.

146
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,298
It is supposed to be good news.

147
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,189
Hello?

148
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,325
Okay. That's good.

149
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,061
Okay.

150
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,066
You'll have to go to Yeoksam without me.

151
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,702
I need to meet with someone.

152
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,004
Drop me off on the way.

153
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,273
Okay.

154
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,421
Gun-woo Park?

155
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,491
Yes.

156
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,859
When will that project end?

157
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,228
I don't know.

158
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,064
It will end when Ms. Seo says I can stop.

159
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,034
Do it right.

160
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,039
Since you're doing it anyway,
make sure he falls for it.

161
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,451
Didn't you want to see me
about my earring?

162
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,619
Earring?

163
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,723
Oh. That's in my office.
I forgot to bring it.

164
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,693
I'll save it as an excuse to meet again.

165
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,162
Then why...

166
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,798
Did you hear anything else since?

167
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,901
Either about Mr. Jang or my company.

168
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,871
Not particularly.

169
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,074
-Hear what?
-When did Moo-sam Park

170
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,777
come to the gallery? Does he come often?

171
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:58,844
Hold on.

172
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,213
Am I arrested?

173
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,650
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

174
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,185
Let's say you're a witness.

175
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,623
Whatever it is, I don't have
anything worth mentioning.

176
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,193
Last time, I thought you really
need to know.

177
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,294
That's why I went to you.

178
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,562
I appreciate that.

179
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,698
I'm asking something I need to know again.

180
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,737
I am not your spy.

181
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,973
I have no intention of telling
on Ms. Seo, either.

182
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,643
Rather than a deal,

183
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,245
what about a favor?

184
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,622
If you'd help me,
we can end this fight soon.

185
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,158
You may call me a hypocrite,

186
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,162
but I don't want to see Yi-kyung get hurt.

187
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,431
I don't have that power.

188
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,500
Maybe not,
but we have something in common.

189
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:57,970
Both 12 years ago

190
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,405
and now,

191
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,809
you and I are the only people
to whom she showed

192
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:04,743
her true emotions.

193
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,881
And you and I

194
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,383
worry only about one person.

195
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:14,687
He's anxious.

196
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:19,592
He must've noticed that Moo-sam Park
has started to take action.

197
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,095
So, what did you tell him?

198
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,663
That I'd think it over.

199
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:26,799
Indeed you should.

200
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,170
It will be suspicious
if you accept it right away.

201
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,141
Leak information to him that are safe
to leak. Mr. Jo will let you know what.

202
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,078
Gun-woo

203
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,448
seems convinced...

204
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,155
that he is trying

205
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,791
to end this fight for you.

206
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,099
Se-jin. What did you do?

207
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,368
-Sorry?
-Did you go on a date?

208
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,104
Or did you meet with him
to hear him preach to you?

209
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,539
-Ms. Seo--
-Get your act together.

210
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,775
That isn't what I meant.

211
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,644
I don't have time
to settle your feelings for you.

212
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,479
If you're going to waver,

213
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,180
just quit now.

214
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:22,788
You may go.

215
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,374
Moojin Produce just sent this.

216
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,843
BUSINESS CONSENT FORM
FOR RECOVERING FROM IMF CRISIS

217
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,781
I suppose there's a quite old document
in Moojin Group.

218
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,918
Hey. You okay?

219
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,289
Lower your standards.

220
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,726
If you try to follow Ms. Seo's pace,
you'll fail early in the race.

221
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,595
I'm angry.

222
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,932
What can you do? You have to keep it in.

223
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,971
If I had met Ms. Seo sooner,

224
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,473
I'd be much stronger by now.

225
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:16,742
I'm still too weak.

226
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,878
You're right.

227
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,215
I should do it right,
since I'm doing it anyway.

228
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,297
Calm down. Think of your blood pressure.

229
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,899
You worthless scumbag.

230
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,703
How dare you try to take over the company?

231
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,741
I can't just work for you all my life.

232
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,275
-What?
-That's enough. Please go.

233
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,411
I know what your father's thinking.

234
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,279
If Moo-yi were alive,

235
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,315
he would've made him chairman,
then skipped me

236
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,649
and given it to you.

237
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,386
Is that why you crawled over to Tae-joon?

238
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,021
So that he can make you a chairman?

239
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,090
If I don't do something,
I'd be out in the cold.

240
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,525
Shut your mouth you...

241
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,027
Father.

242
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,495
Okay, so please go.

243
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,398
As long as I'm alive,

244
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,033
there is no way

245
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,802
you'd get the company,
even if Tae-joon has your back.

246
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,373
I have my ways.

247
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,742
Did you forget already?

248
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,779
The consent form we signed
during the IMF crisis.

249
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,283
When we were freaking out
about reorganization and getting funding,

250
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,419
we tried anything and everything
to save the company

251
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,488
and signed a consent form
regarding business management.

252
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,460
I signed without really thinking,
and had forgotten all about it,

253
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,231
but I get to use it 20 years later.

254
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,739
Moo-sam Park owns a third.

255
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,941
Company stock, of course,

256
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,477
and he can also claim the right
to manage the business.

257
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,679
The deceased brother's shares

258
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,049
would be split between them.

259
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,019
Even if we add Mr. Jang's
and my shares in Moojin,

260
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,488
it'll be too close.

261
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,324
But if we announce this consent form
at the shareholders meeting,

262
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,359
we have a very good chance.

263
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,663
The chairman who is old
and is on sick bail.

264
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,266
The younger brother who has the support
of the most powerful figure.

265
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,237
Whose side would the shareholders take?

266
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,806
How did you find such an old document?

267
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,708
When it comes to Moojin Group,

268
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,711
I know down to the number of tiles
in their building.

269
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:34,780
Because

270
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,483
they were all supposed to be mine.

271
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,288
Whether at the shareholders meeting

272
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,591
or in court,

273
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,361
the consent form will cause a problem.

274
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,097
Don't speak.
I told you, you need to sleep.

275
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,234
Where did he find

276
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,803
that old document?

277
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,076
Gun-woo.

278
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,478
You're talking again.

279
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,113
Moo-sam

280
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,616
admitted it proudly

281
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,485
that he sold me out.

282
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,225
That punk

283
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,995
shouldn't be the chairman.

284
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,131
A punk who sells out his own blood

285
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,867
doesn't deserve to own Moojin.

286
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:30,636
That won't happen.

287
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,271
Rest assured, and sleep.

288
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,139
Okay.

289
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,308
It shouldn't happen.

290
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,684
What did you just say?

291
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,854
I had a blow-out with my brother
and I told him

292
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,823
that I have the consent form,
so he can try to take me on, if he wants.

293
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,826
We were going to disclose it
during the shareholders meeting anyway.

294
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,862
We should fight head-on.

295
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:57,996
Goodbye.

296
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:16,949
Yes, Ms. Seo.

297
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,183
Where are you?

298
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,518
I am on my way home.

299
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:20,886
Come in right away.

300
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,454
Call Tak, too.

301
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:23,922
Yes, ma'am.

302
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,380
I'll check A-3.

303
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:53,819
A-3 Clear.

304
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,845
The Auditing Team doesn't have a copy.

305
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:20,879
Not a single one?

306
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,181
They said the chairman ordered them

307
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,785
to destroy all the documents
on Moo-sam Park's rebates.

308
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,290
Did you not find it either?

309
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,693
They cleaned out my office
and yours completely.

310
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,530
Who knew we had a thief
in the Park family?

311
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,865
I will look for another weakness

312
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,067
other than the rebate matter.

313
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,171
You give up too quickly.

314
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,141
We're not done.

315
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:53,612
My brother is very protective
of his little brother.

316
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,982
He said he refused to see me
behind bars as well,

317
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,684
and got rid of the rebate documents.

318
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:00,819
He must regret it now.

319
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:05,090
Did you clean out Gun-woo's office, too?

320
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,626
We obtained the documents
and destroyed them.

321
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,165
Thanks to you, my year has turned around.

322
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,903
I'm not interested in your morality.

323
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,840
Whether you sell out your brother
to avoid being investigated yourself

324
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,643
or how much of the company's funds
you have embezzled.

325
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,479
They have nothing to do with me.

326
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:28,980
However,

327
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,550
I do not like it

328
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,285
if you hinder my plan.

329
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,488
Don't get so mad just because
I made one little mistake.

330
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,157
Do you want the chairman's office
at Moojin Group?

331
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,460
Then don't do anything

332
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,395
without my consent.

333
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,298
You must hide everything out there

334
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,735
and not hide a single thing from me.

335
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,404
If you cannot keep that promise,

336
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,840
our collaboration ends

337
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,341
right then and there.

338
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,646
I'll say that right back to you.

339
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,116
Don't try to trick me.

340
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,818
I need to become chairman

341
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,588
for you and Mr. Jang to benefit from me.

342
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,492
Mr. Jo will see you out.

343
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,164
I'll see you in my office from now on.

344
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,000
We have no reason to worry
about Gun-woo or anyone watching.

345
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,105
Also, change your driver.

346
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:29,174
What?

347
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,276
Why should I change my driver?

348
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,879
Why, do you suspect something?

349
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,249
You must be extra cautious
during these sensitive times.

350
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:39,785
Sure.

351
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,495
Where's Se-jin?

352
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,798
I heard the brothers signed a consent

353
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,267
during the IMF crisis
about business management,

354
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,937
and that with that,
he can take the chairman seat.

355
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,908
What?

356
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,843
Is that not very helpful?

357
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,579
No, it was very helpful.

358
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,016
That's right.

359
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,619
I remembered today.

360
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,557
-It's cheap, so you can throw it out.
-Then I'll throw it out.

361
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,263
Did you think a lot about it?

362
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,300
I'm curious if you thought it through

363
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,136
when you asked to see me urgently today.

364
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,641
I respect

365
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,510
Ms. Seo.

366
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,279
I don't want to see her getting hurt.

367
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,582
That means the fight

368
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,117
needs to end soon, as you said.

369
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,254
Thank you for understanding.

370
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,493
Just a minute.

371
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,128
Take the call.
I'm going to use the restroom.

372
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,337
Yes, Ms. Moon. Did you look into it?

373
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,565
Just as you said before,

374
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,635
I am still a cheap mirror,

375
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,038
but I want to reflect...

376
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,108
your true image,

377
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,377
at least a little.

378
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,682
I see why you're special to her.

379
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,918
You have a lot in common.

380
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,765
I'm sorry, but something urgent came up.
I keep doing this.

381
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,567
I know your company is going through
a crisis.

382
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,335
I need to get back too.

383
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,137
Let's grab dinner
once everything is resolved.

384
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:13,638
Is that okay?

385
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:16,708
See you.

386
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,454
Thank you.

387
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,497
VOICE RECORD 004

388
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:54,012
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

389
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,091
I'll forego the pleasantries.

390
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,094
Neither of us wants to talk long,

391
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,696
so let's be brief and get to the point.

392
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,800
Moo-sam Park's rebate documents.

393
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,202
You have a copy, don't you?

394
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,205
Give it to me.

395
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,873
I follow only Mr. Jang's orders.

396
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,442
Mr. Jang has forgotten all about you.

397
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,445
Yi-kyung Seo has taken your spot.

398
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,084
If it's Ms. Seo, I can rest assured.

399
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,020
She is very capable.

400
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,324
I don't care
whether a fired henchman is loyal

401
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,558
or betrays his master.

402
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,261
This has nothing to do with Mr. Jang.

403
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,098
I guess the family feud has begun.

404
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,168
-Right?
-You can read it in the papers.

405
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,104
Hand it over to me.

406
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,573
I don't know.

407
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,009
I've dealt with so many documents.

408
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,779
I can't remember if I have a copy.

409
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:07,852
I don't think I have it.

410
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,857
It's a shame.

411
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,760
I have another document, you see.

412
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,663
Jong-hyuk Nam.

413
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,867
Professor of Media at Moojin University
since 2005.

414
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,305
His brother, Jong-hyuk Nam.

415
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,543
Corruption behind his appointment,
plagiarism, embezzling research funds.

416
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:33,912
It's a triple crown.

417
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,048
Okay. That's enough evidence.

418
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,917
I'll go in now.

419
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,555
I guess he will threaten Mr. Nam

420
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,190
to get the rebate document.

421
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:47,625
How interesting.

422
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,861
Gun-woo Park.

423
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,630
It is an educational corporation
owned by Moojin Group.

424
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,967
But you will still go public
about a professor's corruption?

425
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,302
Is that what you mean?

426
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:00,739
Why would I worry about a corn on my foot
when I'm about to lose my body.

427
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:10,248
If you give me the rebate document,
I'll bury this.

428
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,485
This is a fight within the Park family.

429
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,954
You are not betraying Mr. Jang.

430
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:18,957
Mr. Nam,

431
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,625
give me the document

432
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,327
and save your brother.

433
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,534
Call Mr. Jang. Tell him I'm coming now.

434
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,103
Tell Moo-sam Park to come too.

435
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:33,505
Yes, ma'am.

436
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:35,573
Good job.

437
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:42,847
Okay.

438
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:45,884
I complimented you.

439
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,585
I wasn't scolding you.

440
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,422
I heard it as a compliment.

441
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,091
What's the problem?

442
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,093
What do you mean?

443
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,196
Conscience, morals, rationality.
Which one of them is bothering you?

444
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,365
Is it the recording

445
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,967
or is it that it's Gun-woo,
that it bothers you?

446
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:07,739
No.

447
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:09,941
Nothing is bothering me.

448
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:11,776
That's good.

449
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,547
Gun-woo is desperate
and doing anything it takes.

450
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,415
Don't be naive and stress out.

451
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,083
That's a waste of time.

452
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:21,686
Okay.

453
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,816
Call me at any time,

454
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,052
whether it's for company matters
or personal.

455
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,946
I heard you called the directors
during the day.

456
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,116
I told you, you need to rest.

457
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,219
The special shareholders meeting
that Moo-sam called

458
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,722
is coming up, right?

459
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,926
He's going around telling everyone

460
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,462
about the business consent form.

461
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,098
The directors say

462
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,935
it may be bad for us.

463
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,404
Their hobbies are worrying
and stressing out.

464
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:47,872
Don't take it to heart.

465
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,513
I betrayed my best friend

466
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,182
and made my little brother
die away from home.

467
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,585
I feel like I'm paying

468
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,888
for all my life's sins in one blow.

469
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,358
Stop talking like a weak person.

470
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,761
Don't worry about the meeting.

471
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,965
Uncle won't make it that far.

472
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,937
If you're still worried,
assign me somewhere else.

473
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,039
Moojin's educational corporation.

474
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,107
I need to become the chief director there.

475
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,723
Do you know what it means for him
to become the chief director there?

476
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,327
That corporation owns 5%
of Moojin Group's shares.

477
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,762
If Gun-woo becomes the chief director,

478
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,532
he'll use it all to keep Moo-il in power.

479
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,101
Even if I push with the consent form,

480
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,103
if we can't remove him from office, I...

481
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,005
We'll aim for
the next shareholders meeting

482
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,507
and gather more shares until then.

483
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,910
Do you think Moo-il and Gun-woo
will hibernate during that time?

484
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,511
They'll come on strong, too.

485
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,547
Mr. Park.

486
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,015
Ms. Seo.

487
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,617
I jumped in with two feet.

488
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,686
If I lose here, I'm finished.

489
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,855
But everything is a mess.

490
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,925
Mr. Jang, that old geezer.

491
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,460
He couldn't keep his man in check.

492
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,029
What am I supposed to do?

493
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:19,697
What's the predicted result?

494
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:22,467
As he said, it's not very optimistic.

495
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,135
That's what I'm saying.

496
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,171
If Gun-woo becomes chief director,
it'll be over for me.

497
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,907
You're the one who created this mess.

498
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,212
Don't order me to come and go.
It's quite annoying.

499
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,915
Look, I'm sorry, but it was an emergency.

500
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,917
I had no choice.

501
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,190
Gun-woo Park is not a variable,
but a constant.

502
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,160
He is an obstacle that is always there.

503
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,296
We can't look right at it
and trip over it.

504
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,367
Are you saying you have a good idea?

505
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,521
Did you come for a team meeting?

506
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,356
Any good plans came up?

507
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,159
-You look tired.
-I am tired.

508
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:25,363
I'm not built for working late,
but I made improvements, thanks to you.

509
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,265
Don't work too hard
on the shareholders meeting.

510
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:28,833
You'll lose anyway.

511
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,803
Whether it's people or methods,
I'll have to look hard.

512
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,871
Don't trust people too much either.

513
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,740
Money isn't so trustworthy, either.

514
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,943
That's right. We have freedom of religion
in this country.

515
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,278
Sorry.

516
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,580
Take good care of the chairman.

517
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,982
Being removed from office
will be traumatizing.

518
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,718
I'm looking for a branch office abroad
to send Uncle to.

519
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,555
Somewhere with no business
and no direct flights.

520
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,890
That will be where you'll be transferred,

521
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,525
so look for one with nice weather.

522
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,461
It's good to see you again.

523
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,430
Take a good look at the office
since you're here anyway,

524
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,532
since you'll never come back here again.

525
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,634
Go back to work. Bye.

526
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:12,877
Yes, Mr. Jang.

527
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,113
Thank you for your understanding.

528
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,899
I thought you went to Moojin Group.

529
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,135
How does it look?

530
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,105
I don't know much.

531
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,374
The artist is underappreciated.

532
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:45,543
In one to two years,

533
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,412
everyone will be after him.

534
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,116
You're the same.

535
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,751
Even if it weren't me,

536
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,254
you would've found an opportunity someday.

537
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,091
I may have been the lucky one.

538
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,565
That's obviously not true.

539
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,902
I was the lucky one and you were the one
who gave me the opportunity.

540
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:14,539
Don't get me wrong.

541
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,307
Gun-woo and I

542
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,010
aren't what you're thinking.

543
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,679
Misery loves company.

544
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,583
It's like people suffering from the same
illness feeling a connection.

545
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,352
Gun-woo and I

546
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,488
worry only about one person.

547
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,390
That's a good approach.

548
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,926
This isn't about work.

549
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,862
What else would we talk about,
if not work?

550
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,031
The weather? Hobbies?

551
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,566
Shopping?

552
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:51,742
How's this?

553
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:54,745
I don't know.

554
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,682
I don't know you, either.

555
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,019
Then I should teach you.

556
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,755
Do you remember what I said
when you started?

557
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,326
I said to become absolutely necessary
to Gun-woo.

558
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:15,299
You'll get that chance soon.

559
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,869
He will need your comforting desperately.

560
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,907
Don't miss that opportunity.

561
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,254
Mr. Park.

562
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,090
We found the Daejin Construction matter.

563
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,696
If you look at the shares here...

564
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:19,864
It's as you can see.

565
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,366
The most shares Moo-sam Park may obtain

566
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,768
is 43%.

567
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,237
Gun-woo Park's side...

568
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,339
We are leaving now.

569
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,611
I got to come back thanks to you.

570
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,547
I regretted it as soon as I left.

571
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,249
Did you see those girls from my job?

572
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,484
Weren't they cute?

573
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,521
Professor Nam at Moojin University's
media department,

574
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,925
is being investigated for corruption,
plagiarism, embezzlement,

575
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,860
as well as other charges.

576
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,163
Professor Nam was the youngest
professor...

577
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,932
You should cut off a tangled knot.

578
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,503
You seemed confused about your brother's
matter, so I gave you a helping hand.

579
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:35,873
Did Mr. Jang

580
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,609
agree with that decision?

581
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:42,480
His objective is
to make Moo-sam Park chairman.

582
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,482
You mean, it's what you want.

583
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,952
Don't worry about your brother anymore,
and wait patiently.

584
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:52,189
As soon as we find an adequate fall guy,
you'll be released.

585
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:58,295
Mr. Jang is the only person
for you to return to, anyway.

586
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,099
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

587
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,507
He refuses to see you.

588
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,343
He asked you never to come back.

589
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,229
Hello, ma'am.

590
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,199
-Where are you?
-I'm about to go home.

591
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,300
It's time.

592
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,503
The moment you become a person
Gun-woo needs.

593
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:48,639
Hello?

594
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,616
Is your friend still at the hospital?

595
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,685
Yes. I was leaving, but thought maybe...

596
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,788
Thank goodness I didn't throw it out.

597
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,290
It isn't cheap at all.

598
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,795
I don't have anything in particular to
discuss, but may I take some of your time?

599
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:13,898
Have you had dinner yet?

600
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,074
You don't like it?

601
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,344
I wanted to buy you something nicer.

602
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,181
I guess you don't like cheap food.

603
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,684
-I see.
-What? No.

604
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,061
I ate so much kimbap and tteokbokki

605
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,764
when I did part time jobs,
that just looking at them made me sick.

606
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,867
But I see them now
and they actually look good.

607
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,038
Did Yi-kyung discover you
at your part time job?

608
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,509
Something like that.

609
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,247
It's hard to get her attention.

610
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:06,116
Gun-woo.

611
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,818
Aren't we strange?

612
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,422
All we talk about is Ms. Seo.

613
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,691
Her past and what she's doing now.

614
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:16,727
You're right.

615
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,196
Let's talk about something else today.

616
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:23,767
I hear you're busy preparing

617
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,703
for a shareholders meeting.

618
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,172
No. No work talk.

619
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,306
Right...

620
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:46,323
I'm Yi-kyung Seo of Gallery S.

621
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,593
Does Bong-soo know

622
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,997
that you became Tae-joon's lackey?

623
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,633
I'm sure he doesn't.

624
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,104
He would've flown right over
and caused a scene.

625
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,541
Of all the people to get help from,

626
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,978
how could you join forces with him?

627
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:09,780
Once the shareholders meeting is held,

628
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,549
you will be forced to step down.

629
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:14,551
Not a chance.

630
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,388
That stupid consent form?

631
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,556
Keep trying with that.

632
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,558
I won't back down easily.

633
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,561
If I can't do it,
Gun-woo will fight for me.

634
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,731
If he has
the educational corporation's share,

635
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:29,466
he'll last a little longer.

636
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:33,037
You may survive
the special shareholders meeting,

637
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,706
but it'll be different at
the annual shareholders meeting.

638
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,177
The result has already been decided.
You'll just be dragging it out.

639
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,180
Forget assigning Gun-woo Park

640
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:45,916
chief director, sir.

641
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:49,620
Moo-sam, that punk can never
be a chairman.

642
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,389
He's corrupted to the core.

643
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,458
Gun-woo Park is the same.

644
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,001
This?

645
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,970
Moo-sam faked all of this.

646
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,173
Gun-woo did nothing wrong.

647
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,842
Will people believe his innocence?

648
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,580
His own father removed him from his post
and left him without an appointment.

649
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:20,951
Truth doesn't matter.

650
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,855
What matters is what the people believe.

651
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:28,759
Aren't you curious

652
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,662
as to who it was

653
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:33,797
that produced this show?

654
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,169
You came here

655
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,540
to get revenge for your dad, didn't you?

656
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:47,144
Revenge.

657
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:50,314
How stale.

658
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:54,351
Gun-woo and I

659
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,088
knew each other in Japan.

660
00:45:59,056 --> 00:45:59,990
What?

661
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,593
What? You and Gun-woo

662
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,995
knew each other?

663
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,097
We didn't just know each other.

664
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,968
We even considered running away together

665
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:13,570
from our fathers.

666
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,975
He almost died because of me.

667
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:33,824
Eventually,

668
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:35,993
we broke up.

669
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:40,197
The bad blood

670
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,267
between my father and you people

671
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,236
pushed us into this mess.

672
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,339
Because

673
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:51,942
of that greed and betrayal.

674
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:52,876
Look.

675
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,046
About what happened to Bong-soo--

676
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,548
A respectable business man?

677
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,384
A father who cares
especially a lot for his son.

678
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:03,487
Look at who you really are.

679
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,790
You betrayed your friend
because of your greed.

680
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,226
You are vile and atrocious.

681
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,564
You are just struggling
not to lose what you have.

682
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,669
Gun-woo is a victim.

683
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:21,238
Don't let there be another victim

684
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,007
because of your greed.

685
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:26,643
Remove your son

686
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,079
from this fight.

687
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,603
Sir, sir!

688
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,639
Nurse! Nurse, hurry!

689
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,351
If I add up the cost of all the guitars
my dad smashed,

690
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,219
I'd be a millionaire.

691
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,588
But you somehow escaped to Japan.

692
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,891
I just got on the next available flight

693
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,392
in case they'd come after me.

694
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:18,295
It would've been more interesting
if you had gone to Africa.

695
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:20,530
It must've been fate

696
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,799
to meet Ms. Seo.

697
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:27,204
I saw the CD in her room.

698
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,806
You played for her a lot back then, right?

699
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,477
We're being strange again.

700
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,781
It's a sickness,

701
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,483
for both you and I.

702
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:48,525
Hello?

703
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,941
Father. Wake up. Father.

704
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,610
What happened?

705
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,445
He has difficulty breathing
and went into shock.

706
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,949
He's stable now, but we need an MRI
to see the extent of the bleeding.

707
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,131
I heard you went to the hospital.

708
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:05,168
What did you talk about?

709
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:07,537
How's Chairman Park?

710
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,008
Luckily, there was no brain hemorrhaging.

711
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,211
But he hasn't regained consciousness.

712
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,282
You sent me

713
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,252
for another reason, didn't you?

714
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,456
You wanted Gun-woo out of the room
to meet with the chairman.

715
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,260
What did you say to him?

716
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:42,205
It's guilt.

717
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,176
Even someone who is completely heartless

718
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,845
would fall apart if they feel guilty.

719
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:52,749
Remember that.

720
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,552
It's a useful vital point.

721
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:57,721
He's sick

722
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,322
and he's old.

723
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,625
Attacking someone like that

724
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,127
is wrong.

725
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,100
He isn't an old man
sitting on a park bench.

726
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:14,938
With one word, he can make
thousands of people lose their jobs.

727
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:17,941
With one signature,

728
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,710
he can bulldoze an entire town.

729
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,482
He isn't weak enough to warrant pity.

730
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:26,583
So,

731
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,920
did you go with the intent
to make him collapse?

732
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:34,024
To stab at his weak pressure point?

733
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,627
There are no rules to this fight.

734
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,430
If I don't knock him down,
I'll be the one attacked.

735
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,667
Even if I resent the victors after I fall,

736
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,303
they do not hear a thing.

737
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:51,875
Se-jin.

738
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:01,785
Don't hesitate.

739
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,488
If you truly want to possess

740
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,224
those lights that you saw,

741
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,560
don't hesitate. Just take.

742
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,811
Moojin Group, the subject of
a battle for control,

743
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:04,915
held a special shareholders meeting
at Samseong headquarters

744
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,751
and voted to remove Chairman Moo-il Park
from office.

745
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:10,854
The shareholders meeting
which began at 9 a.m.

746
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:11,922
discussed the health...

747
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,392
Wow. Ms. Seo pulled a big one.

748
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,227
The new chairman...

749
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:18,361
Good job everyone.

750
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:20,197
Moojin Produce's president, Moo-sam Park

751
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:22,399
was voted in on a landslide decision.

752
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:25,535
Moojin Group had doubled in net worth

753
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,904
during former President
Tae-joon Jang's tenure,

754
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,573
and with the approval

755
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,942
of Moojin's Neo City Project,
Chairman Park's pet project,

756
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:35,045
many had raised suspicions
of preferential treatment.

757
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,476
Gun-woo.

758
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,409
My parents

759
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,312
passed away in a car accident.

760
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,449
After my mom went to heaven,

761
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:49,819
my dad was in the ICU for a long time.

762
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,823
I pretty much lived in the hall
outside the ICU.

763
00:54:56,126 --> 00:55:00,230
I'd doze off on the bench,
wake up, stare into space,

764
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:03,166
and after a while,
I couldn't think at all.

765
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,405
Then I'd stare
at the pattern on the floor.

766
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:13,743
Time ceased to exist.
I didn't feel hunger or anything.

767
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:19,382
The pattern here is different.

768
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:25,655
So hang in there.

769
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,793
No more bad things will happen.

770
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:32,329
Yi-kyung.

771
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,300
Yi-kyung wouldn't have done that.

772
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,870
What did she say to my father?

773
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:43,273
Gun-woo.

774
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,292
Excuse me, Gun-woo.

775
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,563
There is

776
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:08,932
something I couldn't tell you.

777
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,504
The truth is,

778
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:17,674
Ms. Seo...

779
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:19,476
Excuse me.

780
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:20,643
Please come in.

781
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,441
It's okay.

782
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,476
You can just talk.

783
00:56:58,448 --> 00:56:59,282
Where's...

784
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,285
Bong-soo's daughter?

785
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,488
She isn't here. She didn't come.

786
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:07,524
And the meeting?

787
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,194
How did it go?

788
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,166
Did Moo-sam win?

789
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:19,903
It all went well.

790
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:21,805
Don't worry.

791
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,151
