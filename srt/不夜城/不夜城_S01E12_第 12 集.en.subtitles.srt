CASHIER'S CHECK
ONE BILLION WON

2
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,277
I understand what you mean.

3
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,047
Whether or not I accept this,

4
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,116
you already got what you wanted.

5
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,652
If I take it,

6
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,988
I'll stop what I've been doing.

7
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:59,959
Looking for your weakness
wouldn't be justifiable.

8
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,395
I'd be bought, pretty much.

9
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,003
EPISODE 12

10
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,504
If I don't take it,

11
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,474
I'll regret it forever.

12
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,711
Every time I need money or hit hard times,

13
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,481
I'll wish I took the money

14
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,483
and wonder if I should ask for it again

15
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,952
and have all sorts of pathetic thoughts.

16
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,924
You still write essays in response
to a math question.

17
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,460
It isn't a difficult calculation.

18
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,395
It's like a right or wrong quiz.

19
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,298
Take the check.

20
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,233
Don't take the check.

21
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,637
If it's too hard to decide,
shall I set a time limit?

22
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:45,939
How's ten seconds?

23
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,740
Decide within that time.

24
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,044
The offer will be withdrawn afterward.

25
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,014
Ten.

26
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,584
Nine.

27
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,520
Eight.

28
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,789
Seven.

29
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,058
Six.

30
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,494
Five.

31
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:09,662
Four.

32
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,699
Three.

33
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,171
Two.

34
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,254
CASHIER'S CHECK
ONE BILLION WON

35
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,624
That looks like a new game. It looks fun.

36
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,695
Se-jin, may I play too?

37
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,098
We're just getting started.

38
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,234
Everyone I like is here.

39
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:50,904
Welcome.

40
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,619
How did you get rid of Gi-tae Son?

41
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,254
Did you threaten him?

42
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,590
Or did you buy him like this?

43
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,661
It's a game for people
who are afraid of their own greed.

44
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,162
I was never afraid.

45
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,664
That's what you want to believe.

46
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,265
I don't want this money, either.

47
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,767
Now, you even lie to me.

48
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,772
Are you okay?

49
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,707
Yes.

50
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,011
It was just getting interesting,

51
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,581
but I think I should stop here.

52
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,520
Here are the documents on TJ
that you were looking for.

53
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,028
Let's meet again on a good day
for good reasons.

54
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,670
Ma'am.

55
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,244
You forgot to take this.

56
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,354
Don't run too far.

57
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,523
The people you're working with
will betray you.

58
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,559
It's a betrayal
only if you've trusted them.

59
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,795
Luckily, I trust no one.

60
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,864
-Ma'am.
-How long will you use

61
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,499
this naive child?

62
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,768
She's the one who brought me here.

63
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,570
She doesn't know how to give up.

64
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,505
She worries about you more than I do.

65
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,510
It's nice seeing you again.

66
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:40,179
Next time, let's not play strange games.

67
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,748
Let's greet each other with a smile.

68
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,635
TJ CULTURAL FOUNDATION FINANCIAL STATEMENT

69
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,254
Thank you.

70
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,757
Please write a nice article

71
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,725
relaying Mr. Jang's true intentions.

72
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:33,760
-I will.
-I will.

73
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,231
Hello.

74
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,133
It's quite chaotic.

75
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,705
It just means they have all been waiting
to see Mr. Jang make his return.

76
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,040
Cancel the remaining interviews

77
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,343
for the rest of the day.

78
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,856
I've sent them all away.

79
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,259
What excuse did you give?

80
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,896
I said you weren't feeling well
and need to rest.

81
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,598
You pushed me out the door

82
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,734
and told me to meet the people,

83
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:19,238
but now, you tell me to kick out
my guests who came to see me.

84
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,140
I don't know

85
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,209
how to keep up with your fickleness.

86
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,311
They were not guests, but migratory birds.

87
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,314
Political migratory birds
who move to another nest

88
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,949
for every election.

89
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,753
Keeping them close to you is merely
a waste of bird feed.

90
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,423
Politics is a bird fight.

91
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,393
Whether it's a fresh, juicy fruit

92
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,196
or a fallen fruit eaten by worms,

93
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,366
you put them in the same bushel

94
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,469
and increase its weight.

95
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,639
That is the old politics
that the world denounces.

96
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:54,774
Ms. Seo.

97
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,976
If you want to serve Mr. Jang properly,

98
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,078
filter out the people.

99
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,914
Don't just kiss up to reporters.

100
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,318
You must scrub off the dead skin
before starting anew.

101
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,687
When it comes to people and habits,

102
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,122
you must adjust them
to fit with the new era.

103
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,359
Look,

104
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,362
you might be good at making money,

105
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,433
but you don't seem to know

106
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,535
about how to do politics.

107
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,970
The fundamentals are the same.

108
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,705
Power and wealth.

109
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,307
Only a few have it,

110
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,176
and those who don't

111
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,446
will struggle to take it away.

112
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,216
And you're confident you won't lose
what you have.

113
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,019
Because I've taken from others so far.

114
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,525
Nam.

115
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,093
Yes, sir.

116
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,261
From now on,

117
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,365
cut down on unnecessary meetings.

118
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,936
I'll do as ordered.

119
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,578
We need to take control

120
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,446
and push forward from the start.

121
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:08,814
Yes, sir.

122
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,454
Wasn't the Neo City Project meeting
at 3 p.m.?

123
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,956
Didn't you get the message?

124
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,125
It has been changed to 1 p.m.

125
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,132
Do you even want me to take attendance?

126
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,001
My employees must have made a mistake.

127
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,171
Don't be so sensitive.

128
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,073
We didn't discuss much at the meeting.

129
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,842
I dozed off during the entire meeting.

130
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,278
I hope there won't be a mistake
for the next meeting.

131
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,580
Of course, not.

132
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,182
I'll talk to my employees to make sure.

133
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,483
Okay, then.

134
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,156
I got the meeting minutes.

135
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,792
It was a general discussion
about the business.

136
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,493
There was nothing special.

137
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,763
They can change the minutes easily.

138
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,032
How about Moojin's network?

139
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,467
It's been strange the past few days.

140
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:05,638
The number of documents being shared
and comments have been decreased.

141
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,174
I suspect they are using
a different network,

142
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,342
so I'm trying to track them.

143
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,678
He's playing silly games.

144
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,681
-Tak.
-Yes.

145
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,049
I'll tail Chairman Moo-sam Park.

146
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,185
No, not him.

147
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,087
Someone else.

148
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,322
Goodness.

149
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,892
I can't stand this young girl
ordering me around.

150
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:34,000
She thinks she's so great,
but she won't last long.

151
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,001
Don't you agree?

152
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:45,411
I thought you'd fully understand
my intentions.

153
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,647
Of course, I understand.

154
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,682
Imagine how controlling
she has been to me,

155
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,984
if she's chiming in about
how Mr. Jang should do politics.

156
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,919
Do this. Don't do that.

157
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,554
It's just that I never complained,

158
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,224
but my insides are all knotted up
because of her.

159
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,661
Checks and balances are a must
when doing something big.

160
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,932
It could put everyone at risk
if one side tries to dominate.

161
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,068
That's what I'm saying.

162
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,745
You're scheduled to visit the site
for the Neo City Project.

163
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,213
You're to leave in ten minutes.

164
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,815
Is that today?

165
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,116
Yes, sir.

166
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,184
Gosh.

167
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,586
Reschedule for tomorrow or the day after.

168
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,059
Yes, sir.

169
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,299
So, does this mean

170
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,036
Mr. Jang is also unhappy with Yi-kyung?

171
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,195
I saw Dr. Yoo on my way up.

172
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,230
He said your health is improving.

173
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,201
The nurses said you're being
more cooperative, too.

174
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,070
You willingly give them
your arm for shots.

175
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,539
You don't complain
about taking your medicine either.

176
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,708
I felt much better when I heard that.

177
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,979
I can't be sick in times like this.

178
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,484
That punk Tae-joon.

179
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,353
I saw him on TV.

180
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,557
I'm sure that he's out
to take something again.

181
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,760
He's all healthy like that.

182
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,195
It's not fair if I'm the only one
who's sick in bed.

183
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,132
I should thank Mr. Jang, too.

184
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,468
That's not funny, punk.

185
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:52,738
I'll go now.

186
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,942
Why are you so busy lately?

187
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,846
You never have time to sit down.
You just come and go.

188
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,615
There's always a mountain of work.

189
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,484
Uncle created so many problems.

190
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,188
Okay. Hang in there a bit.

191
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:15,561
I'll do whatever it takes to get you
your position at the group back.

192
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,664
No, I don't need that.

193
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,633
I don't need your help, either.

194
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,537
Whatever I do and from where,
I'll do it on my own.

195
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,106
FINANCIAL STATEMENT

196
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,208
I don't see anything improper.

197
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,779
I checked again and again,
but Ms. Seo was right.

198
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:38,117
TJ doesn't have flaws like Baeksong had.

199
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,852
So, are you disappointed?

200
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,923
She wouldn't have given us
the original documents.

201
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,091
She wouldn't lie about things like that.

202
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,628
She checked every single figure
and gave this to us

203
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,231
because she was confident.

204
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,468
That's right. That's how Yi-kyung works.

205
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,204
I forgot.

206
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,408
Is Ma-ri coming?

207
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,343
She knows the password to unlock it.

208
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,115
Who is it?

209
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,017
It's me, sir.

210
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,192
Ms. Moon. How did you know...

211
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,461
Come in.

212
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,435
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,505
The chairman ordered me to find out

214
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,407
what you were doing after work.

215
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,216
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

216
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,519
I confirmed when he went in and left.

217
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,957
Should I follow him again tomorrow?

218
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,793
No. Tell Ms. Kim to come up.

219
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,794
Yes, ma'am.

220
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:06,405
So, Jong-gyu Nam went
to the chairman's office.

221
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:12,311
He postponed all of his appointments
and chatted with him for an hour.

222
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,413
Director Jong-gyu Nam?

223
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,249
Isn't he Mr. Jang's right-hand man?

224
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,318
He was released recently.

225
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,787
He and Yi-kyung are fighting
for power right now.

226
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,456
But Ms. Moon.

227
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,459
Is it okay for you to tell me
things like this?

228
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:31,997
I submitted my resignation

229
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,667
just before leaving work today.

230
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,670
I am not here as the chairman's assistant,

231
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,005
but on my own accord.

232
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,575
I didn't report to him
about this place, either.

233
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,444
But...

234
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,579
I didn't quit because of you.

235
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,582
Chairman Moo-sam Park

236
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,252
does not belong there.

237
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,088
When I saw him sell Moojin Tech,

238
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,491
I decided I could not work
for him any longer.

239
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,629
Okay, then.

240
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,366
Ms. Moon.

241
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,669
Did you find a new place to work?

242
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,874
It doesn't compare to being
the chairman's assistant,

243
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,243
but can't you work here?

244
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,013
-Se-jin--
-I'm trying my best,

245
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,449
but I need more detailed knowledge.

246
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,753
It would be so nice if someone
like you would help us.

247
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,154
Se-jin,

248
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,492
Ms. Moon is significantly
overqualified to work here.

249
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,361
And I'm underqualified?

250
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,231
I'm disappointed, sir.

251
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,468
Don't be offended.
Pretend she didn't say that--

252
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,304
You should've made me that offer yourself.

253
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:47,706
Pardon?

254
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,086
I'll bring in the computer
and office supplies

255
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,255
I'll be using.

256
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,227
How many pages a minute
does that printer print?

257
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,361
Well...

258
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,397
I never counted.

259
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,540
She looks tough,

260
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,008
but also looks professional.

261
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,310
I could feel it just by looking at her.

262
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,816
What are you thinking about?

263
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,653
Gather allies and split up the enemy.

264
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,756
Let's go with that strategy.

265
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,426
Split up the enemy?

266
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,860
Se-jin.

267
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,430
You need to meet with Yi-kyung

268
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,599
and tell her what we heard today

269
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,069
about my uncle and Director Nam.

270
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,539
-But--
-She won't believe me if I tell her.

271
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,074
But you're different.

272
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,875
She'll listen to you.

273
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,489
SE-JIN

274
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,198
Hello. It's me.

275
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,166
What is it?

276
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,103
I'd like to see you tomorrow.

277
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:25,804
Do you have time?

278
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,406
What is it about?

279
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,576
I'll tell you in person.

280
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,746
Ma'am.

281
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,349
Fine.

282
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:01,974
Get in.

283
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,917
I could've gone to the gallery.

284
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,485
It would've been uncomfortable.

285
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,087
You'd be awkward with the others there.

286
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,724
Aren't you busy?

287
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,459
I am.

288
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,469
That's the extent of what I heard.

289
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,238
I don't know what they discussed.

290
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,080
Did you know already?

291
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,382
Pretty much.

292
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,118
And I have an idea

293
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,221
why they met, too.

294
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,626
I also know why you came to tell me this.

295
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,429
I'm sure it was Gun-woo's idea.

296
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,099
You're right.

297
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,003
When you called last night,
I briefly thought

298
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,708
you may have wanted to redo
the game we never got to finish.

299
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,910
I was wrong.

300
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,247
There's no reason for me
to accept that much money.

301
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,750
It was a ticket out of this mayhem.

302
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,621
The deeper you go in,

303
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,324
the more dangerous it'll get.

304
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,031
It was a one-way ticket
to forget it all and leave,

305
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,767
but you rejected it.

306
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,769
I can't leave you behind,

307
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,138
when it'll get so dangerous.

308
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,411
I'm being sincere.

309
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,982
No matter how brave a herbivore is,

310
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,217
it only becomes prey to carnivores.

311
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,554
Run away while you can.

312
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,156
Both you and Gun-woo.

313
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,295
I'll relay that message to him.

314
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,867
I'm poor with nothing to lose anyway,

315
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,535
so I have nothing to fear.

316
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,075
I never taught you to be a mess like this.

317
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,244
I'm sure I learned the good things

318
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,747
and the bad things all from you.

319
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,028
Jong-gyu is an evil bastard.

320
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,631
"You know I have your rebate document
in my hands,

321
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,199
so you'd better listen to me

322
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,001
instead of Yi-kyung."

323
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,270
That's pretty much how he threatened me.

324
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,540
So I yelled at him.

325
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,841
"What do you mean?

326
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,744
Yi-kyung is our brain and treasure.

327
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,213
This is not the time
for a power struggle."

328
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,849
-Sir.
-Don't you worry.

329
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,919
I wouldn't hang out with someone like him.

330
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,321
Not a chance.

331
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,524
Director Nam visited
five other corporations

332
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,360
after stopping by here.

333
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,729
They are all corporations

334
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,465
who pledged large sums to TJ in donations

335
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,568
and will be transferring the funds soon.

336
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,204
What about this?

337
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,672
Yi-kyung, the person commanding

338
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,009
the foundation's executives,
suddenly gets a bad reputation,

339
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,777
and thus,

340
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,047
there is a problem collecting
the donations.

341
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:34,386
Who'd start such a groundless rumor?

342
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,756
I know what you're capable of
better than anyone.

343
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:42,227
I feel reassured hearing you say that.

344
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,899
Please let me know
if you hear anything strange.

345
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,735
Bad rumors

346
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,504
must be nipped in the bud.

347
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,172
Yes, of course.

348
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,174
That was me.

349
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,277
I ordered him to do it.

350
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:04,015
Those corporations decided
to donate large sums to our foundation.

351
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,552
I thought we should thank them in person.

352
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,155
That's why I told Nam

353
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,891
to visit each of them in person.

354
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,928
Small acts may cause
huge misunderstandings.

355
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:21,233
Why didn't you discuss it with her first?

356
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:22,968
I was thoughtless.

357
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,238
I'm sorry if I caused a misunderstanding.

358
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,875
I am glad we were able to clear up
the misunderstanding.

359
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,987
Do you really think I should

360
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,923
make pathetic excuses to a kid like that?

361
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,959
Just to cover for your mistakes?

362
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,195
I'm sorry. I didn't think it through.

363
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,565
You can't underestimate her.

364
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,435
Don't look just ahead.

365
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,172
Look carefully behind you, too.

366
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,407
Yes. I understand, sir.

367
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,844
It is very likely

368
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,013
that Mr. Jang is
actually controlling Collin Company.

369
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,850
Collin Company is the foreign company

370
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,084
who purchased Moojin Tech.

371
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,555
The CEO on record is Michael Kang--

372
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,591
But the real CEO is Tae-joon Jang's nephew
Hyun-soo Kim.

373
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,894
It's a smokescreen to hide his uncle,
who is truly in charge.

374
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,497
Even before the acquisition
of Moojin Tech,

375
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:29,067
they acquired several lucrative businesses
for a cheap price.

376
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,869
How do you know all of that?

377
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,571
Everything about the real owner

378
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,573
is either speculation or gut feelings.

379
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,409
Without sound proof or a witness,

380
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,711
it is an empty argument.

381
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,551
Where should I look for it?

382
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,689
Oh. Sorry.

383
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,060
If it were that easy to find,

384
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,762
someone like him would never have been

385
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,231
the President.

386
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,795
Gun-woo said before,
while reviewing documents,

387
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,033
"If Ms. Moon were doing this,

388
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,402
she'd be done in ten minutes."

389
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:43,808
Thank you very much.

390
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,933
CHAIRMAN MOO-SAM PARK

391
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,203
MOOJIN GROUP

392
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,905
It was difficult to make you chairman,

393
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,174
but it's easy to remove you.

394
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,610
Don't test my abilities,

395
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,078
sir.

396
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,757
I stopped by because I heard
you didn't go home yet.

397
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,470
Since when did you
say goodbye before leaving?

398
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,445
No matter what,
we're still the same family.

399
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,649
Family is worse than strangers
when you turn against each other.

400
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,552
It's easier for family to make up, too.

401
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,991
Father is getting better lately.

402
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,261
I'm glad. I had been worried.

403
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,197
He speaks the way he does,

404
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,066
but I think he wants you to do well,

405
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,935
since you're the chairman anyway.

406
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,341
What's wrong?

407
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,343
Nothing. It's nothing.

408
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,312
Is it Mr. Jang or Yi-kyung?

409
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,982
Which one is acting like
Moojin Group belongs to them?

410
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:34,819
Perhaps the participants were warned.
Today's meeting was carried out fine.

411
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,955
The network is fine too.

412
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,024
I have tightened the reins on Moojin,

413
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,792
so they'll be quiet for a while.

414
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,494
Should I continue to mark Jong-gyu Nam?

415
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,230
Isn't he Mr. Jang's man?

416
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,234
We shouldn't be assured of any of them.

417
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,636
Stay extra alert.

418
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,338
To be honest,

419
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,241
I don't respect you.

420
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,977
But that doesn't mean I hate you.

421
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,182
It's not like I want to treat my nephew
like an enemy.

422
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,384
Things just got that way.

423
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,553
And that's what's shaking the group.

424
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,188
Yi-kyung

425
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,392
will claim the chairman's office
before you know it.

426
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,495
-So?
-I'll keep Yi-kyung in check.

427
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,764
Pretend to be oblivious

428
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,599
and help me from behind.

429
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,806
You want to have the Park family
join together and protect the group?

430
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,308
There's nothing more important than that.

431
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,247
Do you have a plan?

432
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,020
The deeper you go in,

433
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,856
the more dangerous it'll get.

434
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,526
It was a one-way ticket
to forget it all and leave,

435
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,129
but you rejected it.

436
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,231
I can't leave you behind,

437
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,633
when it'll get so dangerous.

438
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:59,204
I never taught you to be a mess like this.

439
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,439
I'm sure I learned the good things

440
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,042
and the bad things all from you.

441
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:50,522
A guest Mr. Jang sent is here.

442
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:05,537
It must be very important

443
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,038
for you to come all the way here.

444
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,941
Mr. Jang has sent some orchids as a gift.

445
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,578
He said it would liven up the office.

446
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,981
Please thank him for me.

447
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:22,187
We both know the situation,
so I won't beat around the bush.

448
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:27,625
Mr. Jang has been very displeased
because you had been pushing

449
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,727
your unreasonable opinions on him.

450
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,997
He appreciates your abilities
and your vision,

451
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,866
but certain lines should not be crossed.

452
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,467
So?

453
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,336
Do not upset him anymore.

454
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:39,971
He may be a gentle man,

455
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,141
but he will be difficult to handle
once he gets angry.

456
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,310
Okay.

457
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,912
Is there anything else?

458
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,114
What I mean is...

459
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,383
I understand, so please leave.

460
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,221
I'd appreciate it if you'd make
an appointment next time.

461
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,462
I heard your skilled crew

462
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,731
help you to fully perform your ability.

463
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,766
Please keep up the good work.

464
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,509
I heard there is a young woman, too.

465
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,479
She resigned for personal reasons.

466
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,648
I won't see you out.

467
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,094
A few years ago,

468
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,564
a reporter looked into Collin Company
and President Tae-joon Jang.

469
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,634
I don't know if he was pressured,

470
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,968
but nothing came of it.

471
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,771
-Se-jin.
-We need to find

472
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,473
a witness or a connection,

473
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,175
but I can't find anything anywhere.

474
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,146
My lunch break is almost over.

475
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,951
I may have been pushed out,
but I need to stick to the rules.

476
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,588
I'm sorry.

477
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,390
I took too much of your time.

478
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,092
Did you sleep at all?

479
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,861
Sleep?

480
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:11,529
Did I sleep?

481
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,999
I think I did, but...

482
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,068
Go home and sleep.

483
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,137
-Let's talk later.
-But--

484
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,072
I know you're anxious because of Yi-kyung,

485
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:25,510
but we should approach it slowly,
one thing at a time.

486
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,613
There's something I'm working on, too.

487
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,549
Don't struggle so much alone.

488
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,487
Did you hear me?

489
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:40,191
Yes.

490
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,630
Stick to Se-jin for now,
unless I give a special order.

491
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,764
To Se-jin?

492
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,701
Did she do something?

493
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,870
You're not watching her,
but protecting her.

494
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,049
Se-jin!

495
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,587
She's Gun-woo's assistant.

496
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,322
She came to help us.

497
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,725
She owns this place.

498
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,293
She's also my friend.

499
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,230
Every time I come here,
there's another person.

500
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:21,866
Goodness.

501
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:25,303
My feet are on fire from shopping
because the new releases came out today.

502
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:29,173
Your life is painful, I know,

503
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,476
but my life is no joke, either.

504
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,712
I need to shop but my allowance was cut.

505
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,814
What a crisis.

506
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,449
Exactly.

507
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,585
I went to the company
to kiss up to Grandpa,

508
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,854
and ended up getting an earful instead.

509
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,922
My life stinks.

510
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:49,660
Ma-ri.

511
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:51,963
How has your grandfather

512
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,898
been lately?

513
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,033
My grandpa?

514
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:56,834
Why?

515
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,539
Would we get anything from him?

516
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:02,907
I heard before,

517
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,843
that the association managed
Mr. Jang's slush fund.

518
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,513
Ma-ri's grandfather did that for a while,

519
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,581
so he must know more
about funds from abroad

520
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,283
more than the documents show.

521
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,852
Even if he does,
he won't tell us that easily.

522
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,155
First, I'll beg.

523
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,823
Then I'll just plead to the end.

524
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,162
-Hello?
-I'll go with you then.

525
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,831
Do you have the time?

526
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,866
Aren't you working on something else?

527
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,302
You forego sleep for this.

528
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,804
I can't say I don't have the time.

529
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,672
Thank you.

530
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,608
We won't say things like that, remember?

531
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,245
It's okay if it comes from the heart.

532
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,633
She was at Ma-ri Son's studio
and went home.

533
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,603
-What about Gun-woo?
-He didn't come.

534
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,139
Should I check on him as well?

535
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,774
No.

536
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,542
Just guard Se-jin.

537
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,010
Make sure she doesn't get hurt.

538
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,812
Okay. Understood.

539
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,187
Go home.

540
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,824
You know where to find documents
on the person really in charge

541
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,459
of Collin Company, don't you?

542
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,461
Does Chairman Park know

543
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:31,863
you're doing this?

544
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,098
I don't know which chairman you mean,

545
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,267
but neither of them know.

546
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,768
Please help us.

547
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,006
Yi-kyung was foolish.

548
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,542
She raised a tiger

549
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,945
to bite off her own tail.

550
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:51,983
Go home.

551
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,185
I have nothing else to say.

552
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,864
The sky won't fall.

553
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,401
I didn't expect it,
but it's still frustrating.

554
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:14,138
I thought you were always tough.
Are you tired already?

555
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,441
If you want to tease me, do it
another time. I'm not in the mood.

556
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,578
Chairman Son isn't
the only member of that family.

557
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:25,316
Someone who resents Yi-kyung
more than Chairman Son.

558
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,353
Ma-ri's father?

559
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,424
But he lied to us about giving us
the foundation's documents.

560
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,427
Although I'm sure Ms. Seo had him do it.

561
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,763
Exactly why we need to test him.

562
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,200
If he was forced to do something
he didn't want to do,

563
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,070
he probably resents the person
who made him do it.

564
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,142
I don't really feel like going back up.

565
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,710
It's such a hostile territory.

566
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:09,594
What's with you people?

567
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,729
Did you both go crazy?

568
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,030
I'm not crazy enough yet.

569
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,266
Help me get crazier.

570
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,737
You said it was something urgent
about Ma-ri.

571
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,439
You were the financial director
for a while.

572
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,074
Just tell us what you know.

573
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,544
I know nothing about Collin Company
or Mr. Jang.

574
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:27,812
I don't know anything.

575
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:29,747
Sit back down.

576
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,850
-What?
-If you leave like this,

577
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,652
you're the one who will lose out.

578
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,287
I said to sit.

579
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,258
Lose out? How?

580
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,326
How long will you and your father

581
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,296
let Yi-kyung order you around?

582
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,067
If she loses power, Chunha can go back
to what it used to be.

583
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,869
I'm saying

584
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,105
we'll take care of the annoying things.

585
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,041
One mistake,

586
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,377
and I'll take the fall for everything.

587
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,079
Forget it.

588
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,815
When will you repay the debt you owe me?

589
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,418
What debt?

590
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,387
You hired Taiwanese thugs to abduct me.

591
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,791
That was so long ago.

592
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,293
Plus,

593
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,362
I thought you were Yi-kyung.

594
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,765
That's not all.

595
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,401
You framed Se-jin and got her locked up
and interrogated.

596
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,102
You owe that debt, too.

597
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,848
You can't be here right now.

598
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:40,518
Isn't Moojin's Neo City Project's
bidding taking place

599
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:41,952
today?

600
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,621
There was a problem with that.

601
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,022
One of the companies

602
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,258
confessed to the Fair Trade Commission
that the contractor

603
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,894
was already decided ahead of time,

604
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,929
and that there was price fixing.

605
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,336
I just heard, too.

606
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,971
You know the company you've chosen.

607
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,375
I think one of the other companies
was annoyed and did this,

608
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,911
not caring what's going to happen.

609
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:11,082
I thought you had taken care
of the businesses.

610
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,585
It's not like they did what I said
because they wanted to.

611
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,654
It looks like they couldn't
hold it in any longer.

612
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,956
It's tough for me, too.

613
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,359
We have to pay the fine now.

614
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:24,795
We can't do anything
until the rebidding process.

615
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,799
The information may have leaked
elsewhere, too.

616
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,235
Elsewhere? Where?

617
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,104
That's what I plan to find out.

618
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,339
In these situations,

619
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,842
there's usually a mole from within.

620
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,478
Within the company?

621
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,547
Okay.

622
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,783
I'll look into it, too.

623
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,926
Go to the Fair Trade Commission
and find out the details.

624
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,061
Yes, ma'am.

625
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,104
Hello, Ms. Seo.

626
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:08,372
Where are you?

627
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,473
In front of the studio.

628
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,143
Se-jin and Gun-woo
stopped by Chunha Financing

629
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,778
and met Gi-tae Son outside.

630
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,381
And?

631
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:18,783
They just returned to the studio.

632
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,685
I think they're digging
into TJ Foundation.

633
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:24,088
Come here for now.
Something urgent came up.

634
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:25,723
Okay.

635
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,026
Yes.

636
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,661
You did the right thing, Uncle.

637
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,097
Once the rebidding begins,

638
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,100
the companies Yi-kyung chose
will be disqualified.

639
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,004
She won't be able to inflate
construction cost and siphon funds

640
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,105
into the slush fund.

641
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,642
I'll call you later.

642
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:51,449
What?

643
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,418
Hyun-soo Kim's ex-wife
is in Korea right now.

644
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,121
Gi-tae Son didn't lie.

645
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,690
I'll get her contact information
and those close to her.

646
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,230
What is it?

647
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,431
Yi-kyung received

648
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,099
a punch in the face.

649
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,736
It won't knock her down,

650
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,872
but it'll sting a little.

651
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:19,076
Is that what you said you were working on?

652
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,221
What did you

653
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,290
just say, Chairman Son?

654
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,726
The person digging into
who's really controlling Collin Company--

655
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:39,296
No, what you said before.

656
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:40,898
Gun-woo?

657
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,267
Moo-il's son Gun-woo

658
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,603
is doing that?

659
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,472
That's correct.

660
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,576
He came with Yi-kyung's prior employee.

661
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:55,279
Of course, it was fruitless.

662
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,516
Then,

663
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:00,351
do you think

664
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,621
Yi-kyung is involved?

665
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,422
She couldn't possibly.

666
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:08,959
But she may be preparing for the future.

667
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,297
If she wants to find your weakness

668
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,332
as an insurance policy...

669
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,474
I'm sorry.

670
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,944
Yiheung Construction met with
the Fair Trade Commission

671
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:30,314
and told them about the price fixing,
so our plan was ruined.

672
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:34,752
They must've been upset that
Twins Construction was preselected

673
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,453
to do the construction.

674
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,597
I need to go to the studio.

675
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,466
Was it Gun-woo who prevented the bidding?

676
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,689
Even if we can get in touch with her,

677
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,857
will Hyun-soo Kim's ex-wife talk to us?

678
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,126
If what Gi-tae Son said is true,

679
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:19,563
she would've saved documents and evidence
to get back at her ex-husband.

680
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:24,501
If we can find proof that Mr. Jang
is associated with the company...

681
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:28,272
Then, will Ms. Seo stop with her plan?

682
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,141
Even Yi-kyung

683
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:34,845
wouldn't be able to make a fallen,
scandalous politician into a kingmaker.

684
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,222
Who are you?

685
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,757
We came to take the documents.

686
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,560
Everything on Collin Company.

687
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,997
Mr. Yoo, pack them up.

688
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,233
Who sent you?

689
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,135
Director Jong-gyu Nam?

690
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:01,972
Just continue what you were doing.

691
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,709
I need to talk to this person.

692
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:26,463
Are you okay?

693
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,332
Just give them the documents.

694
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,201
You have guests.

695
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,074
Ma'am.

696
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:39,777
What's going on?

697
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,247
They're trying to take the documents.

698
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,450
We're looking into a company
called Collin Company...

699
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,085
I think Mr. Jang sent them.

700
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:53,057
Take the documents that you need.
Don't cause a scene.

701
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,425
-Yi-kyung.
-Sorry.

702
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,627
We need to take them, too.

703
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,731
That, I will not allow.

704
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,867
It's our job to do what others cannot do.

705
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,369
I don't care about your job.

706
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,037
Tak.

707
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,805
Why are you being stupid?

708
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,241
-Pack the documents.
-No.

709
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:45,909
If you keep that, you'll get hurt.

710
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:47,478
Se-jin will be in danger, too.

711
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,150
If you give the documents to Mr. Jang,
he won't send

712
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,518
those hunting dogs again.

713
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,487
Ms. Seo.

714
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,091
I told you to run away.

715
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,481
Thank you.

716
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,826
When was the last time you fought?

717
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:39,630
Maybe in middle school?

718
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:42,032
With a friend who sat behind me.

719
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,234
Didn't you realize then

720
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,804
that you are a terrible fighter?

721
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:47,871
I am hurt.

722
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:49,873
No scolding.

723
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,742
That was too dangerous.

724
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,310
Who cares about some documents?

725
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,778
You should've just handed them over.

726
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,281
I'm regretting it too.

727
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,451
I regret it more, since my body aches.

728
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:06,490
If something like this happens again,

729
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:08,725
do not fight.

730
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:12,529
Okay?

731
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,698
I can hand over documents whenever.

732
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,066
However,

733
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,036
I can't let them take my partner.

734
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,743
I was trying to sound cool. Was it lame?

735
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,582
Se-jin.

736
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:40,591
We're back to the beginning.

737
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,393
It'll get more dangerous from now on.

738
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:47,898
No one will blame you
even if you stop here.

739
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,300
Ms. Seo said

740
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:53,937
there will be a time when I must choose.

741
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,608
I chose differently than she did,

742
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,143
and I am walking down that path.

743
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:02,813
Yi-kyung

744
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,249
may never stop.

745
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,826
I'll destroy all these documents
that Ms. Seo brought.

746
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,402
I'm sure there are more things
to take care of.

747
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,171
I made sure they understood.

748
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,276
They won't do anything that will harm you.

749
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,678
Am I supposed to relax,

750
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:38,315
just because you say so?

751
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,487
I heard one of them worked under you.

752
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,592
She did.

753
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,128
If you wanted to assuage my suspicions,

754
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:55,265
you should've gotten rid of them first.

755
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:56,700
They'd be unnecessary sacrifices.

756
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,337
It may end up hurting your candidate, too.

757
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,273
Is that right?

758
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,376
Please trust my judgment.

759
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,273
I told you to run away.

760
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,977
No matter how brave a herbivore is,

761
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:42,145
it only becomes prey to carnivores.

762
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,515
Run away while you can.

763
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,085
Both you and Gun-woo.

764
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,988
The deeper you go in,

765
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,724
the more dangerous it'll get.

766
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,986
Se-jin!

767
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:24,187
How...

768
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,622
Se-jin.

769
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,324
How have you been?

770
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,863
It's been too long. I've missed you.

771
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,132
I'm here to see Ms. Seo.

772
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,891
I was worried.

773
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:02,592
About what?

774
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,327
I know

775
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:06,663
I was reckless.

776
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,866
I did it to stop you,

777
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,071
but I didn't think that would happen.

778
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,507
Ma'am.

779
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,545
You're in danger because of me,
aren't you?

780
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,682
Mr. Jang

781
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,151
or someone else

782
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,588
must be after you now,

783
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,357
right?

784
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,059
Maybe,

785
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,028
and maybe not.

786
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:41,565
Will you still continue?

787
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,935
Although it'll obviously
get more dangerous?

788
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,005
Because the moment I stop,

789
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,141
my life would be finished.

790
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,979
I didn't do it for you.

791
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,348
It wasn't for Gun-woo, either.

792
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:00,517
I

793
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,486
wouldn't want to breathe

794
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,721
a single minute,

795
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:06,923
a single second, if that happens.

796
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,494
That's why I'm fighting,

797
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,863
because I want to stay alive.

798
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,965
What if you fight and get hurt

799
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:17,134
and then fall?

800
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:20,971
What meaning would that spot

801
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,740
on top of the world have?

802
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:25,876
Se-jin.

803
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,527
I'm not climbing up there
to find any meaning.

804
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,229
The desire to climb up.

805
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,498
That itself is the meaning.

806
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,983
How's Gun-woo?

807
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,419
He's okay.

808
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,556
I didn't get to thank you.

809
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,091
Forget it.

810
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,027
Don't be mistaken.

811
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,696
I wasn't watching you.

812
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,867
Ms. Seo said to protect you,
because you may be in danger.

813
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,070
I was a step behind earlier,

814
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,041
but I thought you should know the truth.

815
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:09,506
I'm sorry for making you come here.

816
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,941
Not at all, sir.

817
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,879
I'm so busy lately.

818
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:20,684
I just came from a service
at the national cemetery.

819
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:22,786
After this meeting...

820
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,189
Where am I going again?

821
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:29,526
You're going to a traditional market
to speak with shop owners...

822
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,563
Yes, yes. That's right.

823
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:38,234
There are many positive articles
about you in the papers.

824
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,136
The people--

825
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,839
It means the people
have high expectations for you.

826
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:45,108
What's the point?

827
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:50,447
I can't even sleep well at night,
worrying about things.

828
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:53,750
I'm sure

829
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:57,821
you're suffering from the same problem.

830
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:03,193
Mr. Jang is very concerned about Yi-kyung.

831
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,762
He admits she is skilled in business,

832
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,365
but she has been too audacious recently.

833
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:09,766
That is how he feels.

834
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,702
I tried talking to her
several times already,

835
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,372
but she doesn't listen to others.

836
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,007
That's a bad trait for a business person.

837
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:20,877
She thinks she's the only one
who exists in the world.

838
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:22,412
That's how she is.

839
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,351
So,

840
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,588
that is why I made this decision.

841
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,425
I think we,

842
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,695
as people with more life experience,

843
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:42,532
should teach her

844
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,269
a lesson she won't forget.

845
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,105
What do you think?

846
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,419
You are right.

847
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,956
Who here would oppose you?

848
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:09,993
I support you all the way.

849
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,266
Okay.

850
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,510
Ms. Moon.

851
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,513
Did you see this article?

852
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:42,358
Geo Construction won't do it.

853
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,295
It's qualified.

854
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:46,796
You put that company in there.

855
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,600
It doesn't matter. If they are qualified,
they should be given a chance.

856
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,734
It'll be a chance for you.

857
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:55,438
You plan to inflate construction cost
and create Mr. Jang's slush fund.

858
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,607
You have a wild imagination.

859
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:00,043
Yi-kyung, let's be honest.

860
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,612
I don't feel like listening to someone
who coaxed his uncle

861
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,214
to do his bidding.

862
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,882
Leave my family matters to me...

863
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:08,985
Sorry.

864
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:12,522
Yes, Ms. Moon.

865
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,457
The chairman's sick bail
has been canceled.

866
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:19,662
It's on the news.

867
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,499
The prosecution sent people
to the hospital...

868
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,280
I'll become a villain.

869
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,615
I'll climb to the top

870
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,217
and look down on the world.

871
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,486
I'm sorry, because I'll make you stop.

872
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,322
So go back before it gets harder,
Yi-kyung.

873
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,858
So you need to make people
continue to want you.

874
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,460
If you can't,
you'll be discarded instantly.

875
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:26,863
I respect Ms. Seo.

876
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,799
I don't want to see her getting hurt.

877
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:33,670
That means the fight
needs to end soon, as you said.

878
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,606
I never forget something I once wanted,

879
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:39,008
whether it be clothes or people.

880
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,782
