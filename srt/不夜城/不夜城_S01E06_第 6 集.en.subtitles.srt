1
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,354
You insist

2
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,923
on disobeying me?

3
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,059
The Korean market has a bright future.

4
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,528
Compared to the forerunners,

5
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,863
it's already too late to join the race.

6
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:06,900
Everything is ready.

7
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,535
And

8
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,138
Mr. Jo and Ms. Kim will be going with me.

9
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,506
You brat.

10
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,009
How dare you! Without my permission!

11
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,711
I'm way too old to need your permission
to do business.

12
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:22,949
Yi-kyung.

13
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:28,922
Don't go

14
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,091
to Korea.

15
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,426
It isn't

16
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,696
a place where we belong.

17
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,566
Moo-il Park and Tae-joon Jang.

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,801
Because of them?

19
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,477
I found this in the safe room.

20
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,313
I heard what happened from Mr. Jo.

21
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,684
The trauma of being betrayed
by friends of 30 years.

22
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,753
I understand how you feel.

23
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:01,754
Not at all.

24
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,127
They're scumbags not worth
even taking revenge on.

25
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,829
I never said I'd take revenge.

26
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,333
I'm still thinking about it.

27
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,802
A cruel revenge

28
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,605
or a useful tool.

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,077
Which would be more helpful
in creating my own kingdom?

30
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,318
Yi-kyung Seo, the CEO of Gallery S
has arrived.

31
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,320
Yes. I'll send her in.

32
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,363
EPISODE 6

33
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,743
Hello.

34
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,546
Oh.

35
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,583
You've met before, haven't you?

36
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,984
We've met.

37
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,653
Thanks to you.

38
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,591
You even gave him
our gallery's transaction details.

39
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,526
Mr. Jang is waiting.

40
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,597
I thought I'd be seeing him
quietly, alone.

41
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,233
Isn't it quiet?

42
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,174
We lit the Olympic cauldron,

43
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,611
and the doves there caught on fire too.

44
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,413
Gosh, it was just...

45
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,483
"Switch the cameras to another scene!

46
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,118
Silence the foreign press."

47
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,954
The planners were all freaking out,

48
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,090
and then Moo-il says,

49
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,193
"Tae-joon, Bong-soo,

50
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,598
grilled doves go very well with soju."

51
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,775
Whether it was money or people,

52
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,244
the 88 Olympics

53
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,548
would not have been a success
without the three of us.

54
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,956
Seeing the two of you here
is making me emotional.

55
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:55,161
It seems like yesterday that Moo-il,
Bong-soo and I banded together.

56
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,766
Before I knew it, it became time
for the next generation to take over.

57
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:03,936
From now on,

58
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,073
be my right-hand men.

59
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,208
Sir.

60
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,047
Moojin Group has a special place
in Mr. Jang's heart.

61
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,450
Ms. Seo,
if you'd like to be of help to him,

62
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,954
you'll have to help Mr. Gun-woo Park
become the group's leader.

63
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,091
I'm not sure.

64
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,962
There's a better option for Moojin's sake.

65
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,031
I know.

66
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,200
Mr. Moo-sam Park is the nuisance.

67
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,937
You'll have to give in and cut him off--

68
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:38,938
That's fine.

69
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,709
I came to pull Mr. Jang's sleigh.

70
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,947
I don't want to run with another sled dog.

71
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:50,883
I can't

72
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,186
give in either.

73
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,393
If you want me to do great things,
please trust my judgment.

74
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,199
I'm sure you know with what determination
I came here.

75
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,469
The choice is yours to make.

76
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,093
Why don't you cut off my uncle
and stick to Mr. Jang?

77
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,496
Wasn't that your objective anyway?

78
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,097
He's the next chairman of Moojin Group.

79
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,101
You don't throw out a card like that
so carelessly.

80
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,202
Sure.

81
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,106
Yi-kyung Seo wouldn't just run
backdoor art deals.

82
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,244
You'll make my uncle chairman
and increase the pot.

83
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,580
You'll carry Mr. Jang on your back
and raise the bet.

84
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,250
That was

85
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,352
the plan you mentioned

86
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,521
to climb to the top.

87
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:03,956
Sorry,

88
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,793
but your name isn't in that plan.

89
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,795
I said I won't join you.

90
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:10,997
I feel the same.

91
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,571
-Mr. Gun-woo Park.
-I showed my hand.

92
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,141
Mr. Jang will decide
whether or not to call.

93
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:31,918
Around this time, two years ago,

94
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,321
the prosecutor investigated
Moojin Produce.

95
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,891
Internal transactions by subsidiaries,
rebates from subcontractors,

96
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,359
and Foreign Exchange Law violations.

97
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,529
I'm sure you know very well

98
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,499
just what Mr. Moo-sam Park is like.

99
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,301
That's why he's useful.

100
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,038
I don't work with people
who aren't greedy.

101
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,274
What about someone
who sells out his brother?

102
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,711
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

103
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,421
Hi.

104
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,523
How have you been?

105
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,226
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

106
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,630
Mr. Park, who obtained
internal information

107
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,232
approached the prosecutor for a deal.

108
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,268
In exchange for letting him go,

109
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,704
he sold out the big fish, Chairman Park.

110
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:28,808
Do you get it now?

111
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,378
The reason Mr. Jang doesn't trust
Mr. Moo-sam Park.

112
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:34,747
I guess

113
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,517
Gun-woo doesn't know about it.

114
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,987
If he did,
Moojin Group would've fallen apart.

115
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,991
Mr. Jang doesn't want that, either.

116
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,692
You should work with Gun-woo Park

117
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,895
for your sake.

118
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,398
You should convince Mr. Jang.

119
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,868
The person who will make his dream

120
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,871
of becoming the king's father

121
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,706
is me.

122
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,284
Yes, Ma'am.

123
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,252
Where's Mr. Jo?

124
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,187
He took Se-jin to the office in Yeoksam.

125
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,089
Tell him to come in. Tell Tak, too.

126
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,491
I didn't know we had a building
in a place like this.

127
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,861
Moving funds, investments.

128
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,230
Normal business is conducted here.

129
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,566
You'll be coming here often, too.

130
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,739
That's the entrance to the annex.

131
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,517
This way.

132
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,293
Hello, Ms. Kim. We just arrived.

133
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,329
An emergency?

134
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,033
Even if it's a single tree,

135
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,036
if you plant it on top of a mountain,

136
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,840
you can make it look down

137
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,144
on a thousand roads.

138
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,513
Is that a saying in Han Feizi?

139
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,322
I must choose one or the other.

140
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,160
Which tree

141
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,564
should I plant on my mountain?

142
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,367
Gun-woo?

143
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,237
Or the other child?

144
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,006
If you consider
only ambition and abilities,

145
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,309
wouldn't Ms. Seo be better?

146
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,714
A knife that is overly sharp
may cut its master.

147
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:28,921
Today,

148
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,325
I wish I could have some soju
with my old friends.

149
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,094
Don't give me that bull.

150
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:39,398
Moo-il, Gun-woo threatened me.
He threatened me.

151
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,599
Mr. Jang...

152
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,570
He said he'll work with him
to kick me out.

153
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,504
Moo-sam.

154
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,507
Watch what you say!

155
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,677
Gun-woo will cause a big trouble
if you don't do something.

156
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,580
You need to call him in
and give him a big scolding--

157
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,083
Aren't you the one who caused trouble?

158
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,820
Did you forget about being stabbed
and putting on an act?

159
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,823
Moo-il, that was...

160
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,859
Do you think I kicked out Gun-woo
because I like you?

161
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,496
I did that so that you can live,
feeding your greed,

162
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,200
and leave my child alone.

163
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,470
But what? Tae-joon Jang?

164
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,038
Moo-il.

165
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,341
Are you okay? Moo-il.

166
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,649
I know my own child.

167
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,019
No matter what kind of treats

168
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,089
Tae-joon offers him,

169
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,625
Gun-woo wouldn't fall for it.

170
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,430
I understand.

171
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,766
I'll come to Seongbuk soon.

172
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,838
You should go home early.

173
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,874
Be ready to work like crazy
starting tomorrow.

174
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,144
Sir.

175
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,847
I'm sure the chairman
will be disappointed.

176
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,258
When I left Japan

177
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:14,827
to say goodbye to my uncle,

178
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,764
this may have already been planned.

179
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,067
This fight

180
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,336
may be unavoidable.

181
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,507
Aren't we worrying for nothing?

182
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,409
It's Gun-woo Park, of all people.

183
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,645
He'd never.

184
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,380
It's too soon to relax.

185
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,517
Mr. Moo-sam Park may be the target,
but we may be hurt as well.

186
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,692
Everyone listen.

187
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,761
First, Ms. Kim,

188
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,096
obtain Moojin Group's data.

189
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:52,631
Yes, ma'am.

190
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,367
We need everything you can obtain
through the network.

191
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,204
Tak. Stay on Gun-woo Park.

192
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,907
Note where he goes, whom he sees,
round the clock.

193
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:02,942
That's not a problem.

194
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,311
If Mr. Jang gets involved,

195
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,147
the prosecutor's office or the FSS
may make a move.

196
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,248
We'll be ready.

197
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,584
What about me?

198
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,119
Be on standby in the office.

199
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,947
I never called you.

200
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,017
I'm learning the basics of financing
from Mr. Jo.

201
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,322
When Ms. Kim updates profiles,
I memorize them again,

202
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,191
and am learning how to use the computer.

203
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,427
Tak taught me a few self-defense moves.

204
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,230
They may seem like nothing to you,

205
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,199
but I'm trying hard.

206
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,338
I know you're stressed and upset
about Gun-woo Park.

207
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,474
Have me do anything.

208
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,509
I'll do well in your place.

209
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,480
In my place?

210
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,584
-I never did that.
-Sorry?

211
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,020
I never worried about someone
from the past,

212
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,856
and I don't wait for someone
to give me an order.

213
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,293
But what will you do in my place?

214
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,863
I was just worried about you.

215
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,109
From now on,

216
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,378
the real fight will begin.

217
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,548
The opponents are Tae-joon Jang

218
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,016
and Gun-woo Park.

219
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,219
Even I don't know

220
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,388
the power they hold.

221
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,524
Are you afraid?

222
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,026
Do you have a hard time sleeping
before a picnic

223
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:02,995
because you're afraid?

224
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,465
Don't be nervous.

225
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,300
Don't be anxious.

226
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,770
You are the universal key
that I kept hidden,

227
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,307
and the mirror that reflects me.

228
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:16,969
Chairman.

229
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,676
Chairman.

230
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,349
They say the position makes the person.

231
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,018
Even the great and mighty Chairman Son

232
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,787
is a powerless old man.

233
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,624
I wonder who will become the new chairman.

234
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:40,692
Don't tell me

235
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,028
you got a call from Mr. Jang.

236
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:45,831
No way.

237
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,566
Let's go.

238
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,250
Father.

239
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,186
Do you want to go golfing?

240
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,155
A few swings on the field

241
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,591
will make you feel much better.

242
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,232
Would it be a little cold?

243
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,037
Maybe a hot spring would be better.

244
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,974
We can soak in hot water and eat good food
for a few days.

245
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,976
Maybe we'll just go to Guam
or Hawaii, instead.

246
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,144
We can take Ma-ri, too.

247
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,355
Just hit me.

248
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,593
I blew the association's money
and disgraced your name.

249
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,295
It's all my fault this happened to you,

250
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,664
so beat me until you feel better!

251
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,003
Father.

252
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,781
Gosh.

253
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,713
Remember the guys who went to the shed
to take care of those Taiwanese guys?

254
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,249
Call them in.

255
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,688
What the crap are you trying to pull?

256
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:24,756
Rebates?

257
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,359
Who dares defame me?

258
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,329
The 2011 contract with Myungjin Logics.

259
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,437
The 2012 company system replacement
by Sungil Networks.

260
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,973
-There's something from 2013 too, correct?
-Yes.

261
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,609
Take the ledgers and computers
of everyone involved.

262
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,544
Pay attention. Don't miss a thing.

263
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:47,846
Let's finish up and go.

264
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,230
Gun-woo, you punk.

265
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:09,835
You covered up my flaw for the sake
of the company's reputation.

266
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,770
I'll return the favor.

267
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,240
Let's take care of it quietly internally.

268
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,176
Let's not ruin the company name.

269
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,213
Don't tell me...

270
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,715
Did Mr. Jang tipped you off?

271
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:27,919
Sorry, but the woman who said
she'd make you chairman

272
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,222
failed in the preliminaries.

273
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,365
My poor brother.

274
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,303
He trusts wholeheartedly in his son.

275
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,204
Goodness.

276
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,208
He failed at managing his brother.

277
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,244
He can't expect much from his child.

278
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,181
It's too late for me anyway,
so I'll give up on being a good son.

279
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,684
I'll pursue being a good employee instead.

280
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,754
Oh, it looks like the personnel committee
plans to reconsider

281
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,423
my reassignment.

282
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,826
Word gets out quickly.

283
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,862
Maybe they heard about Mr. Jang already.

284
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,067
I should redecorate this place.

285
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:26,044
I've never been this humiliated before
in my life.

286
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,780
Gun-woo brought the Auditing Team

287
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,683
and emptied out my office
and the secretaries' offices.

288
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,954
-What a relief.
-What?

289
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,990
You wouldn't be able to call like this
if the prosecutor got involved.

290
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,328
Gun-woo must care a great deal
about his uncle.

291
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,397
Look here, Yi-kyung!

292
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,332
You're partly to blame in this!

293
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,936
You said it would be smooth sailing
once you met Mr. Jang!

294
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,806
That's when I didn't know you completely.

295
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,008
What?

296
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:58,577
What do you mean?

297
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,012
You handle your own family matters.

298
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,082
I'm busy looking after my company.

299
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,021
Rude brat.

300
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,561
Moojin Group Chairman Moo-Il Park
Indicted for Tax Evasion

301
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,102
You need to go to the office in Yeoksam.

302
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,439
The Financial Supervisory Service
is doing a special on-site audit.

303
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,212
You craft each line of codes to get in.

304
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,515
It takes creativity in its own way.

305
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,151
That's why people say I'm a writer.

306
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,920
Can you get in anywhere you want?

307
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,691
What? Yes. No.
Well, you can't do everything.

308
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,773
I'm the CEO of Gallery S, Yi-kyung Seo.

309
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,877
I'm Woo-sung Choi, auditing team manager
of the Financial Supervisory Service

310
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,880
Sorry to interfere with business,
but we'd appreciate your cooperation.

311
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,049
-Mr. Jo.
-Yes?

312
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:15,020
Move them into a larger room and give them
every document they request.

313
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,957
It looks like it won't end that quickly.

314
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,569
Gun-woo.

315
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,138
He's being harsh from the start.

316
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,940
Don't you think Mr. Jang got involved?

317
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:36,842
It doesn't matter who it is.

318
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,578
Call Chief Heo
from the Financial Supervisory Service.

319
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,180
Yes, ma'am. I'll find out what's going on.

320
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,188
The interview is running long.

321
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,656
Why don't you come another time?

322
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,093
Did you instruct them to strike Gallery S?

323
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:56,995
Oh, that.

324
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,732
The director of
the auditing team is my old friend.

325
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,435
You shouldn't do that all by yourself.

326
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,071
I said let's tie up my uncle first,

327
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,039
since that is the proper step.

328
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,810
Mr. Park.
We are not competing in the Olympics.

329
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:15,680
Wait for the whistle and fight
fair and square by the rules?

330
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,918
There is no such thing
as a beautiful loss.

331
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,520
Once the fight has begun,

332
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,624
you must win, no matter what.

333
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,659
That's your style.

334
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,095
I'll go with my pace.

335
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,864
From now on,

336
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,634
don't attack Yi-kyung
without my permission.

337
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,182
Gun-woo Park speaking.

338
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,222
Hold on. Hold on.

339
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,393
Hey, you. Will you go to
the office in Yeoksam?

340
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,095
I need to know what's going on,

341
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,897
so that I'll be less nervous.

342
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,533
Don't worry. Ms. Seo will handle it.

343
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,970
Look at this girl.

344
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,940
The Financial Supervisory Service auditors
are like the angel of death to us.

345
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:50,909
Gosh.

346
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,978
No one in this world is spotless.

347
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,279
Ms. Seo is.

348
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,880
She is, thorough and thorough.

349
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,587
How can you be reading right now?

350
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,090
They're documents on Moojin Group
and Gun-woo Park.

351
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:07,726
Tak said,

352
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,228
"know the enemy, know yourself
and you will never lose."

353
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:12,564
Enemy?

354
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,434
I'm sure the audit has something to do
with Gun-woo Park.

355
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,437
That means he's Ms. Seo's enemy.

356
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,312
-Hello?
-We're police officers.

357
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:28,847
Excuse me?

358
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,585
It's freezing cold.

359
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,788
I said let's meet at a nice bar.

360
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:10,789
What is it?

361
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,158
What do you have on my uncle?

362
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,427
Put your fangs away.

363
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,462
We may end up helping each other.

364
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,067
Recently,

365
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,103
I got a very good reason,

366
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,238
so I'm getting back at Yi-kyung.

367
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,107
To start it off,

368
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,444
I cut off one of her subordinates.

369
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:37,282
The police?

370
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:38,850
Se-jin? Why?

371
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,654
There was a record on his phone
of a call with our company.

372
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,490
Those Taiwanese guys.

373
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,027
Se-jin is on the line. I'll connect you.

374
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,663
Ma'am, it's me.

375
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,133
She followed them since they said
they just need a few statements.

376
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,603
Se-jin said not to call you
because you'll worry,

377
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,239
but my heart is racing so much right now.

378
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,212
Call the police and find out
which detective is in charge.

379
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,782
Send our attorney straight there
as soon as you reach him.

380
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,859
More auditors came.

381
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,428
I think they plan to investigate
all through the night.

382
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:25,697
What did Chief Heo say?

383
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,232
He said it's out of his hands.

384
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,000
The director ordered it himself.

385
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:38,710
Ma'am.

386
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,979
The documents are clean, right?

387
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,714
We prepared for this, but...

388
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,016
Tell Tak to come in.

389
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,725
On the prior day, you called
to discuss the artwork transaction.

390
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,594
I work at the gallery,
so I do that all the time.

391
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,031
There was another call the next day.

392
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,400
The matter at the hotel didn't work out.

393
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:06,070
"Let's do better next time."
It was something like that.

394
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,177
But what is this case about?

395
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,046
Those people left the country already.

396
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,347
One did,

397
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:17,916
but the other one

398
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:20,718
died.

399
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,756
He died?

400
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,193
A passport and cell phone were found
in the bag with the body.

401
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,265
The tip was right.
It was close to the scene.

402
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,203
The forensics guys just went.

403
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,706
There were burn marks on the body.

404
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:45,109
There was an explosion
at a storage shed nearby that night.

405
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,744
Do you know anything about it?

406
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:54,552
Ms. Se-jin Lee.

407
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,888
You were at the shed, weren't you?

408
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,704
What the hell is this?

409
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:34,092
We even left the gun
where they can see it.

410
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,160
She can't get out of this one.

411
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:41,132
Anyway, while I was trying to frame
that chick Se-jin Lee,

412
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,801
I remembered.

413
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,804
The Taiwanese guy that Yi-kyung borrowed.

414
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,876
I heard Moo-sam Park
was attacked by a stranger.

415
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,979
And you took the fall for it.

416
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:00,018
It's obvious, isn't it?

417
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,454
If we tighten the leash around him
for fabricating that incident--

418
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:04,389
Get out.

419
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,025
-What?
-I said to get out.

420
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,393
My ears are about to rot.

421
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,198
Hey, Gun-woo.

422
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:17,735
I'm being nice.

423
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,371
Don't treat me like a fool.

424
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,707
I heard Moo-sam Park
was attacked by a stranger.

425
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,843
And you took the fall for it.

426
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,146
Yi-kyung is a cruel woman.

427
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,082
She knew it was a trap,

428
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:05,950
but she sent a replacement.

429
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:09,153
Go back before it gets harder, Yi-kyung.

430
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,425
You said this was your dream.

431
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,428
You can't even pursue your own dream,

432
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,064
but what, you'll stop me?

433
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,469
If I were going to let you break me,
I wouldn't have even made it here.

434
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,574
Gun-woo,

435
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,911
you can't win this fight.

436
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,586
A monster can't lose

437
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,088
to a human.

438
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:54,599
So, you passed out at the hotel,
and you were in that shed?

439
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:55,967
I told you already.

440
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,102
They mistook me for Ms. Seo.

441
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,371
Chunha Financing.

442
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,106
Investigate them first.

443
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,710
We'll take care of that.
Don't worry about it.

444
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,581
The two Taiwanese men fought among
themselves and then the place exploded.

445
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:12,984
It wasn't you who shot it?

446
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:14,152
Shoot if you can!

447
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:18,689
I told you, I didn't.

448
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:22,593
The fingerprint identification is
in process, so we'll find out soon.

449
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,263
Ms. Se-jin Lee.

450
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,801
If your fingerprints are found
on that gun,

451
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,837
it'll be murder based on
willful negligence.

452
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,506
It is a serious crime!

453
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,277
So,

454
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,680
tell me the truth, will you?

455
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,116
-Detective.
-That's right.

456
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,285
There could have been
extenuating circumstances.

457
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:51,322
Other than...

458
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:54,792
being poor,

459
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,361
I did nothing wrong.

460
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,335
It was Gi-tae Son's doing.

461
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,604
Otherwise, they wouldn't have found

462
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,005
the passport, cell phone and gun.

463
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,207
Keep it down.

464
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,142
She knows already.

465
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,845
Do you know Gun-woo Park
met with Gi-tae Son?

466
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,381
Are you sure?

467
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,083
The camera will prove what I saw.

468
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,151
I have it on camera.

469
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,988
They teamed up in order to get you.

470
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,994
What are you doing?
We need to get the kid out first.

471
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,096
There's a problem in Yeoksam office, too.

472
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,198
-What?
-Remember the account

473
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,399
we received from Chunha?

474
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,668
Some of them are problematic.

475
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,704
Normally, they may let it slide,

476
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,307
but given how targeted this audit is...

477
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,688
Let's take care of them one at a time,

478
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,024
in the order of importance.

479
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,695
I went to the hotel in Ms. Seo's place,

480
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,798
and those people...

481
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,735
Wake up and talk clearly.

482
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,853
I've prepared something.
Please take a look.

483
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,194
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

484
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,428
I told you.

485
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,198
I escaped when the fire broke out.

486
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:42,867
I don't know the rest.

487
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:55,913
Ma'am?

488
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:56,914
What are you doing here?

489
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,383
I told you to be on standby at the office.

490
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,454
I know.

491
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,424
I look a bit...

492
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:08,960
-Right?
-Hold your head up.

493
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:12,830
Sit up straight.

494
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:17,735
Much better.

495
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,783
My aunt will be worried.

496
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,652
Ms. Kim already called her.

497
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:36,821
You're away on business.

498
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,856
I avoided a back slap.

499
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,295
I'm sorry.

500
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:49,333
The company has been attacked by a bomb
and I'm unable to do anything.

501
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,235
Then get out and get to work.

502
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:52,570
We should

503
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,872
return that bomb.

504
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,841
There may be fingerprints on the gun.

505
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,044
They say if they find mine on it,

506
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:01,912
it'll go straight to court.

507
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,147
Will you just sit there and die

508
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,017
like a loser,
while being someone's double?

509
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,655
I couldn't sit there and just die

510
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,357
like a loser,
while being someone's double.

511
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,261
There will be

512
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,464
no fingerprints.

513
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,139
If it fails online, they'll go offline.

514
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:40,451
Money is the world's strongest eraser.

515
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,192
THE FINGERPRINTS ARE A MATCH.

516
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,833
Whether it's memories or records,

517
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,268
it erases them completely.

518
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,336
MATCH SUCCEEDED
MATCH FAILED

519
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,303
FAILED
NO MATCH FOUND

520
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,138
Even if you don't like it, tough.

521
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,841
That is the best way to get you out.

522
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,447
I can breathe now.

523
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,551
I wondered how I'd escape from prison
if things went south.

524
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,854
I wondered if I should
draw a map on my body

525
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,956
and dig my way out with a spoon

526
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,192
like in the movies.

527
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,628
At most, it'll be 48 hours.

528
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:26,430
Hang in there.

529
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,133
I'm not afraid at all.

530
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:31,836
I'm not anxious, either.

531
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:33,704
I'm not nervous.

532
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:39,543
You would've been the same
if you were the one in here.

533
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,295
This is

534
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,931
-from before...
-It's my lucky charm.

535
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,001
The one yen
that is more important than my life.

536
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,171
I'll lend it to you interest-free.

537
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,417
Thank you for not charging interest,

538
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,352
but sorry.

539
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,488
You don't lend money without collateral.

540
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:26,857
Se-jin.

541
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,927
You are my collateral.

542
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,622
Ms. Se-jin Lee.

543
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:47,905
Huh?

544
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,341
Look at you.

545
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:51,909
Where's my tofu?

546
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,211
Tofu's only for people
released from prison.

547
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:57,982
-You brat.
-Ouch.

548
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,918
Hey. Wait. I didn't teach you that
to use on your master.

549
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:02,052
-Let go.
-No.

550
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,621
-Let go!
-No, you brat.

551
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,089
Hey, let go of me.

552
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,857
-I won't.
-Let go!

553
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,492
My arm hurts.

554
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,262
Se-jin just got out. I'll take her home.

555
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,130
No, ma'am. I'll come to work.

556
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,431
Rest at home today.

557
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,934
See? She says to rest.

558
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,569
I'm fine.

559
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,071
You'll be exhausted starting tomorrow.
Be ready.

560
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,874
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow, then.

561
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:44,662
Yes?

562
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,003
We don't need tea.

563
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,849
Should I say I'm happy to see you
or shocked?

564
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,154
-Sit.
-Good news, bad news.

565
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,423
Which first?

566
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:15,059
They say it's better to get the worst
out of the way first,

567
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,327
but I'd rather take it later.

568
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:21,031
I decided to challenge you properly

569
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,433
starting now.

570
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,503
-And the bad news?
-I plan

571
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,340
to work very hard at it.

572
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,645
You must be upset about the audit.

573
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,047
But luckily, they didn't shut you down.

574
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,517
A few million won in fines is generous.

575
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,286
Why did you drag Se-jin into it?

576
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,054
Who?

577
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,459
Oh, the other Yi-kyung Seo?
What about her?

578
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,061
To start it off,

579
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,365
I cut off one of her subordinates.

580
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,969
-What happened?
-Let's not ask what we know.

581
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,138
Do you think

582
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,073
I was behind it?

583
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,589
-Yi-kyung, this was--
-This is our fight.

584
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,526
Don't touch her.

585
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,699
I'll give you a big gift very soon.

586
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,702
I hope you like it.

587
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,038
Yi-kyung.

588
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,643
I don't know if you want revenge
or business,

589
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,012
but choose your methods wisely.

590
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,549
Even if you lie to yourself
that you're a monster,

591
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,885
you're still human.

592
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,386
Just wait for the gift.

593
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:13,944
Se-jin Lee.

594
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:26,623
That's right.

595
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:28,959
Don't forget

596
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,728
that name.

597
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:54,451
Hey, it's me.

598
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:57,721
Really?

599
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,924
Good job. Let's grab soju next time.

600
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,101
Take a cab from here.

601
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,537
-Why?
-I need to meet someone. Go.

602
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,906
-Who?
-You're so annoying.

603
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:18,675
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

604
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:20,144
Happy?

605
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,479
A jerk like you has a girlfriend?

606
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:24,982
Have you ever been in a relationship?

607
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,020
Do you see that car? Please follow it.

608
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,618
It doesn't taste good.
The food doesn't taste good.

609
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:37,354
Just eat what I buy you.
Have you ever earned money before?

610
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:41,425
I'm just saying it tasted bad
because it did. What's your problem?

611
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,228
Hey. Ma-ri!

612
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:50,601
Se-jin.

613
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:52,936
What are you doing here?

614
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:55,072
I don't have business with you.

615
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,141
How have you been?

616
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,378
You know I wasn't well, don't you?

617
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:02,613
You got out somehow.

618
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,348
Did Yi-kyung send you?

619
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:08,151
Tell her to come herself,
if she has something to say.

620
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,254
Ms. Seo is busy.

621
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:13,724
Plus, she's on a whole different level
than you.

622
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,994
Hey. Se-jin. Watch it.

623
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,029
I came to warn him.

624
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,003
Do you see our employee in that car?

625
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,041
Those men are also our employees.

626
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,035
-Shit.
-Really?

627
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,404
Girlfriend?

628
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,573
What do you have in your brain?

629
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,209
-Hey.
-Did you want to take my place

630
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,344
and go to prison?

631
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:13,784
Will you tell Ms. Seo?

632
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,856
Do whatever you want.
I'll just be yelled at.

633
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:24,695
Still,

634
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,463
I feel

635
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:28,332
pretty good.

636
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,804
Don't jump to conclusions.
I didn't do it for you.

637
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,018
Huh?

638
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,121
You have a visitor.

639
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:07,270
Are you

640
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,607
really Bong-soo's daughter?

641
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,282
I heard you were here,

642
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:23,387
but I didn't know I'd see you like this.

643
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,589
Have a seat.

644
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:34,865
Sure.

645
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,601
Your eyes and mouth

646
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,103
are just like Bong-soo's.

647
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,709
How is he doing?

648
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:48,912
How do you think he is doing?

649
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,650
Does he

650
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,486
still resent me a lot?

651
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:02,259
I did a lot of wrong against him.

652
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:05,829
Just the word Korea,

653
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,765
probably makes your father sick.

654
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,302
Well,

655
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:16,440
I guess it's justice.
I think that's why I'm being punished.

656
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,275
A nice single room.

657
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,710
A medical staff standing by
24 hours a day.

658
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:24,414
Special visitation rights
regular prisoners can't even dream of.

659
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:27,217
This is a vacation,

660
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,386
not a punishment.

661
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:35,392
If you really want to repent,
you should do it outside.

662
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:37,794
What do you mean?

663
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,198
Gun-woo Park

664
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,169
is working under Mr. Jang.

665
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,675
If you leave it this way,
Moojin will be split into two.

666
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,878
As long as Gun-woo
is receiving Mr. Jang's support,

667
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,048
Mr. Moo-sam Park won't sit still.

668
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,551
Why would Gun-woo do such a thing...

669
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,655
Wait.

670
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,091
How do you know so well?

671
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,994
This is all within the group.

672
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,463
I am also operating a tiny shop.

673
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:16,800
And I've know Mr. Moo-sam Park
for a while, too.

674
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:21,771
You're the only person who can fix this.

675
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:23,807
Let go.

676
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,111
Give in and say you'll give up
the Dubai business.

677
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:31,148
That way, you can get sick bail.

678
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,757
You betrayed a friend
to build Moojin Group.

679
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,295
You can't let it collapse like this.

680
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:49,332
Leave this place.

681
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,335
That'll be the beginning

682
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:54,804
of your repentance toward my father.

683
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,502
KOREA-JAPAN CO-OP NIGHT
1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS

684
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:27,504
Gun-woo Park

685
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:31,641
is working under Mr. Jang.

686
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,587
KOREA-JAPAN CO-OP NIGHT
1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS

687
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,087
It's my lucky charm.

688
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,023
The one yen
that is more important than my life.

689
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,425
I'll lend it to you interest-free.

690
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,529
Thank you for not charging interest,

691
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:28,365
but sorry.

692
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,601
You don't lend money without collateral.

693
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,637
Se-jin.

694
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:36,740
You are my collateral.

695
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:43,413
Japanese money?

696
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,283
Did you go to Japan for work?

697
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,485
No, I didn't.

698
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:50,086
I'm right.

699
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:51,688
Let me see.

700
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,423
Get lost.

701
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,491
Song-mi.

702
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,160
Your exams start next week.
Shouldn't you be studying?

703
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:01,097
Everyone's always picking on me.

704
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:02,632
You brat.

705
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,408
I saw Suk's mom this afternoon.

706
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,642
Did you renew?

707
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:14,911
Yes.

708
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,949
We can finally sleep peacefully now.

709
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,019
Tell your boss

710
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:25,021
that we are ever so grateful

711
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,723
over and over again.

712
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:28,858
Okay.

713
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,027
Let's drink to celebrate.

714
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:32,462
Yes?

715
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:33,463
Yes.

716
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,265
With seaweed.

717
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:41,638
Isn't there anything else?

718
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,207
MOOJIN GROUP

719
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:45,608
Mr. Park!

720
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:52,349
Moojin Group's chairman
Moo-il Park, who is in custody

721
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:55,318
while being investigated for charges
including embezzlement and tax evasion,

722
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,355
left the detention center today
and was admitted

723
00:55:58,555 --> 00:55:59,723
into Dongsan Hospital in Seoul.

724
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,992
We will connect to our reporter
on the scene.

725
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:04,327
Moo-il Park Out on Sick Bail

726
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,096
The Department of Justice

727
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:09,299
stated that his health worsened
due to his high blood pressure,

728
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,867
pneumonia, depression, and other ailments,

729
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:13,737
and stated that detention is not required.

730
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:18,842
Dongsan Hospital's diagnosis
of Chairman Park's condition

731
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,277
will determine whether or not
he will qualify for sick bail.

732
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:24,280
A spokesperson from the court
stated that Chairman Park

733
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,715
has not been in good health...

734
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,385
Please have a seat.

735
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:31,888
I want to knock over everything here,
but what?

736
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:33,490
You want me to sit?

737
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:36,326
You really don't listen to others.

738
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,362
I asked you

739
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,998
not to drop by here because

740
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:43,666
people are watching.

741
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:47,570
Moo-il's sick bail

742
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:49,305
was your doing, wasn't it?

743
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,174
I just confirmed it.

744
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:55,011
Shit.

745
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,648
What are you up to?

746
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,050
If you keep disrespecting me,

747
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,119
I can't work with you.

748
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,389
Then what?

749
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:10,026
Will you run to the prosecutor
and cut a deal again?

750
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,997
You don't even have your brother's
corruption to offer up anymore.

751
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:18,635
Trust me and follow me.

752
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:22,939
If you keep suspecting the path,
you'll fall.

753
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,509
I'm just worried that I'm wasting my time.

754
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:28,011
No.

755
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:30,013
Chairman Moo-il Park

756
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:31,848
can't keep his position.

757
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:35,518
But Gun-woo Park
won't be claiming it either.

758
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:39,422
Se-jin, come here.

759
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:47,597
Introduce yourself.

760
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:52,569
I'm Se-jin Lee.

761
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,206
Whenever I'm away,

762
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,374
she will take my role.

763
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,078
She will be the new hidden card.

764
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,204
Father.

765
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,643
Stop working with Tae-joon!

766
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,021
He just left.

767
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:46,689
Moo-sam Park...

768
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,993
will betray me someday.

769
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:53,997
I'm sure he's wary, too,

770
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:57,367
worrying when he will

771
00:58:58,334 --> 00:58:59,769
get stabbed in his back.

772
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,106
You're on the same side
only while you need each other.

773
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,208
Is that it?

774
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:09,779
That's right.

775
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,383
So you need to make people
continue to want you.

776
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:15,485
If you can't,

777
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:17,720
you'll be discarded right away.

778
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,022
Rest assured.

779
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:21,424
I won't discard you,

780
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,360
since you're always important to me.

781
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,264
Since we dragged the old lion
out of its cage,

782
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:30,900
the bloody fight will begin now.

783
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:33,670
In order to fight,

784
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:36,306
you must become

785
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,509
absolutely necessary to someone.

786
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:42,912
Pardon? To whom?

787
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,814
Tae-joon, that punk,

788
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:47,116
is a monster wearing human skin!

789
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:50,587
I won't watch my own son

790
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:53,323
be a pawn in his little game!

791
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:01,297
It's nice being scolded

792
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:03,299
on the outside.

793
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,069
You're more energetic
than in the detention center.

794
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:07,370
Gun-woo!

795
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,638
The Auditing Team

796
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:11,674
barely stopped Uncle from his rampage.

797
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,611
Both inside the company and out,

798
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:16,980
I have more people on my side.

799
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,550
I benefited from Mr. Jang
when I needed him.

800
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,019
I can't turn my back on him
because things have changed.

801
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:25,088
He's just using you

802
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,590
to take over the group!

803
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:28,992
You have to know.

804
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,495
You were used all your life.

805
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:34,931
Gun-woo Park.

806
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:37,934
Steal him.

807
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:18,074
Do you really not care?

808
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,044
He's just one of the obstacles in my way.

809
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,312
I'd like your help with something.

810
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:26,582
Did you predict Gun-woo would approach me?

811
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:29,152
Will you let your life end
just being used by Yi-kyung?

812
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:32,088
I'm sure she has an axe to grind.

813
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:35,491
It's meaningless
if she can't realize her real ambition.

814
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:38,227
It'll be her final test.

815
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:39,562
Guess.

816
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:41,898
Whom do you think I'm here to seduce?

817
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:48,504
