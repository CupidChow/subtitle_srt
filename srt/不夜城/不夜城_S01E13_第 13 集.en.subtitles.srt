1
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,743
No matter how brave a herbivore is,

2
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,945
it only becomes prey to carnivores.

3
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,151
Run away while you can.

4
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,420
Both you and Gun-woo.

5
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,422
I think we should teach her

6
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,992
a lesson she won't forget.

7
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,027
The chairman's sick bail
has been canceled.

8
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,830
It's on the news.

9
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,232
The prosecution sent people
to the hospital...

10
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,741
Chairman Moo-il Park of Moojin Group,
who was accused of crimes

11
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,709
including embezzling
over a hundred billion won,

12
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:20,246
was incarcerated 32 days
after being released on sick bail.

13
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,416
Last week,
members of the National Assembly

14
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,786
held a press conference requesting
a reevaluation of his sick bail.

15
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,488
Meanwhile, Moojin Group

16
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,823
cannot hide their shock

17
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,258
at the sudden
cancellation of his sick bail.

18
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,294
They criticize the move as being

19
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,131
an unreasonable attack on a corporation
by the government.

20
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,299
Let's go to Seongbuk.

21
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,468
EPISODE 13

22
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,871
I went to the hospital,

23
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,407
and he was already transferred
back to the prison.

24
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,709
He cannot even take any visitors yet.

25
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,444
What happened?

26
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,513
I found out through the news too.

27
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,181
-Uncle!
-Hey, punk.

28
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,884
What would I gain
by sending Moo-il back to the prison?

29
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,920
I'm your father's brother.

30
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,857
Like you said, no matter what,
we're still brothers.

31
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,992
It looked like Yi-kyung
didn't know, either.

32
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:09,829
I guess that means Mr. Jang did this.

33
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,698
Why would he?

34
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,969
What do you plan to do?

35
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,772
I need to get Father out.

36
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,443
Whether I make a deal or fight,
I need to see Mr. Jang.

37
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,614
You stay out of it. I'll handle this.

38
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,816
I told you.

39
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,851
I'm a member of the family too.

40
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:38,224
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave a message...

41
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,962
Ms. Seo isn't picking up.

42
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,664
I can't reach Mr. Park, either.

43
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,833
If his sick bail was canceled,

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,568
he needs to go to trial again, right?

45
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:49,769
Most likely,

46
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,238
he will be sentenced to time in prison.

47
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,520
Winters don't feel like winters anymore.

48
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,956
In the past, when a cold wave hit,

49
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,592
the Han River used to freeze over.

50
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,262
The temperature is
above zero today, right?

51
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,865
Thanks to you, it is subzero now.

52
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:21,935
Chairman Moo-il Park.

53
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,704
Why did you send him back?

54
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,675
You should've discussed it with me
if he needed to be dealt with.

55
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,878
I just went back to the basics.

56
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,247
I do the politics,

57
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,283
and you handle everything else.

58
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,554
Wasn't that our initial agreement?

59
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,756
I asked why you canceled

60
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,426
his sick bail.

61
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:50,029
The father should take responsibility
when his son makes a mistake.

62
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,565
I couldn't just trust you

63
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,568
and ignore what he did.

64
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,440
He dared dig into my business.

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,208
It was Mr. Jang's decision.

66
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,110
You should take a step back.

67
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,781
This time, it'll be one step.
Next time, it'll be two steps.

68
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,518
That's how you plan to push me out, right?

69
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,188
There's no need to be anxious.

70
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,825
I won't get rid of you.

71
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,093
However,

72
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,929
you'll work as well as you can

73
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,965
within the realm that I permit.

74
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,234
You want meaningless loyalty.

75
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,037
I came to help you.

76
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,307
I mean, you must help me
in the way I want.

77
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,809
You should follow my plan.

78
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,183
Nam.

79
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,351
Yes, sir.

80
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,087
Take back all the accounts

81
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,857
that you gave her.

82
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,763
Thanks for your hard work up to now.

83
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,402
I hope you won't regret this.

84
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,572
They say half of the parent's fate

85
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,275
belongs to the child, don't they?

86
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,478
Just like Bong-soo,

87
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,882
you will leave empty-handed.

88
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,228
It would be much easier
if you'd take a step back.

89
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,097
You bring hardship upon yourself.

90
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,468
This is what you wanted.

91
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,471
He is a generous person.

92
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,340
Tell him that you will serve him,

93
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,974
and he will forgive you.

94
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,609
I will return the accounts to you.

95
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,154
Is there no room for negotiation?

96
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,589
It was a declaration of war,

97
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,424
meaning compromise is unnecessary.

98
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,061
He thinks it's done.

99
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,931
He has no idea he's ruining it himself.

100
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,615
What about Mr. Jang?

101
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,318
He is busy preparing
for the Minwoo Club panel.

102
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,054
He says he has nothing
to say to you anyway.

103
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,124
Are you saying he plans to ignore
my brother in there?

104
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,594
It's up to the judicial branch.
What could he do?

105
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,628
Mr. Jong-gyu Nam.

106
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,198
What are you doing to a sickly old man?

107
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,668
If he wants to retaliate,
he should take it out on me.

108
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,804
Retaliate?

109
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,073
Please watch what you say.

110
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,178
You and Mr. Jang

111
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,147
targeted the wrong person.

112
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,418
Gun-woo, we didn't come here to fight.

113
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,286
You should talk quietly with him--

114
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,221
These people have no intent of undoing it.

115
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,424
They want to mess with our company

116
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,591
and our family.

117
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,861
Tell Mr. Jang.

118
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,832
This time, I will take aim at him.

119
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,138
I have good news for you.

120
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,074
Ms. Yi-kyung Seo

121
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,377
will no longer be able to interfere

122
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,479
with Moojin Group's affairs.

123
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,216
It will leave a huge blow this time.

124
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,686
It's difficult to predict
where and how it will strike.

125
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,189
Keep doing what you have been.

126
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,758
If you notice anything unusual,
report to me right away.

127
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,928
Ma'am.

128
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,397
Is this related

129
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,033
to our helping Se-jin?

130
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,506
No, it isn't.

131
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,142
It would've happened eventually.

132
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,177
It's just that it has begun.

133
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,011
SE-JIN

134
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,858
SE-JIN

135
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,568
Ma'am.

136
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,036
What is it?

137
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,105
I saw the news.

138
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,807
I was worried all day,
but I couldn't reach Gun-woo.

139
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,544
I thought you'd know something.

140
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,179
-Se-jin.
-Yes?

141
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,581
Stop freaking out.

142
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,784
Oh. Sorry.

143
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,020
I shouldn't have called like this.

144
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,721
Don't worry about Gun-woo.

145
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:16,989
He'll take care of it.

146
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,292
I know. I do, but--

147
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,260
Don't bother worrying about others.
Just do your work.

148
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,296
Don't bother trying to console--

149
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,798
They are a waste of time
which make no money, right?

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,968
You know

151
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,404
I like doing stupid things.

152
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,172
It's nothing to be proud of.

153
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,310
Are you

154
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,579
all right?

155
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,051
-Ma'am?
-Don't do what you like to do anymore.

156
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,421
You left, saying you'll handle it
your way.

157
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,690
Then you should stick to your decision.

158
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,927
It's annoying playing along.

159
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,256
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

160
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,365
Hi.

161
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:36,936
Sit.

162
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:45,978
What are you doing?

163
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,214
The sky isn't falling.

164
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,023
Did you sleep well?

165
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,626
It isn't my first time here or anything.

166
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,230
I slept well and I'm eating well.

167
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,297
What about your cough?

168
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,599
It's not so bad.

169
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:16,242
Are you visiting your dad in prison
or at his grave?

170
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,176
Stop frowning.

171
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,413
It wasn't Uncle.

172
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,948
It wasn't Yi-kyung, either.

173
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,452
It was Mr. Jang.

174
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:28,888
I knew

175
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,724
it was him.

176
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:37,196
When he said he'd reenter politics,

177
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,466
it meant he'd do all sorts
of wicked things again.

178
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:42,601
I...

179
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,671
poked at Mr. Jang's weakness.

180
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,910
You were struck by the bullet in my place.

181
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,451
Then will it end with my coming here?

182
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,351
No.

183
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,088
It'll probably start for real now.

184
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,990
I won't just take it, either.

185
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,693
Even if I try to stop you,

186
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,997
it's not like you will stop. Right?

187
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,669
He is a total snake.

188
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,806
Don't fall for anything he says.

189
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,641
Don't be fooled.

190
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,745
Keep that in mind.

191
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,047
Okay.

192
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,125
Mr. Park, where are you?

193
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,194
We need to investigate Collins Co. again.

194
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,629
Please come to the studio now.

195
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:51,971
Ma'am.

196
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,141
At the Yeoksam office...

197
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,619
Agents from both FSS and IRS are here.

198
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,087
Who's dealing with them there?

199
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,489
Director Jung and Mr. Lee are,

200
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,892
but the department for
non performing loans is being targeted.

201
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,928
It isn't anything we didn't expect.
Calm down.

202
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:17,963
Yes, ma'am.

203
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,400
Check the range of investigation
and their authority carefully.

204
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,968
Do not cooperate any more than necessary.

205
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,137
I'll head over now.

206
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,138
Yes, ma'am.

207
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,443
They are targeting
non performing loans department only.

208
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,513
The operations documents should be fine,
since the FSS was there recently.

209
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,982
Those people could find flaws
that don't exist.

210
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,050
Check again,

211
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,686
and contact Mr. Jo
if there's anything that may be a problem.

212
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:41,587
I will.

213
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,255
Come with me.

214
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,223
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,026
Goodness.

216
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,597
If the FSS and IRS are
investigating jointly,

217
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,366
even most large corporations
can't survive.

218
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,702
Even the penalty
has been decided internally.

219
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,771
A six-month suspension of business.

220
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,141
But in our industry,

221
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,609
that's like asking them to shut down.

222
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,680
Mr. Jang always stresses the importance
of rewarding those who serve him.

223
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,617
You should be rewarded for your work
in preparing the new foundation.

224
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,487
If Yi-kyung shuts down--

225
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,488
Somebody

226
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,291
will have to purchase it for cheap.

227
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,179
I spoke with Chief Heo
at the Financial Supervisory Service.

228
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,680
It was probably ordered from above.

229
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,349
That's correct.

230
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,416
And?

231
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,120
He said to expect a six-month suspension
from conducting business.

232
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:49,955
That's absurd!

233
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,523
That's like telling us to close down.

234
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,860
-Ma'am.
-Quiet.

235
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,965
Take care of things here.

236
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,166
Yes, ma'am.

237
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,218
Are you quitting here?

238
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,387
I heard from Ma-ri

239
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,290
that we can't stay here
any longer, anyway.

240
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,426
I heard Gi-tae Son told her
to kick us out immediately.

241
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,698
Thank you for all your help

242
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,933
and your hard work.

243
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,303
I'll put this in the car.

244
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:38,637
Okay.

245
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,043
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,445
I was reckless.

247
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,548
I should've known
whom we were going up against.

248
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,517
I was naive.

249
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:56,088
I'm terribly sorry about the chairman's
sick bail being canceled.

250
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,460
Se-jin,

251
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,529
I didn't give up.

252
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,166
The fact that they're coming on strong

253
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,435
means we found the right target.

254
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,272
If I give up now,
I'd be seething with anger.

255
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,009
I...

256
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,878
have something I really want to know.

257
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,281
Was Ms. Seo

258
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,084
behind what happened to the chairman?

259
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,088
No.

260
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,256
-I don't think so.
-Really?

261
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,959
Yi-kyung would've offered a deal first.

262
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,628
She doesn't take drastic measures
for emotional reasons.

263
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,934
I didn't think it was her either,

264
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,203
but I was afraid.

265
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:46,638
I think

266
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,808
there's a problem between Yi-kyung
and Mr. Jang.

267
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,740
You left, saying you'll handle it
your way.

268
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,209
Then you should stick to your decision.

269
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,280
It's annoying playing along.

270
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,258
Take over Yi-kyung's company at once?

271
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,798
Did Mr. Jang really tell you to do so?

272
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,801
If you eat too much alone,
you're bound to get sick.

273
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,038
I'll give you a fair share.

274
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,773
Sir.

275
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,310
There may have been
misunderstandings lately,

276
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,012
but we can use this opportunity
to mend our friendship.

277
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,080
My goodness.

278
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,884
I'd be thankful until the day I die.

279
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,885
Of course.

280
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,320
Father.

281
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,658
Hello.

282
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,394
It's been a while.

283
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,434
I'll come visit again.

284
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,443
Why did you call in that jerk?

285
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:05,878
None of your business.

286
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,279
What is it?

287
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,116
I got a call from Japan
about Chairman Bong-soo Seo.

288
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,417
What?

289
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,020
I hear he isn't very well.

290
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,930
The doctor went to check on him
during the night.

291
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,100
It was nothing big,
but he's gotten very weak.

292
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,937
Why don't you leave things here to us
and go visit?

293
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,706
Yes, you should go see him--

294
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,109
Let's look at the list of documents
that were taken yesterday.

295
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,310
Ma'am.

296
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,379
I can't be gone even for half a day.

297
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,382
Mr. Jang won't end it with just this.

298
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,384
Bring me the documents.

299
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,059
Is Ms. Seo leaving right away?

300
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,094
She says it's more urgent here.

301
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,797
This is insane.

302
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,932
Why now...

303
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,317
Get out

304
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,119
of my house.

305
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:23,989
Get out.

306
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,226
Now!

307
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,630
Don't come back.

308
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,567
I don't want you...

309
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,171
to see me this way.

310
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,209
Shake it off and get up.
Then I won't come.

311
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,452
This is my will and testament.

312
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,792
I said I'd disown you,

313
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,764
but you insisted on going to Korea
and started this.

314
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,634
Whether you succeed or fail there,

315
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,704
you and I...

316
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,276
will never see each other again.

317
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,136
TJ CULTURAL FOUNDATION CONTRIBUTION STATUS

318
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,181
When I was at the gallery,

319
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,616
Ms. Seo said

320
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,452
you may lose documents,
but you keep your memories,

321
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,689
so to always memorize important content.

322
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,059
So you memorized all of this?

323
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,760
I'm not sure about some of them,

324
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:10,996
so I put a question mark next to them.

325
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,632
I'll look through it.

326
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,301
I didn't give it to you to look through.

327
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,004
I'll investigate with you.

328
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,174
That's dangerous.

329
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,909
I don't want you getting involved--

330
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,410
I saw the news about the audit.

331
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,146
I know what it means to be shut down
for six months.

332
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:34,286
I wanted to stop Ms. Seo,

333
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,488
not ruin her.

334
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,592
But those people want to destroy her.

335
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,195
Not a chance.

336
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,497
I won't let them do that.

337
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,332
I'm sure Yi-kyung doesn't want

338
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,701
you to be placed in danger.

339
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,236
I feel the same.

340
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:53,705
Fine.

341
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:57,709
Then

342
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,311
let's do our own thing.

343
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,048
-Se-jin.
-Rather than trying to console her,

344
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,816
this is the best I can do for her.

345
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:06,785
Don't try to stop me.

346
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,128
Promise me two things.

347
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,897
If you feel like you are in danger,

348
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,365
you will pull out.

349
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,038
Okay. What else?

350
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:30,142
Don't turn your back on me
while talking, as you just did.

351
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,380
I promise that, too.

352
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,354
Mi-yun Jung.

353
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,090
She divorced Hyun-soo Kim last year
and returned to Korea.

354
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:49,661
She was directly involved
with Collins' operations before then.

355
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,197
She'll have documents or testimonies
to give about the company,

356
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,333
including the fact that
Mr. Jang is the true owner.

357
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,270
The problem is finding her.

358
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,540
It's difficult to assume
she is at her parents' house.

359
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,141
It's the only clue we have.

360
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,810
Let's have hope and wait.

361
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,353
Mr. Jang shouldn't do that to you.

362
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,789
You swept and mopped
and cleared the path for him.

363
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,892
Not only will he not take you with him,
he wants to step on you.

364
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,529
Being shut down for six months is like
saying you should close shop.

365
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:28,467
It's annoying, but I can always
just start a new company.

366
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:31,303
Don't be stubborn
and lose everything you have.

367
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,505
Just bend and bow down to him.

368
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,640
That's the only way you can survive.

369
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,578
Did Mr. Jang give you a role?

370
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,980
You are the good cop,

371
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,349
and Director Nam is the bad cop.

372
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,117
Hey, don't get me wrong.

373
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:49,855
No matter what Mr. Jang says,
I'm always on your side.

374
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:53,291
Don't transfer the pledged contribution
to the foundation yet and wait.

375
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,862
-Why?
-You'll see soon enough.

376
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:00,432
Even if Mr. Jang pressures you,
just hold on for a while.

377
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,770
Are you up to something big?

378
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,207
I don't want to get caught
in the crossfire.

379
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,238
Let's call it a night.

380
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,207
Just a little longer.

381
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,510
No, this won't work.

382
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,812
We need a new plan.

383
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,817
You can't get full from your first bite.

384
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,686
Let's pace ourselves.

385
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,484
TJ Foundation Donates Billions
to an Elderly Widower and Poor Child

386
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,622
Nam!

387
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:07,959
CHAIRMAN MOO-SAM PARK

388
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:11,863
You shouldn't try to feel good
using Mr. Jang's money.

389
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,467
You treated them really big.

390
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,169
He'll get the compliments.

391
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:22,073
I understand you want me to hold off
on sending in my contribution,

392
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,778
but what do you plan to do?

393
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,914
Mr. Jang won't take this sitting down.

394
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,283
My company that I worked hard
to build was stripped from me.

395
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,219
I need to do this much.

396
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,488
Don't touch Moojin's Neo City Project.

397
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,224
That will hurt us both.

398
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,458
Goodbye.

399
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,997
Did you hear any updates from Japan?

400
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,868
Thankfully, no.

401
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,132
I heard you handed over
Mr. Jang's accounts.

402
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,035
You were holding onto
the foundation's purse.

403
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,506
I was on the phone with Mr. Jang
until now.

404
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,041
There is still a large sum left

405
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,243
from the initial contributions.

406
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,779
I'm sure he knows that as well.

407
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,516
What do you plan to do
with the remaining funds?

408
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,485
I don't know.

409
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,987
Should I bankrupt the foundation?

410
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,989
Or should I give him that much?

411
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,591
I'm debating.

412
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,462
Or maybe you should make a move.

413
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,198
What do you mean?

414
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,033
You received my company

415
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,368
as the spoils of war.

416
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,838
I haven't heard.

417
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,673
You worked hard to create the foundation,

418
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,075
so you should receive that much
in compensation.

419
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,011
Go tell Mr. Jang

420
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,448
to stop the meaningless attacks now.

421
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,150
If he doesn't,

422
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,185
his brand new foundation

423
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,388
will go bankrupt as soon as
it is established.

424
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,060
Do you think

425
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,596
you have multiple lives or something?

426
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,564
If I did,
I wouldn't play a game like this.

427
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,234
I'm placing this bet
because I have only one.

428
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,586
Mi-yun Jung is not at her parents' house.

429
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,089
She's living in a condo in Gangnam.

430
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,625
How did you...

431
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,527
I found out through social media.

432
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,230
See? This was taken in the living room.

433
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,765
Do you see that office building?

434
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,067
If you can see this building
from this angle,

435
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,969
it has to be Sky City Condos.

436
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,307
I scanned her posts,

437
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,042
and she goes out once a day.

438
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,778
It's a brunch cafe near the condo.

439
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,548
It looks like she eats
and reads a book there.

440
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,217
Over there.

441
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:09,834
Hello?

442
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,703
Chairman Eu-sung Son came by.

443
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,705
Mr. Jang was angry

444
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,607
when he heard your message.

445
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,210
He can't dislike his image
as being generous.

446
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,114
Hand over TJ Foundation's funds quietly.

447
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,183
Don't play any more games.

448
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,652
I don't like how you're asking.

449
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,289
You shut down a perfectly fine company
with a few phone calls.

450
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,691
You should repent first.

451
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,360
Ms. Seo.

452
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:38,563
Tell Mr. Jang to call himself,
if he wants a favor from me.

453
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,105
Mr. Jang won't give in easily.

454
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,307
Neither will I.

455
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,541
If I get dragged around now,

456
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,379
everything I've done until now
will be for naught.

457
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,581
I can take the loss,

458
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,583
but I can't ruin my plan.

459
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,726
Maybe she came and left already.

460
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,296
It's only been 30 minutes.

461
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,068
How did you get
into her social media page?

462
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,603
I'm sure it's a private account.

463
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,737
Oh.

464
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,206
I pretended to be from the same school.

465
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,376
I lied that I worked

466
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,679
at the same company, too.

467
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,582
I needed her to approve my friend request.

468
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,532
-Right?
-I think so.

469
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,501
What do I do?

470
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,103
Now that she's here, I can't...

471
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:00,945
Are you Mi-yun Jung?

472
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:02,480
I am, why?

473
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,849
I'd like you ask you something
about Hyun-soo Kim

474
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,285
and Collins Co.

475
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,253
Who are you?

476
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,090
-The police?
-I'm an average citizen.

477
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,059
This is my friend.

478
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:16,561
Hello.

479
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:19,897
We just need a minute.

480
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,701
I have nothing to say about him,
and I know nothing about the company.

481
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:27,905
Your ex-husband bought Moojin Tech
practically for free.

482
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,241
I am involved with that company.

483
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,011
I also know that Collins Co.,
which Hyun-soo Kim operates,

484
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,847
is the channel
for Tae-joon Jang's slush funds.

485
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,617
Any little thing will help.

486
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,153
Anything you know about the company--

487
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,521
I told you, I know nothing.

488
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,968
I'm sorry.

489
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,171
I don't care if you're sorry.

490
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,606
I don't know anything.

491
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:02,974
I lied to you

492
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,076
that I went to your college

493
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,579
and that I worked at the company
where you used to work, too,

494
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,448
to get you to add me as a friend.

495
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,119
I'm very sorry,

496
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,322
but that's how desperate we are.

497
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,524
Move.

498
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,626
Many people are involved.

499
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,062
Many are being harmed without knowing why.

500
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,432
If you'd help us, we can make sure

501
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,200
that doesn't happen again.

502
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:32,437
I'm sorry, but I hate being annoyed.

503
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,415
She doesn't hear anything we say.

504
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,983
It's natural she isn't interested,

505
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,785
since it's not her business.

506
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,278
What's going on?

507
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,813
They claim to have found

508
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,882
clues of money laundering
in foreign transactions.

509
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,018
Why do you need to question us?

510
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,222
The documents will say whether or not
there is any culpability.

511
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,224
Of course, we will do that as well.

512
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,428
You're in charge of transportation,
correct?

513
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,763
-I am.
-You'll have to come with us.

514
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,165
Tak.

515
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,870
You know what they're after.

516
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,671
Don't cause trouble needlessly.

517
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,840
-Ma'am.
-Don't get worked up.

518
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,809
Call the attorney.

519
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,110
Yes, ma'am.

520
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,298
PROSECUTOR

521
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:08,599
On April 16 of this year,

522
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,968
you sold artwork to Horizon Gallery
in Sydney, correct?

523
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,172
-Probably.
-How many pieces?

524
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,174
I'd have to check the documents.

525
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,377
Go ahead, then.

526
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,655
Look. The number from before
and the rate here.

527
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,690
It matches perfectly

528
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,725
including the foreign transportation fee.

529
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,397
Do you see here,
where it says "special price"?

530
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,831
What that means is

531
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,600
that buyer--

532
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,768
Sit straight.

533
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:50,808
Look!

534
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,179
Look where?

535
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,586
I threw a tantrum at my dad!

536
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:04,055
I said you're my only real friend,

537
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,257
and how could he kick you out like that,

538
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,227
and do you know what he said?

539
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,829
He said to take it up with Grandpa!
Seriously?

540
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,564
It's okay. Thank you!

541
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,499
You did enough for me!

542
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,068
Yeah, what's there to life?

543
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,736
Just shake it off!

544
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,304
Okay, let's shake it off!

545
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,639
What are you doing?

546
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,074
What are you doing? Get him!

547
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,076
-Hurry!
-Where?

548
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,111
-Thank you.
-Have a good night.

549
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,914
-Thank you.
-That looks so good.

550
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,719
You know when you were in school,

551
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,555
you'd like a teacher

552
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,657
and want to study hard for that class.

553
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,559
What do you mean?

554
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:42,793
Haven't you felt that way?

555
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,196
If you like the teacher, you say so.
Why would you study hard?

556
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,865
To look good.

557
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,568
What does that have to do with studying?

558
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,873
Why? Would the teacher not like you
if you don't do well in class?

559
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:58,643
Forget it.

560
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,347
I don't know what went wrong,

561
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,782
but don't stress too much.

562
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,951
You said you respect and like your boss.

563
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,653
That's enough.

564
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,356
It's hard because you keep trying
to look good.

565
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,557
Gosh.

566
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,063
What?

567
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,598
Wait here.

568
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:25,536
What's her problem?

569
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,738
She's always like that.

570
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,048
-What is that?
-Nothing much,

571
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,883
but to thank you.

572
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,284
It's a gift.

573
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:43,988
Hey, Se-jin.

574
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,457
Get me one by a real artisan from Kyoto.

575
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,426
-Forget it, then.
-Wait.

576
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,529
I'll hold onto this until then.

577
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,340
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

578
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,042
-You've never had these before, have you?
-I have, of course.

579
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,043
Look at how many you ate.

580
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,179
It's a secret.

581
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,014
We meet again.

582
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,484
Are you done with your tea?

583
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,553
Ma'am.

584
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,324
I wondered who it was.

585
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,895
What's going on?

586
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,029
Why are you here?

587
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,964
Where are you going?

588
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,335
She has nothing to do with my business.

589
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,204
Just a minute.

590
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,473
Let me ask the director.

591
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,686
Yes.

592
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,821
I'll give her the phone.

593
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:39,964
Hello?

594
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,499
How do you like the place?

595
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:43,734
It's clean.

596
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,506
If you hand over the foundation's funds,
we will let you go.

597
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,541
I'll just rest since I'm here.

598
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,311
A week?

599
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,080
A month?

600
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,183
The choice is yours.

601
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,226
You may take walks in the garden,
but do not go farther.

602
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:10,961
We have many workers.

603
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,686
What happened to Tak and the others?

604
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,920
Did you have dinner?

605
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:11,488
I didn't, so I'm hungry.

606
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:14,391
Ma'am.

607
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,499
If they're at the prosecutor's office,
no one knows

608
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,767
you're being held captive here.

609
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:28,672
What if they do something to you?

610
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,075
Consider it a vacation.

611
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,043
It's a waiting game, anyway.

612
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,847
Give them what they want.

613
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,016
It's because of the foundation's funds,
isn't it?

614
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,921
Or think of a way out of here.

615
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,825
Stop talking.
If you're going to nag, go to sleep.

616
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,228
But...

617
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,537
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

618
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,539
Please leave a message after the tone.

619
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,609
You're not drinking
because you're upset, are you?

620
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:09,480
Let's go see Mi-yun Jung again tomorrow.

621
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:10,948
She'll give in if we keep trying.

622
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,250
Call me when you get this.

623
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:00,998
Ma'am.

624
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,137
You didn't lose 100 yen on the street.

625
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,672
You lost your mind.

626
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,208
Find every single one.

627
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,452
Ma'am.

628
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,354
Are you okay?

629
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:59,623
Gosh.

630
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,530
You're pale.

631
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:08,966
You may have indigestion.

632
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:23,347
What are you doing?

633
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,482
The medicine isn't working.

634
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,886
Pricking your finger
is the quickest remedy for indigestion.

635
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,262
Sit like this.

636
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:43,567
Trust me.

637
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,236
I did this for my aunt
whenever she got indigestion.

638
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,867
See? Your blood is black.

639
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,277
Drink this.

640
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:35,586
I feel better.

641
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,988
You're pretty good.

642
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:50,500
Did you

643
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,203
have a bad dream?

644
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,240
Just a dream about my childhood.

645
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:58,775
Back when I was six,

646
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,677
and when my father was still strict.

647
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:02,512
I heard he's sick.

648
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,484
You've been under a lot of stress lately,

649
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,519
so that must have manifested
in your dream.

650
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:35,345
In my family, being weak was a sin.

651
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,316
Deals were okay. Compromise was not.

652
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:44,588
You make the other surrender,
but you must never kneel.

653
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:49,192
Is that why you're still holding out?

654
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:53,230
Losing is a habit.

655
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:57,601
Once you begin to get pushed back,
you'll lose everything in an instant.

656
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,904
That's true if you separate everything
into winning and losing.

657
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,373
However,

658
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,209
although there are things
you should fight for,

659
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,211
there are more things to share, too.

660
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,316
I'm still powerless.

661
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,584
I blame myself every day.

662
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,154
But

663
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,657
I will make sure to help you release

664
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,426
all of the bad blood you have

665
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,996
so that you will no longer be in agony.

666
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,437
Hello?

667
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,173
Mr. Gun-woo Park?
I'm Director Jo with Gallery S.

668
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,242
-Yes?
-Have you

669
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,344
heard from Ms. Seo or Se-jin

670
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,213
since last night?

671
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:27,691
You still can't reach either of them?

672
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:31,228
We just got back from being interrogated
all night by the prosecutor.

673
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:33,130
We checked the surveillance videos
from yesterday.

674
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,464
The punks who came to the studio

675
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:37,334
took Ms. Seo and Se-jin.

676
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,837
Can we check with Mr. Jang?

677
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:41,872
No.

678
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,608
Even if we ask,
he wouldn't tell us the truth.

679
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:46,977
He definitely won't say where they are.

680
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,046
Then what, sit and wait?

681
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:51,014
We should beat the shit out of them
until they talk!

682
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:51,948
Tak.

683
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,686
-Hello?
-Can we check

684
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:58,455
their license plate number?

685
00:50:58,522 --> 00:50:59,790
Or...

686
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,593
-Um...
-Did something happen

687
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,395
to Ms. Seo and Se-jin?

688
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,832
The chairman...

689
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:17,974
Our boys had been monitoring
the situation closely.

690
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,510
It happened

691
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:22,979
at 6 a.m. this morning.

692
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:24,548
I understand.

693
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,828
Chairman Bong-soo Seo

694
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,063
passed away this morning.

695
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,137
Bong-soo?

696
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,172
Yes.

697
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:27,744
I will

698
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,213
release Yi-kyung for now.

699
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,885
We can discuss the foundation's funds
after the funeral--

700
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:36,052
Why?

701
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:38,421
Pardon?

702
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,827
If she wants to go
to her father's funeral,

703
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:48,064
she'll make her decision sooner.

704
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,234
Don't you agree?

705
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,876
When did you get up?

706
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,644
Just now.

707
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:37,214
Do you feel better?

708
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:40,984
It's 18 billion won.

709
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:46,489
The money remaining from the initial
contributions after that donation.

710
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:51,361
Should I give that back
and leave this place?

711
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,396
Ma'am.

712
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,749
It may be fun for a few days,

713
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,685
but you'll get cabin fever after a while.

714
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,254
It isn't bad so far.

715
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,256
It's Mr. Jang's money.

716
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:20,590
I gathered it.

717
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,193
If you beg for forgiveness,
he will show mercy.

718
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,929
Tell him I'll consider it if he repents.

719
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:45,582
This morning,

720
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:51,488
Chairman Bong-soo Seo passed away.

721
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,960
Hand over the foundation's funds
and go to Japan.

722
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:01,865
You should prepare his funeral
as his only child.

723
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:09,639
What...

724
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,375
did you just say?

725
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,485
What did you just say?

726
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,921
Chairman Seo's illness worsened.

727
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:31,428
Mr. Jang said he sends
his condolences as well.

728
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:39,769
So,

729
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:43,206
since my father passed away,

730
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:46,242
you'll let me go on the condition
that I give you the money?

731
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:49,179
I'll get the car ready right away.

732
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:50,213
Not a chance.

733
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,351
You don't know my father very well.

734
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,788
If I give up that much money
just for his funeral,

735
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,091
he'd scold me

736
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,860
even from his grave.

737
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:04,894
Ma'am.

738
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:06,663
I have the funds.

739
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,533
Mr. Jang will have to get on his knees
if he wants it.

740
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,536
Nothing else has changed.

741
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:15,605
That is all.

742
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,339
I'm not here because I trust you.

743
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:52,275
I had no choice,
since Mr. Jo told me to go.

744
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:55,645
But

745
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,248
can we really find out

746
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:01,284
where they're holding Ms. Seo that way?

747
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:04,654
I'm sure of it,
let's each do our part right.

748
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:06,389
Now stop talking.

749
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:07,424
What?

750
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:17,534
Yi-kyung.

751
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:20,837
Don't go to Korea.

752
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:23,673
Moo-il Park. Tae-joon Jang.

753
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,942
Because of them?

754
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:31,147
The trauma of being betrayed
by friends of 30 years.

755
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,217
I understand how you feel.

756
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,251
Not at all.

757
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:40,190
They're scumbags not worth
even taking revenge on.

758
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:42,392
I never said I'd take revenge.

759
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,462
I'm still thinking about it.

760
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,797
A cruel revenge

761
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:50,667
or a useful tool.

762
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:56,105
Which would be more helpful
in creating my own kingdom?

763
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,479
Se-jin.

764
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:03,646
Yes?

765
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:05,815
I need

766
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:08,952
to get out of here.

767
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,658
Look, Gun-woo Park.

768
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:19,762
Are you joking me? I'm a busy man.

769
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,264
I am not joking.

770
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:23,766
I'm desperate to get my father out.

771
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,836
If there's no legal means,
I'll have to try illegal.

772
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:31,407
How much will it take?

773
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:32,842
What is your price?

774
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,580
We never had this conversation.

775
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:43,386
You're a good negotiator.

776
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,790
There's a shopping mall
in the outskirts of LA.

777
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,026
It'll be a nice gift for your wife.

778
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:51,895
I

779
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,631
will not betray Mr. Jang for money.

780
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,665
Who said to betray him?

781
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,468
I'm just asking you to help me
be a good son.

782
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,503
I can't help you with that.

783
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:02,572
Mr. Nam.

784
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,814
He just left.

785
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:16,319
Couldn't you hold him
for five more minutes?

786
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,453
Can you do it?

787
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:18,855
TRANSFERRING FILES

788
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,757
It'll be close.

789
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:22,559
RECEIVING FILES

790
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,260
Okay, I'm getting the files now.

791
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,597
I'll extract the GPS information
and send it to you.

792
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:40,710
Did you get it?

793
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:44,681
You're pretty good.

794
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:46,015
It's my specialty.

795
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,188
If you say

796
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,124
you'll give them the foundation's funds,
would they let you go?

797
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,626
I never said I'd do that.

798
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:58,661
Then how...

799
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,530
I won't give him what he wants.

800
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,765
I'll finish it with something
he does not want.

801
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,367
It's Mr. Jang.

802
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,740
I heard the news.

803
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,745
I don't know how to give my condolences.

804
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,649
We lost a great man.

805
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,051
I need to go to my father.

806
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:23,586
Of course.

807
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:26,689
That's your duty as a child.

808
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,894
I was worried since Mr. Nam said
he wasted his trip out there.

809
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:34,430
I'm glad

810
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,499
you changed your mind.

811
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:39,602
I'm not saying I'll give you
the foundation's funds.

812
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,372
What?

813
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,007
Just before coming to Korea,

814
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:46,142
my father gave me a book of records.

815
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,213
I doubt it was so that I could
be there at his funeral,

816
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:54,517
but I'm thinking of using it
to get out of here.

817
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,519
What...

818
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,488
What records?

819
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,030
I have a lot of things.
Tell me what it is first.

820
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,533
The only thing a businessman keeps
is a record.

821
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:14,303
While they were preparing
for the Olympics,

822
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:19,175
I wrote down everything I saw, heard
and checked.

823
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,747
Someday,

824
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,450
when you have no other choice,

825
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,921
but to stop Tae-joon's breath,

826
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:36,759
this book of records will help.

827
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,666
I don't know.

828
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:47,036
The deceased left records like that?

829
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,107
It's difficult to believe.

830
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,643
It isn't something to discuss
over the phone. Goodbye.

831
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:08,725
We're running late, sir.

832
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:12,829
Sir?

833
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:16,933
Bring her

834
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,136
to me right now.

835
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:30,213
Ma'am.

836
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:36,252
When you said maybe you should
give back the funds and get out,

837
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,287
you weren't kidding, right?

838
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:42,258
You wanted to stop too.

839
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:44,293
Right?

840
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:46,062
No.

841
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,534
This isn't the end.

842
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:54,570
I haven't...

843
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,373
even begun yet.

844
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:33,309
Reaping the benefits from a field
someone else farmed is stealing.

845
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:35,812
I'm sure she's angry and feels wronged.

846
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:36,946
She'll come back.

847
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,749
She won't easily give up
what she wanted to do here.

848
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:43,219
I'll make sure to collect the
contributions that haven't been paid yet.

849
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,054
We must protect the group.

850
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,456
I will complete
your long-cherished project.

851
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:49,192
You'll have to choose.

852
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:50,326
Mr. Jang

853
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:51,360
or me?

854
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,796
If the group is harmed because of you,

855
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,131
I won't sit still, either.

856
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:56,933
Finish this fight for good.

857
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:57,934
Keep at it.

858
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,036
I may end up needing your help.

859
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:07,076
