00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,842
FINAL EPISODE

2
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:48,014
The past president Tae-joon Jang
has denied the charges of collusion

3
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,084
with Moojin Group
during his term in office.

4
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,321
However, the prosecutor states
that because Moojin Group's past chairman

5
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,224
Moo-il Park's testimony is very detailed
and they have supporting evidence,

6
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,061
they believe it will not be difficult
to prove their case.

7
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,066
The one who tied the knot must untie it.

8
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:13,206
I got us into this mess,
so I must get us out of it.

9
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,377
Don't get any stupid ideas.

10
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:22,115
Help your uncle
and take care of the company.

11
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,918
Of course. That's what I always do.

12
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:31,324
Also, don't bother trying to win over
people in the government

13
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,394
to get a special pardon
before the change in power.

14
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:41,835
Once I receive my sentence, I'll serve
my time and get out once I'm done.

15
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,804
-Father.
-I kissed up to jerks in power

16
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,941
and broke the law now and then

17
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:53,446
while doing business.
That's how I became rich.

18
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:58,685
I won't try to play games now.

19
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:06,626
I am not angry at the world,
and I don't blame anyone.

20
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:14,501
I committed these sins,
so I will carry them with me.

21
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,172
Gun-woo.

22
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,276
This wasn't easy for me to say.

23
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,012
Please do it for me.

24
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,217
I will.

25
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,727
It's about Bong-soo's daughter.

26
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,597
Don't fight with her.

27
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:51,137
The bad blood ended with the fathers.
That's enough.

28
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,742
I can't promise you that.

29
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,144
Gun-woo.

30
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,848
Your generation may be done,
but we are not.

31
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,988
It's supposed to get chilly.
Don't catch a cold.

32
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,536
You can't find a path in books.

33
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,778
When you walk, the path is behind you.

34
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,118
I'm not in the mood
to play word games with you.

35
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,821
I'm not here to argue with you, either.

36
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,592
Don't you want to catch Yi-kyung Seo?

37
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,397
I have a couple of plans.
It won't hurt for you to listen.

38
00:03:53,299 --> 00:04:00,073
I don't know. Just because I'm after her,
doesn't mean I need to work with you.

39
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,843
That allowed her to get both you and me.

40
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,448
We'll have to do it right this time.

41
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,150
You seem confident.

42
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,719
All I have left is my will.

43
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,888
So, how will you do it right?

44
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,093
If you want to capture the general,
you must shoot his horse.

45
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,795
That's the beginning.

46
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,435
How long have you been following me?

47
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,438
Rest assured. We're not here to harm you.

48
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,173
You expect me to believe that?

49
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,750
Chairman Son requested Ms. Seo's help.

50
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,854
We will help you flee the country safely.

51
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,230
Three people replied saying
they will take on the mission.

52
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,632
That's all?

53
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,701
They tend to do their own thing.

54
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,338
-When are we meeting them?
-Well...

55
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,443
No one will come in person.
They all want to do it online.

56
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,680
Connect them right away.

57
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,715
UNKNOWN ZERO

58
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,351
I'm Unknown Zero,
the one who invited you to this mission.

59
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,754
I heard you are all skilled hackers,
so I have high expectations.

60
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,591
If you work together
and fulfill the mission,

61
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,561
you will each receive
the promised compensation.

62
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,869
I'll leave the details of
how you attack the target to you.

63
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,038
-Who's the target?
-Who's the target?

64
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,674
Gallery S' system.

65
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,177
How severely should we attack?

66
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,580
Unrecoverable utter destruction.

67
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,670
Who are you?
How dare you snoop around in my computer?

68
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,805
I'll track you and teach you a lesson.

69
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,014
Father.

70
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,953
Our company can do it too,
but it's in case the prosecutor finds out.

71
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,488
Don't make any mistakes.

72
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,523
That's what Ms. Seo said, too.

73
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,092
I'm sorry, Father.

74
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,228
Don't talk.

75
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,764
When you get to Japan,
live quietly and stay hidden.

76
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,435
Can we trust Yi-kyung?

77
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,271
If not? Will you turn yourself in?

78
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,606
What?

79
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,676
Stay out of trouble until things
quiet down. Don't come to Korea.

80
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,047
Before I go,

81
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,619
I'd like to say bye to Ma-ri.

82
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,320
If you wanted to be a good father...

83
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,126
Go quietly.

84
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,195
That's best for her.

85
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,002
Father.

86
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:35,521
Okay. Tell Tak to stay with Gi-tae Son.
You can come back.

87
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,668
Ms. Kim, my laptop is acting up.

88
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,370
Just a minute. One minute.

89
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:00,680
Ms. Kim.

90
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,584
I'm almost done stopping him.
It's okay now.

91
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,094
Done.

92
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:16,829
What's going on?

93
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,767
Some punks who don't know better
start trouble now and then.

94
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,437
The system I created must trigger
their competitive spirit.

95
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,339
Did you resolve it?

96
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,775
Yes. It was a little difficult,
but I kicked him out.

97
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,254
What's wrong with you?

98
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:53,599
Ms. Kim.

99
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,269
The earlier one was bait.

100
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,272
He must've been messing around
in order to see my response pattern.

101
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,010
What is this? How many are attacking?

102
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,129
What?

103
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,131
No way.

104
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,402
This can't be.

105
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,137
No way.

106
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,139
What is this?

107
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,912
-Ms. Kim.
-It's okay. I can...

108
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,049
I can recover it in no time.
I'll handle it.

109
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,684
Look at me.

110
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,887
Slow down. Calm down.

111
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,256
I trust your abilities.

112
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,159
Okay.

113
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:04,971
Hey.

114
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,541
I've repaid my debt with this.

115
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:09,942
What?

116
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,613
Making it look like TJ Foundation
made an illegal investment

117
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,182
was a trap your computer expert set.

118
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,722
It'll be difficult to recover. It'll be
better to create again from scratch.

119
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,892
-You worked hard and racked your brain.
-Thanks.

120
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,996
And I won't touch the gallery's accounts.

121
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,365
I'm not into stealing.

122
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:36,836
But I'll have to freeze your assets,
so you don't get ideas.

123
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,506
The money you see isn't everything.

124
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,642
Even freezing the money I see
is a great success.

125
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,877
I didn't know you hated me this much.

126
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,078
Wrong.

127
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,580
I like you.

128
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,150
It would be less tiring for us both
if you'd give up now.

129
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,352
I guess I'm asking for too much.

130
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,755
You must've prepared the next step, too.

131
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,224
I'll be waiting.

132
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,199
-Ms. Kim.
-Don't talk to me. I'm almost done.

133
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,738
Please work. Please.

134
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,820
It'll take longer than expected.

135
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,657
Don't rush her. She'll take care of it.

136
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,793
Are you moving Gi-tae Son tomorrow?

137
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,962
Yes. The preparations are almost done.

138
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,366
Once that's taken care of,
let's take care of the funding issue.

139
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,971
Even if we revive the system later,
we need to move the funds.

140
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,473
Was this Gun-woo Park's doing?

141
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:26,145
I think what old feelings remained
are gone now.

142
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,983
Now, our only option is to knock him down.

143
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,559
Did you pack everything?

144
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,830
Mr. Jo will be here soon.
Let's go down to the garage.

145
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,500
Behind you!

146
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:27,006
Let go, you jerk!
Do you know who I am? Mr. Jo!

147
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,475
Tak! Get Mr. Son!

148
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,539
Mr. Jo, wake up! Mr. Jo!

149
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,015
I've restored 50% so far.

150
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,951
If I work quickly, I should be able to...

151
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,722
What's wrong?

152
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,291
Mr. Jo...

153
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,439
They just began the surgery.

154
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,909
There was internal bleeding
in his abdomen.

155
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:13,979
Go to the gallery.

156
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,149
-I'll wait, too.
-Ms. Kim is working alone.

157
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,817
Go stay with her.

158
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,255
Go on.

159
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,358
Okay.

160
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,577
Where's Mr. Son?

161
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,747
I can't let someone like that in here.

162
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,150
He's being kept somewhere safe.

163
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,052
I've spoken with the prosecutor.

164
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,621
If Mr. Son agrees to the deal--

165
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,189
That won't be easy.

166
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,793
It was a pain bringing him, too.

167
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,228
What do you mean?

168
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,265
Yi-kyung Seo almost took him away.

169
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,567
What do you mean, it was a pain?

170
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,003
Did someone get hurt?

171
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,341
-Mr. Nam.
-Mr. Park.

172
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,344
There is no beautiful loss
or a valuable loss.

173
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,478
I know.

174
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,314
Once the fight has begun,
win no matter what.

175
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,216
I'm sure that's your philosophy.

176
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:28,053
I have bet everything on this fight.

177
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,556
Didn't you have the same conviction?

178
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:35,594
Just keep in mind
that our mutual target is Yi-kyung Seo.

179
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,663
You're the one who needs to remember

180
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,433
just what kind of a person
you are going up against.

181
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,581
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

182
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,822
We stopped the bleeding. Any later,
and it would've been dangerous.

183
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,924
Thank you.

184
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,660
But it'll take quite a while
before he is fully recovered.

185
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,324
Seriously...

186
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,531
Ms. Seo left the hospital.

187
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,100
I'm going to take her place.

188
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,271
Do you want to go, too?

189
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,173
I do,

190
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,341
but I can't.

191
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:01,346
My job is to build the gallery's system
as soon as possible.

192
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,817
I'm sure that's
what Mr. Jo would want as well.

193
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,934
What happened to my son?

194
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,005
It was either Gun-woo Park, Jong-gyu Nam,

195
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,042
or perhaps a collaboration
between the two.

196
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,344
How dare they...

197
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,712
It's obvious what they're up to.

198
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,049
They'll threaten him
and hand him over to the prosecutor,

199
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,485
and tie me to his crimes.

200
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,752
But he knows nothing.

201
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,588
He knows nothing,
so it's easy to make it up.

202
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,992
If a past president's right-hand man
teams up with a corporate heir,

203
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,428
they can create crimes that don't exist.

204
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,031
Don't worry.

205
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,602
We'll get your son out
before he's handed over to the prosecutor,

206
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,838
and we'll pay them back one by one.

207
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,376
How can I help?

208
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,881
I'll take care of both the planning
and the execution.

209
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,550
I stopped by in case you'd be concerned.

210
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,653
Yi-kyung. Be careful.

211
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:23,462
He's staying in the recovery room today
and moving to a general ward tomorrow.

212
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,964
Okay. What about Ms. Kim?

213
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:30,836
She's still working. But I think
it's been stabilized a lot.

214
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,339
Okay. Call me if anything happens.

215
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:35,941
Are you going to the gallery?

216
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,144
No. I need to see someone.

217
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,806
Yi-kyung Seo made you do it, correct?

218
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,376
Big Love Bank's illegal loans.

219
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,382
She created the bank to begin with,
and controlled you behind the scenes.

220
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,817
Correct?

221
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,253
No.

222
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,856
I did that on my own.

223
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,429
That's not right.

224
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,901
Try to remember, okay?

225
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,870
Yi-kyung Seo made you do it,

226
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:43,375
and you couldn't resist her threats,
so you did as she instructed.

227
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,577
That's not what happened.

228
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:59,391
I'll be back in half an hour. Show him
some exercises good for his memory.

229
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,392
Yes, sir.

230
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:01,893
Mr. Nam!

231
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,741
I mean...

232
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,544
I...

233
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,880
Sorry.

234
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,050
Mr. Nam was rougher than I expected.

235
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,952
No need to apologize.

236
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,056
He's been through much worse in Japan.

237
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,158
He'll be fine.

238
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,596
Gi-tae Son will turn himself in soon
to the prosecutor.

239
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,602
He'll confess that you ordered
Big Love Bank's illegal loans.

240
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,306
You have no way out.

241
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:51,843
I'm disappointed. I was looking forward
to a more creative attack.

242
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,312
This isn't a game.

243
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,449
If you keep resisting,
you'll end up losing everything.

244
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,054
Stop on your own and go back,
before it becomes the worst-case scenario.

245
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,022
-Gun-woo.
-I told you,

246
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,757
I like you.

247
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,527
This is the last bit of consideration
I can show you.

248
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,797
Do you think it'll be over
if my money is frozen

249
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,933
and I'm taken in by the prosecutor?

250
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,234
What?

251
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,545
Everyone I like is here.

252
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,080
Se-jin.

253
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,648
May I have a seat, Ms. Seo?

254
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,765
I heard about what happened
at the gallery.

255
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:51,169
Why did you do it?
That's not for the company, either.

256
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,972
It's not something
you should involve yourself with.

257
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,073
Sorry,

258
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,009
but I've been way too involved already.

259
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,111
Se-jin.

260
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:03,415
He says I'll lose everything,
and that I should stop and go back.

261
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,351
What do you think?

262
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,487
Should I do that?

263
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,021
Really?

264
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,258
Do you mean it?

265
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,293
Who knows?

266
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,230
I guess not, because of Gun-woo.

267
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,101
No matter what you do,

268
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,071
this fight will not end.

269
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,608
No. I'll end it.

270
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:36,148
It's good to see you again,
but you shouldn't have come.

271
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,484
I agreed to run right over
if she ever called.

272
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:43,555
Didn't I tell you before
that Se-jin is my savior?

273
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,124
Yeah, I think so.

274
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,276
Give me the car keys.

275
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,212
You look tired. I'll drive.

276
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,214
It's okay.

277
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:10,916
Give them to me.

278
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,285
Please?

279
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,756
I moved the funds in Japan
as soon as I received your instructions.

280
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,426
They were all scared when I said
I was there in your place.

281
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:32,103
Once Ms. Kim gets the system running,
the funding issue will be resolved, right?

282
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,672
It'll take some time.

283
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,574
We'll take it one at a time.

284
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,611
How was Japan?

285
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,682
It was a total disaster.
Everything was a complete mess.

286
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,185
That's how it was overall, but it was fun.

287
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,955
Did you miss me?

288
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,258
I think you should look forward.

289
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,049
Hey...

290
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,605
How could you do that?
I thought we were friends.

291
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:44,075
You should say if you're coming or going.

292
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,244
Couldn't you at least text?

293
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:47,846
Sorry.

294
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,915
I'll take you out somewhere nice.

295
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,286
Is Mr. Jo okay?

296
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,988
I heard the surgery went well.

297
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,125
Yeah.

298
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,595
Stand straight.

299
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,764
-It wasn't your fault.
-No.

300
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:07,966
I was stupid.

301
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,835
I could've covered him.

302
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,539
It'll become a habit if you
keep regretting and blaming yourself.

303
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,512
-What?
-That's Ms. Seo's line.

304
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:24,749
Is it?

305
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,519
Anyway, chin up.

306
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,888
It's no fun
seeing the complainer like this.

307
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,158
We have a lot to do for Ms. Seo.

308
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,777
Seriously...

309
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,248
My back.

310
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,424
Ms. Kim, I'm back.

311
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,960
Se-jin.

312
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,946
This should be enough
to shake them up a little.

313
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,816
They created an entire task force
just for me.

314
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,585
I should show my respect.

315
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,224
I'll get the remaining documents
from Ms. Kim.

316
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:43,361
The system is running well again,
so it won't take long.

317
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,800
But what about Ma-ri's dad?

318
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,637
-What about him?
-If he lies to the prosecutor,

319
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,673
you'll have to go in for questioning.

320
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,108
We need to find something before then.

321
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,878
I doubt Gun-woo did it.

322
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,614
I'm sure it was Jong-gyu Nam.

323
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,054
You said Gun-woo has a lot of fear,

324
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,756
remember?

325
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,961
At first, he tried to stick to the rules,
even as he was betraying someone.

326
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:22,500
But as things got tougher, he kept finding
new excuses and rationalizing to himself.

327
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:29,541
Eventually, he'll come to believe
that those reasons and goals are real.

328
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,812
So? Do you feel sorry for him?

329
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,881
Yes.

330
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,551
In my eyes,

331
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,220
you are the same.

332
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,790
Is making someone President

333
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,993
and becoming the wealthiest person
in the country

334
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,796
the top that you want to reach?

335
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:53,898
It isn't.

336
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:58,069
When you get there, there will be stairs
to somewhere higher.

337
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,441
I can worry about that once I'm there.

338
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,176
I know.

339
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,446
You'll keep climbing without worrying

340
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:14,652
since you don't want to live
a single second if you're dead.

341
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:17,922
And that...

342
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,492
makes me sad.

343
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,695
-Se-jin.
-Mr. Jo is unconscious

344
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,965
and Ms. Kim has no one to lean on,

345
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,635
but you will not stop.

346
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,138
You'll keep climbing up

347
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,241
and stand alone at the top.

348
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,377
You, up there,

349
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,847
seem beautiful

350
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,251
yet sad at the same time.

351
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,596
Tak and I will figure out the problem
regarding Ma-ri's dad.

352
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,066
I'm sure we can come up with something.

353
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,786
What's going on with Yi-kyung?
Is it going as planned?

354
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,657
We're taking our first step
for the Neo City Project today.

355
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:36,127
Don't worry about that.
It'll just give you a headache.

356
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,998
Make sure it doesn't hurt the company.

357
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,744
What happened with Mr. Son?

358
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,780
He's resisting,
but he won't last much longer.

359
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,515
Are you done with your part?

360
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,319
The task force is gathering documents
that may appear to be illegal loans.

361
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,555
Gallery S and Chunha Financing had
so many transactions,

362
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,224
it'll be a piece of cake.

363
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,528
It's our first and last time
working together. Let's do this right.

364
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,168
Over the past 15 days,

365
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,306
the Neo City Project completed
receiving outside investments,

366
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,442
and on the first of next month,
we will be breaking ground.

367
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,913
The project is being hailed as the biggest
construction since the founding of Korea.

368
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,750
It'll be the best opportunity
for Moojin Group

369
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,319
to prove our potential and capabilities.

370
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,355
They'll have to rush
before the business gets held up.

371
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:41,626
They want to get the business running
before the licensing corruption

372
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,661
that Chairman Moo-il Park was involved in.

373
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,563
They can rush, but it'll be useless.

374
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,800
If these internal deals that were involved
in obtaining the land get out,

375
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,369
the Neo City Project will come to
a complete halt.

376
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,372
I went to the site,
and there isn't even an office there.

377
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,040
That isn't all.

378
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,345
Most of these companies
are paper companies.

379
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,947
They bought land using the names
of paper companies,

380
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,383
and bought them for much more
once the project was announced.

381
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,119
It's so easy for the rich to make money
in this country.

382
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:11,756
And the money they made from it
probably went into their slush fund.

383
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,092
Do you think Gun-woo knows as well?

384
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,693
I'm half sure.

385
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,663
It was before he took over the project,
so he may not know.

386
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,802
Ms. Kim, you can do
the additional investigation.

387
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,105
Tak and Se-jin, mark Ma-ri.

388
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,008
It'll be a pain if we lose Gi-tae Son.

389
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:31,909
Okay.

390
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,513
But Se-jin, are you back at the gallery?

391
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,249
I'm not back
and I'm not working part-time either.

392
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,251
I'm just here to help for free.

393
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,020
That's not right.

394
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,655
You're thorough when it comes
to calculations. You can't do that.

395
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,358
Meeting adjourned.

396
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:03,975
Goodness.

397
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,179
Why are you doing this to yourself?

398
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,348
You have to pay for your sins anyway.

399
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,684
All you need to do is take someone
with you as a companion.

400
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,454
You must...

401
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,957
keep your promise.

402
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,760
Just make sure to get Yi-kyung Seo
on the hook.

403
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,297
Gun-woo Park and I will take care
of the rest.

404
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,568
Then...

405
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,303
Go ahead.

406
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:38,409
Let me see my daughter
before I turn myself in.

407
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,746
She has quite the temper.

408
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:47,351
If I turn myself in
without telling her first,

409
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:54,225
my daughter will disown me.

410
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,262
I think she noticed.

411
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,597
Pull up behind her.

412
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,232
-Se-jin.
-Go on.

413
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,928
Se-jin, were you following me?

414
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,198
I was.

415
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:08,533
Why?

416
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:09,967
To find your dad.

417
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:12,937
If we don't, our boss will be in trouble.

418
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,175
Where are you going?

419
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,680
To see my dad.

420
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,217
But I can't go if you follow me.

421
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,686
Se-jin.

422
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:33,424
I can't stand him and he's pathetic,
but he's still my dad.

423
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,928
Help me see my dad.

424
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:39,697
Se-jin.

425
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,807
The roads are slippery.

426
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,077
Drive carefully.

427
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,548
Thank you. Thank you so much.

428
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:14,732
What are you doing? Get in!

429
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,111
Don't go after her.

430
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:29,547
What...

431
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,617
I'll explain to Ms. Seo.

432
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,053
She's...

433
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,356
my friend.

434
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,066
There's nothing wrong
with the transactions between us.

435
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,869
Can they frame you with these?

436
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,439
Moojin's Special Team is on par
with secret government agencies.

437
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,844
They can fix what's there
or create what isn't.

438
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,814
Plus, I'm sure they've been working
with a prosecutor already.

439
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:11,889
And they want to use my son
as a witness in that production.

440
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,525
They'll regret it if they aren't careful.

441
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:20,398
The moment they throw a jab,
I'll counter with a final blow.

442
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,408
-Hi.
-I'm sorry.

443
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,819
Dad. Dad.

444
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,125
It's okay, Ma-ri.

445
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,829
I'm okay.

446
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,265
What happened to your face?

447
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,334
Did those jerks hit you?

448
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:58,903
No, they didn't.

449
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,138
I told you not to be greedy.

450
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,910
I don't need to go to Europe
and I don't need a sports car.

451
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,546
I just need you to stay, please?

452
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,550
I raised my daughter well.

453
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,252
Don't worry.

454
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:17,521
I'm turning myself in.

455
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,759
-Really?
-Of course. You can trust me.

456
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:28,566
See? You're not a bad person.

457
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,335
No one else knows.

458
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,572
Grandpa doesn't know, but I do.

459
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,073
Okay, okay.

460
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,442
As long as you know.

461
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,787
Gi-tae Son just went
to the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office.

462
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,189
Will he get the story straight?

463
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,491
Of course.

464
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,826
Once your task force
submits the documents,

465
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,362
Yi-kyung Seo won't be able
to find a way out.

466
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,564
Okay. We'll talk later.

467
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,957
Gi-tae Son turned himself in.

468
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:28,759
I heard.

469
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,531
If you had followed her,
Tak would've been able to handle it.

470
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,234
I insisted...

471
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,237
that we let her see her dad.

472
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,173
They'll come after us now.

473
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,310
In other words, your friendship created
annoying complications.

474
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:48,846
I'm sorry.

475
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:52,316
Don't apologize to me.
Tell that to Gun-woo.

476
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:57,254
If Gun-woo uses Gi-tae Son
to cause trouble,

477
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:01,358
he'll have to enter a fight,
which he will obviously lose.

478
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:06,096
You pushed him into a corner
that he could've avoided.

479
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,835
I was thinking of Ma-ri...

480
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:14,605
Just because you have the best intentions
doesn't mean the results are beautiful.

481
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,409
You may go.

482
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,829
Forget what she said.

483
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,500
At least Ma-ri got to see her dad.

484
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,570
If they collide like this,
neither Ms. Seo nor Gun-woo

485
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,240
will win this fight.

486
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,879
They'll both be damaged,
but there will be a winner.

487
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,749
What if they can resolve it
without fighting?

488
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,418
Dream on.
Do you want to get scolded again?

489
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,989
I know. I can't change Ms. Seo on my own.

490
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:09,960
But I can get Gun-woo to stop.

491
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:10,995
Gun-woo Park?

492
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:15,232
No matter what you say,
he won't believe you that easily.

493
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:17,701
Well,

494
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,671
I won't know until I try.

495
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,373
Hey, Se-jin.

496
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,653
Did Yi-kyung declare war against me
or something?

497
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,989
I came to say something
you both know well.

498
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:44,261
In all honesty,
you don't want to fight Ms. Seo, do you?

499
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,667
Making Ma-ri's dad lie
and forging documents

500
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,437
is not the method you wanted, is it?

501
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,473
-Se-jin.
-Please stop.

502
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,877
Then neither of you will be hurt.

503
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,279
It isn't that simple.

504
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,716
No, it is extremely simple.

505
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:09,553
Even without a big incident
or a great opportunity,

506
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,624
all you have to do is tell yourself,
"Let's stop here." That's all.

507
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:20,764
I wanted something I didn't have,
and you didn't want to lose what you had.

508
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,634
I'm not saying that greed is bad.

509
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:29,340
I'm just saying you don't need
to use a method you do not like.

510
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,844
Are you saying
you found the method that you like?

511
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,082
I'm still searching.

512
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,518
But I don't plan to give up.

513
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:46,824
You and I both like Ms. Seo.

514
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:52,463
That's why we hate her,
and that's why we get angry.

515
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:59,269
It'll become much easier if you're true
to your feelings toward her.

516
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,841
You've changed somehow.

517
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:06,510
Is that a compliment?

518
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,450
Should I tell you something
you don't know?

519
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:18,756
Corruption behind
Moojin's Neo City's land purchases.

520
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,860
That is how Ms. Seo will attack you.

521
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:37,107
Yes, Ms. Moon.
It's a Special Team emergency meeting.

522
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,077
Call them in right away.
I'm on my way as well.

523
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:47,851
You and I both like Ms. Seo.

524
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:53,424
That's why we hate her,
and that's why we get angry.

525
00:44:55,059 --> 00:45:00,364
It'll become much easier if you're true
to your feelings toward her.

526
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:03,734
Please stop.

527
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,770
Then neither of you will be hurt.

528
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,476
I'm going to start writing
my own music, too.

529
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:48,979
It's a gift.

530
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,216
Will you come watch us practice sometime?

531
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:59,022
Do you have any hobbies?
You don't even have friends, do you?

532
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,793
Hey, hey, hey.

533
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:06,930
Listen to some music
and make some friends.

534
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,200
People smell much sweeter than money.

535
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,204
Want me to be your friend?

536
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,241
I don't need it.

537
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,048
I'm sorry for worrying you.

538
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:01,618
It was bad luck.
Thank goodness it wasn't worse.

539
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,087
Gi-tae Son...

540
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,156
He went to the prosecutor.

541
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:10,594
I'll probably get a subpoena
in a day or two.

542
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:16,433
Would Gun-woo Park go that far?

543
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,074
I remembered something from the past
while I was lying here.

544
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:30,714
If we hadn't entrapped him back then,

545
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:35,786
you may have led
a completely different life.

546
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:43,327
You say useless things at times, too.

547
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:48,065
I must be getting old.

548
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:24,301
Mr. Park, the meeting will begin
in ten minutes.

549
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,671
Ms. Moon.

550
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:34,511
If my late uncle saw me now,
what do you think he would've said?

551
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,751
MOOJIN NEO CITY PROJECT EXPANSION MEETING

552
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:03,073
Before we begin our meeting today,
I have an important announcement to make.

553
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:07,878
Based on the Special Team's discrete
internal investigation,

554
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,514
we found illegal transactions

555
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:14,918
that exceed our imagination
during the land purchasing process.

556
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,759
-Gun-woo.
-This is something

557
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:26,296
that I, being in charge of the project,
cannot look past.

558
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:29,800
It is a corruption that must be exposed
for the sake of Moojin Group.

559
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,503
What are you saying?

560
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,507
I plan to punish everyone involved
and hold them accountable,

561
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:40,110
and there will be
legal ramifications as well.

562
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:44,114
Moreover, I plan to ask the public
for forgiveness

563
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:48,518
for failing to fulfill our duties
to society.

564
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,128
Moojin... I mean, Gun-woo Park

565
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:00,998
announced that they will stop
the Neo City Project.

566
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:27,090
Are you out of your mind?
Are you trying to destroy the company?

567
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,792
Were you involved, too?

568
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,262
I'm saying this as the chairman
because I'm worried about the company!

569
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:33,563
That's good.

570
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:36,666
As a manager,
I made this decision for the company.

571
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,069
Gun-woo.

572
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,744
"There is no need to be angry
at the world. Do not blame others,

573
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,915
and carry the sins
you committed yourself."

574
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,858
Okay, I've heard your story now.

575
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,027
Let's hear the other story.

576
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,130
Big Love Bank's illegal loans

577
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,000
were ordered by Yi-kyung Seo,
weren't they?

578
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,403
See?

579
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,739
You're not a bad person.

580
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,075
No one else knows.

581
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,845
Grandpa doesn't know, but I do.

582
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,554
No.

583
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:32,756
What?

584
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,393
I was solely responsible
for the illegal loans.

585
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:39,963
No one else was involved,

586
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:42,833
not Yi-kyung Seo or anyone else.

587
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:51,174
Gi-tae Son flipped his testimony on us.
He played us.

588
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,910
-Is that right?
-Let's push forward

589
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:55,579
with the documents you prepared.

590
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,047
I destroyed them all.

591
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:01,618
Mr. Park.

592
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,956
There may be no valuable loss,
but there must be a less embarrassing one.

593
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:07,824
That's enough for me.

594
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:13,663
I still have the rebate documents
on Chairman Moo-sam Park.

595
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:17,134
You should take that up with my uncle.

596
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,570
It's gotten cold.

597
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:24,641
Don't waste your energy,
and tend to Mr. Jang in prison.

598
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:34,718
Just what did Se-jin say to you?

599
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,622
Something so obvious that I had forgotten.

600
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:44,728
Just how much I liked you.
She made me remember that.

601
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:49,466
She shared a simple know-how with me, too.

602
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,170
That even without any reason or incident,

603
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:57,340
the moment I say I'll stop,
it'll all come to an end.

604
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:06,316
But you know, I knew all along,

605
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:11,087
that if we took this fight all the way,
you would win,

606
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,357
although I hate to admit it.

607
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:19,563
Accept it. That's a fact I know, too.

608
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:28,672
My phone has been ringing nonstop
ever since the announcement.

609
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,740
I should go.

610
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:35,779
So, have you let it all go, now?

611
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:39,449
What do you mean?
Like Mr. Nam would sit still?

612
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:43,753
If anything happens to my uncle,
I'll have to fill in as chairman.

613
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,257
If I'm lucky,
I may just become the chairman, too.

614
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,162
You're quite greedy. It's good to see.

615
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:59,369
I remember the joke you made
when we were with Se-jin.

616
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,673
Even though it was momentary,

617
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:06,977
you wanted to stop too.

618
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:09,379
Right?

619
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,241
What's wrong? Did something happen?

620
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,411
Is it Mr. Jo?

621
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:44,014
No, Ms. Seo...

622
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,416
What about her?

623
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:52,088
What did you say to her?

624
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:53,957
-What?
-What did you say,

625
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,992
that she's folding everything
and returning to Japan?

626
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,240
-Ms. Seo.
-Hi.

627
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,475
You're going to Japan?

628
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,045
Why so suddenly?

629
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:22,152
It's no fun anymore.
There's no one to fight anymore, either.

630
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,158
I'm kidding. Laugh.

631
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:30,393
It isn't funny.

632
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:32,762
What is this?

633
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,898
Why are you suddenly leaving?

634
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,235
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

635
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,013
Ms. Kim will bring Mr. Jo back
once he's recovered.

636
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,649
Please visit him regularly.

637
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,285
Tak seems seriously pissed off.

638
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:58,054
Although I'm sure he'll come too,
once he gets over it.

639
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,361
You still haven't told me the reason.

640
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:11,101
It's what you wanted. My stopping.

641
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:16,806
Don't be too smug.
It isn't completely because of you.

642
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,277
I've already seen everything
I needed to see here.

643
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,914
I remembered a few things
I need to do there, too.

644
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:26,616
Ms. Seo.

645
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,786
Stopping when you can reach the top.

646
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,722
That's true power.

647
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:35,625
Don't go.

648
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,697
Even if you start over, do it here.

649
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:42,966
Se-jin.

650
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,468
You said you never lose something
you once wanted.

651
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,072
So how could you leave like this?

652
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,575
I never lost it, and I never let it go.

653
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:56,880
Because Se-jin you are my mirror.

654
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,152
-Se-jin.
-I...

655
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,622
won't go with you.

656
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:09,426
I know.

657
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:12,762
I will

658
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:15,498
climb my way up

659
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:18,301
on my own here.

660
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:22,839
You should. That's why I taught you.

661
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,681
I need your help with one last thing.

662
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,465
Everything in Gallery S is
in these numbers.

663
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:55,171
Once I make the initial calculations,
you check them.

664
00:57:56,873 --> 00:58:00,109
I'm warning you, it is more boring
than you can imagine.

665
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:02,979
I'm prepared.

666
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,582
Shall we begin?

667
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:16,326
For just one hour,
I want you to be me, Se-jin.

668
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:20,497
Can I really act...

669
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:22,232
like you?

670
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:25,101
Ask yourself, Se-jin.

671
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,405
Even if it's very brief,
even if it's a lie,

672
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:31,875
do you want to be like me?

673
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,178
You sent me there

674
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:37,714
knowing what will happen.

675
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:40,483
So? How did it feel to be me?

676
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:47,891
What did I do wrong?

677
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,560
Is being poor a sin?

678
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,162
Is it my fault I was born poor?

679
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,832
Of course. Being poor is a sin.

680
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,067
Can you really make me...

681
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:01,804
like you?

682
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,341
If your ambition is real,
do not be afraid of money.

683
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:10,179
If you fear the weapon you possess,
you can't win the fight.

684
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,183
I want all those lights.

685
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,254
You will become me someday.

686
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:22,859
What meaning would that spot
on top of the world have?

687
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,595
I'm not climbing up there
to find any meaning.

688
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:30,466
The desire to climb up.
That itself is the meaning.

689
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:01,230
I'm done.

690
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,967
-Any errors?
-It's perfect.

691
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,068
Are you sure?

692
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,036
Shall we do it again?

693
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:09,806
Good job.

694
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:25,288
I'll look forward
to seeing the kingdom you'll build.

695
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:31,828
It won't take long.

696
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,068
Every coin is a god and a life.

697
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,039
You lost your mind.

698
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,643
Find every single one.

699
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:26,783
Something so obvious that I had forgotten.

700
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,520
Just how much I liked you.

701
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,622
She made me remember that.

702
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,026
And...

703
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:40,063

it'll all come to an end.

705
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,104
You wanted to stop too.

706
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:51,040
Right?

01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:28,905
