EPISODE 5

2
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:51,918
You rat.

3
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,521
-Shit.
-Tak!

4
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,422
Sir.

5
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,557
-Please calm down.
-Did you do this?

6
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,815
Long time no see, Gun-woo.

7
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,517
Yi-kyung, you...

8
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:26,719
What a shame.

9
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,190
This isn't how I wanted to meet again.

10
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,531
What are you doing?

11
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,067
Things got complicated.

12
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,535
Then explain it simply.

13
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,171
Let's put out the fire first.

14
00:01:58,985 --> 00:01:59,986
Stay out of it.

15
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:02,522
It's Ms. Seo's personal life.

16
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:05,892
Are you okay?

17
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,095
I would've been fine
if you hadn't stopped me.

18
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,098
Stay out of it next time.

19
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,273
A Year...

20
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,442
You're so mean.

21
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,111
You didn't call once.

22
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:32,986
You look good.

23
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:34,888
You look even more gorgeous.

24
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,456
You too.

25
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,859
You look better in a suit than jeans.

26
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,928
It's suffocating not being able to
do whatever I want.

27
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,365
It always reminds me of the past.

28
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,635
Whenever I looked up
after playing my guitar,

29
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,005
you sat there with that look on your face
12 years ago.

30
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,119
Do you still have

31
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:07,820
that coin?

32
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,292
This is why I didn't call.

33
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,861
Reminiscing about the old days

34
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:16,729
is not my thing.

35
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,232
So you are the Yi-kyung that I know.

36
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,301
I remember the way you talk.

37
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,772
Was it also you

38
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,775
the other day? At the wedding hall.

39
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:33,646
It was, wasn't it?

40
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,417
I tried to recycle your memories.

41
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,587
-What?
-When we first met at the temple.

42
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,523
You followed me then, too.

43
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,728
Let's stop talking about the past.

44
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,464
I have a lot to do.

45
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,133
All my artwork burned,
so I took a huge loss.

46
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,672
I can tell why you came to Korea.

47
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,543
I'm sure it was your father's orders.
Like successor training.

48
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:04,978
But

49
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,314
I don't understand
why you teamed up with my uncle.

50
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,351
An employee awaiting assignment
doesn't need to know that much.

51
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,052
Yi-kyung.

52
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:16,556
I figured

53
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,859
we'd meet again someday, somehow.

54
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,394
But this...

55
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:23,997
Not like this.

56
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,101
-What happened to you?
-It's simple.

57
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,104
As promised, I became a villain,

58
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,973
and you haven't changed at all.

59
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,177
Even your habit of trying
to be right and good.

60
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,026
Excuse me.

61
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,700
When I lied about my name before,
that was all my doing.

62
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,103
I don't want you to think
Ms. Seo had me do it.

63
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,177
Hey, Korean girl.
Get lost from our district.

64
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,813
I wondered when you'd come.

65
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,182
You're from the Matsuoka Family, right?

66
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,486
My father built this kingdom.

67
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,688
You're the one who should get lost!

68
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,490
Get her!

69
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,068
Hey. This is bad. It's really bad.

70
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,080
Shit.

71
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,452
Yi-kyung.

72
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,059
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

73
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,222
Let's get to the hospital.
Or at least call home.

74
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,423
Want me to do it?

75
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,791
-Yi-kyung.
-Leave me alone.

76
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,462
It happens now and then.
It's not a big deal.

77
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,032
You can't even walk straight.
How is it not a big deal?

78
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,868
If you won't see a doctor,
at least call home.

79
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,503
Forget it. I'll take care of it.

80
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,638
I know you're a stubborn mule,

81
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,540
but what is your father thinking?

82
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,444
It's obvious it'll be dangerous
to collect money at night.

83
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,214
Doesn't he care what happens
to his daughter?

84
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,051
How long will you run
these stupid errands?

85
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,456
This is how it always ends.

86
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,593
If I let them stick around,
they act like they know everything.

87
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,164
Look, Mr. Gun-woo Park,
know yourself first.

88
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,567
I don't want your stupid warnings,

89
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,769
involvement, or pity.

90
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:25,671
Yi-kyung.

91
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,740
Do you really not get it?

92
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,711
Do you not know
why I'm so worried about you?

93
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,554
You ran away from Korea, but you have
the time to worry about others?

94
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,556
That's indulgence.

95
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,791
-Yi-kyung.
-I'll live my own way,

96
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,661
the way I learned
and experienced on these streets.

97
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,431
So don't try to chime in
on how to live my life.

98
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,551
I'll go home now.

99
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,523
Don't drink alone because you feel down.

100
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,927
Promote me to executive director
of drinking, and I'll drink with you.

101
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,328
Hey, punk.
You should've called my assistant...

102
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,496
MOOJIN PRODUCE FOREIGN BRANCH

103
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,798
You know what this is, don't you?

104
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,137
Am I supposed to know?

105
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,007
Then you must not know where I went
with the Auditing Team.

106
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,342
You're supposed to wait

107
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,777
until you get placed somewhere.

108
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,147
If you have time to take the Auditing Team
on a picnic, clean out your office.

109
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,116
How did you choose to work with Gallery S?

110
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,485
Did you choose them,

111
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,253
or did Yi-kyung Seo approach you first?

112
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,656
Yi-kyung Seo?

113
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,025
Who's that?

114
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:08,427
Check your documents.

115
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,063
The name, date, transaction details,
everything's there.

116
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,500
I can't look at every transaction
each foreign branch conducts.

117
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,438
Regardless, that route is closed,
so be careful.

118
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,207
Tell Yi-kyung to stop
getting involved, as well.

119
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,309
Gun-woo.

120
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,445
You should take this with you.

121
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,880
I have plenty of copies.

122
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,149
I gave a set to the Auditing Team, too.

123
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,552
PRESIDENT, MOO-SAM PARK

124
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,795
LIST OF GALLERY S SALES ITEMS

125
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,185
There's nothing Gun-woo Park can do.

126
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,422
We got rid of the evidence
and the transaction documents are clean.

127
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,194
As long as we're cautious about
the special transaction, we'll be fine

128
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,529
You say that because you don't know him.

129
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,666
Once he goes off-course,
you don't know where he'll go.

130
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,202
If he used this--

131
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,238
You should uncover that.

132
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,439
What?

133
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,809
If there is a whistleblower in the group,
this will not be the end of it.

134
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,246
You must find it, no matter what.

135
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,319
The gallery took a big hit
from what happened yesterday.

136
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,956
I'll have Mr. Jo process
the compensation request.

137
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,995
You set the fire,
but you want me to compensate?

138
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,264
If not for that fire,

139
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,533
the Auditing Team would have been
investigating you.

140
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,037
You should be precise about money
with those on your side.

141
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,647
By the way,

142
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,183
do you and Gun-woo have
a past or something?

143
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,022
He asked a lot about you.

144
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,925
I'm sure the target is you.

145
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,930
I hope you'd refrain
from dropping in like this.

146
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,032
There are many watching.

147
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:01,867
Have a nice day.

148
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,523
Is it about what happened yesterday?

149
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:26,558
What happened?

150
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,194
-What?
-Ms. Seo and Gun-woo Park.

151
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,562
Did anything else happen?

152
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,799
I don't know either.
It's her personal life.

153
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,837
Seeing how he called those close to him
from the association,

154
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,573
Chairman Son isn't making empty threats.

155
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,644
I put up with Mr. Park's tantrums.

156
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,113
Now, it's Chairman Son.

157
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,716
He may withdraw your appointment
as financial director.

158
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,584
I'll be meeting Mr. Jang soon.

159
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,788
It's too late to kill time
and patronize him.

160
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,224
Call Baeksong Foundation directly.

161
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:04,797
Did you want me?

162
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,465
We'll take a shortcut from now on.

163
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,094
What are you doing?

164
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:39,732
Hey, Se-jin.

165
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,319
Thanks.

166
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,299
Everything you do from now on
will be in my place.

167
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,302
Stop impersonating me with just my name.

168
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,471
Fight as the real Se-jin Lee.

169
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,207
Can you do it?

170
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,546
May I choose an outfit

171
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,849
from your closet
instead of getting a new one?

172
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:46,932
My apologies.

173
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,269
Ms. Seo had an important meeting,
so I came in her stead.

174
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,240
I am Se-jin Lee of Gallery S.

175
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,014
Even if she came herself and begged,
it wouldn't be enough.

176
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,615
How can she be so audacious?

177
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,718
Sir, please take care of this right away.

178
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,989
Tell Ms. Seo that as of today,

179
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,426
she's been removed from her position
as financial director.

180
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,530
Wait.

181
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,068
I read through
the Articles of Association,

182
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,905
and the entire association must vote
on removing a director from office.

183
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,608
So if you want to fire Ms. Seo,

184
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,577
you'll have to hold
a general meeting first.

185
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,779
What was that?

186
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,781
There are exceptions,

187
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,384
such as embezzling
the association's funds.

188
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,386
Then they may be fired immediately.

189
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,356
I heard that's why
the previous director was kicked out.

190
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,025
Watch your manners.

191
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,194
Right, I almost forgot.

192
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,732
Ms. Seo said she has an appointment
at 4 p.m. in Seongbuk tomorrow,

193
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,368
and that you should come then
if you want to see Mr. Jang.

194
00:18:59,004 --> 00:18:59,905
-Just one.
-It's over.

195
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,340
Please, Dad.

196
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,142
-You never stop.
-Come on.

197
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,383
Oh, my.

198
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,019
Awesome.

199
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,789
You look like your boss.

200
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:20,959
Where's Yi-kyung?

201
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,028
Don't tell me you came in her place.

202
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,131
You've got to be kidding me.

203
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,734
Why? What's going on?

204
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,604
What are you doing?
Go tell her that she's been fired.

205
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,008
Aren't you the one who was kicked out?

206
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,410
Be nice to your dad.

207
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,112
I'm sure it's been tough for him.

208
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:41,914
Hey!

209
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,169
Please proceed.

210
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,406
You'll go after Yi-kyung Seo?

211
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,209
Even heir like yourself

212
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,444
ends up alone in the wilderness
if you lose power.

213
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,580
You can clean up your company

214
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,748
and I'll remove the stray.

215
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,784
It's a win-win situation.

216
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,520
You must have a big grudge
against Ms. Seo.

217
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,023
You're after Moo-sam Park too, aren't you?

218
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,459
Our situations are alike.

219
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,730
Do you know anything about Ms. Seo?

220
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,333
Her business relationships
or personal things?

221
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,069
Hey. You're mistaken
regarding your target.

222
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,771
I'll get Yi-kyung.

223
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,841
You take Moo-sam Park--

224
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,710
Do you think someone like you
can take her down?

225
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,247
Forget it.

226
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,917
I looked through the catalog,
but I'm not interested in buying.

227
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,185
You may leave now.

228
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,426
You don't seem to get it.

229
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,929
Being the financial director

230
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,266
means she has a direct line to Mr. Jang.

231
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,168
If she becomes close with him,

232
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,138
she'd give Moo-sam Park wings.

233
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,107
He'll fly high.

234
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,579
Ms. Moon, our guest hasn't left yet.

235
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,907
I'll become a villain.

236
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,544
I'll climb to the top

237
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,213
and look down on the world.

238
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,367
CHAIRMAN MOO-IL PARK

239
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,771
I'm sorry for asking you to come
when you're so busy.

240
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,482
What are you doing there?

241
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,619
This chair is comfortable.

242
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,388
You become fond of it.

243
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,892
I hear you're busy trying to find
the whistleblower.

244
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,628
You should've asked me directly.

245
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,130
You wasted your time.

246
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,032
What?

247
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,878
That intel

248
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,947
didn't come from within.

249
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,549
I got it from Baeksong Foundation.

250
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,721
They said they'd get my back if I want.

251
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,490
According to Mr. Jang.

252
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:13,925
So?

253
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,262
If you latch onto an old, toothless tiger,

254
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,031
do you think you can sit there?

255
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,267
You know I hate
fighting within the family.

256
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,069
But

257
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,005
don't covet the chairman seat.

258
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,910
The next chairman will be either
the president of Moojin Electronics

259
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,479
or the president of Moojin Life.

260
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,648
You brat.

261
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,117
Are you trying to threaten me?

262
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,919
If you give up,

263
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,522
I won't need to visit Mr. Jang.

264
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,157
Please

265
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,293
let me continue to pretend to be nice.

266
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,369
The documents came from Mr. Jang?

267
00:23:58,837 --> 00:23:59,905
That's possible.

268
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,242
No.

269
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,812
I'll check for myself.

270
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,100
You came

271
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:03,902
a long way.

272
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,742
Gosh.

273
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,411
Let's see.

274
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,283
TO MOO-IL PARK

275
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,339
Mr. Chairman!

276
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,675
Are you all right? Mr. Chairman!

277
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,078
Dr. Park!

278
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,784
KOREA-JAPAN CO-OP NIGHT
1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS

279
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,352
BONG-SOO SEO, TAE-JOON JANG, MOO-IL PARK

280
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,327
It's been a while, Chairman Son.

281
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,529
How have you been, sir?

282
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,932
I'm Yi-kyung Seo of Gallery S.

283
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,935
I apologize for last time.

284
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:15,440
You always look healthy, Chairman Son.

285
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:17,909
I'm nothing compared to you.

286
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:19,644
No, no.

287
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,680
No need to sit down.

288
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,349
Pardon?

289
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,287
He worked hard for a very long time
for the association, hasn't he?

290
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,423
It's been seven years and five months.

291
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,560
I think you should rest now.

292
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,730
I asked you to come to tell you that.

293
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:40,699
But sir...

294
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,134
You should look after your company
that you've been neglecting

295
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,905
and take care of your child as well,
if you have time.

296
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,710
You have much to do.

297
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,247
My son's mistake

298
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,117
is unrelated to your funds.

299
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,920
He was trying to refill the funds--

300
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,956
Your time with Mr. Jang is up.

301
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,398
Han Feizi

302
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,735
I copied over one page a day

303
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,471
to give it to you whenever you come.

304
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,376
It took a little over a year.

305
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,978
I made you wait long.

306
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,613
I'm sorry.

307
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,249
So,

308
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,386
what do you plan to take from me?

309
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,991
If you're trying to reclaim
what your father lost,

310
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:17,395
it'll take quite a bit of effort.

311
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,836
The kingmaker
for the next presidential election.

312
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,241
You want to become the king's father
who controls the nation again, don't you?

313
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:31,743
I will give you

314
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,412
that opportunity.

315
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,353
Not revenge, but an opportunity?

316
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,557
I will refill your leaky safe.

317
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,493
It sounds so good,
that I'd like to believe you.

318
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,929
I have a plan and the person.

319
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,565
But I also have a condition.

320
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,503
You'll have to discard Gun-woo Park.

321
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,240
I'm holding the ace of Moojin Group.

322
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,710
You've watched me for long
just like reading that thick book.

323
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,813
So you must know what I'm capable of.

324
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,850
I am your last opportunity.

325
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,790
The most important thing
seems to be lacking.

326
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,628
Trust.

327
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,333
I have no reason to believe
Bong-soo Seo's daughter.

328
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,478
You are correct.

329
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,353
That is why my father failed.

330
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,123
He was betrayed by friends
whom he trusted.

331
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,028
I am confident that I would succeed

332
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,431
since I don't trust anyone.

333
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:09,707
Ma'am.

334
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,276
We'll have to wait.

335
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,481
Until his greed overpowers his distrust.

336
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,907
MOOSONG FOUNDATION

337
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,814
KOREA-JAPAN CO-OP NIGHT
1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS

338
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:54,619
Bong-soo Seo's daughter came to Korea.

339
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,824
How did you know?

340
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:03,995
How do you feel?

341
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,563
I'm fine.

342
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:09,000
I must have been a little dizzy.

343
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:16,441
This man.

344
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,143
What is your relationship with him?

345
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,446
Were you friends?

346
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,258
Please give your daughter a chance.

347
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,360
-Yi-kyung
-Stay put.

348
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:36,995
has the right to be free.

349
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,663
You impertinent brat.

350
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,020
Calm down. I'm not here
to talk about the past.

351
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,339
Return to Japan.

352
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,576
Whatever it is you planned,
it won't go your way.

353
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,746
So close the business you started here

354
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,815
and go back as soon as possible.

355
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,751
I remember.

356
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:09,420
You were

357
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:11,956
never good at making jokes.

358
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,558
My uncle

359
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,060
is already the chairman in his dream.

360
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,997
I'm going to turn that dream
into a nightmare.

361
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,300
I don't want to drag you
into that nightmare as well.

362
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,704
It's a warning for Yi-kyung Seo
from 12 years ago.

363
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,207
-And you have the power to do that?
-Tae-joon Jang.

364
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,244
I can be on his side whenever I please.

365
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,213
The person you want on your side.

366
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:43,287
Go ahead.

367
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,492
Let's do it.

368
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:16,954
Shit.

369
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,323
Is Gun-woo Park out already?

370
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:20,691
What are you doing?

371
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,393
How did you get in?

372
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,433
Know the enemy, know yourself
and you will never lose.

373
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,435
I'm looking for anything useful.

374
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,537
Is Gun-woo Park an enemy?

375
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,039
Do you think he's an ally?

376
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,545
Gun-woo Park

377
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,814
will be a headache for Ms. Seo.

378
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:45,983
Huh?

379
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,229
I'm too tired to see you out.

380
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,538
I heard about your father.

381
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:13,211
The trio behind the scenes
who made the 1988 Olympics a success.

382
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,214
The glory was short-lived.

383
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,951
For Mr. Jang,
it became a political burden.

384
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,788
My father coveted the assets
that would remain.

385
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,191
-I'm sorry.
-You aren't the one who should apologize.

386
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:28,426
I'm sorry

387
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,461
because I'll make you stop.

388
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,265
So...

389
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,667
go back before it gets harder,

390
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:38,736
Yi-kyung.

391
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,164
You said this was your dream.

392
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,466
But you gave it up.

393
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,637
You can't even save your own dream,

394
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,239
but what, you'll stop me?

395
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,609
If I were going to let you break me,

396
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,878
I wouldn't have even made it here.

397
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,684
Gun-woo, you can't win this fight.

398
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,522
A monster can't lose

399
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,125
to a human.

400
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,094
Gun-woo Park just left.

401
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,396
Is there anything else for me to do?

402
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:17,868
Okay, then.

403
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,238
Should I promote you?

404
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,210
To executive director of drinking
just for tonight.

405
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,270
Gun-woo Park

406
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:54,672
was a debtor.

407
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,390
I'm meeting Chairman Matsuoka today.

408
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,995
I need an apology for what happened.

409
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:21,666
How's your leg?

410
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,169
I can walk.

411
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,571
It's best to avoid

412
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:29,740
unnecessary fights.

413
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,276
You couldn't even call it a fight.

414
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,477
We just introduced ourselves.

415
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:38,616
Anything else?

416
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,351
Is there anything?

417
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:41,686
Like what?

418
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,208
This kid...

419
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,509
PERSONAL DATA

420
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,911
He's Moo-il's son?

421
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,046
Yes, sir.

422
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,614
We must be cursed.

423
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,455
We should end the bad blood

424
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,290
in our generation.

425
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:10,608
GUARANTOR

426
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:11,509
GUN-WOO PARK

427
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,614
Look.

428
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,417
I'm the one borrowing money.

429
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,686
He's just letting me use his name
as my guarantor.

430
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,321
Of course.

431
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,924
There won't be a problem
if you pay within the deadline.

432
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:27,892
Okay.

433
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,830
GUN-WOO PARK

434
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:12,503
I'm sorry, Gun-woo.

435
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,240
I'm a crazy piece of garbage.

436
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,381
Sang-chul.

437
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,361
ILHAN FINANCE

438
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,067
Did you lend Sang-chul money?

439
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,837
Not his remaining debt.
Did you give him a new loan?

440
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,974
Your joke isn't funny.

441
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,876
I don't work like that.

442
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,545
He has no collateral or guarantor--

443
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,980
I'm his guarantor.

444
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,483
He stole my immigration card and seal

445
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,784
and made me his guarantor.

446
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,053
Are you sure it's my office?

447
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,191
Did you really have nothing to do with it?

448
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,372
Hide for the time being.

449
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,840
Don't go to your part-time job.

450
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:23,774
Why should I?

451
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,509
Explain so I can understand.

452
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:29,747
My father...

453
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,517
I'm sure my father figured out about you.

454
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,654
He had you become the guarantor
because he was after you from the start.

455
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,056
What do you mean? Why would he do that?

456
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,395
Because he can't have
the successor of his kingdom,

457
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,063
become weak.

458
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,366
You've become an annoying obstacle.

459
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,336
Just for that?

460
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,972
He could do much worse for much less.

461
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,173
So you need to run away.

462
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,377
That means Sang-chul is in danger too.

463
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:01,545
He did it to himself.

464
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,682
He knew it was dangerous,
but sold you off for a few bucks.

465
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,651
If you have nowhere to hide,
I'll find one.

466
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,852
-First--
-No.

467
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,487
I need to find Sang-chul first.

468
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:12,323
What do you mean?

469
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:13,857
I can't just ignore him.

470
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,693
If you're right,
this happened because of me.

471
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,795
But you'll get hurt. It's dangerous.

472
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,734
"You ran away here,
but you worry about someone else."

473
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:26,337
You're right.

474
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,238
I am audacious.

475
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,743
Sorry for suspecting you.

476
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:06,910
Hey.

477
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:09,713
I'm sorry.

478
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,078
It was my father, wasn't it?

479
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:44,815
Where's Gun-woo's document?

480
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:46,583
I couldn't find it anywhere in the office.

481
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,385
-Miss--
-Is it in Father's safe?

482
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,720
Or a safety deposit box?

483
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,888
You know where it is.

484
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,257
This is why the chairman is concerned.

485
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,493
The person I know
wouldn't look for an answer like this.

486
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:00,931
You should forget Gun-woo Park.

487
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,801
The chairman will settle it himself.

488
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,927
You know I'm on your side, don't you?

489
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:32,162
What is it?

490
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,832
I heard Mr. Jo on the phone.

491
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,266
No, no.

492
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,570
-I wasn't trying to eavesdrop. I just--
-Ms. Kim.

493
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:41,972
That man.

494
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,274
Gun-woo Park is locked in a storage unit.

495
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:02,519
Don't worry.

496
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,722
I can handle a beating.

497
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,291
I told you to run.

498
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,427
I considered it,

499
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,931
but I couldn't find Sang-chul

500
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,835
and I couldn't leave without you.

501
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:29,980
Can you walk?

502
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:31,381
Hold onto me.

503
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:42,960
Go with me, Yi-kyung.

504
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,096
Anywhere.

505
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,465
Somewhere nobody will find us.

506
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,567
Leave with me.

507
00:47:58,976 --> 00:47:59,843
That's impossible.

508
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,311
It's not for my sake.

509
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:05,816
You need to escape from this mire.

510
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:07,985
Successor?

511
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,688
That's what your father wants.
That isn't your life.

512
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,360
This may be

513
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,695
the first and last chance.

514
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:21,398
I'll help you.

515
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:23,800
But first,

516
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:25,936
you must save yourself.

517
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:36,713
I won't

518
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,049
run away like this.

519
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,089
If I leave my father, I'll do it my way.

520
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,358
I'll leave with my head held high.

521
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:09,579
We have a cat burglar.

522
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,348
Did he tell you to do it?

523
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,351
To steal your dad's money

524
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,153
and run away with him?

525
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:17,220
Not at all.

526
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:21,058
I'm simply taking my share
from the work I've done.

527
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,696
There's no such thing.

528
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:28,598
You didn't even work that much.

529
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,233
My calculation is correct,

530
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,170
since I worked under you
ever since I graduated.

531
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,305
You were blinded by a guy
and betrayed your father,

532
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,874
so you fail as a child, too.

533
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,144
You're mistaken.

534
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:43,914
He has nothing to do with my decision.

535
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,283
It may be late,

536
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:50,020
but I just want to find my life.

537
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,256
Your life isn't out there.

538
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,494
It's here in my shadow.

539
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:59,529
It's a waste of time to talk any further.

540
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,968
I'm cashing out on my life thus far.

541
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:08,538
Calculate down to one yen.

542
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:10,807
Everything that you think is your share.

543
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:22,913
We're done.

544
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,448
There's more.

545
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,450
There's no point. That is your share.

546
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:28,118
No, I can do it.

547
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,221
I must have made a mistake somewhere--

548
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:32,322
Yi-kyung.

549
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,663
Don't covet a number you cannot have.

550
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,934
That amount
is the maximum value of your abilities.

551
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:08,525
Please

552
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:10,594
let Gun-woo go.

553
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,195
If you pay off his debt,

554
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,031
you'll be penniless.

555
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:18,869
You plan to leave empty-handed?

556
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:20,036
No.

557
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,139
I will not leave.

558
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,809
Promise that if I settle the loan

559
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,345
with my money,

560
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,414
you'll let Gun-woo go.

561
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,618
Then I'll start over
as the heir of Ilhan Finance.

562
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:38,855
This...

563
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,560
is the final offer I can make.

564
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:47,597
Will you accept it?

565
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,476
GUARANTOR, GUN-WOO PARK

566
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,231
Your coin and a song I write.

567
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:22,799
Doesn't that sound good?

568
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,870
I'll practice
and play it for you properly,

569
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,172
so let me borrow this coin until then.

570
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,348
Go with me, Yi-kyung.

571
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,650
Anywhere.

572
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,053
Somewhere nobody will find us.

573
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,188
Leave with me.

574
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,892
You need to escape from this mire.

575
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:51,428
This may be

576
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,863
the first and last chance.

577
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:57,934
I'll help you.

578
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:00,837
But first,

579
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:02,572
you must save yourself.

580
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:10,280
Yi-kyung! Yi-kyung Seo!

581
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:13,416
Yi-kyung! Yi-kyung Seo!

582
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,553
-You jerk.
-Stay put.

583
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,869
Please give your daughter a chance.

584
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:35,105
Yi-kyung

585
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,407
has the right to be free.

586
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:38,975
You impertinent brat.

587
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:39,909
Chairman.

588
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,054
I'll send him away.

589
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:53,690
You know.

590
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,927
Once I enter into a transaction,
I do my part no matter what.

591
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,413
I was framed as a thief in middle school.

592
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,984
I was a loner with no friends
and a Korean-Japanese.

593
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,820
I was the perfect prey.

594
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:27,857
My father was called to the school

595
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,328
and he even kneeled before the father
of the class president

596
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:33,129
who lost her money.

597
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,568
That building belonged to her father.

598
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,476
After I finished middle school,
I visited my father at his office,

599
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:51,181
and the class president's dad
was kneeling before my father.

600
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,285
That building...

601
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:58,855
is now my father's.

602
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:03,927
I can't give up

603
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,396
the power that money possess.

604
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,264
Did your father say something?

605
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:09,466
Did he threaten you? Or--

606
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,767
I made the decision.

607
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,472
I finally awoke from my dream.

608
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:20,009
Once I returned to reality,
I could see straight.

609
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:22,212
I must get stronger

610
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,214
and much smarter.

611
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:28,051
I can't do anything if I'm this weak.

612
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:30,620
Yi-kyung.

613
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:32,088
Don't lecture me.

614
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,424
Don't try to change my mind, either.

615
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,699
I'll become a villain.

616
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:46,669
I'll climb to the top

617
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,172
and look down on the world.

618
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,042
I won't be framed again

619
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:56,346
or be anyone's prey.

620
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:00,917
Yi-kyung.

621
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,690
But the time I spent with you

622
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:09,959
wasn't a bad dream.

623
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,062
Thank you.

624
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:15,865
Are you saying

625
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,202
it's over like this?

626
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,739
Go back to where you came from.

627
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:25,842
I'll stay here, where I've been living.

628
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:00,610
Goodbye.

629
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:55,365
Moo-yi Park of Moojin
Dies in an Accident in the Middle East

630
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:49,752
Wow.

631
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:52,755
That light

632
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,626
is brighter than all the other lights.

633
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:01,064
It's like Ms. Seo. Don't you agree?

634
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:26,489
Yi-kyung Seo speaking.

635
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,791
This is Jong-gyu Nam
of Baeksong Foundation.

636
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,594
Yes?

637
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,896
Mr. Jang would like to see you again.

638
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,099
Discreetly.

639
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:16,032
From now on, I would like you to be
my right-hand men.

640
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,434
-Sir.
-I can't give in either.

641
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:21,104
From now on, the real fight will begin.

642
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,307
The opponents are Tae-joon Jang
and Gun-woo Park.

643
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,410
Don't attack Yi-kyung Seo
without my permission anymore.

644
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:28,811
This is our fight.

645
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,279
Don't touch her.

646
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:33,916
The company has been attacked by a bomb
and I'm unable to do anything.

647
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,885
We should return that bomb.

648
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:37,887
Let's take care of them one at a time,

649
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,322
in the order of importance.

650
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,529
