1
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:44,411
That someone

2
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,080
should be needing my service.

3
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,749
The best option we have

4
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,653
is you taking over Moojin Group.

5
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,589
I should get rid of him or something.

6
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,626
I'll find a way to get rid of him.

7
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,128
I think there's something between him
and Ms. Seo.

8
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,466
This hand
isn't one that can fight someone.

9
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,667
You would've been happy

10
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,804
if you had followed your dream
and played the guitar for a living.

11
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,541
I'm sorry, Gun-woo.

12
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,843
Don't try to find out something
you don't need to know.

13
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,380
If you need to know, I would've told you,
even if you didn't ask.

14
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,015
You can't waste that money.

15
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,751
It's ingrained in you.

16
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,519
You feel safe if you have it

17
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,455
and insecure if you spend it.

18
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,290
That's the poor man's spirit.

19
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:31,458
But...

20
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,860
I want to reflect

21
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:36,663
your true image a little,

22
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:38,898
at least.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,634
Be careful.

24
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,803
You might break yourself.

25
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,173
I don't like my things

26
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,008
breaking.

27
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,284
It's not for my sake.

28
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,487
You need to escape from this mire.

29
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,923
That is Moo-il's son?

30
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,526
We need to end the feud

31
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,394
in our generation.

32
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,270
What is she up to?

33
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,643
KASHII SHRINE

34
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,180
TWELVE YEARS AGO IN JAPAN

35
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,585
EPISODE 4

36
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,395
Please show your respect here

37
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,863
and clap three times.

38
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,211
If you're done, we will move on.

39
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,013
Please watch your step.

40
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,661
Gosh.

41
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,232
MY ONE AND ONLY DESTINY, GUN-WOO PARK

42
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,177
A guitarist once said,

43
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,982
"The guitar is the best instrument
for getting rid of distracting thoughts."

44
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,819
Pete Townshend of The Who.

45
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,554
How did you know...

46
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,193
I used to be a musician.

47
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,831
I knew you were Korean
from the name tag on your bag.

48
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,301
I see. Then you are from Korea--

49
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,671
Nationality is meaningless
to one who follows the way of Buddha.

50
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,976
The sun is setting,

51
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,714
but I do not see a nest in which
to fold my wings.

52
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,117
Sorry? A nest? What was that?

53
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:22,789
Excuse me.

54
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,493
What did you just say?
Please explain it to me.

55
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,862
It is not my duty
to share the profound secret,

56
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,167
but this too is an act of providence,
so it is difficult to ignore you.

57
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,135
Are you...

58
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,739
in a position
in which you can make a donation?

59
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,443
What a bum. A total bum of all bums.

60
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,478
He looks well-off enough,

61
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:46,879
but he has less than I do.

62
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:47,814
Gosh.

63
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,249
Ouch, my knees.

64
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,152
I ran around all day today,
but made only three rounds.

65
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,122
Come on.

66
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,324
I need to work hard.

67
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,159
It's so tough to make a living.

68
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,475
I'm sorry. I meant to call, but...

69
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,750
I wasn't trying to run away
without paying you back.

70
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,820
I was a little short
and wanted to make sure I had it all.

71
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,157
I mean it.

72
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,027
Okay.

73
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,450
Wait!

74
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,584
Bro, help me out.

75
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,586
I'll return all the money
you donated earlier.

76
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,388
-The monk?
-Help! Hold on!

77
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:05,758
That hurts. Shoot.

78
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,104
Hey, conman.

79
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,173
-Yes?
-It's next Monday.

80
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,507
Don't miss your payment date.

81
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,243
Hey. Hold on.

82
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,348
Some of that is my money.
5,400 yen of that is mine.

83
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,651
If you were conned,
take it up with the conman.

84
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,386
You just took it all.

85
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,854
I just want mine back.

86
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,190
You don't seem to understand
the situation here.

87
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,491
You'll get in trouble.

88
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,859
Just let her go.

89
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,695
Is this how you lure people
and smack them from behind?

90
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,265
You guys work together, right?

91
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,269
I worked hard at a ramen place
to make that money.

92
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,472
I won't call the cops,

93
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,173
-so give me back my money.
-Hey.

94
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,543
Once it leaves your pocket,
it is no longer yours.

95
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,346
-What?
-If you don't get it, call the cops.

96
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:02,782
Hey.

97
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,757
Gosh.

98
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,398
What did I say? I told you
that you were asking for trouble.

99
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,067
Oh no.

100
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,469
It died of a broken neck.

101
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,571
This is impossible to fix.

102
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,106
You'll have to throw it out.

103
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:29,909
Oops.

104
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,005
I hear Matsuoka's boys
have been lurking around.

105
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,172
Don't worry about it.

106
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,875
They're just testing the water
to see if they can go in.

107
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,811
Mr. Jo seems concerned.

108
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,847
Should I put more people on you?

109
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,148
I prefer working alone.

110
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,486
Yesterday's numbers are fine.

111
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,726
Please give me this month's pay in cash.

112
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,833
Welcome.

113
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,943
Hey, wait.

114
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,615
What the heck are you doing?

115
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,884
You want me to take it and get lost?

116
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,793
Wow. This is awesome.

117
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,195
But sorry, this isn't my guitar.

118
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,864
-What?
-It's a different model.

119
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,268
I prefer rundown clunkers
over sleek sports cars.

120
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:04,937
So what?

121
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,379
Welcome.

122
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,839
MONEY, POWER

123
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,877
COLLUSION BETWEEN POLITICIANS
AND CORPORATIONS

124
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,781
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY

125
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,583
Did someone touch the back-up server?

126
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,785
No.

127
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:27,887
That's strange.

128
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,123
Just the time around the wedding
is missing.

129
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,759
Did the cameras not record,

130
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,227
or were they deleted?

131
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,730
It looks like they were deleted.

132
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:40,466
Who could've done that?

133
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,702
It's possible if someone hacked in.

134
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,203
Pardon?

135
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,202
I'm out of a job,
so all I have is time on my hands.

136
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,238
It might be a waste of time,
but let's go to one more place.

137
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,374
Do you think Moojin Produce
played with it?

138
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,477
They wouldn't do something
they'd get caught for.

139
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,781
There's someone helping my uncle
from the outside.

140
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,451
Someone who is smart enough

141
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,754
to think of covering their tracks here.

142
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:43,596
This way.

143
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,267
We've discussed the matter of who will be
the new financial director.

144
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,370
But it is not an easy position.

145
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,939
For me, I think

146
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,342
you are more than qualified, but...

147
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,250
Tell me.

148
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,052
Is it for the association

149
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,789
or are you just trying to become
one of Mr. Jang's people?

150
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,791
Either way, the result will be the same.

151
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:13,893
I will

152
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,195
make you bigger,

153
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,733
with more money and power.

154
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,811
My goodness. This room is filled
with people that I like.

155
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,047
Mr. Park. What are you...

156
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,618
I know I'm not welcome,
but I thought I'd chime in.

157
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,620
Oh.

158
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,722
Ms. Seo, Gallery S' CEO.

159
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,759
She is my business partner
whom I trust and depend on.

160
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,529
She has helped me
with many difficult tasks.

161
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,632
I asked Mr. Park for support

162
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,068
regarding the financial director position.

163
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,004
I apologize

164
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:00,673
if I startled you.

165
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,115
Why were you yelled at?

166
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:12,551
The homework?

167
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,053
Or did you say something stupid?

168
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,023
Don't worry about the homework.

169
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,060
I had a similar homework assignment,
but I wasn't fired for not doing it.

170
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:22,828
Don't worry.

171
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:25,998
Am I you?

172
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,733
What, punk?

173
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,047
Hello?

174
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,215
What are you doing?

175
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,284
Who is this?

176
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,253
Did you forget my voice?

177
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,754
I'm hurt.

178
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,257
Ma-ri?

179
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,859
Okay. I'll see you soon.

180
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,595
-Happy?
-Wow.

181
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,798
I thought I wasted my money
on your acting lessons

182
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,568
when you wanted to become an actress,

183
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,970
but you're pretty good.

184
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,172
Meet her a few times and scope her out?

185
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,508
What do you mean?
You have to keep acting friendly

186
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,444
until you find out about Yi-kyung
and the company.

187
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:15,748
Dad. Every time I see her,
I want to yank out her hair.

188
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,516
How can I pretend to be friends?

189
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,918
It's a year in Europe.

190
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,153
A luxury apartment and a sports car.

191
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,623
You should work that much
if you want the rewards.

192
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,659
You'd better keep your promise.

193
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,827
Just work on that girl.

194
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,364
But did that Yi-kyung woman
really get you kicked out?

195
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,366
Why did you just take it?

196
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,701
What do you mean?

197
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,608
This is because your grandfather
made the wrong choice.

198
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,344
Wait and see.

199
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,713
I'll show Yi-kyung and your grandfather

200
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,349
what Gi-tae Son is all about.

201
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,652
If you'd entrust me
with the responsibility,

202
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,721
I will do my best and do my part.

203
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,395
Chairman.

204
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,733
The financial director position

205
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,403
is difficult for someone
as young as you to handle.

206
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:16,809
Will you

207
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,345
still do it?

208
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,416
You won't regret it.

209
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,623
It's like the Oath of the Peach Garden.

210
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,228
Although we're not in a peach garden
and we don't have any wine,

211
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,597
let's still make a toast.

212
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,066
Yes, why not.

213
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,024
With this, I paid my debt, okay?

214
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,159
How's your wound?

215
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,727
That guy was an expert.

216
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,463
He stabbed me with such precision.

217
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,299
-Are we in the clear?
-We sent the assailant

218
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,635
out of the country
and deleted all the CCTV videos

219
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,103
related to that incident.

220
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,175
I won't want you as an enemy.

221
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,344
Let's continue being allies.

222
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,012
That's what I'd like to ask of you.

223
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,114
Now that you became
the financial director,

224
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,284
you'll be meeting Mr. Jang soon.

225
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,887
Please put in a good word for me too,
if you get to see him.

226
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,089
Tell him if he calls,

227
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,124
I, Moo-sam Park, will go running.

228
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,365
Oh.

229
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,200
And please, make no mistakes

230
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,070
with the special transaction.

231
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,244
If you give him one thing, he expects two.

232
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,048
He doesn't know when to stop.

233
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,349
He can't stop.

234
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,485
Tae-joon Jang.

235
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,220
Moo-il Park.

236
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,122
Moo-sam Park.

237
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,227
Their greed is the capital
for my business.

238
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:19,765
Although there are

239
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,433
the occasional exceptions.

240
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:34,713
It was

241
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:36,982
deleted here as well.

242
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,485
The video of him being stabbed
is still there--

243
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,787
I'm sure they deleted everything
except for what they need.

244
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,191
He was a foreigner.

245
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,262
He doesn't know the area,
so he probably scoped it out before.

246
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:51,563
But

247
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,799
there's no other way to check.

248
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,149
The CCTV isn't the only camera.

249
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,070
Se-jin!

250
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:40,412
Get in. There's a new brunch cafe
that opened. It's awesome.

251
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,247
I'm not in the mood to get into your car.

252
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,849
What did you need to say?

253
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,384
You want to talk on the street?

254
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,456
That brat.

255
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,394
Let's go to Europe, Ma-ri.

256
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:56,795
Europe.

257
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,702
Hey, Se-jin. Wait for me.

258
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,707
This is all because of that loser
Hong-suk.

259
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,943
Why should you and I be enemies?

260
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,813
When I got hurt last time,

261
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,848
-I was at fault too.
-So?

262
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,484
-Get to the point.
-Do you want

263
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,287
-to be friends?
-What?

264
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,691
All the kids I hang out with
are total airheads.

265
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:30,162
I always wished I had
a smart friend like you--

266
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,263
Hold on.

267
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,966
Did you say friends?
Do you think that's even possible?

268
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,000
Why not?

269
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,703
We can call each other, "Se-jin," "Ma-ri,"

270
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,239
and eat together, shop together,
and play together.

271
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,573
That'll make us friends.

272
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,508
I can't do this.

273
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,412
I know you hate me,

274
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,448
but don't hate me too much.

275
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,783
Because I like you.

276
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,324
When will you do your homework?

277
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,493
I said to refill as much as you used.

278
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,028
Did you forget?

279
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,307
I've completed my homework.

280
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,875
I refilled the amount that was there.

281
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,477
How?

282
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,279
Ma-ri said she wants to be friends.

283
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,680
She wanted to make up.

284
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,050
-Friends?
-I'm sure she isn't being sincere.

285
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,886
I'm sure her father or grandfather
is making her do it.

286
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,722
She probably wants to get close to me

287
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,724
and then find out about you.

288
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:34,693
So?

289
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,296
I'm going to pretend to fall for it
and use her instead.

290
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,899
You need information about her company.

291
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,802
I'll be able to use her.

292
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,172
Thanks to that, I was able to finish
my homework easily.

293
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,342
You know that they don't have
this brand in Korea yet right?

294
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,177
Of course. I was planning to go to Paris

295
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,312
-just for that--
-Hush.

296
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,317
-It's for a select few. Just five people.
-Five?

297
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,087
Even if I wanted to get you more,
the supplier can't get any more.

298
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,489
You can pay half for the deposit now,

299
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,025
-and the rest when you get them.
-Five people?

300
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,661
Okay. Hold on.

301
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,432
You made a dumb move.

302
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,702
I didn't scam her.

303
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,805
You said to do whatever it took
to fill the envelope.

304
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,809
I'll return it tomorrow
and say there was a problem.

305
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,378
-Why only five people?
-Sorry?

306
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,947
If you threw a bait like that,
you should've gathered 10, 20,

307
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,882
as many as you can.

308
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,488
Complacency. Thinking, "This is enough,"

309
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,156
is the most pathetic thing.

310
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,726
Anyway, good job.

311
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,095
Use this for the next assignment.

312
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,896
At least

313
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,832
double this amount.

314
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,103
Don't say stupid things like
you'll return it.

315
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,972
Whatever the reason,
once it comes into your possession,

316
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,907
the money is entirely yours.

317
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,809
What? But...

318
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,781
I can't get her those designer goods
with that money.

319
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,716
That's why you need to double it.

320
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,686
Buy time and return the original amount.

321
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,355
Then the difference will be yours to keep.

322
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:15,927
It's like a snowball.

323
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:17,896
It grows as you roll it.

324
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,832
If you leave it alone, it'll melt away.

325
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,668
That's money.

326
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:27,672
Forget double.

327
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,443
I'll grow it 10 times, no,
20 times or more.

328
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,080
I don't mind a difficult assignment.

329
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,916
Teach me like that

330
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,718
and use me. I don't care.

331
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,219
However,

332
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,423
I'm not fine with not knowing anything.

333
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,694
I'm sure I said you don't need to know
the reasons.

334
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,196
That is

335
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,199
how I've lived until now.

336
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,035
I danced in front of a restaurant
if they told me to.

337
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,572
I scanned barcodes all night
at a convenience store.

338
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,576
Because those jobs didn't need a reason.

339
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:08,947
Even when my mom and dad

340
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,285
got into a car accident
on their way to the marketplace,

341
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,856
I didn't want to know

342
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,494
why that happened.

343
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,230
However,

344
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,301
I want to know from now on.

345
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,406
I accepted your offer
in order to live differently.

346
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,373
I'm disappointed.

347
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,109
You're whining about something so old.

348
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,645
Do you want to change?

349
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:42,681
Then just do what I say.

350
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,183
You don't know enough

351
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,586
to even be disappointed.

352
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,089
Do I have to know?

353
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,325
It's like a snowball.

354
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,227
It grows as you roll it.

355
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,664
If you leave it alone, it'll melt away.

356
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,333
That's money.

357
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,282
What's up? Did you get them already?

358
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,918
No, that's not it.

359
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,186
I need to see you later.

360
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,523
Okay. I'll see you there.

361
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,479
The phone has been turned off.

362
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,748
Please leave a message after the tone.

363
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,120
-Where's Se-jin?
-She hasn't come in yet.

364
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,591
Her phone has been turned off.

365
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,126
Maybe she has the flu.

366
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:36,328
Should I go check on her?

367
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,329
Yes, that's a good idea.

368
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,430
Leave her.

369
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,465
Let's have a meeting in 10 minutes.

370
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,830
I need to know what you are thinking,

371
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,165
in order for me to help you

372
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,801
draw the big picture.

373
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,138
I want to know from now on.

374
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:25,043
I accepted your offer
in order to live differently.

375
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:54,906
Just a minute.

376
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,978
I almost missed you.

377
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,814
Don't you remember me?

378
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,418
Moojin Global Center.

379
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,454
Yes, that's right.

380
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,122
Are you okay now?

381
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,557
Yes.

382
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,659
But what brings you here?

383
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,595
-How did you know who I was?
-Well, I...

384
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,067
I just happened to find out.

385
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,268
Oh.

386
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,037
I wanted to return this.

387
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,606
I picked it up in front
of the wedding hall.

388
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,843
You came just for this?

389
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,012
Whether it's money or an object,

390
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,247
it should return to its rightful owner.

391
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,216
That makes me feel better.

392
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:41,986
Okay, then.

393
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:43,988
Excuse me.

394
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,128
I don't know your name yet.

395
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:51,596
No, it's okay.

396
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,168
I'm Yi-kyung Seo

397
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,938
from Gallery S.

398
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,977
Why are you so surprised?

399
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:07,846
You have

400
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,348
the same name as someone I used to know.

401
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:11,516
Oh.

402
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,486
What an interesting coincidence.

403
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:16,621
Who was...

404
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:17,822
Mr. Park.

405
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,191
We heard from the owner of the car
with the dashcam.

406
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,459
Will he work with us?

407
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,028
He's in Shanghai on business
and is at the airport.

408
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:25,330
He's about to board.

409
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,500
I'm sorry. Thank you.

410
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:42,781
Hi, Auntie.

411
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,383
Who?

412
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,955
What took you so long?
I told you to take a cab.

413
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,426
-Ma'am?
-Hello.

414
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,836
My gosh. I had no idea you were working
under someone so amazing

415
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,538
and questioned if you were
working at a bar...

416
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,241
Oh my. There I go again.

417
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:11,810
It's fine.

418
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,546
What brings you here?

419
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,449
She gave this to me to pay for our rent.

420
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,353
I don't know if it's okay for me
to accept this.

421
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,689
Se-jin is an irreplaceable employee
that I need.

422
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,493
It's an investment for the sake
of the company, so please take it.

423
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,721
You have a knack for toying with a person.

424
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,524
You even make up with money.

425
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,260
It's so you.

426
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,662
I'm not making up with you.

427
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,700
I told you, it's an investment.

428
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,270
I wanted to see where my employee lives

429
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,505
and meet the family myself.

430
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:17,609
I'll believe you.

431
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:19,644
It's cold.

432
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:23,815
Just now...

433
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,689
I went to Moojin Group.

434
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,226
I went to give Gun-woo Park his cufflink.

435
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:40,331
I was going to return Ma-ri her money
and say screw the homework,

436
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:41,599
but I couldn't.

437
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:49,340
I used your name to introduce myself.

438
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,979
I thought maybe you and he
used to know each other,

439
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,447
so it just came out.

440
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,953
You said you were me?

441
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:03,922
He was surprised.

442
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,626
He said he knew someone by the same name.

443
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,597
And?

444
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,465
I couldn't get anything more.

445
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,301
He was busy.

446
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:19,604
That's right.

447
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,641
He said something about a dashcam
and rushed off.

448
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,923
It isn't here.
Do you know who owns the car?

449
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,491
I found it in the list of residents.

450
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,261
Joo-won Noh, the CEO of Haesung Bio.
The office is located at...

451
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,730
Okay. I'll head to the office now.

452
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,737
Tak is going to the office.
We confirmed the license plate number.

453
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,607
Sorry for troubling you
in your busy schedule.

454
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,476
It's okay. I can do that much.

455
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,477
Thank you.

456
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,825
Shit.

457
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,707
-Sir.
-Yes?

458
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:06,711
What happened?

459
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,947
It was fine when I got back
from the airport minutes ago.

460
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,444
They would've found him immediately
if they tracked the license plate.

461
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,280
I was careless.
I didn't think of the dashcam--

462
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:45,216
These are important times.
Be more careful.

463
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,351
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,980
Ms. Kim said to have some herb tea.
It'll calm you down.

465
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:18,850
Should I leave it here?

466
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:22,954
Gun-woo Park

467
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,356
made me come this far.

468
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,097
A very long time ago,

469
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,434
he was the first to ask me

470
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,204
what it is that I truly want.

471
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,161
GAKU

472
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,038
Hey.

473
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,277
Are you busy?

474
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,379
Have some ramen. My treat.

475
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,415
-It's okay.
-Come on. I want to talk...

476
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,517
to you.

477
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,220
Don't flip me.

478
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,299
Sang-chul and I formed a band.

479
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,901
We have all the members already.

480
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,003
He even quit gambling.

481
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,405
He's excited about doing music again.

482
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,140
Don't be fooled.

483
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,509
He's a gambler and a conman.
He won't change.

484
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,511
That's because you don't know music.

485
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,481
Music is more addicting than gambling.

486
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,752
It's a cover, but we even recorded a demo.

487
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,856
I'm going to start
writing my own music, too.

488
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,593
It's a gift.

489
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,796
Will you come watch us practice sometime?

490
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,700
People don't change.

491
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,270
Seeing how he hasn't come to us,

492
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,105
he probably borrowed money elsewhere.

493
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:57,742
Do you have any hobbies?

494
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,577
You don't even have friends, do you?

495
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,047
Hey, hey.

496
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:07,084
Listen to some music
and make some friends.

497
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,488
People smell much sweeter than money.

498
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,358
Want me to be your friend?

499
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,361
I don't need it.

500
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,979
Here are the financial metrics
for Miyama Machinery.

501
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:35,913
Okay.

502
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,584
Miyama Machinery's debt isn't due yet.

503
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,453
Go to Kyusen Bank later.

504
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:44,889
The bank's VP will give you
some documents.

505
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,457
Just bring them to me.

506
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,794
Are you attacking before it falls?

507
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,664
The company can revive itself.

508
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,099
The smell of blood has already spread.

509
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,703
A sick water buffalo
will be nothing but prey.

510
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,342
I guess you'll eat the tastiest parts
before anyone else.

511
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:09,613
Should I bring some fresh tea?

512
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,716
There's a gift box
that hasn't been opened yet.

513
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:14,952
I'll be back soon.

514
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,534
Stop fooling around.
This is an important part.

515
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,602
Hey. There.

516
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,643
-Hey.
-Are you insane?

517
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:40,678
What?

518
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,913
Her father's this and this are scary.

519
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,215
Stay away, or you'll see blood.

520
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,449
Go home and clean.

521
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,685
Don't gamble on the way.

522
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:48,686
Hey!

523
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:48,679
People who work nights like we do
need to photosynthesize like this.

524
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,016
Isn't the sun better than the moon?

525
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,524
I hear your father is really scary.

526
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:11,569
I guess if he has the guts to send
his daughter to collect money at night,

527
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,504
he can't be your average Joe.

528
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,808
Don't you ever want to escape?

529
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,349
My dad stinks of money, too.

530
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:27,251
That's why I ran away.

531
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,021
I wanted to live where no one knows me

532
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,290
and play the guitar all I want.

533
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,627
I'm not interested in listening
to other people's problems.

534
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,595
I'm asking.

535
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,936
What is it that you really want to do?

536
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,439
Who are you? That's what I want to know.

537
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,882
Yi-kyung Seo, loan officer
at Ilhan Finance.

538
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,317
I lend money and collect with interest.

539
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,119
That's what I do.

540
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,488
Why? Do you need money?

541
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:06,357
Forget money.

542
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,262
Lend me something else.

543
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,497
What?

544
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:14,965
What is it?

545
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,035
Lend me time you have left over
now and then,

546
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,271
to photosynthesize like this.

547
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:23,874
Oh. Collateral.

548
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,745
Gun-woo Park's jukebox.

549
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,213
What do you want to hear?

550
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,117
Forget it. I've heard you play.

551
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,653
Hey, that's very hurtful to a musician...

552
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:38,856
Yi-kyung.

553
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,329
How could you say that...

554
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,545
You should think about
what people will think.

555
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,746
Someone awaiting assignment

556
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:05,449
shouldn't be going in and out
of the chairman's office.

557
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,084
You should be careful too.

558
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:11,889
If someone who was attacked
by a stranger is too well too soon,

559
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,357
people will get suspicious.

560
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,725
Don't resent me.

561
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:18,562
Your father is the one
who signed the reassignment order.

562
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,331
I don't resent you. I envy you.

563
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,702
The gang outside of the company
who is helping you

564
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,437
is pretty skillful.

565
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,509
Once your father's trial is over,

566
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,745
you should go to Europe or somewhere
to clear your head.

567
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,780
I'll think of an excuse
for a business trip.

568
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,749
Where would a bad son go?

569
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,818
I should visit my father in prison.

570
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:43,687
Do as you wish.

571
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,297
I should redecorate this place.

572
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,035
Yes.

573
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,549
I haven't destroyed it yet.

574
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,553
The document Baeksong Foundation gave us.

575
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,393
I'll have to drink

576
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:24,728
the poison.

577
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,135
KOREA-JAPAN CO-OP NIGHT
1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS

578
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,336
EU-SUNG SON

579
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,075
Hello, Chairman.

580
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,679
We're going to meet with Mr. Jang
at 2 p.m. tomorrow.

581
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,382
It's a very important and rare
opportunity, so don't be late.

582
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,918
I'll see you tomorrow.

583
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,626
KOREA-JAPAN CO-OP NIGHT
1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS

584
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,981
I don't understand.

585
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:22,419
You kicked out Gun-woo Park
after your past together?

586
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,123
Merely to make the person
who's working with you

587
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:28,692
a chairman of the group?

588
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:30,828
"Merely"?

589
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,530
That word doesn't belong there.

590
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,500
My goals and plans

591
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,670
are much more important
than those mere memories.

592
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,139
-But--
-I'm making a choice

593
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,776
to throw away something
in order to gain something else.

594
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,147
Only children or immature adults

595
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:51,949
believe you can have it all.

596
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,152
One of these days,

597
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,755
you'll have to choose as well.

598
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:00,057
That thing you wish to gain

599
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,027
won't end with Moojin Group, will it?

600
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,730
I've only reached the first door.

601
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,335
I'll reclaim what was taken from my father

602
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,938
from the people who took it.

603
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,279
I was worried for nothing.

604
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,283
-About what?
-I'm talking about you.

605
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,752
You act out, then don't show up to work.

606
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,388
I was afraid you'd be fired,
but you got promoted instead.

607
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,824
What is Ms. Seo thinking?

608
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,058
You call this a promotion?

609
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,328
What? Do you know
how important this job is?

610
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,631
Look at that attitude.

611
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,369
How much do you think this is worth?

612
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:49,406
It must be pretty valuable,
to sell it abroad.

613
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,409
Maybe five million won? Ten million won?

614
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:55,979
What?

615
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,415
What? Is it several tens of thousands?

616
00:46:58,982 --> 00:46:59,817
Wrong.

617
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:01,785
This is worth 700 million won.

618
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:03,987
This one is 950 million won.

619
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:07,224
Why do you think they purchased
these expensive artworks?

620
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,227
The buyers

621
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:14,131
are paper companies set up
by Moojin Produce.

622
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,135
New York, London, and Hong Kong.

623
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:20,304
If you add them up,

624
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,306
the total transaction amount is huge.

625
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:24,174
The purchase is an excuse.

626
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,277
The artworks
these paper companies purchased

627
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:31,515
are probably worth much less
than the purchase price.

628
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:33,016
Pardon?

629
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,122
They purchase cheap paintings for billions

630
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,125
Then they'll have to pay large sums
to the Korean art dealer.

631
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,063
That is how they brought in money
from abroad,

632
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,031
packaged as art purchases.

633
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,738
I'm sure she laundered the money for him.

634
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:56,773
Gallery S.

635
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,242
Yi-kyung Seo.

636
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,411
I'm Yi-kyung Seo from Gallery S.

637
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,924
Do you think she came to you
to size you up?

638
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,426
Who knows?

639
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,696
I must have bad luck with that name.

640
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,333
It's getting complicated
with this woman, too.

641
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,602
The purchased goods

642
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,371
are coming in today.

643
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,006
That's good.

644
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,142
I'm itching to get out.

645
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,778
How about a knife dance?

646
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,916
But you're still awaiting assignment,
so you don't have authority--

647
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,550
Mine aren't the only knives.

648
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,420
Call Director Jung of the Auditing Team.

649
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,424
I'll tell him where to stick the knife.

650
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:57,894
What is this about?

651
00:49:58,061 --> 00:49:59,763
We're from Moojin Group's Auditing Team.

652
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,467
The artwork that the foreign branch
of Moojin Produce purchased

653
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:05,669
is in there, isn't it?

654
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,038
We need to check the transaction details.

655
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,574
Please open the container.

656
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:11,742
I can't do that.

657
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,911
A subsidiary of the group
purchased the item.

658
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:18,281
The Auditing Team has the authority
to check the details of such transactions.

659
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,284
That's your situation.

660
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,887
There are other items in there.

661
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:26,423
Even businesses have a right of privacy.

662
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,759
They brought a whole bunch of people.

663
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,661
I think they're asking him
to open the container.

664
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:32,963
Listen to me.

665
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:35,465
Don't open the container, no matter what.

666
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,535
We can't let them see or take
the special transaction item.

667
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,837
It must never have been there
to begin with.

668
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,406
What should we do?

669
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:44,207
Tak is trying to stop them--

670
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:45,409
You buy us some time.

671
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:47,944
They think you're the gallery's CEO.

672
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,180
-Sorry?
-Pretend to make a deal

673
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,581
and lead them elsewhere.

674
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,419
Se-jin.

675
00:50:57,654 --> 00:50:58,588
I'll try.

676
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,792
Turn the car around.

677
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,995
-But Mr. Jang--
-Now.

678
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:11,835
Call your CEO.

679
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:16,807
Tell her everything you did to cover up
for Moojin Produce for the past year

680
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,442
is about to be exposed.

681
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:23,013
Just know we'll be easier to deal with
than the prosecutor.

682
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,315
There must be a misunderstanding.

683
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:33,590
You don't look like
you're here to thank me.

684
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,126
Don't say anything.

685
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,497
I'd like to hear
your company's position as well.

686
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:44,534
Let's not do this here.
Why don't we go inside?

687
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,770
Shall we?

688
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:00,650
Shit.

689
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,222
Yes, ma'am.

690
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,225
They just went into the office.

691
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,927
Pardon?

692
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:12,863
All of it?

693
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,331
What do you mean, Yi-kyung?

694
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,066
This is very important.

695
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,869
Hello? Yi-kyung?

696
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,205
What is it?

697
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,244
Well...

698
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:31,481
The director I wanted to introduce
had a sudden emergency.

699
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,086
I'll apologize to Mr. Jang in person.

700
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,522
There's no need. You should leave.

701
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,392
The purpose was to meet
the new financial director.

702
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,628
She isn't even here.

703
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:47,230
We can't waste Mr. Jang's time.

704
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,744
To borrow the term kids use these days,

705
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,847
is she playing hard-to-get?

706
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:07,083
I think there is an emergency.

707
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,623
Discreetly find out what it is.

708
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:18,828
She killed herself for a year to get here.

709
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,264
If she suddenly can't make it,

710
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,434
she must have a good reason.

711
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:25,802
Yes, sir.

712
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,140
That's the way the world works.

713
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,543
Look at what's happening.

714
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:38,215
Whereas one friend's son pushed me away
when I offered to help him,

715
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,017
another friend's daughter

716
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,221
voluntarily offers to become my helper.

717
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:55,398
What is she up to?

718
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,569
I was curious for a year.

719
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,573
I'll have to wait a few more days.

720
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,945
Money laundering using artwork?

721
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,781
I've never heard that before.

722
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,917
And such large sums, too.

723
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,019
I had no idea.

724
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,320
You're a good actress.

725
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:20,156
You should close the gallery
and go into acting.

726
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:23,660
You fell in front of the wedding hall
and came to my office,

727
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:25,795
all for show.

728
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:30,500
I'm really curious as to
what you're really after.

729
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,205
Mr. Park!

730
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,657
You rat.

731
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:56,426
-Shit.
-Tak!

732
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,429
-Please calm down.
-Did you do this?

733
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,570
Long-time no see, Gun-woo.

734
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:55,518
Please

735
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,587
let Gun-woo go.

736
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:00,890
Yi-kyung, you...

737
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,325
What a shame.

738
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:05,228
This isn't how I wanted to meet again.

739
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,734
Promise that if I settle the loan

740
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:13,169
with my money,

741
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:16,439
you'll let Gun-woo go.

742
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,642
Then I'll start over
as the heir of Ilhan Finance.

743
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,211
This

744
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,182
is the final offer I can make.

745
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,019
Will you accept it?

746
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:04,053
I figured we'd meet again someday,
somehow.

747
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:05,622
But not like this.

748
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,490
As promised, I became a villain,

749
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:09,125
and you haven't changed at all.

750
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,361
Everything you do from now on
will be in my place.

751
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:13,129
Stop impersonating me with just my name.

752
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,131
Fight as the real Se-jin Lee.

753
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,867
Whatever it is you planned,
it won't go your way.

754
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,537
Go back before it gets harder, Yi-kyung.

755
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,972
We'll take a shortcut from now on.

756
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,975
Please let me continue
to pretend to be nice.

757
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:27,811
You can't win this fight.

758
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,612
A monster can't lose

759
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,548
to a human.

760
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,354
