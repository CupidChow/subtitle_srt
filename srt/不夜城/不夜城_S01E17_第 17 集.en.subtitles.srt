1
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,210
I'm probably an eyesore to Chairman Son.

2
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:49,115
But why would Mr. Nam have met him
secretly like this?

3
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,385
Give it up.

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,755
You can't win.

5
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,390
What about the file?

6
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,625
I planted it.

7
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,960
There must be a misunderstanding.

8
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,464
They say I stole Korea Works' technology.

9
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,332
-Se-jin.
-Because I like Ms. Seo,

10
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,334
I want to be loyal, like you.

11
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,305
But if I keep at it,
I'm the one who will be destroyed.

12
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,976
That was too harsh and painful.
That's why I left her.

13
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:21,047
You may have done that,
but I have no regrets.

14
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,721
Suspicion. Guilt. Resentment.

15
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,625
Those are worms that eat away at the soul.

16
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:37,263
It's probably eating away at Se-jin
right now.

17
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,336
EPISODE 17

18
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,474
EDUCATION, WORK EXPERIENCE,
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

19
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,814
You filtered them out a lot.

20
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,952
Will your people disappear
into thin air like this?

21
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,555
You should pour new wine
into new wineskins.

22
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,125
Don't you agree?

23
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:06,726
Mr. Jo.

24
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,630
This is the list of people
who will join the new party.

25
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:16,269
They're free from corruptions or scandals,
so they'll bring up your image.

26
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:24,210
Once I join the new party,
I'll be the top candidate in no time.

27
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:28,748
In politics, it's half the person
and half funding.

28
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,351
The non-profit bank hasn't been
established yet.

29
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:36,389
And I believe the foundation hasn't met
its goal amount yet, either.

30
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,725
I'll do the worrying and I'll resolve it.

31
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,295
You just have to stand behind him
and smile.

32
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,632
That look you have now will not do.

33
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,041
Ms. Seo.

34
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,746
Once we create the new party,
you should get a business card.

35
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,816
A position that is serious,
but not too obvious.

36
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,318
I don't know.

37
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,954
I'm not very interested in titles.

38
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,259
What do you have on him?

39
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:19,532
Seeing how you can order him around
like that, it must be quite fatal.

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,635
-Mr. Kang.
-I'll keep the secret. Tell me.

41
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,071
Your approval rating...

42
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,141
Half of it is thanks to his support.

43
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:32,412
Don't forget that your fates
are tied together.

44
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,083
I just feel sorry for him, that's all.

45
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,853
He looks dejected ever since
you kicked out Jong-gyu Nam.

46
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,490
Why don't you call him back in?

47
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,826
He wouldn't come, anyway.

48
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,429
I'm sure he's busy.

49
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:57,737
I know you were someone Ms. Seo cherished,
but I'm a bit taken aback.

50
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,773
She knows a great deal about Gallery S.

51
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,043
She saved me from the hospital, too.

52
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,980
Why did you and Ms. Seo split ways?

53
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,048
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

54
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,352
Please explain so that I can understand.

55
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,989
If we are to do important work together,
we need trust.

56
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,626
You must not trust me.

57
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,895
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

58
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:25,832
Hey.

59
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:33,606
I don't know what you'll plan or how,
but I'll tell you one thing.

60
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,544
You should look around
when meeting outside,

61
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,348
since Ms. Seo is keeping an eye
on both of you.

62
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,418
Are you saying she is having us watched?

63
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,453
You are safe today.

64
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,423
I checked on my way in. Excuse me, then.

65
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,524
Hold on.

66
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,828
Let's talk slowly over tea.

67
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,899
I'll get sick if I drink tea with someone
who doesn't trust me.

68
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,810
Your company's legal team
is incredibly influential.

69
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,581
When I retire, I may consider
joining Moojin's legal team.

70
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,317
You are always welcome.

71
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,923
But is it proper to waste tax money on
an absurd investigation such as this one?

72
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:00,593
So why did you steal
someone else's technology?

73
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,296
If I repeat myself again, it'll be
the 100th time, so I won't bother.

74
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,537
You won't be able to indict me anyway.

75
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,909
Why don't you place your bet
on a more realistic investigation?

76
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,178
What do you mean?

77
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:23,082
The top presidential candidate
whom a past president is backing,

78
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,986
and the puppet master controlling them.

79
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,889
Doesn't that sound intriguing?

80
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,991
For me, it's survival.

81
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,427
For you, it's your career.

82
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,797
This is a pretty fair deal.

83
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,267
Puppet master?

84
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:43,770
Who is that?

85
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,975
I said to rest. Why are you back already?

86
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,345
Time off is enjoyable
only if you know how to enjoy it.

87
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,046
I'm built to overwork.

88
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,349
I had nothing to do
during my time off, either.

89
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,120
What is it?

90
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:04,657
Are you afraid
that Se-jin may cause trouble?

91
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,594
No. That's not why I returned so soon.

92
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,263
Really?

93
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,533
I'm afraid.

94
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,103
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

95
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,106
Make up some excuse to Ms. Kim and Mr. Jo,

96
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,176
since they don't know the real reason
you were fired.

97
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,744
Understood.

98
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,528
How did it go? Can you come back to work?

99
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:43,963
She didn't say anything else?

100
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,399
Yes.

101
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,401
That's great.

102
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,570
I'll get my things.

103
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,072
-Okay. Need help?
-I can do it by myself.

104
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,813
What's wrong?

105
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,952
I think the person
who planted the documents

106
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:10,256
from Korea Works
into Gun-woo's computer was Tak.

107
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,492
Let's play dumb.

108
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,595
They must have kept it from us
because security was critical.

109
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,066
She wasn't after Gun-woo.

110
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,537
She wanted Se-jin to be isolated,

111
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,640
so that she can't get anyone's help,
not from Gun-woo or anyone.

112
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,982
Did you want to make me a monster

113
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,084
like you?

114
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,655
Did you believe you could change me?

115
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,757
Definitely.

116
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,661
You will become me someday.

117
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,302
I thought you'd be happy. Are you not?

118
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:00,706
I'm happy.

119
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,343
I just realized, you see,

120
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,581
that anything you do,

121
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,617
I can do.

122
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,856
I'll see you in hell.

123
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:28,200
Mr. Nam is very strict and distrusting.

124
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,637
Please understand if he offended you.

125
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:32,805
It's fine.

126
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:37,543
His cautious nature is probably the secret
to working for Mr. Jang for so long.

127
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,548
Why did you want to meet separately?

128
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,685
Did you say it's something
Mr. Nam shouldn't know about?

129
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:46,919
Right.

130
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,525
Because it will harm not just Ms. Seo,
but also Mr. Jang.

131
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,728
I'm sure Mr. Nam would oppose.

132
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,532
You said your son said
he'd split up the company, correct?

133
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,669
I'm sure Yi-kyung is manipulating him
from behind.

134
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,640
If you want to end it swiftly,
you need a weapon as well.

135
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,276
A weapon?

136
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,679
You know more
about TJ Foundation than anyone.

137
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,982
Obtain its weakness.

138
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,488
There is nothing wrong with it on paper.

139
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,726
There are double, triple layers
of protection in the accounts.

140
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,695
If the message won't work,
attack the messenger.

141
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,200
You should go after the person.

142
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,960
The finance team and the legal team
went over it numerous times,

143
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:05,197
and it'll be difficult to split in half.

144
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,335
Of course.

145
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,773
Chairman Son is the one
who built Chunha to what it is.

146
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,675
Then what do I do?

147
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,011
Even if I participate
in the non-profit bank with my shares,

148
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,446
it won't have any effect.

149
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,115
Still, keep showing him that you intend
to split up the company.

150
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,421
Chairman Son will be the one
making the mistake.

151
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,391
That would be great.

152
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,361
No parent can defeat their child.

153
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,974
I heard you were fired.
When did you come back?

154
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,312
That punk.

155
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,380
Get home safely.

156
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,582
Let's talk.

157
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:57,917
What?

158
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,385
Ms. Kim.

159
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,623
Did you work with Se-jin
after you left here?

160
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,628
Are you the one who entrapped Gun-woo?

161
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,297
That's a violation of Rule Three.

162
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,567
Do not question or be curious
about an order from Ms. Seo.

163
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,235
How could you...

164
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,144
Chairman Son?

165
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,147
Yes. She stopped by Chunha
and then went home.

166
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,049
Jong-gyu Nam must've gone too.

167
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,484
I saw only Se-jin.

168
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,656
Mr. Jo and Ms. Kim figured it out.

169
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,658
They were hurt.

170
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,862
Jong-gyu Nam was not included.

171
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:44,964
Ma'am?

172
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,967
Forget Chairman Son. Mark Se-jin.

173
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,203
She'll try to do it on her own
since Gun-woo is out of the picture,

174
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,739
and she'll try to meet people
left and right.

175
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,376
What about Mr. Jo and Ms. Kim?

176
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,011
What?

177
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,581
They seem to have figured out what I did
while I was away.

178
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,818
Tell Ms. Kim to send up
the Korea Works documents.

179
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,072
Hello, sir.

180
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:29,809
Tomorrow?

181
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,944
Okay.

182
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,314
No. I'll find my way.

183
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,249
Okay.

184
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,696
CHAIRMAN MAN-HO SONG OF KOREA INVESTMENTS

185
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:57,736
I get to have you drive me around after
being investigated by the government.

186
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,672
What a luxurious life.

187
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,775
You must be tired. You should rest.

188
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,643
I will drive you home.

189
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,278
I need to stop by somewhere first.

190
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,682
Has Se-jin been coming to the office?

191
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,717
She's been busy lately.

192
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:14,954
With what?

193
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,890
I don't know. I never asked.

194
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,366
I don't have anything to say
about the contribution to the foundation.

195
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,104
I heard Mr. Gi-tae Son had you confined
and assaulted.

196
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,741
Chairman Son is upset about it too.

197
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,446
We plan to uncover the illegal activities

198
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,382
TJ Foundation performed
in gathering contributions.

199
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:49,622
Everyone contributed voluntarily,
I believe, including our company.

200
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,157
-Sir--
-Tell Chairman Son.

201
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,627
If he starts uncovering this and that

202
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,198
because he lost to his son,
he may lose big.

203
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,703
You know Yi-kyung is backing up
Gi-tae Son.

204
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:10,476
Chairman Son took the courage
to stop being controlled by someone else.

205
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,177
Look here, young lady.

206
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:17,449
If the one in charge controls you,
you need to follow quietly.

207
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,920
That is how you survive in this world.

208
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,624
You checked the company name,
so you know whom I came to see.

209
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,960
You want to know what we discussed?

210
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,962
Don't push it. I'm working right now.

211
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,300
I asked about the illegal activities
while collecting contributions.

212
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,171
He insists there weren't any.

213
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,707
I really wasted my time.

214
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,944
Ms. Seo will laugh when she hears.

215
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,914
Chairman Son won't last long, either.

216
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,952
You're smart.

217
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,355
Don't you see what's going on?

218
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,324
Ms. Seo has Mr. Jang and
Jae-hyun Kang in the palm of her hand.

219
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,828
Moojin became her stomping grounds again.

220
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,398
Even if Gun-woo is released
after questioning,

221
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,900
there's nothing you can do.

222
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,669
Thanks.

223
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,573
-I feel energized, thanks to you.
-Se-jin.

224
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,174
Don't bother waiting next time.

225
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,711
I'll call you in advance and let you know

226
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,814
whom I'm meeting
and what we're discussing.

227
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,662
Why are you doing this
about something from the past?

228
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,931
I'm not trying to blame you.

229
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,434
I'm trying to uncover the wrong
that Yi-kyung committed.

230
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,671
You must've lost your intelligence
while you were in the hospital.

231
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,706
Chairman Park.

232
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:26,478
If doing business is difficult,
why don't you retire?

233
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,516
Ms. Seo has something
she'd like to say to you.

234
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,320
I won't talk to someone who's
trying to break up my company.

235
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,324
If you care about the company,
you should do anything to save it.

236
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,294
Participate in the non-profit bank
with your son.

237
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,432
Chunha Financing will change its name,
but nothing else will change.

238
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,202
I'd have to take your order
regarding every little thing.

239
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,505
Like someone who is a chairman
by name only.

240
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,774
Let me make one thing clear.

241
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:59,645
I'm not working with Gi-tae Son
because I like him.

242
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:05,250
If you do not join,
your son holds no value to me.

243
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,422
I should reconcile debts
that are not profitable.

244
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,025
Even if he wants to remain
the company president,

245
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,194
if he can't refill what he took,
he should step down.

246
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,936
Here. Count it.

247
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,877
That bank check.

248
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,647
When you paid it back for him...

249
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,617
It's not a charitable work.
Why would I pay his debt for him?

250
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,587
I lent it to him.

251
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:47,593
Stop straying off the path
and follow the one I've prepared.

252
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,364
Chairman Park is much more at peace too,
now that he cleared his mind.

253
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,101
Don't choose a difficult path
instead of the easy one.

254
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,861
He resisted out of pride earlier,
but I think he's almost there.

255
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,231
No parent can be rational
when it comes to their child.

256
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,367
The same goes for my brother.

257
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,705
He suspects you for framing Gun-woo.

258
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,141
So?

259
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,611
He's a bit old for a prison break.

260
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:44,082
You may think you're all set,
with Chairman Son turning to your side,

261
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,420
but you must be extra careful
at times like these.

262
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,556
What a precious word of advice.

263
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,892
I should return the favor.

264
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,195
I'm slightly afraid.

265
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,898
You should recover your reputation
that was harmed

266
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,534
because of the sale of Moojin Tech.

267
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:09,841
Moojin will acquire
Jae-hyun Kang's Korea Works.

268
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,880
We will not sell.

269
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,916
I built that company
sharing cup noodles with friends,

270
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,521
hugging CPUs for heat in the winter
instead of heaters and taking short naps.

271
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,091
Korea Works is my youth and a part of me.

272
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:30,295
You'll have to resign from your position
in order to run for president.

273
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,532
I'll have someone succeed me as CEO.

274
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,602
No one could run the company
quite like you, though.

275
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,671
Still, I can't just sell it.

276
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,306
I can't do that.

277
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:48,013
What will happen if Yi-kyung tries
to sell it?

278
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,216
Why would she?

279
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:55,053
She'll give you hundreds of excuses,
but there is only one reason.

280
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,490
How profitable it will be.

281
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,060
Once she has that assurance,
she'll push hard to make it happen.

282
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:09,468
Whatever calculation she does,
it's my company. I make the decisions.

283
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,871
There will be no sale.
I'll have someone succeed me.

284
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,208
I hope you hold true to that conviction.

285
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,914
I apologize for misunderstanding you,
even if it was briefly.

286
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,518
I really suspected you of stealing
our technology.

287
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,656
I am glad the investigation showed
you were innocent.

288
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,994
I have an idea who set the trap.

289
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,964
It was Yi-kyung, wasn't it?

290
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,532
She's after me.

291
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:44,436
She has every other card,
but I'm still hidden.

292
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,708
I showed her only a part of mine, too.

293
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,979
I think we'll have a lot
to help each other with from now on.

294
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:58,750
You seem to know Yi-kyung very well.

295
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,086
What is she after?

296
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,324
She doesn't care for fame,
and she doesn't seem to be chasing money.

297
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,295
I just can't figure out her intentions.

298
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,965
I can't give you that answer, either.

299
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:21,273
No one has ever reached the summit
that she is trying to reach.

300
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,247
Let's check the draft on the sale
of Korea Works as soon as it's in.

301
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,649
I'll get it prepared.

302
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,851
Mr. Jo, please come in as well.

303
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,820
I'm on my way.

304
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,088
Tak, where are you?

305
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,023
I'm by the Special Planning Team's
external office.

306
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:40,892
Should I come back?

307
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,328
No. Keep watching.

308
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,079
When did you get out?

309
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:02,547
Earlier.

310
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,684
You should've called. I was worried.

311
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,321
If the investigation is over,
you've been cleared of all wrong, right?

312
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,124
That's great.

313
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,261
Ms. Moon told me you've been busy.

314
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,064
It was nothing big.

315
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,566
I was looking into the foundation.

316
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:24,669
Have a seat.

317
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,546
I thought about it
while I was being investigated,

318
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,350
and we can't take on Yi-kyung like this.

319
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:40,652
What do you mean?

320
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:44,723
We threw a counter punch,
but it was just a jab to her.

321
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,058
If she attacks back,

322
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,494
we'll easily end up
being investigated again.

323
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,463
Chairman Son said he'd help.

324
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,831
Don't rely on others.

325
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,702
If we contact them,
Yi-kyung will get to them right away.

326
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,605
So?

327
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,677
She's flying high right now.

328
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,079
There's nothing she can't do.

329
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:15,420
Until we find that one crucial blow,
you and I should save our energy.

330
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:20,158
So you're saying
we shouldn't do anything for now?

331
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:25,897
I mean, let's prepare quietly underwater,
so she doesn't see us.

332
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,202
Ms. Seo got so far ahead of us.

333
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,572
If we hesitate,
there may be no last chance.

334
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,640
It's better than rushing and ruining it.

335
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,414
Se-jin?

336
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,550
I understand.

337
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,222
Anyway, it's good seeing you again.

338
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,024
Me too.

339
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:19,518
CONTACTS

340
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,359
MS. SEO

341
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:53,218
Cafe tea is nice too.
I should have it more often.

342
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,086
I'm sorry.

343
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,057
I was out of line for barging in
out of the blue like that.

344
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,193
It's okay. I understand how you felt.

345
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,463
We found out only later about Tak.

346
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,532
You must've been very upset.

347
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,672
I've worked for Ms. Seo
for over 20 years since Japan,

348
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,208
but there is only one thing
I was able to learn about her.

349
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,247
That she's very lonely.

350
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:27,385
That's why Mr. Jo and I came to Korea.

351
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:33,224
If she knew the reason,
she would've told us not to come.

352
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,027
I can imagine.

353
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,063
Se-jin.

354
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,497
Yes?

355
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,667
Don't try so hard to stop Ms. Seo.

356
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,035
It's useless.

357
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,506
She's been planning it for a while

358
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,775
and she came to Korea
with only that determination.

359
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,546
She didn't get a single penny
from her father.

360
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,648
She even cut ties with him.

361
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:01,386
She even left all of her inheritance
in Japan, too.

362
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,321
Because for Ms. Seo,

363
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:09,828
if she can't build it on her own,
the kingdom would be meaningless.

364
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,332
That's right. That's how she is.

365
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,372
So you can't stop her
from going down that path.

366
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,578
I'm saying this out of concern for you.

367
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,614
I know. And I thank you.

368
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,517
I wanted to talk to someone.

369
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,986
Thank you for calling.

370
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,522
But Ms. Kim,

371
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,925
I need to keep going.

372
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,594
Se-jin.

373
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:43,995
Even if it's hard,

374
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,264
even if I'm alone,

375
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,467
I'll keep going.

376
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,372
Because Ms. Seo is waiting.

377
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,459
KOREA WORKS EARNINGS

378
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,627
KOREA WORKS BALANCE SHEET

379
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,212
Oh my. You've done a lot of research.

380
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:12,450
If you had just asked me,
you wouldn't have wasted your energy.

381
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,921
I'm not interested in selling the company.

382
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:21,292
You should dispose of it
before registering as a candidate.

383
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,929
All I have to do is step down
from my CEO position.

384
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,632
My successor will take good care of it.

385
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,001
Whom did you decide on?

386
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,604
It is a company secret.

387
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,239
Mr. Kang.

388
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,474
I may take your coaching
on everything else,

389
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,910
but the company is under my control.

390
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,880
My blood and sweat in my twenties
were poured into...

391
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,518
I admit your skill.

392
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,555
But you can't deny the fact
that you were lucky, too.

393
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,025
I'd be a bit hurt if you say...

394
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,394
it was luck.

395
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,797
You succeeded by riding
the venture capital wave.

396
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,098
And then,

397
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,535
you bought up all the small companies
who used their technology as collateral.

398
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,806
Once you got bigger,
you made money selling stock.

399
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:13,011
The innocent Jae-hyun Kang in his twenties
is not here.

400
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:17,048
The only person here is the second
favorite candidate Jae-hyun Kang,

401
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,450
who is true to his ambitions.

402
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:26,357
I don't work with people
who are not greedy.

403
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:32,330
I will not sell Korea Works.

404
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,567
You will.

405
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,483
Find out whom he chose
to be his successor.

406
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,521
It looks like he won't be
selling the company.

407
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,859
He'll change his mind
if something happens to his successor,

408
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,329
since the election isn't that far away.

409
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,283
It's Jae-hyun Kang.

410
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,518
We need to meet.

411
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,890
Sure, let me know what time works for you.

412
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,127
Okay.

413
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,402
-Are the Korea Works documents ready?
-Yes.

414
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,938
Should I call Se-jin?

415
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:51,542
No. This is company business,
so I'll proceed separately.

416
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,579
Okay.

417
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,086
Chunha Financing will be joining
the non-profit bank.

418
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,591
Did you meet with Ms. Seo?

419
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,027
You don't need to know that.

420
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:13,197
If you get involved with the slush fund,
it will be problematic later on.

421
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:21,472
That's all I'm capable of
and that's what I've always done.

422
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,540
Sir.

423
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:27,645
I will repay you someday
for saving me from the hospital.

424
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,918
You don't need to follow me
or watch me anymore.

425
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,687
-Se-jin.
-Tell Ms. Seo she got what she wanted.

426
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:14,425
I have no way of investigating
or chasing anything.

427
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,229
Are you okay?

428
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,099
I'm not okay at all.

429
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,434
So don't talk to me.

430
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,911
We looked, but there is no information
on who will be the next CEO.

431
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,482
I hear they are selecting someone
within the company to be safe.

432
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,450
He is so unpredictable,

433
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,220
he may have chosen someone
completely random, too.

434
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,489
We must find out before we miss the timing
for the sale.

435
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,592
Check both on and off-line resources.

436
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,360
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

437
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,463
I don't think
I need to follow Se-jin anymore.

438
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,400
I think it's over with Chunha Financing.

439
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,202
I think what she was doing
with Gun-woo failed, too.

440
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:02,340
Ever since he was released,
he hasn't been at the office at all.

441
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:04,709
Okay.

442
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,078
But keep checking on her.

443
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,280
You want me to keep following her?

444
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,516
That's what I just said.

445
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,448
This isn't a James Bond movie.
What are we doing?

446
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:47,318
I'm sure you've been in big troubles
after underestimating Ms. Seo.

447
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:02,233
If she decided on selling the company,
she'll push it forward, no matter what.

448
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,838
I told her I would not give up
when it comes to the company.

449
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,074
Who's the succeeding CEO?

450
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,080
We can't continue our discussion
if you don't trust me.

451
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,352
We have a branch in Silicon Valley.

452
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,055
The branch manager
started as a researcher.

453
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,625
He has vision
and excellent business management skills.

454
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,530
-When is he coming?
-Early next week.

455
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,667
Delay it as much as possible
until you announce your candidacy.

456
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:38,836
Maybe have him come the day of.

457
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:43,574
If he comes in sooner, Ms. Seo will bribe,
threaten, or do something to him.

458
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:50,381
She'll make him give up succeeding me
and force me to sell the company?

459
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:52,984
Don't let your guard down.

460
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,163
COLLINS CO.
ORDER RECORD AND CAPITAL STATUS

461
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:16,707
Hello?

462
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,578
I heard Chairman Son is now
on Ms. Seo's side.

463
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,514
-What a shame.
-Right.

464
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,349
I'd like to meet.

465
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:27,919
Sorry,

466
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,655
but I'm investigating Collins Co.

467
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:35,126
I can't ask you to help me find
Mr. Jang's weakness.

468
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,237
PROFILE

469
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,677
SISTER, SOO-YUN JUNG

470
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,587
Why do you look so surprised?

471
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:06,190
The group is acquiring Korea Works?

472
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:09,026
Everyone cursed me out so much
for selling Moojin Tech,

473
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,429
that I duked it out with Yi-kyung.

474
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:14,232
We decided that Moojin
will acquire Korea Works.

475
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,068
She'll set the table.

476
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,338
We just have to thank her and eat from it.

477
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,776
Stop being so shocked and smile.

478
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:31,148
If the New City Project goes well
and we acquire Korea Works,

479
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,517
it's huge for the group.

480
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,511
The new party's steering committee
will hold a meeting this weekend.

481
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:05,616
Naturally, you should both attend
and meet the committee members.

482
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:10,755
I'd better dress up,
if I want to look good to your crew.

483
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,193
How is the non-profit bank coming along?

484
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,729
Chairman Son started preparing it.

485
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,934
Mr. Jang, isn't she just impressive?

486
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:27,238
She turns our enemy from yesterday
into our ally today.

487
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,708
It is an art. An art.

488
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,285
I was the one who was impressed.

489
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:44,555
The succeeding CEO.

490
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,957
You hid that person well.

491
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,429
It's hard to find, right? It will be.

492
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,098
Selling your company is the best option
in order to win the election.

493
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,968
You can't be the only winner.

494
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:01,205
You should lose once in a while
to appear more human.

495
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:02,940
I'll go ahead.

496
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,054
Why? What?

497
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:20,591
I heard something mind blowing
from Director Yoon just now.

498
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,794
-What is it?
-That Grandpa was in the hospital

499
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,263
because you put him there
against his will.

500
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,899
Is it true? Did you really do that?

501
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,937
That makes no sense whatsoever.

502
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,007
So tell me something that makes sense!

503
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:40,111
Did you really lock Grandpa
in the hospital? Did you?

504
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,278
Ma-ri, you...

505
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,848
It's a false rumor.

506
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,552
People are trying to get between us,
that's all.

507
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:59,130
Your father may be a troublemaker,
but he wouldn't lock up his own father.

508
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:02,366
Who would do something
so immoral and depraved?

509
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,406
Ma-ri, don't fall for rumors like that.

510
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,308
Do you two think I'm stupid or something?

511
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,177
You suddenly switched hospitals.

512
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,713
Se-jin said to make sure not to tell Dad.

513
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,915
Come to think of it, it's all suspicious!

514
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,217
Ma-ri, that was--

515
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,919
Never mind! Forget it!

516
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:29,160
If being a son is too difficult for you,
at least be a good father.

517
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,696
But you know her temper.

518
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,104
Get the non-profit bank proposal.

519
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,808
Yes, Father.

520
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,091
If you're going to say something boring,
don't bother. I feel crappy right now.

521
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,427
Let's go skiing. I want some fresh air.

522
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,863
What? Skiing?

523
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,005
What's going on with Korea Works?

524
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:18,375
They've beefed up their firewall
ever since the leak from last time.

525
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,811
I can't seem to get in.

526
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,982
We've contacted some people
in the industry,

527
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,518
but they are split on
who they think will succeed as CEO.

528
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:38,796
Talk.

529
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,565
Se-jin got on the highway with Ma-ri Son.

530
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,167
The highway?

531
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,836
They seem to be going somewhere to play.

532
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,673
-Stay on her.
-Understood.

533
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,579
Welcome.

534
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:32,182
Is there a Soo-yun Jung
in Customer Relations Department?

535
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:35,686
Ms. Jung? She's off today.

536
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,221
I see.

537
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,990
May I get her contact information?

538
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,927
What is it about?

539
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:43,928
Her sister...

540
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,965
I need to ask her something.

541
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:49,600
I see.

542
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,536
If you'd give me your information,
I'll relay it to her.

543
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,004
Thank you.

544
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,642
-Thank you.
-Sure.

545
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,211
What are you doing here?
Let's hit the rental shop.

546
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:04,081
I can't ski. I'll just watch.

547
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,917
Hey, we came all the way here.

548
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:07,985
Let's go.

549
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:09,053
What?

550
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:26,804
Hey!

551
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,439
Hey!

552
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,674
What the heck?

553
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,545
-Where were you?
-I was hiding, so that I could scare you.

554
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,146
-It's cold.
-You scared me.

555
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,247
-Did I surprise you?
-Yeah.

556
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:38,449
That's good.

557
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,500
Here.

558
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,070
Sorry for asking you
to come out of the blue.

559
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,640
No, it's a nice getaway.

560
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,643
I was just about to explode, anyway.

561
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,113
Hey, Se-jin. Tell me honestly.

562
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,217
-What?
-When you switched hospitals,

563
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,351
what was that about?

564
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,822
What did the chairman say?

565
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:22,393
He says all the strange talk
are false rumors.

566
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,931
-What he said is right.
-Really?

567
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,603
I'll believe it
because it's you saying it.

568
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,706
Yeah, believe me.

569
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,976
I'm hungry. Let's get some cake.

570
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:51,522
You look good. I guess the investigation
was to your liking.

571
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,425
Let's not start with an attitude.
Sit down.

572
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,935
I heard you're trying to sell Korea Works.

573
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,806
He can't run for president
if he is the CEO of a company.

574
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,775
And Mr. Kang adamantly refuses to sell.

575
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,679
It's a matter of time.
He'll end up selling it.

576
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,582
Did you find out whom he chose
to succeed him as CEO?

577
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,353
I don't know why you're asking this.

578
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,490
You need to know who the successor is,
so that you can take action.

579
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,558
Right?

580
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,560
Let's say that's true.

581
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,697
You still didn't say
why you wanted to meet.

582
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:41,672
It's Korea Works' branch manager
in Silicon Valley.

583
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:48,412
You take care of the rest
and make the sale happen.

584
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:51,882
Gun-woo.

585
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:54,718
Good.

586
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,654
Now, you seem human.

587
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,792
You can do much more,
if it'll profit the group.

588
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:02,826
Not at all.

589
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,629
This is the first and last time.

590
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,002
Don't be ashamed of your greed.

591
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,511
I said you don't need to
follow me anymore.

592
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:56,313
It's Ms. Seo's orders.

593
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:01,919
Collins Co. was my last thread of hope,
but it's gone.

594
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,222
She doesn't want to talk about her sister.

595
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:06,623
Se-jin.

596
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,126
It's time to let go.

597
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,794
It's over.

598
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:16,200
You and Ms. Seo don't need
to get tangled anymore.

599
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,467
I know.

600
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:22,706
If things get tangled,
she cuts it off without hesitating.

601
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:28,011
I want to see if I can do the same.

602
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,746
-Se-jin.
-Drive carefully.

603
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,764
To be honest, I'm afraid...

604
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,367
that Se-jin will cause trouble.

605
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,770
I got it. You may go.

606
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,810
Why don't you see her and talk to her?

607
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:04,381
-About what?
-Warn her or advise her.

608
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,917
She'll listen to you.

609
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:12,055
If that were true,
she never would've left.

610
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,226
I just realized, you see,

611
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:18,996
that anything you do,

612
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,331
I can do.

613
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,751
I may be locked in here, but I have ears.

614
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:45,088
Bong-soo's daughter framed you,

615
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,124
right?

616
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:48,692
It's not certain.

617
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:55,699
Her life ended up that way
because of bad blood between the fathers,

618
00:48:55,799 --> 00:49:00,103
so I felt sorry for her,
but she knows no limit.

619
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,139
-Father.
-Just wait.

620
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:07,377
I'll make sure she can't
act like a maverick anymore.

621
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,212
It can help the group at times.

622
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:15,552
We'll be acquiring Korea Works soon,
thanks to her.

623
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,554
Do you mean it?

624
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:21,224
We should use her as well,
if it'll profit the company.

625
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,527
She won't be that easy.

626
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,863
I hear she's creating
a new political party, too.

627
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,103
She can't maintain this momentum
much longer.

628
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,741
-I'm sure the Future Party will do well.
-Thank you.

629
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,111
Hi, Mr. Kang.

630
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,849
-Sir, thank you.
-Congratulations.

631
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,018
Your presence has brightened the room.

632
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,654
Please look this way.

633
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,291
-Hello.
-It's good to see you.

634
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,292
Thank you.

635
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,227
I'll see you inside.

636
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:58,962
Congratulations.

637
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:00,831
Excuse me for a moment.

638
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,735
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

639
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,483
I'm sure I told you.

640
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:21,985
I will not sell the company.

641
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,889
There will be a press conference
after the event.

642
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:29,326
You may announce the sale then.

643
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,694
Ms. Seo.

644
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,230
Young-suk Joo,
the US West Coast Branch manager

645
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,232
can't come to succeed you as CEO.

646
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,769
You must know how I work.

647
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:44,541
I will do anything it takes to stop you
from appointing a successor.

648
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,513
How did you find out?

649
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,982
What you do now is what matters.

650
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,052
Decide on the sale.

651
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,512
I'm sorry, but would you please
fill out a survey?

652
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,513
No, thank you.

653
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,816
It'll take just three minutes. Please.

654
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,084
I'm sorry, but I'm busy.

655
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,685
There's a gift, too.

656
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:44,234
Se-jin!

657
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,170
Go.

658
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:55,112
Ms. Kim.

659
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,581
Please track a car for me.

660
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,750
Se-jin was abducted!

661
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,354
Mr. Kang.

662
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,494
Today is about you. Don't forget to smile.

663
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,034
Mr. Jung.

664
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,137
-Hello.
-You came.

665
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:22,439
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. Let's go.

666
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:23,673
-Sure.
-This way.

667
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,674
-Yes.
-I know.

668
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,209
-They're all inside.
-Really?

669
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:31,515
Isn't that strange?

670
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:44,794
Hey.

671
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,365
Ma'am.

672
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,538
-Hello?
-Se-jin was abducted.

673
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,142
I'm sorry. I was distracted
for a minute and...

674
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:02,512
Calm down. Are you tracking the car?

675
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,181
Ms. Kim is looking into it.

676
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:07,117
Go to the gallery for now. Mr. Jo and I...

677
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:18,962
Yi-kyung Seo speaking.

678
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,598
Is the event going well?

679
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,066
Thanks to you.

680
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,535
I'm sorry I couldn't join you
on such a happy occasion.

681
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:30,307
My body may have left,
but my heart is always serving Mr. Jang.

682
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,676
You should tell him that yourself.

683
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:34,578
I'm busy with my work, too.

684
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:39,783
I'm bothered by a nuisance
who keeps digging into Mr. Jang.

685
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,886
Give her the phone.

686
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:45,422
I'll let you confirm for yourself.

687
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:53,964
Ma'am.

688
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:56,533
What happened?

689
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,569
I don't know. I was just dragged here.

690
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,271
I don't know anything...

691
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,207
Ms. Seo?

692
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,642
Speak.

693
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:09,212
Given what it is, I thought I'd show
my final act of loyalty toward Mr. Jang.

694
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:12,983
Give me the documents you have
on Collins Co.

695
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:18,989
You are so skilled at making deals,
I can't give you a chance to think.

696
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,224
Bring it within two hours.

697
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:24,127
-Mr. Nam.
-I'll let you know the location.

698
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:27,163
Obviously, you must come alone.

699
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,972
-Shall we head in?
-Yes, let's go in.

700
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,446
Do you think he ordered it?

701
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:45,782
No.

702
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:47,984
I doubt it.

703
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:50,587
Then we'll send Tak
once we find out the location.

704
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:52,022
Then Se-jin will be in danger.

705
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:56,693
You don't mean to go alone, do you?

706
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:04,234
Do you really think she'll come alone?

707
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,970
She'll bring the documents, too.

708
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:11,608
You seem sure about her.

709
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:22,786
She knows I've been digging
into Collins Co.

710
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,423
Tak saw me get abducted.

711
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:34,664
She'll think you resorted
to taking drastic measures.

712
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,701
I never expected you
to volunteer to be bait.

713
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,203
There was no other way.

714
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:44,407
At least I can eliminate
Mr. Jang's weakness.

715
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,943
What do you gain from this?

716
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:53,750
If she cuts ties with Mr. Jang,

717
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,020
her plan will fall apart as well.

718
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,559
That's enough for me.

719
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:26,082
You can't go alone.

720
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,452
-Go to the gallery with Mr. Jo.
-Ma'am.

721
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:38,061
No. I need to go after her.

722
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,462
Tak!

723
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:43,166
It's her choice. Follow orders.

724
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,042
Where should I go?

725
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:06,216
Ma'am.

726
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:08,284
Are you okay?

727
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:10,420
Yes.

728
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,122
I'm sorry for startling you.

729
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:16,860
Consider it a slightly deviant expression
of my loyalty.

730
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,431
Where are the documents?

731
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:30,573
-Ms. Seo?
-I didn't bring them.

732
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:38,515
The deal was that you bring
the documents on Collins Co.

733
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:47,624
There's no need for a deal
for a fake abduction.

734
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,594
I don't understand what you mean.

735
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:53,830
I'm sure it was Se-jin's idea.

736
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,900
You had nothing to lose.

737
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:01,538
Are you saying that's why you came
empty-handed?

738
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:05,041
You keep repeating the same question.
It's quite a bother.

739
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:21,424
Did you think I'd agree that easily
to a deal like this?

740
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:23,660
Yes.

741
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:25,495
Why?

742
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:27,697
Because...

743
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,466
I am your weakness.

744
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:33,369
It was a good attempt.

745
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,471
I'm proud of you.

746
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:40,410
If you knew it was a trap,
why did you come?

747
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:42,779
To mock me?

748
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:47,584
To make sure I understand
that I can't win no matter how hard I try?

749
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,219
Because if I didn't come,

750
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:52,689
you'd be in danger.

751
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:59,529
A fake trap could turn into a real one.

752
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,135
Given what it is,

753
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,238
I need to get the documents.

754
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:12,475
-Call the gallery.
-Mr. Nam.

755
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:15,278
It's for Mr. Jang.

756
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:17,547
I have no choice.

757
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,049
Don't be disappointed.

758
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:23,019
Everyone is fighting for their lives.

759
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:25,989
We are, and so is he.

760
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,730
You can't track Ms. Seo's car?

761
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:35,932
Do you think I'm a Genie?

762
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,001
Both Ms. Seo and Se-jin are in danger!

763
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,503
-I know!
-Keep it down, both of you!

764
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:44,140
She knew what she was doing. Let's wait.

765
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,076
Ms. Seo will take care of it.

766
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:16,706
I'm sorry.

767
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,910
I ruined everything.

768
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,580
I never predicted

769
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,784
this would happen.

770
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:32,355
I can't reflect you,

771
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,093
and I can't be like you.

772
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:39,796
I get it now.

773
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,765
This is my limit.

774
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:52,475
Let's stop now.

775
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:57,046
We should give them the documents
and get out.

776
01:01:58,581 --> 01:01:59,749
Don't do it.

777
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:05,188
Make deals, but don't compromise.

778
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,792
I must suppress the other.
I can't get on my knees.

779
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:15,431
You don't have to give in
to a scumbag like him.

780
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:20,269
I'll find a way out.

781
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,007
Se-jin.

782
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,914
The documents
on Collins Co. are in my car.

783
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:39,088
It's good to have them,
but it doesn't matter if I hand them over.

784
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,491
I came...

785
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,261
to hear you say what you said just now.

786
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:53,503
That's why I came to get you.

787
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,538
You don't need to let her manhandle you
any longer.

788
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:31,541
I'll have to do the elections my way, now.

789
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,943
There's been a change in the deal.

790
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,145
It's Mr. Jang's wishes.
You should do as he says.

791
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:40,950
The presidency is much more powerful
than you can imagine.

792
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:42,418
I'll take care of Yi-kyung.

793
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,420
We will collect our profits.

794
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,790
It's time to get rid of her,
don't you agree?

795
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:50,326
We will be the final victor.

796
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:53,262
You seem to want that position.

797
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,502
