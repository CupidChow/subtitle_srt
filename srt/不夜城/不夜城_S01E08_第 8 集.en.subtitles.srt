EPISODE 8

2
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,127
There's something
I'd like you to help me with.

3
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,631
Give this to Gun-woo directly from you.

4
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:08,034
Did you predict that Gun-woo
would approach me

5
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:09,936
from the start?

6
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,639
Is that why you fired me?

7
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,207
I was only half sure.

8
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,409
You could've returned...

9
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,312
or you could've given up completely.

10
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,348
Because if I just approached him,

11
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,284
Gun-woo wouldn't have trusted me.

12
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,454
Don't mix in sincerity
when dealing with people.

13
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,191
Whether it's Gun-woo or someone else.

14
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,827
If there is any sincerity,

15
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,130
everything else that is fake
will become evident.

16
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,884
Isn't this what you wanted me to find?

17
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,554
Right?

18
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,156
It's the item in the picture.

19
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,258
How did you find it?

20
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,328
-Sorry?
-You found it sooner than I expected.

21
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,831
He'll want to know how you got it.

22
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,535
Even the prosecutor's team
couldn't find it, since we hid it so well.

23
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,805
It would be suspicious
if you find it easily.

24
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,643
How did you find this?

25
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,280
Should I say I searched
in the middle of the night?

26
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,449
Would you believe that?

27
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,486
What if I say you told me
where you hid it?

28
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,421
Then I'd suspect you

29
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,158
as the person who stole the hard drive.

30
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,477
I just need a believable excuse.

31
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,013
I'll say I lied to you.

32
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,149
It'll have to be something
that will convince both me and Gun-woo.

33
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,219
I can just mix in what you said.

34
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,324
The prosecutor's team came,

35
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,560
so you told me
where the hard drive was hidden

36
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,295
and to hide it somewhere else.

37
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,531
-And?
-I hid it somewhere safe,

38
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,233
and lied to you.

39
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,336
I'll say the prosecutor's team
found it just before I got there.

40
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,206
If I believe
that the search team took it...

41
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,876
Then you'll have no reason to suspect me.

42
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,081
That's what you need to tell
the owner of this item.

43
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,651
That Ms. Seo believes
the prosecutor took it.

44
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,490
What?

45
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,425
Will you be okay?

46
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,194
I don't want you to be in danger
because of this.

47
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,697
With great risk comes great reward.

48
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,734
I take cash only. No credit cards.

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,982
Do you suddenly need money?

50
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,984
I'm always short on money.

51
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,118
You know my situation.

52
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,854
You've already done
the background check on me.

53
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,157
I didn't think you'd call so soon.

54
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,029
"Situations change
and so do your convictions."

55
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,333
That's what you said, right?

56
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,070
And you said it was hypocritical.

57
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,240
I couldn't stop thinking about
what you said,

58
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,209
but I get it now.

59
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,478
These backdoor dealings

60
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,714
are dirty, no matter how you call it.

61
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,852
Let's end our transaction here.

62
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,689
There's no need for you to be corrupted
in my fight against Yi-kyung.

63
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,027
That was hypocritical too.

64
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,798
I did it for money and I am not ashamed.

65
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,669
What's it to you whether or not
I get corrupted?

66
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,638
-Se-jin.
-A corporate heir everyone envies.

67
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,541
I can put up with you acting arrogant
and haughty,

68
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,511
but don't act like you're nice, too.

69
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,170
Will you be long?

70
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,842
Se-jin has plans nearby,
so I thought I'd pick her up.

71
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,311
It'll only be 30 minutes round trip.

72
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,312
Wait here.

73
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,056
Please tell him Yi-kyung Seo
is here to see him.

74
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,774
He'd like you to come in first.

75
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:30,857
Wow. You must have worked
night and day to build the company

76
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,992
this much this quickly.

77
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,161
You must've worked hard.

78
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,064
Let me know if there's anything I can do
to help.

79
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,800
I brought those documents because
you wanted to know about my company.

80
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,502
I didn't mean anything else.

81
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,804
Sure.

82
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,840
They say the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

83
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,244
You must be good at running a business
because you take after Bong-soo.

84
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,179
You should call in your son too.

85
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,817
How long will you let him
run Mr. Jang's errands?

86
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,522
If you leave Gun-woo alone,
he'll end up becoming one of his people.

87
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,856
I don't care.

88
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,759
I can't control him.

89
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,898
He likes it there.
I just won't see him anymore.

90
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,803
Mr. Jang may be holding him captive
as a shield.

91
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,905
A shield?

92
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,640
You were together for a very long time.

93
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,676
You know things you should

94
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,077
as well as things you shouldn't.

95
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,081
What if you had something,

96
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,818
something that is

97
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,420
his fatal weakness?

98
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:40,927
What?

99
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,862
If you have one, give it to me,

100
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,698
so that I can punish Tae-joon.

101
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,148
I'm sure he's hiding it.

102
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,685
The weapon he can use on Tae-joon Jang.

103
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,720
Even if he does have something,

104
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,057
he wouldn't use it rashly.

105
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,000
I've confirmed it.

106
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,803
Thankfully, the account
has not been touched.

107
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,639
Mr. Jang says you did a good job.

108
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,441
Okay, then.

109
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,077
I need to see him.

110
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,049
So you'll return to Moo-il?

111
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,552
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,088
I know how you feel.

113
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:47,527
"I've repaid him this much.
I can return to my father now."

114
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,929
That's probably all you can think about.

115
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,567
His big brother is right there,

116
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,436
so Moo-sam can't do silly things.

117
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,607
Now that you no longer have
a source of concern,

118
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,677
coming here would be

119
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,079
a drag for you.

120
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,016
-Sir.
-I don't care.

121
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,585
Go back whenever you want.

122
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,187
If my father was given a prison sentence,

123
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,791
I would've become chairman
as you had intended,

124
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,295
and pulled your sleigh.

125
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,529
It's a shame.

126
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,700
You need to be mutually useful
to continue a relationship.

127
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,672
As for Yi-kyung Seo,

128
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:34,807
please

129
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,943
don't take issue with her anymore.

130
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,982
She caused this problem.

131
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,518
If you caused trouble,

132
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,220
you should be spanked.

133
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,189
-Sir.
-Give Moo-il

134
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,358
my regards.

135
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,764
It's sort of obsessive disorder.

136
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,235
Even if the opponent cheats,
he must follow the rules.

137
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,438
That's how Gun-woo is.

138
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,675
I'm sure making the deal with you
tortured his conscience.

139
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,311
How inflexible.

140
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:13,779
Extremely.

141
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,214
And cowardly.

142
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,089
Someone who is tough on himself
is that way because he is afraid.

143
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,092
Because he is afraid of wavering,

144
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,261
he hangs on through rules and standards.

145
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,364
Not bad.

146
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,468
I've had part time jobs for eight years.
I'm better than any fortune teller.

147
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,536
It'll be difficult to penetrate.

148
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,038
Can you do it?

149
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,341
I heard he'll be returning
to the group soon.

150
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,078
It's obvious he'll get in the way
of your plan.

151
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,448
I'll have to do it somehow.

152
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,420
BIOGRAPHICAL DATA OF GUN-WOO PARK

153
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,925
I want to stop Yi-kyung.

154
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,629
If she keeps at this pace,

155
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,831
she'll fall eventually.

156
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,235
Let's end our transaction here.

157
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,038
There's no need for you to get corrupted
in my fight against Yi-kyung.

158
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,473
It's sort of obsessive disorder.

159
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,678
Even if the opponent cheats,
he must follow the rules.

160
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,579
That's how Gun-woo is.

161
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,549
The ceiling won't fall.

162
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,718
Another homework assignment?

163
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:26,952
Sort of.

164
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,090
What is it?

165
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,492
Want me to help?

166
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,466
What?

167
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,336
I'm sure

168
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,939
it may sound strange, but...

169
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,812
I love you.

170
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:54,880
Hey.

171
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,016
You...

172
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,351
Oh.

173
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,120
It works.

174
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:02,988
Right?

175
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,291
That's dangerous.

176
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,063
He refused to see you.

177
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:12,898
Let me in.

178
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,568
Don't come in
even if you hear things breaking inside.

179
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,108
Is this a supermarket?
Why are you letting anyone in?

180
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,644
What are you doing? Get rid of him!

181
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,947
I've said goodbye to Mr. Jang.

182
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,652
I told him I'll nurse you back to health
rather than do his bidding.

183
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,222
My filial love worked.

184
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,159
Don't yell at me all at once.

185
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,827
Spread it out a little.

186
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,100
Please forgive me.

187
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,403
Stop that.

188
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,174
A man must have a stiff neck.

189
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,448
If you leave Gun-woo alone,
he'll end up becoming one of his people.

190
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,153
Mr. Jang may be holding him captive
as a shield.

191
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:13,392
Did that punk Tae-joon really
let you go peacefully?

192
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,727
He didn't say anything?

193
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,096
I went on my own,
and I came back on my own.

194
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,052
SEOUL OLYMPICS

195
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,264
The prosecutor?

196
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,867
The director of Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure and Transport

197
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,769
was arrested for taking bribes.

198
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,139
Details on art deals
with Gallery S were obtained,

199
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,441
and we need to investigate
Ms. Yi-kyung Seo as well.

200
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,710
Look. Last time, you came
and searched the place.

201
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,946
Now, you're ordering Ms. Seo
to go in for questioning?

202
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,180
Lower your voice.

203
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,755
I expected them to come around today.

204
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,657
Then Mr. Jang...

205
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,626
It won't take long.

206
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,996
I e-mailed each of you
your assignments, so check them.

207
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,731
Ma'am.

208
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,499
It's for bribery.

209
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,970
-Se-jin--
-You may go to prison.

210
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,606
Would you split up your life

211
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,541
and offer them to useless people?

212
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,945
I don't use my money like that.
Not even a bit.

213
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:43,682
Shall we?

214
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,602
Yi-kyung was taken in by the prosecutor?

215
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,375
I'm anxious.

216
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,844
I feel like this happened

217
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,613
because I helped you last time.

218
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,218
But it's not like
I could talk about this with anyone else.

219
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:21,520
Don't blame yourself.

220
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,157
What's the charge?

221
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,760
Some official is being investigated
for taking bribes

222
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,929
and they found art deals with the gallery.

223
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,531
-Bribes?
-Yes.

224
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,071
Then don't be anxious.

225
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,242
She'd never use her money for bribes.

226
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,844
Even if by chance she did,

227
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,547
she would've made sure
they were untraceable.

228
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,525
She said something similar, too.

229
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,029
-You know her well.
-Rest assured and wait.

230
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,167
She'll be out in a day or two at most.

231
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,370
I feel a little relieved now.

232
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,006
Thank you.

233
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,209
You seem to worry a lot about Yi-kyung.

234
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:19,945
Sorry?

235
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,818
That's because she's like a mentor to me.

236
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,824
At times, I get jealous
because she is just too perfect.

237
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,736
You invited assemblymen and vice ministers

238
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,105
to this charity auction, correct?

239
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,440
Among them were Director Jin-chul Kim,

240
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,442
who is being investigated
for taking bribes.

241
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,944
It's a coincidence.

242
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:53,679
Ms. Yi-kyung Seo.

243
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,948
We may not have physical evidence,

244
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,251
but there's circumstantial evidence.

245
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,286
You must prove that I received
something in exchange.

246
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,057
I don't remember receiving any benefit.

247
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,892
-What?
-You must be frustrated

248
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,128
conducting an investigation
that you know is going nowhere

249
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:10,929
for a crime that doesn't exist.

250
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,967
If it's your superior
whom Mr. Jang can influence,

251
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,770
is it Director Jong-hyun Oh?

252
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,507
Or Chief Prosecutor Tae-sung Lee?

253
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,212
The nature of enlightenment cannot be seen

254
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,948
Its effect is subtle
that it is incomprehensible

255
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,221
Yi-kyung Seo is being interrogated
by the prosecutor.

256
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,123
Chief Prosecutor Oh says

257
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,526
he couldn't find anything suspicious.

258
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,932
Mr. Yang is meeting with the prosecutor
on the case.

259
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,601
They can't drag out the interrogation

260
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,504
without any physical evidence.

261
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,241
Make an appointment with Mr. Jang.

262
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,277
I'm sure he's waiting.

263
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,344
I will.

264
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,019
Mr. Jo, please wait outside.

265
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,022
Yes, ma'am.

266
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,405
Raise your head.

267
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,207
Sit straight.

268
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,582
I was looking forward to saying that,
but I guess not.

269
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,618
I'm disappointed because you look so fine.

270
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,321
I won't let something like this
stagger me.

271
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,157
I met with Gun-woo.

272
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,427
Seeing me worry about you,

273
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,662
he told me to rest assured.

274
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,399
I'm sure.

275
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,802
You said before,

276
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,573
not to mix in sincerity because
what's fake will show.

277
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,543
But I don't think that's right.

278
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,846
I thought about it,

279
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,818
but someone like Gun-woo must be
approached with sincerity.

280
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,387
Little by little and slowly.

281
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,757
That way, even that which is fake
will look real.

282
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,461
When I was worrying about you,

283
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,564
I was being sincere.

284
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,032
It's not an emotional matter.

285
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,303
It's a cold fight where you take and lose.

286
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:33,939
If you want to win,

287
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,642
you must use that emotion
as a weapon, too.

288
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,145
I'll use it sparingly,

289
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,648
since emotions are also money.

290
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,586
I have nothing to give you.

291
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:49,621
What do you mean?

292
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,758
I want to lend you something
interest-free,

293
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,427
but I have nothing.

294
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,863
You don't need to,

295
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,899
since I have everything.

296
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,851
Will you continue to remain silent?

297
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:21,987
You'll be cross-examined.

298
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,057
I told you everything already.

299
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,459
How many times did you meet
Director Jin-chul Kim?

300
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,394
You know his wife, don't you?

301
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,048
I told you everything already.

302
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,117
Will you keep doing this?

303
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,487
Fine. When did you first meet
Director Jin-chul Kim?

304
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,734
Are you living in the office now?

305
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,469
Why is an office worker so busy?

306
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,737
You're not sick, right?

307
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,106
-Song-mi's studying well?
-Se-jin.

308
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,875
I deposited the money
for the living expenses.

309
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,910
-When did you--
-I'll see you.

310
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,145
Wait. Hey.

311
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,048
Se-jin.

312
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,322
Where's Ms. Seo?

313
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,658
She came by and left already.

314
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,160
Already?

315
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,661
Where did she go?

316
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,763
Does she ever say?

317
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,205
What?

318
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,799
Yi-kyung Seo was sent home this morning.

319
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,969
I was aware of one percent possibility.

320
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,372
-Pardon?
-I was thinking

321
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,141
that there was
a one percent chance of danger.

322
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:00,312
But Mr. Jang made a wrong guess.

323
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,451
It's been a while.

324
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,026
You look a little wearied.

325
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,696
Did you not sleep well?

326
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,799
People need to sleep well.

327
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,435
They say eating right
will keep you healthy,

328
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,170
but sleep--

329
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,672
I don't like repeating myself.

330
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,609
Mr. Jang was speaking.

331
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,678
I'll make a special exception for you
and repeat myself.

332
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,482
I will help you become the king's father.

333
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,886
In order to do that, I will fill

334
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,521
your empty safe.

335
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,124
I have the plan and the people.

336
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm sure you remember.

337
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,799
I thought you came to apologize.

338
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,767
I came to receive an apology.

339
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,104
Thanks to you and Gun-woo Park,

340
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,007
I've taken a huge loss in time and funds.

341
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,843
If you admit your mistake,

342
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,512
I won't demand payment.

343
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,814
Ms. Yi-kyung Seo.

344
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,817
You have no intention of apologizing,

345
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,587
and I have no desire to either.

346
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,591
I guess we can stop talking here.

347
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,663
It's a shame.

348
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,571
You should at least send flowers
to the chairman.

349
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:35,941
He's very upset

350
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,543
about Gun-woo.

351
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:46,551
Ms. Seo.

352
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,157
What did you mean
that Chairman Moo-il Park

353
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:54,593
is upset?

354
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,495
Who knows?

355
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,597
It's difficult to tell,

356
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,866
since he is such a short-tempered person.

357
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,667
Next time you meet with Mr. Jang,

358
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,003
please be more respectful.

359
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,575
Next time you want to frame me,

360
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,645
make sure you have some solid evidence.

361
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,525
I considered taking her in

362
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,427
if she apologized.

363
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,132
But she'd rather break than bend.

364
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,768
What about Chairman Moo-il Park?

365
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,138
Don't worry about him.

366
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,041
I know Moo-il very well.

367
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,848
No matter what,

368
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,217
we all are family.

369
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,355
As long as I'm alive and well,

370
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,525
stop the fighting

371
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,461
and work together for the company.

372
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,300
You punks. Answer me!

373
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,069
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

374
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,304
Good.

375
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,574
You two should work together

376
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,944
and restart

377
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:20,779
the new city project.

378
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,549
We need to make up for the loss incurred

379
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,585
from shutting down Dubai.

380
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,822
It's my long-cherished business.

381
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,693
I need to see it completed before I die.

382
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,605
Moojin Group Special Planning Team.

383
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,974
This is the VIP wing of Dongsan Hospital.

384
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,775
Is Mr. Gun-woo Park in?

385
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,611
He went to the hospital.

386
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,212
Did something happen--

387
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,313
No. Okay, then.

388
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,686
It's cold. Bundle up.

389
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,787
I need to be cold.

390
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,566
You should've settled down in Seongbuk.

391
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,668
Why did you return already?

392
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,603
Thank goodness I didn't.

393
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,106
The new city project

394
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,742
is vital to the group.

395
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,949
Let's work together,
since Moo-il ordered us to.

396
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,453
-I'll be a good son this time.
-Sure.

397
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,237
Hi, Ms. Seo. What is it?

398
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:10,855
Se-jin?

399
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:13,425
Huh?

400
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,628
-What brings you here?
-I came to visit a friend.

401
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,564
Oh. The chairman is in this hospital.

402
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,199
I think I saw that on the news.

403
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,901
Is he okay?

404
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,003
-Yes.
-That's good.

405
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:26,638
Goodbye, then.

406
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,467
I feel bad for troubling you.

407
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,502
I could've grabbed a cab.

408
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,437
Pretend you did.

409
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,976
Ms. Seo was released
for lack of culpability.

410
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,045
I heard.

411
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,047
I told you to rest assured.

412
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,886
May I ask you something?

413
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,623
Will you keep fighting

414
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,792
with Ms. Seo?

415
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,229
The two of you

416
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:25,997
shared a past.

417
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,466
It's such a shame.

418
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,936
If she stops,
there'd be no reason to fight.

419
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,073
You can stop too.

420
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:40,612
Back at that gathering,

421
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,581
I could tell when I heard you
play the guitar,

422
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,284
that

423
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,587
you still had feelings for--

424
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,522
Se-jin.

425
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,725
Please stop talking about Yi-kyung.

426
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:57,962
I'm sorry.

427
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,732
I didn't mean to offend you.

428
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,734
You didn't.

429
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,202
Let's just...

430
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,105
talk about something else.

431
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,346
What was your friend hospitalized for?

432
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,849
You can drop me off over there.

433
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,753
I'll drive you to the gallery. It's cold.

434
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:25,056
It'll be bad for both of us if others see.

435
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,548
Thank you. I came comfortably
thanks to you.

436
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:51,950
Se-jin...

437
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,715
-Get in.
-Hey.

438
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,117
I said, get in.

439
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,159
-Where did you go?
-Dongsan Hospital.

440
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:36,527
What?

441
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,097
Were you following me?

442
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,633
Are you dating Gun-woo Park?

443
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,336
A Cinderella seducing a prince.

444
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,306
Is that it?

445
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:56,481
Rule number one.

446
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,816
Follow Ms. Seo's orders no matter what.

447
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,021
Ms. Seo ordered you? Why?

448
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,323
You violated rules two and three.

449
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:07,959
You followed me without being ordered to

450
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,694
and even questioned the reason.

451
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,664
Did Ms. Seo really order you to do it?

452
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:17,101
Why do you think it's hard
for businessmen?

453
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,971
The quasi-taxes are bleeding us dry.

454
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,407
They ask for payments here and there.

455
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,876
It's so hard.

456
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,314
Our newspaper is preparing
a special article.

457
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,750
I think it would be best
to focus the suspicion

458
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,053
on one or two foundations.

459
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:39,791
Such as...

460
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,329
Baeksong Foundation.

461
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,867
Anyway,

462
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,437
please help me out.

463
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,272
Sure. I'll see you soon.

464
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,118
Isn't it too much?

465
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,288
It'll be a headache
if we become enemies with Mr. Jang.

466
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,126
Anyway, you owe me a big one.

467
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,428
You're the one who owes me.

468
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,263
Me? Why?

469
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,032
You should wipe down

470
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,034
the chairman's seat.

471
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,337
You'll be sitting there very soon.

472
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,147
Hello.

473
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,156
What is this?

474
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:50,094
I need to ask you something.

475
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,095
Hey. You...

476
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,131
Did you really

477
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,099
give the order regarding Gun-woo Park?

478
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,370
He followed me when I met with Gun-woo.

479
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,141
You'll often get tails while working.

480
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:04,909
You're lucky it was Tak.

481
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:06,711
Be careful from now on.

482
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,012
Yes, ma'am.

483
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:09,981
Ma'am.

484
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:12,917
It was my order.

485
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,819
Se-jin did as she was told.

486
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,612
What's wrong is wrong.

487
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,218
I respect you and Se-jin

488
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,387
is a good friend,

489
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,722
but this is out of line.

490
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:56,894
Whatever the reason,

491
00:34:58,663 --> 00:34:59,530
it is wrong.

492
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,401
I don't care that you think it's wrong.

493
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,404
I have no intention of explaining
my reason, either.

494
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,310
If you don't like how I work,
quit right now.

495
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,829
You can't leave like this.

496
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,931
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

497
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,099
Calm down.

498
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:36,501
Tak.

499
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:38,836
Do as Ms. Kim says.

500
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,038
I'm following Ms. Seo's orders
for the last time.

501
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,242
And you.

502
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,116
Seriously.

503
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,451
Tak!

504
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,365
Tak left.

505
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:09,800
He must've been shocked.

506
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:11,869
Please give him some time.

507
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,572
Even if he changes his mind,
he can't return on his own.

508
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,141
He's different from you.

509
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,878
You came back on your own, no matter what.

510
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,148
-Yes.
-You deal with Tak how you want.

511
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,018
Yes, ma'am.

512
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:36,961
I've made it to the final step.

513
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:39,931
About Gun-woo.

514
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,567
I just have to take one more step.

515
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,338
Do you think he'll let you?

516
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,974
Do you want to make a bet?

517
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,772
Pressured To Donate, The Financial World
Suffering From Quasi-Taxes

518
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,583
Where did this leak from

519
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,986
and who wrote it down?

520
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,254
I'll look into it.

521
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,201
Pressured To Donate, The Financial World
Suffering From Quasi-Taxes

522
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,981
The Moojin Neo City Project

523
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,850
is the largest new city project
in the world

524
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,620
which requires 60 trillion won in funds.

525
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,222
It'll create the most top-of-the-line
environment-friendly city

526
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,492
which will be a distribution hub
in the Northeast Asia.

527
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,828
It will be a massive project,

528
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,797
incorporating Moojin Group's technology
and funds.

529
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,799
Poor me.

530
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:58,336
It'll be such a headache to direct
such a huge business.

531
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,406
The presentation was good.

532
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,241
-Thank you.
-He's good.

533
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,945
-I'll get going now.
-Okay.

534
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,218
Did you see
the Baeksong Foundation article?

535
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,453
Why?

536
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,355
I was worried.

537
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,491
Maybe you told a reporter
something you shouldn't have,

538
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,493
when a huge project is coming up.

539
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:26,230
If you're concerned about Mr. Jang,
why don't you go see how he's doing?

540
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,166
No. I'd rather not get a beating
from my father.

541
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,303
The prodigal son should focus
on the company.

542
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,673
The business is so big.

543
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,809
I'm worried how I should conduct it.

544
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,922
Just throw away the earring.

545
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:53,524
It was cheap.

546
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,599
Someone once said

547
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,635
money and objects
must return to its rightful owner.

548
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,003
I wanted to return this.

549
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,775
You came just for this?

550
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,443
Whether it's money or objects,

551
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,912
it should return to its rightful owner.

552
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:20,718
Let's meet up sometime.

553
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,296
I cross-checked a few places,

554
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,131
and I think it was leaked from Moojin.

555
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,300
What about the prosecutors?

556
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,035
Since it's just a reporter's hunch,

557
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,271
they aren't taking any legal action

558
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:41,739
as of yet.

559
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,210
Moo-il.

560
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,346
Just because I used his kid a little,

561
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,585
he's showing his terrible temper.

562
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:04,695
How should I send a response
to make him quiet down?

563
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,941
Why are they reviewing
project feasibility now?

564
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,843
What nonsense is this?

565
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:22,446
It may be a private enterprise,
but it's of such a large scale.

566
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,149
If the government reevaluates...

567
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,150
Darn it.

568
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,318
This is Mr. Jang's revenge.

569
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,591
He pushed for the reevaluation.

570
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,693
He suspects we are behind

571
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,062
the article on the foundation.

572
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,031
Tae-joon, that bastard.

573
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,968
He's doing this
because of a stupid article?

574
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,536
Just because we disgraced his name?

575
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,041
Everyone who isn't a Park, leave.

576
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,216
We're just sprinkling some embers

577
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,152
between two dried up sheaves of rice.

578
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,022
If the ember hits either one,

579
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,725
they will both catch fire.

580
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,729
It'll be resolved if the two of them meet
and speak truthfully.

581
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,299
They suspect before trusting

582
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,368
and betray before being betrayed.

583
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,638
They lived like that all their lives.

584
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,741
Would talking change anything?

585
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,143
What should I do?

586
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,145
Wait for now.

587
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,347
You'll have something to do soon.

588
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,055
I have a bomb.

589
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,159
When Bong-soo got kicked out like that,

590
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,562
I wasn't just sitting there doing nothing.

591
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,498
Is it about Mr. Jang or his family?

592
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:51,168
That foundation that he cherishes
so dearly.

593
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,437
I'll destroy it in a single blow.

594
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:54,638
-Father.
-Moo-il.

595
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,340
That's a bit...

596
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,510
What? He's hurting my business.

597
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,012
Should I just whine and take it?

598
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,881
I'll go visit Mr. Jang.

599
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,152
Are you saying you're the hotline
to Mr. Jang?

600
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,820
I'll find out his real intention--

601
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,255
Forget it.

602
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:12,723
Why should you go to him?

603
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:13,791
I should warn him

604
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,560
not to touch Moojin Group.

605
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:18,395
I'll advise him as well.

606
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,765
You may have gone your separate ways,
but you were once friends.

607
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,436
You give me a dud after I take over

608
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,705
and then disappear on me?

609
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:29,206
I was disgraced

610
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,176
before Mr. Jang because of the account.

611
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:35,446
We'll hold a general meeting,

612
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,314
so officially apologize.

613
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,786
You won't be able to call
the general meeting.

614
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:48,092
Chairman Song, you'll be stepping down
from your position.

615
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:49,860
What was that?

616
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,565
You're all in it together. Huh?

617
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,537
Seriously.

618
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,174
Association management reform

619
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:09,013
and the plan of support for
the new foundation Mr. Jang will create.

620
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:10,414
A new foundation?

621
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,583
He has Baeksong. What new foundation?

622
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,119
You'll find out soon enough.

623
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,722
Return to being the association chairman.

624
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,624
I'll make that happen.

625
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:22,726
Hey, Ms. Seo.

626
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,730
What, you'll do everything
and we should be your lackeys?

627
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,599
The two of you

628
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,901
have no other exit.

629
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,605
You've prepared this for a long time,

630
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:36,974
so that you can be above us.

631
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:39,610
I can't do anything from that height.

632
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:41,745
I need to go higher.

633
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,449
Either take my hand and survive,

634
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,852
or continue to get dragged around
by useless people.

635
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:51,855
You decide.

636
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,360
You won't really do as Yi-kyung says,
will you?

637
00:44:57,294 --> 00:45:00,030
We're not sure whether or not
she really has Mr. Jang's support.

638
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,200
She gets anything she plans.

639
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,235
I have no choice.

640
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:06,403
Father.

641
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,771
One of these days,

642
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,040
I'll get my revenge.

643
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,144
Until then, I'll have to
walk the thorny path

644
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,714
and deal with the pain.

645
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,420
Yes. Okay. Goodbye.

646
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:26,924
Was that Moo-sam Park?

647
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,494
I think Gun-woo will take action,
as expected.

648
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,932
I can't let him turn out the ember
when I worked hard to keep it alive.

649
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:37,801
Se-jin will be waiting

650
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,838
to strengthen that ember.

651
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:46,577
Gun-woo!

652
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,381
-Se-jin.
-We need to talk.

653
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,983
Later. I need to go somewhere--

654
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,119
This is urgent too. That's why I ran over.

655
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:57,521
It's about the chairman.

656
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:00,891
Your father.

657
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,862
I think Ms. Seo was looking into Mr. Jang.

658
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,131
They have bad blood,

659
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,833
and with how she was taken in
by the prosecutor.

660
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,768
So?

661
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,804
I overheard her talking to Mr. Jo,

662
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,408
that she thinks the person who had
Chairman Moo-il Park arrested...

663
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,746
was Mr. Jang.

664
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,684
To make you the next chairman.

665
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,320
She said that was probably it.

666
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,356
Are you sure?

667
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,726
That's as much as I heard.

668
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,896
It looked like she was still
looking into it.

669
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:40,964
Okay.

670
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,766
I'll look into it myself.

671
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,135
Are you okay?

672
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:46,937
Of course.

673
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:49,006
Anyway, thank you. I'll call you later.

674
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,516
We each made a checkmate and countered,

675
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,821
so I guess you're here to finish it.

676
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,858
I let you go nicely.

677
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,294
Why are you back looking like that?

678
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,997
Please tell me one thing first.

679
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,035
My father's arrest.

680
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:20,504
Were you behind it?

681
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:26,310
Because you needed to make me the chairman
as soon as possible, to use me,

682
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,346
so it was okay to send
a disowned friend to prison.

683
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,215
Was that it?

684
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:36,253
Please, first tell me
whether or not it's true.

685
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,355
Who made such an outrageous accusation?

686
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,690
You stay out of it.

687
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:42,426
If I tell you the truth,

688
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,963
are you prepared to believe me?

689
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:53,637
Go back.

690
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:56,640
Don't avoid me, sir!

691
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,852
I was not the one who did that

692
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,223
to Moo-il.

693
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,392
It was your uncle.

694
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,699
He sold out his own brother because
he didn't want to go to prison.

695
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,736
My uncle did it?

696
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,440
You knew that,
but you kept it hidden all this time?

697
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,342
You never asked, did you?

698
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:33,410
Sir.

699
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,145
See?

700
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:40,517
You never intended to believe me
when you asked the question.

701
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,154
What's the point

702
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,890
in saying whether or not it's true?

703
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,698
Will Gun-woo

704
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,034
believe me?

705
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,304
It doesn't matter.

706
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,109
Everyone wants a peaceful life.

707
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,411
They see and hear

708
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:43,613
only what they want.

709
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,850
They use only that to decide
what is right or wrong,

710
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:49,753
because that makes them feel at peace

711
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,356
and they can find stability.

712
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:55,058
Make Gun-woo uncomfortable.

713
00:49:58,628 --> 00:49:59,730
So that was my role,

714
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:02,232
wasn't it?

715
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,436
I'm sure he couldn't even mention
the mediation plan.

716
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,438
That is enough.

717
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:26,723
How did it go?

718
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:31,128
Gun-woo.

719
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,530
He just asked you a question.

720
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,472
Hey, punk. How dare you glare at me?

721
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,808
-Father
-Go ahead.

722
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,676
What did that punk say?

723
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,380
Uncle...

724
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,683
sold you out.

725
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,424
I suspected Mr. Jang

726
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,727
for having you arrested,

727
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:06,363
but it was Uncle.

728
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,497
Gun-woo.

729
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,635
Hey. Are you kidding me?

730
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,103
Huh?

731
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,037
Am I wrong?

732
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,574
Stop your nonsense.

733
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:19,709
Moo-il,

734
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,746
I don't know where he heard
something so ridiculous.

735
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,347
Is that what Tae-joon said?

736
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,385
That your uncle betrayed me?

737
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,253
That's what I heard.

738
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:31,721
Shut it, you punk.

739
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,524
How dare you say such bull?

740
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,461
Do you have a witness? Where's the proof?

741
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,563
I'll have to find it now.

742
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,566
You can't believe

743
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,368
anything that Tae-joon says.

744
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:47,838
Betrayal.

745
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:51,141
He stabbed Bong-soo in the back.
Do you think I'd be safe?

746
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:53,977
Someone who betrayed a friend once

747
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,680
will betray others over and over again.

748
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,049
That's right. Of course.

749
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,750
Father.

750
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:05,322
The scar of being betrayed
can never be erased.

751
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,526
And if it was by an old friend
who is a sly politician,

752
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,330
even if you're given the truth,

753
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,599
it'll be hard to differentiate.

754
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:22,973
I want

755
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:25,475
all of those lights.

756
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,011
You can possess them.

757
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,216
I will look down from the highest place.

758
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,351
You can't do that.

759
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,755
There is only one person who can reach

760
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,191
the top of the world.

761
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:42,659
I'll pass ahead.

762
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:46,129
You can't.

763
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,031
Wait and see.

764
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:08,852
Amazing!

765
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,053
-Amazing!
-Amazing!

766
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,021
Grace!

767
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,189
-Forever!
-Forever!

768
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,230
-Over here!
-Look here!

769
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,899
Look over here!

770
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,301
-Forever!
-Forever!

771
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:38,949
Return to the gallery.

772
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:44,054
Is that what Ms. Seo said?

773
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:47,157
No, it's what I think.

774
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:50,160
No. Forget it.

775
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:52,762
But

776
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:54,965
she knows you'll come back.

777
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,001
The day you left,

778
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,170
she told me to take care of it.

779
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,306
I've been fired before too.

780
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:07,711
Did you succeed with Gun-woo Park?

781
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,183
Is it going well?

782
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:16,219
I'm not sure yet.

783
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:19,422
Does that bother you?

784
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,258
What does it have to do with me?

785
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,560
Come back and protect Ms. Seo.

786
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:25,729
And me too.

787
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,531
Why would I protect you?

788
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,334
Don't you like me?

789
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:37,140
I need to get back.

790
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:41,177
Tak! Chestnut--

791
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,780
Seoul District Prosecutor's Office's
criminal investigation department

792
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:45,715
has summoned Jong-gyu Nam
of Baeksong Foundation

793
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:49,786
regarding illegal solicitation of
contributions by the foundation.

794
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:53,490
Director Nam, who appeared
before the prosecutor at 1 p.m.

795
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:56,459
did not respond
to the reporters' questions.

796
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:58,295
Jong-gyu Nam Summoned

797
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:00,897
The prosecutor is analyzing computer
hard disks,

798
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:03,333
documents and the like,
which they confiscated during a search

799
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,068
conducted that day.

800
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,904
They plan to summon
other parties involved.

801
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:12,242
Baeksong Foundation was found to have
received tens of millions of won

802
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,912
from 32 financial institutions
and corporations.

803
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,282
Attention has also turned on
past Korean President

804
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,785
Tae-joon Jang, the true owner

805
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,753
of Baeksong Foundation.

806
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:26,890
Baeksong Foundation is an educational
and cultural foundation

807
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:30,360
which ex-President Tae-joon Jang
established with his personal assets,

808
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:33,029
but it had been criticized
as being a scholarship foundation

809
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:34,531
in name only.

810
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,133
Meanwhile, Baeksong Foundation

811
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:40,036
states this matter is unrelated
to ex-President Jang...

812
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:52,849
Yi-kyung Seo speaking.

813
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,117
This is Baeksong Foundation.

814
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:06,796
Please come in.

815
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,276
Have a seat.

816
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,925
Mr. Nam went to the prosecutor.

817
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,361
When he's away,

818
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,364
nothing gets done right.

819
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,667
I was thinking about this and that,

820
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,371
and I remembered what you said.

821
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:54,644
You can make me the king's father?

822
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,049
Did you say you had a plan
to fill my safe?

823
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:10,960
Okay.

824
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:13,530
Why don't I listen to your story

825
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:15,565
to pass the time?

826
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:18,468
First, I have a condition.

827
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:20,870
A condition?

828
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,173
You do the politics. In exchange,

829
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:25,442
I'll handle

830
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:27,377
everything else.

831
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:32,916
If I give you everything,

832
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,420
I'll be a king's father without any power.

833
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:39,956
I'll guarantee your power and wealth

834
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,425
until the day you die.

835
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,962
If you can't trust me,

836
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,966
there is no need to even begin talking.

837
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,971
Don't betray me.

838
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:58,641
If you do,

839
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:02,479
you'll regret it even in the afterlife.

840
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,180
I hope you will also refrain

841
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,883
from doing something you'll regret.

842
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,052
So,

843
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,421
how do you plan

844
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,524
to fill my safe?

845
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:18,495
Once the investigation is finished,
Baeksong will be in shambles.

846
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:23,099
You need a new foundation
to move your funds.

847
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,704
-And?
-There is something we must do

848
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:31,007
prior to establishing the foundation.

849
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,376
Moojin Group.

850
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,012
I will pull Chairman Moo-il Park
from the chairman's seat.

851
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,255
Any updates from Tae-joon?

852
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:46,322
No.

853
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,925
The foundation is ruined

854
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:50,927
and his right-hand man was arrested.

855
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:54,330
We should've heard him croak by now.

856
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:55,665
Don't worry about it.

857
00:58:58,268 --> 00:58:59,168
Gun-woo.

858
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:02,805
-Yes?
-Your uncle

859
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:05,275
may be greedy,

860
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,411
but he wouldn't betray his own brother.

861
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:13,082
Don't fall for that punk Tae-joon's antics

862
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:15,919
and cause useless problems.

863
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,420
I'll handle it.

864
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,523
You need to be strong in times like these.

865
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,294
You should finish eating.

866
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,030
The next chairman is Moo-sam Park.

867
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,832
Moojin Group will become

868
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,202
yours and mine.

869
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,438
With your brain

870
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:37,640
and my power,

871
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,011
you want to take it from Moo-il.

872
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:43,713
I'm merely reclaiming what was mine.

873
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,976
