1
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,328
What a shame.

2
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,897
You liked that dress.

3
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,833
You knew it from the start, right?

4
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,636
You sent me there

5
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,072
knowing what will happen.

6
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,009
So, how did it feel to be me?

7
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,714
You'll catch a cold.

8
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,103
Emotions are just like money.
Use it sparingly.

9
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,688
MONEY, POWER

10
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,260
COLLUSION BETWEEN POLITICIANS
AND CORPORATIONS

11
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:44,430
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY

12
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,677
ONE WEEK AGO

13
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:10,623
WELCOMING AUTUMN CHARITY AUCTION

14
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,778
The auction will begin in five minutes.

15
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,714
Did you check the guest list?

16
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,417
Yes. Every director who was invited

17
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,685
is in attendance.

18
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:40,987
As expected,

19
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,289
the scent of money spreads quickly.

20
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,258
Everyone is waiting for you.

21
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,994
I've waited a year to get here.

22
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,232
They can wait 13 minutes.

23
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,772
EPISODE 1

24
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,941
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

25
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:06,980
Thank you.

26
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,785
Thank you, Chairwoman. Thank you.

27
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,222
Chairman Song.

28
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,358
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

29
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,759
Thank you for coming.

30
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,227
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

31
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,195
Thank you.

32
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,900
Thank you, Chairman.

33
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,812
Thank you for coming, Chairman.

34
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,516
Ms. Seo.

35
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:44,817
Did you go to Paris?

36
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,920
That necklace hasn't come to Korea yet.

37
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,522
Dad, send me to Paris.

38
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,823
-Please?
-Keep it down.

39
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,958
You're crazy.

40
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,360
You've just been to Hong Kong
and bought up everything.

41
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,897
If you want to help the poor,
you should just give them cash.

42
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,333
What is this nuisance?

43
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,234
President Son.

44
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,537
Making connections is also
a part of my business.

45
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,306
If you'll excuse me.

46
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,979
I can't stand her.

47
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,114
She thinks she is something.

48
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,984
The problem is,
I don't know what she's trying to become.

49
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:19,886
Pardon?

50
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,190
She grew the company exponentially
within a year of returning to Korea.

51
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,493
The available funds multiplied, too.

52
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,030
At this rate, she'll be on top of us.

53
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,333
Still, she's just a young girl.

54
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,469
Silence. You blew 12 billion won
from the association's slush fund.

55
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,905
Why are you bringing that up now?

56
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,674
Put the money back
before other member companies notice.

57
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,610
That fool.

58
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,179
Hey. That hurts.

59
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,914
Hey! Let go. Let go of me.

60
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:49,816
Are you insane?

61
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,184
How dare you come here?

62
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,586
I'm not here for you.
My dad sent me in his place--

63
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,921
Hey, Hong-suk Kim.

64
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,923
Let's be cool about this.

65
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,826
No matter how much you beg,
I won't go back to you.

66
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,860
Hong-suk.

67
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,762
Hi, Honey.

68
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,398
Who is she?

69
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,299
Well...

70
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,533
Just someone I know.

71
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,634
Don't mind her.

72
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,303
What?

73
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,474
What happened to your tie?
Clean-cut is the best look for you.

74
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,809
Like that'll help.

75
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,246
-Pardon?
-He's such a loser.

76
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:21,781
How do I know?

77
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,716
I played with him until a month ago.

78
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,355
So?

79
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:30,523
What?

80
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,992
Are you sad
you can't play with him anymore?

81
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,329
If you have any respect
for your ex-boyfriend,

82
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,431
you should keep it shut
when someone is being sincere.

83
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,333
-Hey.
-Don't talk down to me...

84
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,170
unless you want a good slap.

85
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,207
Honey, let's go in.

86
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,642
Okay. Let's go.

87
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,484
Hey. It's been a while.

88
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,454
-Hey, Sa-won.
-Hong-suk.

89
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,488
How have you been?

90
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:03,890
-How have you been?
-Well.

91
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:04,891
It's been so long.

92
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,697
You've got skills.

93
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,800
You've got guts, too.

94
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,967
Ma-ri is here too.

95
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,036
I know. I just saw her.

96
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,204
-You did?
-Awesome.

97
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,310
What is it?

98
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:25,978
Do you know me?

99
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:27,780
I know that dress,

100
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,616
since it's Gyung-ja Park's piece.

101
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,386
I liked it too,

102
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,989
but I had to give up because the wife
of Namdong Group's chairman reserved it.

103
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,660
You're quite young for a chairman's wife.

104
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,797
You must've confused it
for a similar dress.

105
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:48,734
No.

106
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,270
I never forget something I once wanted,

107
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,273
whether they are clothes or people.

108
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:58,845
I said it isn't,

109
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,147
but you won't believe me.

110
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:02,949
Don't worry.

111
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,151
I won't call the boutique to check.

112
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,454
We're ready.

113
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,562
It fits well. It looks good on you.

114
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:25,505
Do you know her?

115
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,708
She's the CEO of this gallery

116
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,942
who's hosting the auction.

117
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,344
My father said

118
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,045
she's incredibly impressive.

119
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,185
The real auction will be started
after the one for donations' done.

120
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,087
The pieces with marks on them

121
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,257
will be sold at prices
significantly below its value.

122
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:45,925
Even if I win the bidding

123
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,027
with 100 million won,
I only need to pay ten million won?

124
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,329
We'll make sure there are no problems.

125
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,299
What a nice gift.

126
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,301
No, it's a bribe.

127
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,705
I know how hard
Korean-Japanese businessmen

128
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,842
like yourselves worked to blaze a trail

129
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:03,943
for the Korean market.

130
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,446
We are grateful that you'd accept
Gallery S, a latecomer,

131
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,415
-into your--
-Look.

132
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,050
Ms. Seo.

133
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,319
We haven't decided anything yet.

134
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,456
We've transferred the membership fee

135
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,458
in forms of cash and bond.

136
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,727
Ever since our company
started doing business in Korea,

137
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,796
our performance during the past year
has been stellar,

138
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,432
exceeding the membership criteria
of the association.

139
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,701
You're missing something.

140
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,971
What is Chairman Seo's position?

141
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,309
I understand he is still opposed
to entering the Korean market.

142
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,644
I am the CEO of the Korean entity.

143
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,847
Have you heard about
riding on someone else's coattails?

144
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,584
He has no intention of coming,

145
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,552
but you're tugging hard at his coattails.

146
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,522
Wake up, Ms. Seo.

147
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,924
If not for your father,
Chairman Bong-soo Seo,

148
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,659
-you'd be nothing here.
-Sir.

149
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,127
Get Chairman Seo's consent first.

150
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,897
Otherwise, forget joining the association

151
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,099
and you'll have to close
your business in Korea.

152
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,240
Where's Ma-ri?

153
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,842
She's going to hang out with her friends.

154
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,278
I'll see you at the general meeting.

155
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,147
I'll show you
my father's signature then as well.

156
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,586
I picked a few of the artwork.
Send them to me separately.

157
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,798
Don't worry too much.

158
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,534
If we convince
the other members one by one...

159
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,204
They're all Chairman Son's yes-men.

160
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,573
They'll just go with the flow.

161
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,743
What can we do?
He doesn't want the carrot.

162
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,045
We'll have to use the stick.

163
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,581
Are there any other bids?

164
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,449
-Five hundred.
-We have 500 thousand won.

165
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,917
Five hundred thousand?

166
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,220
-Five hundred and fifty.
-Okay, 550 thousand won.

167
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,822
-Okay, we have 550 thousand won.
-Six hundred thousand.

168
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,457
We have 600 thousand won.

169
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,027
Do we have any more bidders?

170
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,063
Going once, going twice,

171
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,231
sold!

172
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,148
It was handcrafted
by a master craftsman in Kyoto.

173
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,117
It's something Hong-suk

174
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,386
was going to give
to his previous girlfriend.

175
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,487
I was?

176
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,558
But I lucked out instead.

177
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,628
Since he bought it with love,

178
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,163
I want to make sure to win it.

179
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,664
Okay.

180
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,866
This is a handcrafted mirror

181
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,369
created by a Japanese craftsman.

182
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,905
Where should we start the bidding?

183
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,709
-I bid one million won.
-We have one million won.

184
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,344
-I bid 1.1 million won.
-We have 1.1 million won.

185
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,447
-I bid 1.2 million won.
-We have 1.2 million won.

186
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,349
The donor really wants it back.

187
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,051
-I bid 1.5 million won.
-It keeps going up.

188
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,820
We're at 1.5 million won.

189
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,223
-I bid two million won.
-We have two million won.

190
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,624
We'll let you bid freely from now.

191
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,194
The current bid is two million won.

192
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,395
What are you doing?

193
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,297
I'll get out before it's too late,

194
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,299
but only after I screw her over.

195
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,067
Three million.

196
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,569
Wow. Three million won.

197
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,670
Three million?

198
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,907
It jumps to three million won.

199
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,211
I'm shocked. Okay. Three million won.

200
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,946
-If that's all--
-Four million.

201
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,547
I will...

202
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,715
Four million?

203
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,417
Four million won?

204
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,351
You've got nothing.

205
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,353
Do we have any more bidders?

206
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,922
-Five million!
-Five million won?

207
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,793
We have five million won. I'm shocked!

208
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,562
Do we have any more bidders?
Would you like to raise?

209
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,231
Would you like to raise?

210
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,868
I can't go any higher.

211
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,870
Then I'll start the count.

212
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,840
Going once, going twice,

213
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:55,908
sold!

214
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,484
It was sold at an incredible price.

215
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,786
Congratulations!

216
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,594
Hey!

217
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,830
Tell me the truth.

218
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,366
How much is this worth?

219
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,735
You'll want to die if you knew.

220
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,136
Do you know who I am?

221
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,877
A spoiled brat who thinks
that she's entitled to the world.

222
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,946
Hey, do you want to die?

223
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,887
Gosh.

224
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,492
My five million won...

225
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,495
Oh no. What have I done?

226
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,065
Damn it.

227
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,523
She must be upset.

228
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,225
She paid a lot for that.

229
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:20,893
It's cheap.

230
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,995
I got it for 5,000 won in Dongdaemun.

231
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,664
If you're acting like his girlfriend,
you should act until the end.

232
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,099
You lack responsibility.

233
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:31,937
But I liked how you sparked her jealousy
and dragged her into the auction.

234
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,907
Thank you for the appreciation,

235
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,643
but my gig ended five minutes ago.

236
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,679
I fulfilled my obligations
to the extent I was paid.

237
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,449
Would that even pay the fee
for renting the dress?

238
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,119
You should do the calculations
before doing a job.

239
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,057
I feel like you've been following me.

240
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,461
I'd like you to mind your own business.

241
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,633
I don't think it's a coincidence
that we met.

242
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,004
Call me if you're interested.
I'll pay handsomely.

243
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,209
What's the job?

244
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,245
It has to do with her.

245
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:15,881
No thanks.

246
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,151
I don't extend a job I've already taken.

247
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:20,986
That's my rule.

248
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,755
Okay, then.

249
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:24,823
Excuse me.

250
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,394
Thank you for helping me...

251
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,162
during the auction.

252
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,739
YI-KYUNG SEO, CEO

253
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,479
Mister.

254
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,148
It's nothing like that.

255
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,250
Please keep walking.

256
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,592
Hey, I can drive you home.

257
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,694
I can take the subway.

258
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,995
But it's late.

259
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,597
-Hong-suk.
-Yes?

260
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,835
Save those sweet gestures
for your girlfriend.

261
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,639
I was only working for pay.

262
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,109
I know.

263
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,520
-Don't be discouraged.
-What?

264
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,490
You'll meet someone much better
than that spoiled brat.

265
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,492
Good luck!

266
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:34,994
Thanks!

267
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,665
GYUNG-JA PARK COLLECTION

268
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,642
-Hyun-ah!
-Hey!

269
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,711
-I'm so sorry.
-Seriously.

270
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,447
-You're putting me on a bad spot.
-It's spotless.

271
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,915
Do you know how much this costs?

272
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,051
-Don't look.
-Come on.

273
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,619
It's clean, right?

274
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,121
Just this once.

275
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,989
-Just this once.
-Whatever. I'm sick of it.

276
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,424
I have to get back to work. Go.

277
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,959
-Thanks.
-Bye.

278
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:07,860
Thanks.

279
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,641
I have only two arms,
but there were twelve clients waiting.

280
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,110
They had soaked nicely,

281
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,479
so I scrubbed them clean.

282
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,983
We have
a future Olympic body scrubber here.

283
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,620
Auntie, don't worry
about this month's bills.

284
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,456
I have enough
for Song-mi's prep class, too.

285
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,092
How?

286
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,295
Here.

287
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,972
-Suk's mom called earlier.
-Why?

288
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,641
I told you before.

289
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,610
She said she's raising rent next month

290
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,179
when our lease is up.

291
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,583
-Goodness.
-By how much?

292
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,385
I didn't ask.

293
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,387
We have no money anyway,
so why bother asking?

294
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,625
Gosh, where did the bottle opener go?

295
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,143
This is the best painkiller.

296
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,446
Song-mi. Come have a beer.

297
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,714
Don't! Keep studying!

298
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,150
Just wait.

299
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,718
I'll make the money somehow.

300
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,154
Please don't.
What scam do you plan to pull this time?

301
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,657
-You'll get arrested.
-It isn't like that.

302
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,494
I can ask my boss for an advance.

303
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,797
Advance, my butt.

304
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,033
When will you ever get
the backpay he owes you?

305
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,404
Anyway, I'll get you the money.

306
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,751
GOLF, FITNESS, YOGA

307
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,488
He took all the membership fees
and took off!

308
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,723
OUT OF BUSINESS

309
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,192
I paid for six months. What do I do now?

310
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,462
-Don't you work here?
-What?

311
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,796
Where's your boss?

312
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:25,898
Where's your boss?

313
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,333
Let go! He owes me
two months' worth of salary!

314
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,905
-Boss, Boss!
-What is this? Come on!

315
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,578
Are you sure you want to go alone?

316
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,281
You may get turned away at the door.

317
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,583
Forget everything else.

318
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,118
Look into this first.

319
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,158
LIST OF PROPERTY

320
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,428
Gi-tae Son, the company president?

321
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,965
Incompetence plus greed
will always result in trouble.

322
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,601
Dig into Gi-tae Son or Ma-ri Son.

323
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,536
You'll find something from them.

324
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,704
I'll have it done.

325
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,344
Moojin Group's Chairman Moo-il Park
Subpoenaed by the Prosecutor

326
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,356
Moojin Group's Chairman Moo-il Park,

327
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,492
who was arrested
for embezzlement and dereliction of duty

328
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,394
will face trial next month.

329
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,729
Moojin Group states

330
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:34,199
they expect the court to be magnanimous,

331
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,767
but legal experts state

332
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,337
Chairman Park will most likely

333
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,006
be unable to avoid serving time in prison.

334
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:44,876
From 2012 to 2016,
Chairman Park Moo-il had...

335
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,254
Is the chairman still the same?

336
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,358
There is no way to lobby at all,

337
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,160
but Father doesn't have an ounce of desire
to raise the white flag.

338
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,663
I'm at a loss.

339
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,298
I heard that Mr. Moo-sam Park

340
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,568
has plans to meet
Daesung Daily's editor-in-chief.

341
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,071
If he gets the public worked up
about the chairman's release--

342
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,206
That's a bluff.

343
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,375
My uncle

344
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,244
has been contacting
the presidents of affiliate companies.

345
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,947
He's pretending to be
a good little brother

346
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,016
while laying down his groundwork.

347
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,318
Once Father's imprisonment is confirmed,

348
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,920
he needs to grab the reigns for the group.

349
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,523
You know that too.

350
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,960
Uncle's been drooling over the group
for years now.

351
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,797
I didn't know the fight for successorship
would begin so soon.

352
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,132
No.

353
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,268
I won't fight my uncle.

354
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,038
With his age and health,

355
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,674
he won't last three years in prison.

356
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,009
I'll get Father out

357
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,978
before the trial is over.

358
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,581
Then you'll have to give up the business

359
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,050
in Dubai.

360
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,195
I can give it up, but my father can't,

361
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,031
because my late second uncle
is the one who set up

362
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,834
Moojin Group's Middle Eastern base.

363
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,773
You suffered a lot then too, didn't you?

364
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,009
Working under my workaholic uncle.

365
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,044
Between Iraq and Dubai...

366
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,147
It was a long time ago.

367
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,819
When I ran away to study abroad,

368
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,887
my second uncle said,

369
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,123
"Do everything you want

370
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,292
to your heart's content."

371
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,131
I may have

372
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,901
stayed there forever and never returned.

373
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:36,041
He wants you to go back.
He doesn't want to see you.

374
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,943
Tell him I'll wait.

375
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,010
Miss.

376
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,721
Get out

377
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,590
of my house.

378
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,060
Get out,

379
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,763
now!

380
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,201
Calm down. Please calm down.

381
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,502
Get out.

382
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,809
He was discharged a month ago.

383
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:46,912
He said he'd get his infusions

384
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,781
and do rehab at home.

385
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,352
I wanted to call you, but--

386
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,288
I'm sure he said not to.

387
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,157
After you left,

388
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,227
he worked day and night,
as if he were possessed.

389
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,463
Even on the day he collapsed,

390
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,332
he said that he had a score
to settle, and then...

391
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,637
I know who that is.

392
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,491
If you want to get money from me,
Woo-yang Kim,

393
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:35,794
you need guts.

394
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,529
Guts.

395
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,902
The probability is one out of six.

396
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,705
The first person to give in
loses the money.

397
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,544
That old man didn't last long.

398
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,614
Let's see if his daughter is any better.

399
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,364
Let's change the rule.

400
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,399
Let's not...

401
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,801
spin the barrel. Just pull the trigger.

402
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,104
That way, it'll end sooner.

403
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,607
You want to show off?

404
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:40,992
There are three left.

405
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,328
You can give up...

406
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,233
There are two left now.

407
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,157
What are you doing?

408
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,492
That's the last one. It's the bullet.

409
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,228
The first one to give up loses.

410
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:18,530
That's the rule.

411
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,465
Don't be cocky. Do you want to die?

412
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,250
Is this how you fooled my father?

413
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:41,419
Hey.

414
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,324
You must be honest and humble
before money.

415
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,828
That's what my father taught me.

416
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,832
Let's do it for real this time,

417
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,500
without any tricks.

418
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,169
Are you crazy? Stop...

419
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,608
Your turn.

420
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:06,878
What are you?

421
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,713
I'm here for the money you borrowed.

422
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,382
Putting your life on the line
just for little money.

423
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,252
Is that what your dad taught you?

424
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,526
Not at all.

425
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,462
It is worth much more than my life.

426
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,165
A god you can see.

427
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,367
That is what money is.

428
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,171
Even a penny has a god residing in it.

429
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,776
Every coin

430
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,111
is a god and a life.

431
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,748
You didn't lose 100 yen on the street.

432
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,183
You lost your mind.

433
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,584
I can't let my daughter

434
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,753
be that absent-minded.

435
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,155
Father.

436
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,056
They are 100 one-yen coins.

437
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,559
Find every single one.

438
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,243
Why...

439
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,718
did you come here?

440
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:28,887
To get some air.

441
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,122
What about those punks?

442
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:34,926
I haven't

443
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,228
met them yet.

444
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,030
Give up.

445
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,368
You are...

446
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,871
no match for them.

447
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,539
I never said I'd fight.

448
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,675
It's just business.

449
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,081
I raised you wrong.

450
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:00,885
You should've had

451
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,422
that regret 30 years ago.

452
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,858
Don't come back.

453
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,030
I don't want you...

454
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,334
to see me like this.

455
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,437
Shake it off and get up.
Then I won't come.

456
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,441
I know you.

457
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,078
I know you don't waste time
to get some air.

458
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,815
Why are you really here?

459
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,155
That is everything
on Gi-tae Son's personal account.

460
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,857
It was hard to find anything else.

461
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,960
I'm sure he is using an alias.
I expected as such.

462
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,829
You have a guest downstairs.

463
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,331
Are you going to ask her to do that?

464
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,569
Well, how should I say it?

465
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,672
I mean, I don't think it's something
for an amateur.

466
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,241
You got the equipment for the job, right?

467
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,410
-Yes.
-Then Ms. Kim,

468
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,012
you shouldn't be here.

469
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,181
I see. You're right. Okay.

470
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,996
He's using names of friends and relatives

471
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,164
to gather black money.

472
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,501
Many innocent people
may fall victim to this.

473
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,002
So,

474
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,071
Ma-ri Son, that annoying...

475
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,374
Anyway, you need her cell phone, right?

476
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,310
In order to find proof
that her father embezzled funds.

477
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,112
I'm not asking you to steal it or take it.

478
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,849
It'll take about five minutes
to copy her phone.

479
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,751
We'll handle the rest.

480
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,755
May I ask how much you'll pay me?

481
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:18,823
One million won?

482
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,095
That's quite generous
for five minutes of work.

483
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,964
I want double. Two million.

484
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,902
I'm taking on all the risk.

485
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,671
If I'm unlucky, she may think I'm a thief.

486
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,707
You should give me that much.

487
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,745
Let's make it three million.

488
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,588
Would that be enough
to tie all loose ends?

489
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,359
Sounds good to me,
but are you sure about that?

490
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,629
You said you should
do the calculations first when working.

491
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,031
I'll do the calculations.

492
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,967
You should just do what we ask.

493
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,471
Seeing how you came breaking your rule,

494
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,406
you must be in a tight spot.

495
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,609
Without money and connections,
it's a daily routine.

496
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,212
You wouldn't know that, would you?

497
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,713
I'm not any different from you.

498
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,683
My heart is desperate,

499
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,819
but I don't have as much as I need.

500
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,124
Shall we each

501
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,426
get what we want?

502
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,244
This universal key unlocks any lock.

503
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,647
-And this--
-Please.

504
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,149
I heard you the first time.

505
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,784
I'm smart enough to remember them
after hearing just once.

506
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,586
It's so that you don't make mistakes.

507
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,988
I heard that too.

508
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:10,201
I heard the aestheticians
have the hands of god.

509
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,171
We don't accept regular clients,

510
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:16,674
but we made an exception
since you're Ms. Ma-ri Son's friend.

511
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,177
She just came.

512
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,478
-She's here?
-Yes.

513
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,246
She just went in for her facial.

514
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,750
I'm going to scare her.

515
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,687
Where's her locker?
I want to use the one next to hers.

516
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:25,843
Beautiful.

517
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,980
Can we check the transactions with this?

518
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,915
Once we finish copying it,
we can check at any time.

519
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,985
Ma-ri's phone is now has a twin.

520
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,388
She's pretty useful.

521
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,424
Hold on.

522
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,426
I'm expecting a call.

523
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:43,628
I'll get it for you.

524
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,030
I have credit cards and cash
in my bag too.

525
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,513
Would you get me some jasmine tea?

526
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,023
Shit.

527
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,759
Hey.

528
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:18,663
Would you please move?

529
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,867
Damn it.

530
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,202
I told you to move.

531
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:34,578
What?

532
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,147
You?

533
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,015
You are that mirror...

534
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,059
Damn it.

535
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,563
What are you doing? Get her!

536
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,765
God!

537
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,181
Oh no.

538
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,117
Oh no.

539
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:14,952
Gosh.

540
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,858
Damn it.

541
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,861
-Hey.
-Hey.

542
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,363
Get over here.

543
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,666
Get over here. Now.

544
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,038
-Hey.
-What?

545
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,174
Who are you?

546
00:39:58,929 --> 00:39:59,797
What are you doing?

547
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,832
Do you plan to wait until they wake up?

548
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,338
Three million won,
fresh from the press. Count it.

549
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,240
Thank you.

550
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:14,545
In this day and age, a few clicks are
all you need for a wire transfer.

551
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,915
You are more old-school than you look.

552
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,250
I just prefer cash.

553
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,189
By the way, where is Ms. Seo?

554
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,358
She's always busy.

555
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,061
Right, she wants to thank you

556
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,063
for the job well done.

557
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,498
I see.

558
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:10,434
It's a shame what happened
to Chairman Park.

559
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,472
No one contributed to the Korean economy
as much as he did.

560
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,142
This is all
because of that wretched politics.

561
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,344
The group is trying to pull strings,

562
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,012
but it is not going well.

563
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,215
The only option we have left...

564
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,320
is to go see Mr. Jang...

565
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,095
Our young company president
has a good appetite.

566
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,165
You should eat.
The abalone is nice and fresh.

567
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,100
This place is good.

568
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,304
And I'm not the president.
I'm just a team manager.

569
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,706
Special Planning Team.

570
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,274
Gun-woo.

571
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:04,989
Excuse me.

572
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,892
I have a guest waiting for me
in another room. I'll be right back.

573
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:10,461
Of course. Go ahead. You're so busy.

574
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:28,679
Please have a seat.

575
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,215
I had to be rude to important guests
to come here.

576
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,483
Make it brief.

577
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,853
I don't know who they are,
but they'll have to wait.

578
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:41,625
It isn't something you'd want
to hear while standing up.

579
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,795
What the hell are you doing?

580
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,772
Well, why did you call me here?

581
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,075
Chunha Financing's Eu-sung Son.

582
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,345
I know he plays dirty in his industry.

583
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,747
It's the only way to get Moo-il out.

584
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:06,050
We have to be on Mr. Jang's side.

585
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,585
That's a bad call.

586
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,589
You can try as much as you'd like,
but it'll be useless.

587
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,991
You punk. At one time, they used to be--

588
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,726
Yes, they were friends.

589
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:20,030
A fine specimen of collusion
disguised as friendship.

590
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,368
But that beautiful friendship
cracked a long time ago.

591
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,871
Even if Mr. Son reaches out,

592
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,274
Father will turn him away.

593
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,609
Well, what's your idea?

594
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,912
You're his son and the manager
of Special Planning Team.

595
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,580
What have you been doing?

596
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,818
Whatever I do, I'll do it my way.

597
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,388
Colluding with the likes of him
is something I will not do.

598
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,958
Don't act like you're so clean,
you hypocrite.

599
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,127
You won't get far by drawing lines.

600
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:54,064
Is that why you're so busy
turning people to your side?

601
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,435
You're meeting the presidents
of every affiliate we have.

602
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,205
Who said that? Who?

603
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,376
You must be worked up.
Your accent is coming out.

604
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,344
You punk. I don't know what you've heard,

605
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,345
but that's a slander.

606
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:12,583
Anyway, stop trying to save him
when you don't want to.

607
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,052
I'll get Father out myself.

608
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:17,921
Right,

609
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:19,757
you have to try the abalone.

610
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,225
It's pretty good.

611
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:23,193
Hey, Gun-woo!

612
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:28,599
VERIFICATION OF TRANSACTION
ACCOUNT NAME: MA-RI SON, PAYER: GI-TAE SON

613
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:38,275
Gi-tae Son siphoned 5.2 billion won
into his daughter's bank account.

614
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:40,744
There's a good chance

615
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:43,514
more of the association's funds
are in other people's accounts.

616
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,315
My guess

617
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,285
would be at least ten billion won.

618
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,626
So?

619
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,960
You already knew.

620
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,763
That's what I thought.

621
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,300
I heard you went to Japan.

622
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,938
You didn't get your father's consent
or signature, did you?

623
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,477
When someone is cornered,
they end up playing tricks.

624
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:17,214
If you've been tracking down
my granddaughter's bank account,

625
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,450
you must have been desperate.

626
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:20,884
Am I right?

627
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,354
I learned a saying from you.

628
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:29,026
"Riding on someone's coattails." Right?

629
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,296
The son sold the entire coat

630
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,965
and the father pretended not to know.

631
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:36,700
Would

632
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,036
the other member companies

633
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,038
sit still?

634
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,675
Next week,

635
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,812
you will make a generous gesture
at the association meeting.

636
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,248
Thanks to that decision,

637
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,884
Gallery S will become
an official member of the association.

638
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,319
Then,

639
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:59,156
that document will be good as gone.

640
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,203
This piece of paper?

641
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,906
It's useless.

642
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,342
Who do you think

643
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,178
people will believe?

644
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:29,052
Mr. Gi-tae Son is the one
who drilled a hole in the gas tank.

645
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,322
This document is nothing but a match.

646
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:37,227
But once I ignite suspicion in people,

647
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,131
even you won't be able to

648
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,433
quench that fire.

649
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,805
Will you be burned to ashes,

650
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:49,573
or not?

651
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,278
The choice is yours.

652
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,730
What did Chairman Son say?

653
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,833
He just started the exam.

654
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,370
It'll take some time
to fill out his answer.

655
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,645
What's wrong?

656
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,480
Nothing.

657
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,050
I grew up watching you.

658
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,620
I could tell how my father felt

659
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,855
based on your facial expressions.

660
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:14,958
What is it?

661
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,629
I saw Gun-woo Park.

662
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:23,133
He left right as you were coming out.

663
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,604
We are in Seoul, Korea.

664
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:32,476
It isn't strange to run into him
at anytime, anywhere.

665
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,931
Dang it.

666
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,768
Why did you have to break again?

667
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:38,809
Here.

668
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,233
Hey...

669
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,239
That's more than just one yen coin.

670
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:12,642
When I was a kid,

671
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,546
it was the first coin I got
that had meaning to it.

672
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,015
It's like a lucky charm for me.

673
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:23,820
That's how important it is.

674
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:27,224
I suddenly feel motivated.

675
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,761
Your coin and a song I write.

676
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:32,396
Doesn't that sound good?

677
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,865
I'll practice
and play it for you properly.

678
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,367
So let me borrow this coin until then.

679
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:09,733
KOREA-JAPAN CO-OP NIGHT
1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS

680
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,221
BONG-SOO SEO, TAE-JOON JANG, MOO-IL PARK

681
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,768
Hey, you're still a growing girl.
Why aren't you eating up?

682
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:45,836
Eat up like a boar.

683
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,704
Come on, I need to lose weight.

684
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,341
You need energy to study.
Lose weight in college.

685
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,146
Auntie. Is someone chasing you?

686
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,014
You'll get sick.

687
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,716
I need to hurry up
and get to the bathhouse.

688
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,051
I'm filling in for Hyun-ji's mom.

689
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,252
I thought you were off today.

690
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,988
Even I have a conscience.

691
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:08,191
If I gladly accepted money my niece made
by scamming people,

692
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:09,960
how would my sister
and brother-in-law feel?

693
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,495
I didn't scam anyone.

694
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:15,732
Why do you always bring up my parents?

695
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:19,102
Hello?

696
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:43,093
Ms. Seo, what brings you here?

697
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,595
Am I ruining your day off?

698
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,465
No. I'm unemployed.

699
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,067
That's a good news to me. Get in.

700
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,608
The season has changed,
but my closet hasn't.

701
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,445
I'm quick to make business decisions,
but have no talent in shopping.

702
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,649
So I wanted to borrow your sense of style.

703
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,987
I've never heard anyone say
I have poor taste in clothes,

704
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,525
but I don't think
I can match up to your class.

705
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,628
That's not what I saw at the auction.

706
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,967
There aren't many who can choose a dress
like that and look good in it.

707
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,137
It's still someone else's dress.

708
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:32,008
But wouldn't it be better
to shop with a friend?

709
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:46,156
You can be my friend for a day.

710
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:48,425
Will you?

711
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:07,143
This is pretty.

712
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:08,812
How's this?

713
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:09,913
This is pretty too.

714
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:17,854
What do you think?

715
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:21,558
The buttons...

716
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:36,039
-Oh my gosh.
-What do you think? Is it okay?

717
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:37,107
It looks great.

718
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:38,875
Gosh.

719
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,442
Sorry for making you carry my things.

720
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,145
Not at all.

721
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:17,947
You bought me some outfits too.
This is nothing.

722
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,784
Your real present is here.

723
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:22,752
Open the closet.

724
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:44,607
The wife of Namdong Group's chairman

725
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:46,109
is apparently very fickle.

726
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,411
Thanks to that,
we found the dress's true owner.

727
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:51,548
I see...

728
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,684
But this is too much.

729
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,854
I can't wear something that costs more
than my several months' salary.

730
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:01,224
If it's too much as a gift,
you can accept it as payment.

731
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:03,259
Excuse me?

732
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:07,130
I'm supposed to meet an art dealer
from Taiwan tomorrow,

733
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:12,268
but I can't make it
because of another important meeting.

734
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,738
They're pieces I don't want to lose.

735
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:16,673
Then...

736
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,708
For just one hour,

737
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,344
I want you to be me, Se-jin.

738
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:28,284
I'd like to send an employee,
but they said I must be there.

739
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:34,224
I can't speak Chinese.

740
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:36,826
They'll bring an interpreter.

741
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:38,395
We haven't met anyway.

742
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:41,364
Once you exchange business cards,
just take the artwork.

743
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,201
Still, this is...

744
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:47,570
Okay.

745
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,639
You don't have to do it
if it doesn't feel right.

746
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,274
No, that's not it.

747
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,213
Can I

748
00:56:58,281 --> 00:56:59,416
really act

749
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:01,418
like you?

750
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,756
That's not something I should answer.

751
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,133
Ask yourself, Se-jin.

752
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:19,536
Even if it's very brief,

753
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:24,674
even if it's a lie,

754
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,976
do you want to be like me?

755
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:53,169
Hello.

756
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:01,845
Father.

757
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,149
The Feng Brothers are ready.

758
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:07,484
They're meeting at 2 p.m.

759
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,988
Tell our men to stay out of it.

760
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,424
This must not be traced back to us.

761
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:17,727
If it gets linked to us,
it'll be a headache.

762
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:20,430
There should be no loose ends, right?

763
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,866
You shouldn't have embezzled
to begin with if you are that worried!

764
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,139
Yi-kyung Seo

765
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,242
won't make it to the meeting today.

766
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:48,258
We've prepared all the documents
for the general meeting.

767
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:54,631
Don't blame yourself too much
about Se-jin.

768
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,936
It's the only way
to catch Chairman Son off-guard.

769
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,742
Self-blame, regret, obsession.

770
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:08,511
Those feelings don't earn any money.

771
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,115
Now then,

772
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,951
let's go do something that's worth money.

773
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,313
FUTURE PROGRESS
ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATIONS

774
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,953
Are you Miss...

775
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:51,621
Yes.

776
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,458
I am Yi-kyung Seo.

777
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:22,285
Your double who went to the hotel
is in my custody.

778
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,320
I sent her knowing it was a trap.

779
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:25,989
She played her part,

780
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:27,957
so it's up to her to figure out the rest.

781
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:32,762
It was my mistake
for wanting to be like you...

782
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,499
If you shut down the business in Dubai,
it'll be fatal to the group.

783
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:39,202
He's the chairman's only son.
He won't be an easy foe.

784
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,270
How will you get rid of him?

785
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,272
I'm giving you an opportunity.

786
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:45,308
An opportunity to live a real life,

787
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,377
rather than being a double.

788
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:48,311
No thank you.

789
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:52,615
Kneel and beg for forgiveness.
For being rude to me at the auction.

790
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:53,616
Get up.

791
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:01,124
