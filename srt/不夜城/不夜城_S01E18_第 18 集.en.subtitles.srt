EPISODE 18

2
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,511
Let's stop now.

3
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,048
We should give them the documents
and get out.

4
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:50,884
Don't do it.

5
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,156
Make deals, but don't compromise.

6
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,693
I must suppress the other.
I can't get on my knees.

7
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,399
You don't have to give in
to a scumbag like him.

8
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:11,337
I'll find a way out.

9
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,643
Se-jin.

10
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,116
The documents
on Collins Co. are in my car.

11
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:30,256
It's good to have them,
but it doesn't matter if I hand them over.

12
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:32,625
I came...

13
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,129
to hear you say what you said just now.

14
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,136
I can't reflect you,

15
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,973
and I can't be like you.

16
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,342
I get it now.

17
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,680
This is my limit.

18
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,920
That's why I came to get you.

19
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,698
Where do I go at the next intersection?

20
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:20,907
Found it.

21
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:22,475
Go straight.

22
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,045
-What about the next camera?
-Hold on.

23
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,515
If it were that easy,
why would I be going through this?

24
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,750
She should've told us the destination.

25
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,152
It's because of Se-jin.

26
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,656
If they noticed she had a tail,
Se-jin would've been in danger.

27
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,458
That's why she didn't tell us.

28
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:42,095
She trusted us, so we have to find her.

29
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,300
Right. Make a right.

30
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:13,626
Here you go.

31
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,198
COLLINS CO.
SHAREHOLDERS AND FINANCIAL STATUS

32
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,551
There's Mr. Kang.

33
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,553
Hello.

34
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,723
-I look forward to working with you.
-Same here.

35
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,391
-Good job.
-Thank you.

36
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,695
-I'll see you again.
-Okay, I'll do my best.

37
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,029
Mr. Jang.

38
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,136
Hi, Nam.

39
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,175
-It's great meeting you.
-I'll do my best.

40
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,210
Mr. Kang.

41
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,016
Let's talk in private.

42
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,586
The press conference is in ten minutes.

43
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,122
I said I wanted to talk now.

44
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,997
You'll stop them from selling my company?

45
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:29,269
I'm your political mentor, not Yi-kyung.

46
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,340
You don't need to let her manhandle you
any longer.

47
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,744
-Mr. Jang.
-Tomorrow.

48
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,014
Come to Seongbuk.

49
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,386
We'll have many things to discuss.

50
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,565
He may take the documents
and not let us go.

51
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,643
There's been a change in the deal.

52
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,614
You'll have to rest quietly

53
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,251
while Mr. Jang takes care
of some situations.

54
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,119
-That isn't what you promised.
-Se-jin.

55
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,658
Thank you, but I don't have the time
to take a vacation.

56
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,226
It's Mr. Jang's wishes.

57
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,562
You should do as he says.

58
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,707
-She hasn't been caught on camera?
-No.

59
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,777
If she passed that intersection
she should've been caught on camera,

60
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,412
but I don't see her car.

61
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,781
She must've turned the corner somewhere.

62
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,517
There are many side streets there.

63
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,053
I can't waste time roaming.

64
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,089
I don't see her.

65
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,491
She must've changed directions
before the intersection.

66
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,860
Hold on.

67
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,730
There's a gallery near there.

68
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:07,066
Baeksong Foundation put it up for sale,
but it hasn't been sold yet.

69
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,802
-Tak, did you hear that?
-Send me the address.

70
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,419
I'm sorry, ma'am.

71
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,056
Don't blame yourself and don't regret it.

72
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:34,827
Use that time to think about
what to do next, and what would be best.

73
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,532
Did you already think of a way to get out?

74
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,734
No.

75
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,036
Ma'am.

76
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,440
They will find a way for me.

77
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,642
Who will?

78
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,320
-I'm almost there.
-Be careful.

79
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,356
Ms. Seo and Se-jin's safety
is top priority.

80
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,291
Okay. Leave it to me.

81
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,554
Se-jin, drive.

82
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,724
-What about Tak?
-This is his job.

83
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,493
He'll get angry if we stall.

84
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,306
-Stop them!
-Damn it!

85
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,254
Will Tak be okay?

86
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,523
Go to the gallery.

87
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,658
Ma'am.

88
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,226
The gallery.

89
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,308
Ms. Seo. Are you okay?

90
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,710
Where's Tak?

91
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,747
-Well...
-What happened with the press conference?

92
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,016
There was no announcement
of Korea Works' sale.

93
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,286
Jae-hyun Kang hasn't said anything,
either.

94
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,123
I'll wait to see
if Tak is okay before I go.

95
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,525
Okay.

96
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,464
What happened?

97
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,836
She gave the documents
on Collins Co. to Mr. Jang.

98
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,638
What?

99
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,011
Tak is in the hospital.

100
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,684
This way.

101
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,120
-I'll go in first.
-Okay.

102
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,190
Room 1101.

103
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,738
Luckily, they say it isn't serious.

104
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,683
How did Tak end up working at the gallery?

105
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,297
I'll be back soon.

106
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,701
You said it was a test,
but I've been driving all day.

107
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,203
What are we delivering?

108
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:13,939
Do you want to know?

109
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,676
No need to tell me, if you don't want to.

110
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,452
It's all cash.

111
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,922
Wow. The boss has a lot of money.

112
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,625
Your job is to protect this money.

113
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:55,881
Gosh.

114
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,588
Gosh.

115
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,626
You two stay behind.
The rest of you, come with me.

116
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:08,661
Come with me.

117
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,375
Gosh.

118
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:46,198
So you left Mr. Jo behind and ran away?

119
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,633
Yes.

120
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,137
Sorry, but you failed.

121
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,874
-Am I fired?
-Of course.

122
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:59,345
You abandoned your colleague.
Did you think I'd hire you?

123
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,347
I did as I was ordered.

124
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:06,152
If you had said to protect Mr. Jo,
I would've fought until something broke.

125
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,054
But I was told my job
was to protect the cash.

126
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,323
So getting away from there
was the priority.

127
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,262
I'm not afraid of fighting,
but I don't fight anywhere for no reason.

128
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,405
-Sorry I'm late.
-Did you tell him

129
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,175
that his job was to protect the truck?

130
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:32,978
Yes.

131
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,715
-Tak, was it?
-That's right.

132
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:42,421
From now on, unless instructed otherwise,
your top priority is to protect me.

133
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,356
Can you do it?

134
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,793
Am I hired?

135
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:49,862
That's right.

136
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,082
-Ma'am.
-Stay down.

137
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,287
Are you okay? Se-jin, too?

138
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,394
You haven't been working out lately,
right? Because you've been busy?

139
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,264
It had nothing to do with working out.
I was outnumbered.

140
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,799
You said that last time.

141
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,035
-Stop getting beaten up.
-I'll be careful.

142
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,137
You'd better.

143
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,174
Shake it off and get up.
We have a lot of work to do.

144
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,609
I will.

145
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,430
I came because you said
you had something important to say.

146
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,534
I haven't grabbed a brush in a while.

147
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:08,741
My writing seems smooth and nice today.

148
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,212
-Mr. Jang.
-I don't do

149
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,415
what Yi-kyung says because I am powerless.

150
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,785
It's because it's good
to see someone so young work so hard.

151
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,089
So I was proud of her.

152
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,059
Is that right?

153
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:36,302
Now that we've created the new party,
your approval rating has been secured.

154
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,407
I'll have to do the elections my way, now.

155
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,410
And exclude Ms. Seo?

156
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,947
Put this away.

157
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,356
-Huh?
-How have you been?

158
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,225
Hello.

159
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:12,438
I'll have to feel out what Yi-kyung wants,

160
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:17,376
whether she'll follow me
or insist on her own way.

161
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:24,183
If by chance,
she and I go our separate ways,

162
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,889
with whom will you team up?

163
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,295
Work with Mr. Jang.

164
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:41,266
If Jae-hyun Kang didn't announce the sale,
it means Mr. Jang told him not to.

165
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,470
That means there was a problem
with Yi-kyung.

166
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,675
If we have to choose one,
Mr. Jang is a safer bet?

167
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,176
Even if she gets kicked out,

168
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,612
Mr. Jang and Jae-hyun Kang
have a strong connection already.

169
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,914
They can win the election on their own.

170
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,286
That is true,
but will Yi-kyung stand for that?

171
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,156
I'm just worried
we'll get caught in the crossfire.

172
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,724
I'll take care of Yi-kyung.

173
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:12,131
You in the light and I in the dark,
we will collect our profits.

174
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,934
Gun-woo, you--

175
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,804
The fight in the mud will end soon.

176
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:25,377
Once either Mr. Jang or Yi-kyung falls,
we will be the final victor.

177
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,520
Yes.

178
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,723
I'll relay the message.

179
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,129
It's Mr. Jang.

180
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,565
He says to come in right now.

181
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,236
Director Jong-gyu Nam
is the one who called.

182
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:57,409
Mr. Jang must have been very lonely
to call him back in already.

183
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,344
Should we go to Seongbuk?

184
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,781
No. They'll come to me
if they need something.

185
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,225
Are you insane?
Why are you moving around already?

186
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,927
I'm fine. I can move.

187
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,428
Are you the doctor?

188
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,531
Seriously. You and your nagging.

189
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,801
You need to rest. Rest until you think
you've rested too much.

190
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,207
Did you make up with Ms. Seo?

191
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,144
When did we ever fight?

192
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,147
Didn't she tell you to come back to work?

193
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:39,651
No. Even if she did,
I wouldn't just agree, either.

194
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,155
Why not? She handed over
important documents because of you.

195
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,158
That makes it even harder.

196
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,862
This happened because I tried to stop her.

197
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,930
It's all my fault.

198
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,966
How could I...

199
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,667
No.

200
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,469
You're dumber than you look.

201
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,973
Do you think she'll fall
just because she lost those documents?

202
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,976
She'll just work harder
to get what she wants.

203
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,878
How do you know her less than I do?

204
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,880
You're right.

205
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,683
I know I'm dumb, and I've been repenting.

206
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,120
It's no fun since you gave in so quickly.

207
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,391
You're allowed to eat, right?
Should I get you something?

208
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:20,859
Father.

209
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,328
I just spoke with Mr. Nam.

210
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,699
He says they'll give Chunha
a full authority over the non-profit bank.

211
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,703
They're cutting Yi-kyung out completely?
Really?

212
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,972
Every flower must fade.

213
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,842
She acted like she had nothing to fear.

214
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,511
I knew this would happen.

215
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,147
Gi-tae.

216
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:43,849
Yes, Father.

217
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,051
You run the non-profit bank.

218
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,820
Do you mean it?

219
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,323
You said you could do it
if I gave you a chance, right?

220
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,159
This is the chance of a lifetime for you.

221
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,630
You run the bank,
and I'll manage the foundation.

222
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,501
You and I will be the purse strings
of the new government.

223
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,570
Father.

224
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,882
You look like you were caught
doing something bad.

225
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,117
Don't jump to conclusions.

226
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,320
Father is inside.

227
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,466
With this, my son's debt is settled.

228
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,071
CASHIER'S CHECK

229
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:47,479
It's hard to pay such an amount
for someone, even if he is your son.

230
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,984
That means you've made a decision
that has a higher value

231
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,086
than this check, correct?

232
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,690
You were too rough on Mr. Jang.

233
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,427
The harder you push,
the stronger the rebound.

234
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,797
What a shame.

235
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,966
You grew on me.

236
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,236
I thought you'd be wise
in making your decisions.

237
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,241
Yi-kyung.

238
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:23,548
Since I respected your late father,
let me give you some advice.

239
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:28,520
If you want to run a big business,
you need to let go of your vanity.

240
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,991
You need to be flexible and open-minded.

241
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,562
I helped you,
and I took in your troublemaker son.

242
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,800
You can't expect me to be
even more magnanimous.

243
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,405
Get back safely.

244
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,906
I'm sorry,
but he's in an important meeting.

245
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,774
When will it end?

246
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,744
He has a TV interview scheduled
immediately thereafter.

247
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,612
He has appointments afterward, too.

248
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,149
I don't think
you'll be able to see him today.

249
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,252
Ma'am.

250
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,965
-That's what I said.
-Good job.

251
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,339
Ms. Seo seems to have made a trip
for nothing.

252
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:59,010
All she'd do is argue
about selling the company anyway.

253
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,547
But that's over, too.

254
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:07,018
Did Mr. Jang say he'll support you
in keeping the company?

255
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,622
He agreed not to touch my company.

256
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,093
There's no need to be controlled
by Ms. Seo anymore.

257
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,264
I'm glad. But why did you want to see me?

258
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:24,169
You're still clashing
with Chairman Moo-sam Park, right?

259
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:31,610
When you think about it,
you're the rightful heir.

260
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,781
You should be the one sitting
in the chairman's seat.

261
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:40,018
I've given up such greed long ago.

262
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,422
I plan to form a campaign team soon.

263
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:48,994
It would be of help to each other
if you'd oversee the business side of it.

264
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,463
A campaign team?

265
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,700
I'll become President,
and you take over the company.

266
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,238
It's a win-win situation. What do you say?

267
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:37,342
I'm sure you have a gist
of how things are going.

268
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:41,513
I'm sure it isn't the most pleasant
for you.

269
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,348
So?

270
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,283
You may have made reckless moves,

271
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,887
but Mr. Jang holds your abilities
in high regard.

272
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,024
I'm not interested, so please leave.

273
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,761
I was considerate enough
to come here myself.

274
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,998
This will be the last proposition
you'll get.

275
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,099
Go and tell him.

276
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:05,270
I didn't give you the documents
in order to cut Mr. Jang free.

277
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,342
Sadly, he has been expelled from my plan.

278
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,777
That's why I gave you the documents.

279
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,080
Jae-hyun Kang will continue to work
with Mr. Jang.

280
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,148
Then he'll fall with him as well.

281
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,550
It isn't too late.

282
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,218
It's too late for Mr. Jang.

283
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,121
I have no intention
of changing my mind, you see.

284
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:24,823
Okay, then.

285
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,840
If you confine or threaten Ms. Seo again,

286
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,378
you will not be safe, either.

287
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,316
You should ask Ms. Seo about that.

288
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,854
Whether she'll continue being a nuisance
to Mr. Jang.

289
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,966
-Hey.
-The Korea Works acquisition fell through.

290
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,667
Couldn't you bend just once?

291
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:46,938
You could've gotten the sale through,
had you worked Mr. Jang well.

292
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,607
It isn't over yet.

293
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,345
First, I'm thinking of shaking up
Jae-hyun Kang.

294
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:57,349
-That sounds interesting.
-I knew you'd think so.

295
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,285
Let's talk in person. When are you free?

296
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,692
Huh?

297
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,195
What are you doing here so late?

298
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,632
I thought maybe you'd be here.

299
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,133
Are you busy?

300
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:19,304
No. I was just looking through
the documents we found before.

301
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,175
Yi-kyung isn't doing well lately.

302
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,011
Did you know that?

303
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,713
Yes.

304
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,617
I know why that happened, too.

305
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,323
If it weren't for me,
the documents on Collins Co.

306
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,859
wouldn't have gone to Mr. Jang.

307
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,229
Isn't it strange?

308
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,266
I worked so hard to ruin her plan,

309
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:55,140
but now that it happened,
I feel uncomfortable and empty.

310
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,242
That's all in your head.

311
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,377
Sorry?

312
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,579
Yi-kyung has not stopped.

313
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:07,318
Mr. Jang and Jae-hyun Kang are the ones
who were discarded by her.

314
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:14,492
I'm going to meet with her to find a way
to stir them up.

315
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,495
With Ms. Seo?

316
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,564
I plan to acquire Korea Works.

317
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,200
I told you before.

318
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:27,605
I'll do anything it takes for my company.
I won't bother acting nice.

319
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,908
What is it?

320
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,878
Do I seem like one of them?

321
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,481
Yes.

322
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:38,483
Are you disappointed?

323
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,019
I was surprised.

324
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:46,057
But I kind of feel like
it's a good thing, too.

325
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,695
If you work together, I can help.

326
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,698
I don't need to be stuck in the middle.

327
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:59,003
I may help, right?

328
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,106
That's why I came by.

329
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,908
To ask you to help.

330
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:12,484
Jae-hyun Kang, who had announced
he'd donate his entire fortune,

331
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:17,055
was at the opening for the non-profit bank
created with his donation.

332
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,389
The previous president...

333
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,795
The event was a big success.

334
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,898
Good work, everyone.

335
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,238
Your approval rating will
probably go up because of this.

336
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,708
It was an honor to have you participate.

337
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,144
It would've been nice
if Yi-kyung were here

338
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,247
to celebrate this success with us.

339
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,917
She left on her own. What could we do?

340
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:53,024
Now, you should focus
on the presidential race.

341
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:58,930
Nam and Chairman Son will handle the rest.

342
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,332
I'll leave it in your hands.

343
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,035
I'll do the best I can,
as Mr. Jang ordered.

344
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,436
Mr. Kang.

345
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,872
It'll be smooth sailing from now on.

346
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,849
This is my son.

347
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,352
I'm Gi-tae Son.

348
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:22,987
I'm Jae-hyun Kang.

349
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,889
It's an honor.

350
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,526
I'll be in charge of operation
of Big Love Bank.

351
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,396
I'll do my best,
as if my life depends on it.

352
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,898
I feel so assured now.

353
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,300
Thank you.

354
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,070
Sir.

355
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,776
Are you entrusting the bank operations
to Mr. Son?

356
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,913
I need to oversee TJ Foundation.

357
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,382
Still, you should oversee it.

358
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,219
Mr. Jang will be uneasy otherwise.

359
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,088
Don't you worry. He'll do just fine.

360
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:14,839
Not bad.

361
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,741
You'll have to remove the core, first.

362
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,543
Did you just compliment me?

363
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,312
You'll have to move swiftly.

364
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,849
If Jae-hyun Kang catches on,
this will not work.

365
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,151
My uncle has already started.

366
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,622
But your plan seems like a bit of a push.

367
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,390
How so?

368
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,659
There will be resistance
within the company.

369
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,861
There will be a huge loss, too.

370
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,465
I'll have to calm down the resistance
and put up with the loss.

371
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,401
It's what you need to do.
You don't think you can do it?

372
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,870
You shouldn't tease from the start.

373
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,974
The sale is one thing,
what will you do about Big Love Bank?

374
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,843
We have someone investigating.

375
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,012
Your person will have to check, too.

376
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,747
I'll make the order.

377
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,282
Also...

378
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,321
-What?
-Se-jin will be working on this with us.

379
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,525
You've taught her well.
She's a hard worker.

380
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,262
Did she say she'd do it herself?

381
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,334
I heard basically what happened
with Mr. Nam.

382
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:21,139
She wanted to be of help to you,
so I thought I'd give her a chance.

383
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,644
She'll figure out whether or not
it is a chance.

384
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,175
Come in. I heard from Ms. Seo.

385
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,311
Who would've thought
this day would ever come, huh?

386
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:04,182
She's Jung-hee Moon, the assistant manager
of Moojin's Special Planning Team.

387
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,017
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ms. Kim.

388
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:07,719
What's your full name?

389
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,021
Is that important?

390
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,791
There is much data to analyze.

391
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,127
Where may I begin?

392
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,231
Find a spot that you like.

393
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,140
What's her deal?

394
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:32,643
Where's Ms. Seo?

395
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,447
She's out a lot.
She's surrounded by enemies, after all.

396
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:38,750
I see.

397
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:22,226
If you had come to our company,

398
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,129
Moojin Group would've been
a global corporation by now.

399
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,201
Though, you'd refuse even if you were
offered to be the chairman.

400
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,137
You seem to want that position.

401
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:35,640
What do you mean?

402
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:39,377
Once you start following your greed,
you end up looking upward.

403
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,880
Why don't you go for
the chairman's office while you're at it?

404
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,017
Make jokes sound like jokes.

405
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,553
I told you not to be embarrassed.

406
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,593
Aren't you getting in?

407
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,096
No good will come of being seen together.

408
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,564
You go first.

409
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:03,734
Let's meet up
once we each make decent progress.

410
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,871
-Good luck.
-You too.

411
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,453
Have a seat.

412
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,326
Don't be like that, and sit.
I'll explain the system to you.

413
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,994
It's fine.

414
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,333
Welcome back.

415
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,269
Ma'am.

416
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,009
-How's it going?
-It's almost done.

417
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,645
It was quick, thanks to their help.

418
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:48,813
Good work, everyone.

419
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:57,188
-Shall we go now?
-Sure.

420
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,444
What do you mean?

421
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,079
Director Kim resigned?

422
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,448
It wasn't just Director Kim
and his people.

423
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,185
Several team managers
from R&D resigned as well.

424
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,689
What? The research team as well?

425
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,124
You made the right choice.

426
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,827
When it comes down to it,

427
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:16,133
it's about determining
how much you are valuated at.

428
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:24,342
Since we brought such great talent,
Moojin Group feels reassured.

429
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:49,867
Korea Works must be freaking out
just about now,

430
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,636
since we took their core talent.

431
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,205
What's the point in paying so much
to bring them over?

432
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,642
We can't put them to work because
of their anti-competition agreement.

433
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,144
Appoint them somewhere hidden for now.

434
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,848
As soon as we acquire Korea Works,
we'll let them do what they've been doing.

435
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,450
These are documents from Henderson Tech.

436
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,091
With both getting the people out

437
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:17,495
and this announcement,
it's costing too much money.

438
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,900
You said this was Yi-kyung's idea, right?

439
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,103
We'll use this to hammer it in.

440
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,907
Jae-hyun Kang will have no choice
but to agree to the sale.

441
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,813
I wonder if we'll end short
by looking long.

442
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,114
I reviewed it, too.

443
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,485
It'll work. Push forward with it, Uncle.

444
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,324
Moojin Group, which had been developing
the next generation broadband technology,

445
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,661
announced a collaboration with
Henderson Tech, the second in the market.

446
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,697
On the flipside, Korea Works,

447
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,633
who was competing for the technology
with Moojin Group,

448
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,636
saw a huge drop in stock price
ever since the announcement.

449
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,871
Furthermore, Korea Works' management...

450
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,774
Will you stop at every light?
Step on it already!

451
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,543
They plan to meet
to discuss their next step.

452
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,080
It's obvious what they're after.

453
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:12,783
They stole our people and timely announced
a technology collaboration.

454
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,586
It means they plan to acquire Korea Works.

455
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:19,023
Moojin went out on a limb for this.

456
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,726
That's not business. It's gambling.

457
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:27,598
Warn Chairman Moo-sam Park,

458
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,268
that it won't be fun for either of us
if he messes with my company.

459
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,841
Mr. Jang.

460
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,812
I understand your love for your company,

461
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:47,351
but you are the presidential candidate
with the second highest approval rating.

462
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:53,190
Then you'll have to step down as CEO soon.

463
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:54,658
Pardon?

464
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,828
You'll have to leave the company anyway.

465
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,731
What's the difference

466
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,403
between having a successor take over
or selling it?

467
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:08,906
Mr. Jang.

468
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,076
It isn't just a company to me.

469
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,445
Look here, Jae-hyun.

470
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:19,450
Everyone wants
to have their cake and eat it, too,

471
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:24,555
but there comes a time
when you must decide.

472
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:31,562
You need to decide
which is more profitable.

473
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,800
Politics or the company.

474
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,669
As in, choose one or the other.

475
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,772
Do you want my opinion,
speaking from experience?

476
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,576
The presidency...

477
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:51,048
is much more powerful
than you can imagine.

478
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:57,087
If you grasp that power,
you can sweep away...

479
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:03,928
everything that angers you now
like leaves fallen on the ground.

480
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:13,304
This is the situation of Big Love Bank,
that I found with Se-jin.

481
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,040
That woman she brought
was quite skilled, too.

482
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,344
Ma'am.

483
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:22,580
Yes?

484
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,750
Why don't you have Se-jin
return to the gallery?

485
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,388
She's gone through a lot,

486
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,558
and she's gotten much better at work
than before, too.

487
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,328
-Ms. Kim.
-If you tell her to come,

488
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,030
I'm sure she'd drop everything to come.

489
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,969
There's no need to call her in.
She's doing fine out there on her own.

490
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,237
But...

491
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,038
Where's the list of borrowed accounts?

492
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,578
What do you mean?

493
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,882
I'll need to raise the price
for the borrowed accounts

494
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,852
that you bought from our company.

495
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,354
We already paid for them.

496
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,723
We gave you more than their worth.

497
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:10,361
You'll be making a lot of money using them
to siphon the non-profit bank's funds,

498
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,429
but you want me to take the chump change
and just watch?

499
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,032
That's not right.

500
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,103
-Sir.
-Does your father know about our deal?

501
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,741
Wait outside!

502
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:25,910
Bring that here.

503
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,345
Come on.

504
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,164
LIST OF BORROWED ACCOUNTS

505
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,870
They'll lend a small amount to the poor
as a cover,

506
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:57,908
and pretend to lend money to these
accounts to siphon the money?

507
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,109
That's right.

508
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:01,612
These people are terrible.

509
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:07,117
Yi-kyung is the one
who planned the whole thing.

510
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:12,489
Of course, the one who agreed to do it
by pretending to donate his fortune

511
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,091
was Jae-hyun Kang.

512
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:15,526
I know.

513
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,228
Everyone is busy feeding their greed.

514
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,767
The same goes for the person
you are working for.

515
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,369
Because it's for the company.

516
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,638
There are plenty of excuses.

517
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,940
It's for the nation. It's for the people.

518
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,377
Then Ms. Seo is 100 times better.

519
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:39,116
She doesn't make excuses to look better
and cover up what she's doing.

520
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,789
Did you know about
the technology collaboration?

521
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,294
You didn't know that Moojin

522
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,630
was stealing our workers?

523
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,499
I knew about both.

524
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:01,939
I'm busy with the Neo City Project,
but I hear what's going on in the company.

525
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,711
You knew, but you couldn't give me a hint?

526
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,548
I considered hiring you
as my campaign's economic adviser.

527
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:12,916
That's how much I trusted you.

528
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,586
If Moojin acquires Korea Works,

529
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:19,323
we'll build it into a major corporation
within ten years.

530
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:24,528
The company's profits outweigh
being an adviser on your campaign team.

531
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,734
You didn't learn from watching, did you?

532
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,538
Chairman Moo-il Park

533
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,843
had to close down Dubai because
he was blackballed by the current power.

534
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:41,845
Did you forget that already?

535
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,649
If I become president,

536
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:51,355
Moojin will have many problems
conducting business.

537
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:57,061
Then I'll have to join the movement
to make you lose the election.

538
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:01,065
You're quite popular,
so I don't know how it will end.

539
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,502
Mr. Kang.

540
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:10,240
Sell Korea Works to us.

541
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,344
Let's see if things go your way.

542
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:22,920
That's right.

543
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:27,591
Out of appreciation for saying
you'd let me join your campaign team,

544
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,226
let me tell you one thing.

545
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,097
You know Gi-tae Son,
who is overseeing Big Love Bank?

546
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,033
Check on him.

547
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:38,736
Gi-tae Son?

548
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:43,240
I heard the prosecutor is
investigating him for illegal loans.

549
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,515
I met with Jae-hyun Kang.

550
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,952
He's pissed off
since his plan has been ruined.

551
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,856
The more irrational he is,
the more advantageous it is for us.

552
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,892
Mr. Jang is probably pressuring him
to sell as well.

553
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:03,794
I dropped the bait.

554
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,463
His jaw dropped
at the mention of illegal loans.

555
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,399
We sent the list of borrowed accounts
to the prosecutor.

556
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,567
Okay.

557
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,036
My people will do their part now.

558
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,005
Okay. The baton has been passed.

559
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,321
Welcome back, Tak.

560
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,666
I've been discharged.

561
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,502
-How do you feel?
-As solid as a rock.

562
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,038
Then get to work.

563
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:51,842
-Pardon?
-He was just discharged.

564
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:55,279
Bring Tak his gear.
We must get him tonight.

565
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:57,748
Don't worry.

566
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,694
Hey, Tak. I'm on my way to the hospital.
Is there anything you want to eat?

567
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,297
-I've been discharged.
-Already?

568
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,365
Can you really go home? Are you sure?

569
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,903
That's not all. Ms. Seo gave an order,
so I'm working tonight.

570
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,506
Will you be okay?

571
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:25,008
Don't worry. This is what I do.

572
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,811
-Can I help?
-Dream on.

573
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:30,814
Then Ms. Seo will have my head.

574
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,623
I have to go. Talk to you later.

575
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,835
Who said such nonsense?

576
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,136
Well, anyway.

577
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:30,374
How many illegal loans
did Big Love Bank issue?

578
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,709
And you gathered borrowed accounts, too.

579
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,113
Wait, Mr. Kang.

580
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,347
Mr. Son.

581
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:40,717
Do you think I donated my fortune
because I have money to burn?

582
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:45,422
The objective of the non-profit bank is
to create my slush fund,

583
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:48,792
not to pad your wallet, got it?

584
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:02,472
Please, first listen
to what I'm trying to say.

585
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:05,642
Do you know how much it costs
to win the presidential elections?

586
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,745
It'll be hard enough,
even with all of the bank's funds.

587
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:10,914
How can you
dip into the cookie jar already?

588
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,594
I've got nothing to say.

589
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:26,163
I am terribly sorry.

590
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,303
Did you check with the prosecutor?

591
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:37,808
Yes. It is true that the prosecutor
received a list of borrowed accounts

592
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:38,942
from Big Love Bank.

593
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,747
If the prosecutor goes public with this,
the election is out the window.

594
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:47,884
Look here.

595
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:49,853
Yes?

596
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:54,191
Adversity may become an opportunity.

597
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:59,129
You can come clean to the people.

598
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:04,634
You had the best intentions, but the one
in charge ruined it with his mistake.

599
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:08,438
Say you repent sincerely and will improve.

600
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,876
Are you saying
we can just cut off the tail?

601
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:18,281
As long as the body is alive,
the tail isn't a problem.

602
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:24,721
If you are honest and frank,
it'll make the people trust you even more.

603
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,624
What about my son?

604
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:31,461
Your son may have ruined the election.

605
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:33,397
Don't you appreciate
the gravity of the situation?

606
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:55,619
What are you doing?

607
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,687
Is anyone outside?

608
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,425
-No.
-Then stand guard.

609
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,094
Why? What did you do this time?

610
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:08,098
Something urgent came up, so I need to
go abroad for a bit. It won't take long.

611
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:10,333
Dad.

612
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:14,905
Crap.

613
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,041
I thought things were going too easily.

614
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,710
Right, Gi-tae.

615
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:24,181
Even if things go well,
this is how it ends up for you.

616
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:28,051
Dad, are you really okay?

617
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:33,957
-Ma-ri.
-Yeah?

618
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,128
I'm sorry your dad is such a loser.

619
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,297
Dad.

620
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:43,300
He's holding a press conference at 2 p.m.

621
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,770
They must plan to face it straight on.
They'll just cut out Gi-tae Son.

622
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,772
I'm sure it was Mr. Jang's orders.

623
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,174
He hasn't given up yet.

624
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,376
Would Gi-tae Son take the fall alone,
though?

625
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,445
He'll either submerge or go abroad.

626
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,481
It doesn't matter, either way.

627
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:00,317
We need to finish
the rest of our work on time.

628
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,854
-When is he coming?
-Is he even coming?

629
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:14,698
He has been busy.

630
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:17,300
-There are many reporters.
-I see.

631
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,202
You need to go in now.

632
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:22,772
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

633
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:01,244
Hello, everyone.

634
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:05,849
I am Jae-hyun Kang,
the CEO of Korea Works.

635
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:13,557
I am here today
to tell you something very disgraceful.

636
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:19,262
Big Love Bank, established
to provide service and hope,

637
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,798
was involved in an illegal loans case.

638
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,768
We conducted an internal investigation,
which uncovered the source.

639
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,503
Jae-hyun Kang's Press Conference

640
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:31,107
I am at fault for not preventing
the illegal and deviant actions

641
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,777
of the person in charge.

642
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:36,713
Thus, I apologize deeply

643
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,116
in front of you all.

644
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:45,822
Moreover, my intentions
for running for president,

645
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,825
not for my personal honor,
but for the good of the nation,

646
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,161
has not changed at all.

647
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:57,367
I will learn my lesson from this,
and promise to work harder

648
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,805
at creating a nation without corruption.

649
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:07,244
I promise to create a nation
that is clean and full of hope.

650
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,313
Please have faith in my sincerity.

651
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:12,882
And that...

652
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,050
-What is that?
-What's that?

653
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:15,819
-What is that?
-What's the text?

654
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,156
Gi-tae.

655
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:21,124
What is that?

656
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:22,192
Do you think I donated...

657
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,327
-Did you get this?
-It's Mr. Kang's voice.

658
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:28,064
The objective of the non-profit bank is
to create my slush fund,

659
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:31,234
not to pad your wallet, got it?

660
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,536
Do you think I donated my fortune
because I have money to burn?

661
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,872
The objective of the non-profit bank
is to create my slush fund,

662
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,241
not to pad your wallet, got it?

663
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,510
It'll be hard enough,
even with all of the bank's funds.

664
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:41,544
Mr. Kang.

665
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:42,846
How can you dip into...

666
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:44,414
The objective of the non-profit bank

667
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,249
-is to create my slush fund.
-It's being spread.

668
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:48,418
Do you know how much it costs?

669
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,588
It'll be hard enough,
even with all of the bank's funds...

670
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:53,657
How can you
dip into the cookie jar already?

671
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:59,229
The prosecutor's agents arrived
at the press conference.

672
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,364
I think he'll be taken in right away.

673
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:10,206
He is dead politically.

674
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,844
His approval rating will hit rock bottom.

675
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,613
The presidential election is not
what matters.

676
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:19,115
He won't be able to avoid being charged.

677
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,858
As long as the body survives,
the tail does not matter.

678
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,995
Call Mr. Jung.

679
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,831
He is the best replacement...

680
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,268
for Jae-hyun.

681
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,369
Yes, sir.

682
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,138
That aside,

683
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:48,411
there is only one person who would do

684
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,615
something this bold.

685
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:58,455
It's time to get rid of her,

686
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,091
don't you agree?

687
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,903
Korea Works is quick.

688
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,240
Their executives already called my uncle.

689
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,410
They said they want to seriously
discuss the acquisition.

690
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:26,049
Stock prices already plummeted.
It'll crash if their CEO is incarcerated.

691
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,317
They must be in a rush.

692
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,185
I'm so grateful.

693
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:31,654
Let me know if there's anything you want.

694
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,990
I'll do whatever I can to get it for you.

695
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,393
Mr. Jang is still left.

696
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,698
We need to take good care of him,
for me to feel at peace.

697
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,702
That'll be tough for me.

698
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,640
I don't intend to get involved that far.

699
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:55,245
I know. This is between him and me.

700
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:59,649
He'll look for a racehorse
to replace Jae-hyun Kang.

701
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,152
He won't be able to go to the race.

702
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:06,389
I plan to hammer lots of nails
into his front door.

703
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:08,925
I wish you luck.

704
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,261
You too.

705
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:14,197
When are you going to take Se-jin?

706
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,401
-What do you mean?
-You trained her.

707
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:22,472
I feel like the top student from
another class came and raised our average.

708
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,241
It helps, but it bothers me.

709
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,745
Train her more at Moojin.

710
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:32,015
Who knows?
She may claim that chairman's seat

711
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:34,651
that you say you don't want.

712
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,354
It doesn't sound impossible.

713
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,265
Here are the Korea Works documents.

714
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:50,867
Thank you.

715
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,804
Where did you go yesterday?

716
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:56,539
I didn't see you all day.

717
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,409
I went to Busan on business.

718
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:03,146
You're so busy. You must be tired.

719
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:07,617
If you're leaving now,
I'll drive you to the subway station.

720
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,519
I'd appreciate that.

721
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:14,457
This way.

722
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:38,748
RECENT DESTINATION

723
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,519
SOO-YUN JUNG, HYUNSUN RESORT

724
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:46,990
Is there a Soo-yun Jung
in Customer Relations Department?

725
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:48,424
HYUNSUN RESORT

726
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,899
Sorry.

727
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,612
What business did you have in Busan?

728
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,516
I attended a funeral on Mr. Park's behalf.

729
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:16,085
It's a typical assistant's duty.

730
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,087
I see.

731
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:21,624
Assistants do things like that, too.

732
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,395
Should I turn here and drop you off?

733
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,097
Yes.

734
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,009
Get home safely.

735
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:41,778
Thank you.

736
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:03,499
It'll be difficult for Mr. Kang
to avoid a prison sentence.

737
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:09,305
Mr. Jang probably already found
a replacement.

738
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,943
Collins Co. is the only way,
if you want to get him.

739
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:16,813
Do you have any leads?

740
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:22,552
We've contacted Mi-yun Jung's sister.

741
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:26,322
She seems willing to cooperate
for sufficient compensation.

742
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:31,794
You'll go after Mr. Jang
while you're at it, is that it?

743
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,066
You should've become a prosecutor.

744
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,538
Mr. Jang isn't my final target.

745
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:47,176
I have to go after Yi-kyung,
after I take care of Mr. Jang.

746
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:50,313
May I ask why?

747
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:55,785
If I leave her alone,
she'll swallow up everything.

748
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:59,055
Moojin Group, for sure.

749
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:00,790
Perhaps...

750
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,126
even this whole nation.

751
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:51,708
Hi, Se-jin.

752
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:56,913
Ms. Moon came by and took
the Korea Works documents.

753
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:59,482
Thank you. Are you at the office?

754
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:04,721
No. She drove me to the station,
so I'm almost home.

755
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:10,126
She seemed tired from the trip to Busan.

756
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:16,332
She said she went
to a wedding in your place.

757
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,502
It was one for
which I couldn't just send a gift.

758
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:22,038
I had to send her and show my respect.

759
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:26,642
Se-jin?

760
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,144
Okay.

761
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,013
I'll see you tomorrow.

762
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:32,448
Good night.

763
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:47,530
Where did you go yesterday?
I didn't see you all day.

764
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,200
I went to Busan on business.

765
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,903
What business did you have in Busan?

766
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,973
I attended a funeral on Mr. Park's behalf.

767
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,710
It was one for
which I couldn't just send a gift.

768
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,312
I had to send her and show my respect.

769
