00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,945
EPISODE 2

2
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,350
For just one hour,

3
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,385
I want you to be me, Se-jin.

4
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,655
Ask yourself, Se-jin.

5
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,357
Even if it's very brief,

6
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,360
even if it's a lie,

7
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,629
do you want to be like me?

8
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,615
Are you Miss...

9
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:23,750
Yes.

10
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,420
I am Yi-kyung Seo.

11
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,794
MONEY, POWER

12
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,299
COLLUSION BETWEEN POLITICIANS
AND CORPORATIONS

13
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,670
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY

14
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,223
Where's her bodyguard?

15
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,491
She came alone.

16
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:07,727
Go get it.

17
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,739
Isn't there an interpreter?

18
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,308
I heard there would be someone
who speaks Korean.

19
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,445
Interpreter. An Interpreter.

20
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,414
Translator. Interpreter.

21
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,517
Interpreter...

22
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,695
What are you doing?

23
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,036
Where are the paintings?

24
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,506
Are you really here to sell paintings?

25
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,562
Okay.

26
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,497
They've got her.

27
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,333
The Feng Brothers are taking her
to the factory now.

28
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,404
She was too desperate
to think to look around.

29
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,341
Thanks to that, we'll have a smooth
general meeting without an unwanted guest.

30
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,124
FUTURE PROGRESS
ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATIONS

31
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,028
Next topic for discussion is regarding

32
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,531
sponsoring the East Asian Economy Forum--

33
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,565
Wait.

34
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,668
The matter of inducting a new member

35
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,103
was omitted.

36
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,972
What happened with that?

37
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,675
Isn't CEO of Gallery S
supposed to attend today's meeting?

38
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,647
Well,

39
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:08,881
that is...

40
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,286
the association's management committee,

41
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,355
during the review,

42
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,191
discovered that Gallery S
has a critical flaw.

43
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,559
And what is that?

44
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,364
I'd like to hear in front of everyone

45
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,267
what flaw my company and I have.

46
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,842
Ms. Seo. Why don't you
take your seat first?

47
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,479
Let's continue with the agenda.

48
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,181
But before that,

49
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,617
I'd like to say a few words.

50
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,252
Would you let me?

51
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,356
Yes, go ahead.

52
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:00,199
I learned of a shocking truth
a few days ago.

53
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,270
It is shameful. Something that personally,

54
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,072
I'd like to hide.

55
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,107
The fact is,

56
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,044
my son Gi-tae Son,
the association's financial director,

57
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,983
has been embezzling and misappropriating
the association's funds.

58
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:18,851
Father.

59
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,522
As a father, I wish I could
cover his wrongdoings,

60
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,392
but I decided all corruption
must be uncovered.

61

FUTURE PROGRESS
ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATIONS

62
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,400
Chunha Financing

63
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,070
will reimburse the association

64
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:39,839
for the loss it incurred.

65
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,776
Please punish my son harshly

66
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,845
for the wrong he committed.

67
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,448
Father, how could you do this?

68
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,415
Shut up!

69
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,452
Drag him out of here.

70
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,287
Father.

71
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,789
You can't... Let go!

72
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:57,990
Have you lost your mind?

73
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,760
Why are you doing this to me?

74
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,894
Why?

75
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,165
Father!

76
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,667
Okay, then.

77
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,237
The association will investigate

78
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:15,675
Gi-tae Son's corruption thoroughly
on our part.

79
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,043
By the way, Mr. Son,

80
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,146
we respect how you made
such a difficult decision.

81
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,181
Don't you agree?

82
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,292
People like us

83
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,829
who look at the big picture
when running businesses

84
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,033
must not forget

85
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,970
to be impartial and follow the rules.

86
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,573
I'm sure Chairman Bong-soo Seo,
whom I respect,

87
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,309
would have decided

88
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,946
the matter of his daughter's Korean
business in the same impartial manner.

89
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,683
I heard you went to Japan.

90
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,819
Did you get your father's consent?

91
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:06,993
Ms. Seo.

92
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,761
We are all very busy people.

93
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,164
If you have his consent, submit it.

94
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,899
If not, please leave.

95
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,177
What a shame.

96
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:25,745
Mr. Jo.

97
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,381
Ms. Seo has the original.

98
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:29,715
This is a copy.

99
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:32,718
My father

100
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,889
Chairman Bong-soo Seo
of Ilhan Finance wrote this by hand

101
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,258
and signed it at the bottom.

102
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,098
I, Bong-soo Seo

103
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,802
permit Gallery S to operate in Korea.

104
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,607
Thus, I ask for your wholehearted support

105
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,876
and cooperation

106
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,712
and pray for the continued progress

107
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,415
of Future Progress,
Association of Corporations.

108
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,186
Take it.

109
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,155
You don't need to do this.

110
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,389
I didn't write this

111
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,559
to pave the way for your business.

112
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,630
This is my will and testament.

113
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,707
I said I'd disown you,

114
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,578
but you insisted on going to Korea
and started this.

115
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,615
Whether you succeed or fail there,

116
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,585
you and I...

117
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,190
will never see each other again.

118
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,591
I will succeed.

119
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,527
I will win,

120
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,363
because that is how you raised me.

121
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,430
I did not.

122
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,666
I raised my successor.

123
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,670
I never created a monster.

124
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,540
Do you...

125
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,608
fear me?

126
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:04,844
It must be one or the other.

127
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,946
Either you grew weak

128
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,948
or I grew strong.

129
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,884
Don't grow any weaker.

130
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,587
You need to see

131
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,823
the kingdom I will create.

132
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:26,832
The break is lasting too long.

133
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,335
You planned this all along.

134
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,904
You pretended you didn't have
his consent and fooled me.

135
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,073
You made me kick out my own son!

136
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,608
That was your choice.

137
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,345
Impartial and by the rules.
It was touching.

138
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,716
Let's continue with the general meeting.

139
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,652
I'd like you to finish
my induction matter.

140
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,957
Your double who went to the hotel

141
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,892
is in my custody.

142
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,262
Tell everyone

143
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,098
the letter was forged
and that Mr. Seo did not approve.

144
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,500
Then I will let her go.

145
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,503
You shouldn't go all-in with a poor hand.

146
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,406
You'd better fold.

147
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,642
You don't care what happens to her?

148
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,745
I sent her knowing it was a trap.

149
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,183
She played her part,
so it's up to her to figure out the rest.

150
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,722
What I care about is the conclusion
of this general meeting.

151
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,859
You said everyone was busy.

152
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,629
We should continue with the meeting.

153
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,904
Where's Tak?

154
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,507
He's been following since the hotel.

155
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,110
Should I tell him to move?

156
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,148
Okay. I've been waiting.

157
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:08,768
Pull over!

158
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,454
Damn it.

159
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,025
Thank you.

160
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,161
Thank you. Thank you.

161
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,568
-I look forward to it.
-Thank you.

162
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,106
Thank you.

163
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,481
We're increasing the radius by 5km
from where he lost the car.

164
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,750
I'm checking to see if Chunha Financing

165
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,819
has any houses or factories
within the area.

166
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,554
Tak, stand by there.

167
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,090
Be ready to move as soon as
Ms. Kim locates her.

168
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,294
I thought you were the god of computers.

169
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,562
What's taking you so long?

170
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,797
Hack a satellite or something.

171
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,834
You're the one who lost her.
Who are you complaining to?

172
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,204
Hey. I thought you have
a black belt in every martial art.

173
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,705
They had a gun. A gun!

174
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:20,706
Silence.

175
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,174
We don't have time, so hurry.

176
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:24,643
Don't worry too much.

177
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,713
With Ms. Kim's skills,
we'll find her in no time.

178
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,817
Get cash together. In US dollars.

179
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:33,886
Dollars?

180
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,088
They're professionals who follow money.

181
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,424
If I pay them enough,

182
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,392
no one will get hurt.

183
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,561
How much should I prepare?

184
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,029
I don't know.

185
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,831
I wonder.

186
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,200
Se-jin Lee.

187
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,703
How much...

188
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:52,738
is she worth?

189
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,053
You guys...

190
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,089
made a mistake.

191
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,291
You brought the wrong person.

192
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:20,960
I'm not Yi-kyung Seo.

193
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,930
I went there in her place, that's all.

194
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,366
Shit.

195
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:29,869
I'm not Yi-kyung Seo.

196
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,104
You've mistaken, okay?

197
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,506
Let me go, okay?

198
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:40,813
After just one call.

199
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,115
You'll either go home

200
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,050
or go to hell.

201
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:50,890
Hello?

202
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,935
He's angry. He said we messed up.

203
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,470
He says it isn't her.

204
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,073
He said he'd only pay us half,

205
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,176
but in exchange for killing her.

206
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,480
Maybe he's lying
because he doesn't want to pay up.

207
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,582
I don't know. What should we do?

208
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,823
Call her.

209
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:26,892
Your boss.

210
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,532
Se-jin is on the line.

211
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:34,667
I'll connect you.

212
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,369
Ms. Seo, it's me.

213
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,972
These people aren't here
to sell paintings.

214
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,308
I've been abducted.

215
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,946
These people think I'm you--

216
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,581
-Let me talk to them.
-What?

217
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,517
I'll talk to them myself.
Give them the phone.

218
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,604
-Hello?
-I'm the one you want, not her.

219
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,041
I'll compensate you for the mistake.

220
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,209
Let her go.

221
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,178
For how much?

222
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,751
Fine. That's a deal.

223
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,955
Except you come and get her yourself.

224
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,896
Send Tak the address.

225
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,566
Tell him not rush, and to stand by.

226
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,403
Ms. Seo. They have guns. Guns.

227
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:45,938
I have a weapon too.

228
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,207
This is pretty powerful.

229
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:12,931
Hey.

230
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,834
Will you kill her, too?

231
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,073
One of them must be real.

232
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,342
We'll kill them both

233
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,979
and get the money we were promised.

234
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,383
-You're awesome.
-Who cares about the deal?

235
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,585
It's your turn. Go.

236
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,722
I told you, you can't beat me.

237
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,492
You...

238
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,027
For just one hour,

239
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,430
I want you to be me, Se-jin.

240
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,166
These people think I'm you--

241
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,834
-Let me talk to them.
-What?

242
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,203
I'll talk to them myself.
Give them the phone.

243
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,710
I'm here.

244
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,113
Don't rush. Stand by.

245
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,161
I need to use the bathroom.

246
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,065
-Toilet. Toilet, please.
-Hey.

247
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,068
It looks like she needs to pee.

248
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:57,836
You take her.

249
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,374
Don't touch anything.

250
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:06,505
What happened?

251
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,773
I found a great move.

252
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:12,110
Liar. You cheated while I was away!

253
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,812
How dare you accuse me?

254
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,114
I was winning.

255
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,184
You cheated! What the hell is this?

256
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,287
You cheater.

257
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,255
Punk. Do you want to die?

258
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,189
Freeze!

259
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:32,798
If you move...

260
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,200
If you move, I'll shoot.

261
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,103
Have you ever shot a person before? Shoot.

262
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,708
That won't work. Shoot me first.

263
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,118
You cocky bitch, shoot if you can!

264
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:16,975
Get up!

265
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,244
Get up!

266
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,314
Get up!

267
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,953
Get up now!

268
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,300
What a shame.

269
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,836
You liked that dress.

270
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,472
You knew it from the start, right?

271
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,243
You sent me

272
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,578
knowing what will happen.

273
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,016
So, how did it feel to be me?

274
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:42,788
You'll catch a cold.

275
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,943
Emotions are just like money.
Use it sparingly.

276
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,113
"I'm sorry for lying."

277
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,284
Don't you feel that at all?

278
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:22,994
Is that what you want?

279
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,629
I'll say it, if you want.

280
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:26,898
I feel like crap.

281
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,669
You deceived me

282
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,205
and I almost died.

283
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,974
And...

284
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,110
-And I--
-I know.

285
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:41,513
You're angry and feel wronged.

286
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,784
We were supposed to have saved you
midway through,

287
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,253
but we made a mistake. I admit it.

288
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:51,556
You admit it?

289
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:54,860
A mistake?

290
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,672
I'll admit it too.

291
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,811
It was my mistake
for wanting to be like you...

292
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:15,914
even for a moment.

293
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:18,817
What a shame.

294
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,685
You have a lot of potential.

295
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:36,668
Ms. Seo.

296
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:37,969
What happened?

297
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:39,504
I don't know.

298
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,840
There was an explosion.

299
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,542
-An explosion?
-I did it.

300
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,779
-What do you mean?
-I couldn't sit there and just die.

301
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,515
Not while being someone's double.

302
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,459
Can you drive?

303
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:04,529
It's just a scratch.

304
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,197
Take her home.

305
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,266
I don't think she wants to go in my car.

306
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,004
Come to me when you've calmed down.
We still need to talk.

307
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,740
You're pretty gutsy.

308
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:50,976
Most girls

309
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,444
would've just cried and cried.

310
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,580
You are not any better than her.

311
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,083
You knew it was dangerous but played dumb.

312
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,318
Hey, what happened was...

313
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:07,826
It's okay.

314
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,398
How do you work for someone like her?

315
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,301
She lies to people and uses them.

316
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,838
But she doesn't even feel bad about it.
That witch.

317
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,574
That witch also tried to save you.

318
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,311
She was bringing money to trade for you.

319
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,381
They told her to come herself, so she did.

320
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:31,983
It isn't like her.

321
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,099
Are you all right?

322
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,203
I thought something had happened.

323
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,505
I was terrified.

324
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,607
You should rest.

325
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:56,975
You should go rest.

326
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,850
-Call Chunha Financing.
-Now?

327
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,086
He's a well-respected chairman
in the industry.

328
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,056
He shouldn't have his name associated
with abductions and whatnot.

329
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,958
Tell him to clean things up quietly.

330
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,026
Yes, ma'am.

331
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,063
Get me Se-jin's profile.

332
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,698
Make it as detailed as possible.

333
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,333
Why do you want...

334
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:24,436
Mr. Jo.

335
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,504
I'm very tired.

336
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,273
I'll let you rest.

337
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,148
"I'm sorry for lying."

338
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,151
Don't you feel that at all?

339
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,188
Emotions are just like money.
Use it sparingly.

340
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,536
I did it.

341
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,405
I couldn't sit there and just die.

342
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,841
Not while being someone's double.

343
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:07,832
Huh?

344
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:12,971
Ms. Seo.

345
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,007
Huh?

346
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,378
When did you go out?
You worked out already?

347
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,381
You should've slept in on a day like this.

348
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,055
I have a busy day.

349
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:34,425
It's more attractive
if a person is slightly lazy.

350
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,760
Is Mr. Jo here?

351
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,395
Let's have a meeting in 30 minutes.

352
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,420
Goodness.

353
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,657
How much money were you making
that you were out all night?

354
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,159
Just do what you can, and no more.

355
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,863
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

356
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,299
You might get hurt.

357
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,136
Yeah, you're right.

358
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,173
I shouldn't bite off too much.

359
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,543
Did something happen last night?

360
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,811
Like what?

361
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,283
Maybe it's because I had a bad dream.

362
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,052
I'm tired.

363
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,657
I'm looking for a way to get money,
so don't worry about the rent.

364
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,594
Our family won't end up on the street.

365
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,396
Don't you overdo it.

366
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:48,199
What if you slip in the bathhouse
like last year?

367
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,134
Don't jinx me.

368
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,771
I made some fish. Eat before you go.

369
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,473
Yes. Fish.

370
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:58,843
Goodness.

371
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,378
-Be careful.
-Okay.

372
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,944
Young-hae 200,000 won
Da-young 400,000 won

373
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,247
I'm looking for a way to get money,
so don't worry about the rent.

374
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,359
Hello.

375
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,660
He's waiting for you.

376
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,684
Hey, newbie.

377
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,787
The customers are complaining,

378
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,588
asking if someone died in your family.

379
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,090
Smile. Smile.

380
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,293
I'm sorry.

381
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,578
WOMEN-ONLY DESIGNATED DRIVER SERVICE

382
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,715
-I've got a call.
-You got a call?

383
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,118
-I'll be back later.
-Drive safely.

384
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,319
I'm jealous.

385
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,388
-Eat some of this.
-When will we get called?

386
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,722
-I know.
-Right?

387
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:53,991
Be careful.

388
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,294
-Did you get called?
-Don't get annoyed.

389
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,206
How was the painting, Chairman?

390
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:10,975
It's here.

391
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,710
-I'm up.
-You got a call?

392
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,016
What took you so long?

393
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,185
-I'm sorry.
-Get up. Hurry.

394
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,687
Get up. Gosh.

395
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,262
She works at a parking lot during the day

396
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,630
and is a designated driver at night.

397
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,998
FAMILY REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE

398
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,935
She works every minute
except when she sleeps.

399
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,370
Why is she doing this to herself

400
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,072
when there's a perfectly fine shortcut?

401
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,010
Let's see how long she lasts.

402
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:23,481
Gosh.

403
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,826
Excuse me. You have a guest.

404
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:42,700
I wanted to return this.

405
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:44,669
It's your dress.

406
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,305
I have no reason to accept it.

407
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,473
When I think about the giver,
the dress seems just as ugly.

408
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,809
It's too expensive to throw away.

409
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,278
Return it or exchange it.
Do whatever you want.

410
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,449
Do you like herbal tea?

411
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,385
Ms. Kim's herbal tea is top-notch.

412
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,254
I grow the herbs myself.

413
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,390
The key is to dry it well--

414
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:07,358
No thank you.

415
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,160
I need to get to work soon.

416
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,530
Then just make one, please.

417
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,741
What is this?

418
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:24,675
A contract.

419
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,078
I want to hire you to work for my company.

420
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,219
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

421
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,322
You are just beyond words.

422
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,358
After what you made me go through...

423
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,794
This isn't amusing.

424
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,296
I don't hire people for amusement.

425
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,331
I'm offering because I need you.

426
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,168
There's an envelope there too.

427
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,076
CASHIER'S CHECK

428
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,146
I was going to use it to buy your safety,

429
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,015
but you got out on your own.

430
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,683
Consider it a signing bonus.

431
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,124
The amount is tempting,

432
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,526
but it doesn't feel so great.

433
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:19,430
I reject your offer.

434
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,269
What about your rent?

435
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,906
You need to send your cousin
to college, too.

436
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,342
You should do that much for your aunt

437
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,511
who raised you, don't you think?

438
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,215
Did you run a background check on me?

439
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,384
I need to know with whom I'll be working.

440
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:43,621
Se-jin.

441
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,589
I'm giving you an opportunity.

442
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,995
An opportunity to live your own life,
rather than being a double.

443
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:53,964
You're always like this.

444
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:57,335
You think money solves all,
and make fools of people.

445
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,104
What can't money accomplish?

446
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,906
I really don't know.

447
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,174
Shouldn't you at least

448
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,608
apologize for what happened?

449
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,978
You can't make up for it
with this stupid money.

450
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:11,949
"This stupid money"?

451
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,754
Don't look down on money.

452
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,823
Then money will look down on you.

453
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,094
Do you think fake smiles
and phony conversations

454
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,530
are worth even as much as a coin?

455
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,967
How much I want

456
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,169
and how much the other person can give.

457
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,239
All that matters are transactions
with defined values.

458
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,982
I was always terrible in math.

459
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:47,852
I will

460
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,588
just accept my fate and live poor.

461
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,217
She still won't apologize.

462
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,555
I know she's smart,

463
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:28,259
but you have many matters on your plate.

464
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,660
How many do you think have it?

465
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:30,995
Pardon?

466
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,463
The ability

467
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,899
to save herself and escape
from a deadly situation.

468
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,670
That instinct is not something
everyone has.

469
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:44,608
Once our plan gets under way,
we'll need to open many locked gates.

470
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,780
I plan to shape her into a universal key.

471
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,951
We'll see her again soon, so don't worry.

472
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,320
Once you ignite greed,

473
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,389
that fire

474
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,391
doesn't go out easily.

475
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,951
What did you say? Shut it down?

476
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,220
Are you saying you'll close
the business in Dubai?

477
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,889
Tell me, you punk!

478
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,924
You're not built for bread and water.

479
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,860
Come out and eat a balanced meal.

480
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,194
Who said I'd go out?

481
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,997
I said I won't give in.

482
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,500
-I--
-You went to the infirmary last night.

483
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,102
I heard you coughed all night long.

484
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:47,404
Let whoever wants Dubai

485
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,607
have Dubai and wherever else.

486
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,444
The head of the group is about to go
to prison. Who cares about a project?

487
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:54,845
You punk!

488
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,881
Fire me.

489
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,817
But you need to get out of here
if you want to fire me.

490
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,987
I'll make that happen.

491
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,830
-Move.
-Mr. Park

492
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,331
is in an important meeting.

493
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,599
What meeting?

494
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,601
With conspirators to ruin Dubai?

495
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,240
-I said to move!
-You are not on the list of participants.

496
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,842
I am the list.

497
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:29,680
You...

498
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,420
Let's take a ten-minute break.

499
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:37,321
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

500
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:38,389
Sure.

501
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,903
My dad already ripped me a new one.

502
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,672
Have pity on your nephew

503
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,307
and don't scold me too much.

504
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:59,310
If you shut down the business in Dubai,
it'll be fatal to the group.

505
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,211
It isn't something you can decide
on your own.

506
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,913
I've heard that for two hours already.

507
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,584
But it's the better option
than the chairman being jailed.

508
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,585
Shut it.

509
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,720
Do you think
this will make your father happy?

510
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,289
Forget causing the group a loss,

511
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,524
you're being a bad son.

512
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:14,592
Uncle.

513
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,728
I'm the son.

514
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,531
I am my father's son.

515
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,937
I'll play the role of the bad son,

516
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:29,540
so you should keep the chairman's chair
nice and warm.

517
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,611
Father needs to sit there once he returns.

518
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,520
Neither your father

519
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,556
nor you

520
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,726
will sit in that chair.

521
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:51,028
I'm not interested.

522
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,031
But it isn't your seat either.

523
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:29,667
Hey. What are you doing? Cars are coming.

524
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,175
I think she saw you.

525
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:39,843
I'm sure.

526
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,414
Did you insist on this hotel
for the meeting

527
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,349
because of Se-jin?

528
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,260
Come in, Ms. Seo.

529
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,533
I heard you and Chunha's Mr. Son
put on quite a show.

530
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,236
I heard you got rid of Gi-tae, too.

531
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,174
You shouldn't believe everything you hear.

532
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:14,712
That old man is just way too greedy.

533
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:17,181
But,

534
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,483
does Mr. Son still not know

535
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,385
that you are one of my people?

536
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,622
Ms. Seo will take care of Mr. Son
and the association matters.

537
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,727
We asked to see you because we heard
a different rumor.

538
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:31,829
A rumor?

539
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,765
Is Moojin backing out of Dubai?

540
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:40,204
Don't worry about that.

541
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,440
My nephew is being stupid

542
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,176
and doing that to get his father out.

543
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,380
He doesn't know it's just a waste of time.

544
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,383
If I close my fist,

545
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,018
he will crumble.

546
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,756
He's the chairman's only son.
He won't be an easy foe.

547
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,092
How will you get rid of him?

548
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:11,635
There's no need for you to know that.

549
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,511
I wondered if I could help.

550
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,747
You should be the head soon.

551
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,683
That's silly.

552
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,654
It will end up that way anyway, though.

553
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:46,570
An advance?

554
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:49,740
Do you think you are in a brothel?

555
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,576
But you said during the interview

556
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,478
that you can get me a few months' pay
in advance.

557
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,914
It's against the company rules
to give an advance to new hires,

558
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,851
but I can personally lend you the money.

559
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,120
Sorry?

560
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,225
How much do you need?

561
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:14,131
Think of me as a cousin and tell me. Okay?

562
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:22,606
Why you...

563
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:23,974
You creepy bastard.

564
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:28,912
-Hey, do you think you are in a brothel?
-Don't you want to work?

565
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,982
Forget it. I quit!

566
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,819
Hey! Gosh!

567
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:56,506
We meet again.

568
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,276
Didn't you come, knowing I work here?

569
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,247
I have something to say. Give me five...

570
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:05,249
no, three minutes.

571
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:08,385
Mr. Jo, wait for me in the car.

572
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,588
Yes, ma'am.

573
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,694
Will you make it brief? My day is packed.

574
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,601
Let me borrow that signing bonus
that you offered me.

575
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,105
I'll pay you back with interest.
We can write up loan agreement too.

576
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,375
I have the right to ask this much.

577
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,743
I almost died because of you.

578
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:35,312
Of course,

579
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,180
you have the right to ask.

580
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:42,052
But when you ask for something,
you should be prepared for rejection.

581
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:45,656
What I need is a useful employee,

582
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,624
not a borrower without collateral.

583
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,527
If you want to borrow money,
look elsewhere.

584
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:06,310
Things are a lot worse than expected

585
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,045
in Moojin Group.

586
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:13,216
If a fight breaks out,
both sides will be fatally injured.

587
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,486
Is that what you were thinking about?

588
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,924
I thought you were worrying about Se-jin.

589
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,695
I said there's nothing to worry about.

590
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,732
She won't last long.

591
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:41,445
-Did you call a designated driver?
-What took you so long?

592
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:43,680
Well, where to?

593
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,785
The GPS system has
a home button. Use that.

594
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,370
We're leaving now.

595
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,194
Where are we going?

596
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:34,631
Where are my friends?

597
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,199
Where did they go?

598
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:37,634
Those brats.

599
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,169
Did they leave me?

600
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,739
They can't get far.

601
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,743
Hey, let's go to Hongdae.
You know T-Rex, right?

602
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,578
Let's go to T-Rex!

603
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:57,587
Don't you know T-Rex?

604
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,323
It's the hottest...

605
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:04,327
Wait, you!

606
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:14,037
You are not going anywhere this time.

607
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:17,074
That loser, Hong-suk, told me everything

608
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,508
about how he paid you.

609
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,512
Hey. Sit down.
You are going to get us killed.

610
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,350
Don't lecture me.
You're just a designated driver.

611
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,521
No matter how many counterfeits you put on
to act like you are something,

612
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,057
You will forever be nothing.
Don't you get it?

613
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,859
You are nothing!

614
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:47,804
Shit.

615
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,411
Hey, Counterfeit! Where are you going?

616
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:55,412
Let go.

617
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:57,814
Gosh.

618
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:58,748
Hey!

619
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,383
Are you okay?

620
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,619
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

621
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:06,423
I'm sorry.

622
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,326
Daddy...

623
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:14,731
Why are you dragging this out?

624
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,333
-I'm sorry.
-Come on.

625
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,368
Let's finish it already.

626
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,670
Yes, sir. I'll handle it.

627
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,272
Let's finish up and go.

628
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,107
I'm sorry.

629
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:40,490
A bruise on the face

630
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:41,958
and a fracture in the wrist.

631
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,128
Assault and battery are such headaches.

632
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:46,796
I didn't assault her.

633
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,999
I pushed her away lightly
and she fell on her own--

634
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:51,368
If they can send a lawyer
in the middle of the night,

635
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,436
her family must be pretty well-off.

636
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,340
You'll be at a disadvantage
if you take it to court.

637
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,311
Then what should I do?

638
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,679
Settle with the victim out of court.

639
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:04,381
You have to resolve it somehow.

640
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,049
It'll cost a pretty penny, too.

641
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,686
Shit.

642
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:11,755
Hi, Auntie.

643
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:13,790
Why are you calling
instead of coming home?

644
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,159
It's a good day for business.

645
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,361
The clients keep coming.

646
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:21,097
Then are you coming home in the morning?

647
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:22,899
Yeah.

648
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,302
I'll sleep at a sauna
and go straight to work.

649
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,370
Okay, then.

650
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,206
Hey, Auntie.

651
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:31,274
What?

652
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:33,944
Nothing.

653
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:35,478
Sorry for waking you.

654
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,080
That's right.

655
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:41,084
Song-mi came in second in her school
on her mock exam.

656
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:43,720
She's holding her nose up so high.

657
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,789
She's utterly unbearable.

658
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:47,357
Really?

659
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,027
I'd better buy her some pizza.

660
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,999
-Drive safely.
-Okay.

661
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:57,901
Sorry for waking you.

662
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,723
Things got a bit complicated.

663
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:24,327
Good for you.

664
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:27,664
The dad gets fired
and the daughter breaks her wrist.

665
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:28,932
What a lucky streak

666
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,735
-our family is having.
-Dad!

667
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:49,719
Who is she?

668
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:52,656
The one who did this to me.

669
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:54,524
What?

670
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:55,592
Stay out of it.

671
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,261
Why are you here?

672
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,696
To break my ankle this time?

673
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:02,098
Here.

674
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,802
I'm sorry about last night.

675
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:09,572
I didn't mean to hurt you.

676
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,877
-I apologize.
-Apologize?

677
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,545
That's it?

678
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:20,750
It was all my fault.

679
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,254
Please forgive me.

680
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:26,623
And

681
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:30,960
I don't have money to offer
for settlement.

682
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,397
Hey, Counterfeit.

683
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,901
You can work your ass off
for every day in a year,

684
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,036
but it won't add up
to my monthly allowance.

685
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,207
Do you think I'd be cheap
and try to get money from you?

686
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,511
Thanks.

687
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:50,847
Then...

688
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:52,515
Kneel.

689
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,421
Get on your knees

690
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:00,123
and beg for forgiveness

691
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,392
for being rude to me at the auction

692
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,561
and up to what you did yesterday.

693
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,799
Then I'll forgive you.

694
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:14,137
What?

695
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,373
Does it hurt your pride?

696
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,710
Then get lost.

697
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,680
Dad, call the lawyer.

698
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,515
I want to have her locked up.

699
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,252
Hey. Why don't you just kneel?

700
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:09,426
I

701
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:13,863
was

702
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,035
wrong...

703
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:26,876
Get up.

704
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,023
You're pissing me off. Get up.

705
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:43,893
She's my employee.

706
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,996
It looks like a minor argument.
Why don't we end it here?

707
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:48,331
Can't you see this?

708
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:49,866
That witch hurt me.

709
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,404
Hey, Yi-kyung.

710
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,474
Can't you see what's going on here?

711
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:00,910
You have a terrible memory.

712
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:03,713
She almost died in my place

713
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:07,951
because of what you and your father did.

714
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,888
I'm trying very hard right now

715
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,758
not to expose you people
as the despicable beings that you are.

716
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:20,797
So don't

717
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,132
mess with her again.

718
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,758
If you were going to be arrogant,
you should've stayed that way.

719
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,495
If your pride lets you kneel
in front of bastards like them,

720
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,364
feed it to the dogs.

721
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:55,899
Do you think I wanted to kneel?

722
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,736
I'm angry too. More than you know.

723
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,274
What did I do wrong?

724
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,877
All I did was work hard to survive.

725
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,914
Why must I be disrespected
by scumbags like that?

726
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:14,284
Is being poor a sin?

727
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,887
Is it my fault I was born poor?

728
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:19,188
Of course.

729
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:21,491
Being poor is a sin.

730
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:27,363
You can package it how you want.
You're the only one who will be fooled.

731
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,499
The world will not.

732
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:33,436
You get stepped on because you're weak
and have nothing.

733
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:38,474
You're just like them.

734
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,648
I have nothing

735
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:47,984
and nowhere to lean,

736
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,254
so you thought you could control me
however you wanted.

737
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:54,123
That's why you chose me. Am I wrong?

738
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:58,995
You're right.

739
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,466
Right now, you're a cheap mirror
worth 5,000 won.

740
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:07,170
But if I set my mind to it,
I can raise your value

741
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,539
to five million, fifty million won
or even more.

742
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:13,109
You have nothing, so I'll fill you up.

743
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:14,811
If you need a place to lean,
I'll support you.

744
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,314
I'll shape you from head to toe

745
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:20,950
and use you thoroughly.

746
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:23,987
Did you...

747
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,425
Did you choose me from the beginning?

748
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:33,463
From the day we met at the auction?

749
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:34,697
I told you.

750
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,933
I never forget something

751
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:38,701
that I once wanted.

752
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:43,139
What is it?

753
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:44,340
Do you know me?

754
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,576
I know that dress,

755
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:49,379
since it's Gyung-ja Park's piece.

756
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,482
You must've confused it
for a similar dress.

757
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:56,619
No.

758
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,088
I never forget something I once wanted,

759
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:02,191
whether it be clothes or people.

760
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:19,509
Ms. Seo.

761
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,681
Can you really make me...

762
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:32,255
like you?

763
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,157
I thought you wanted to be like me.

764
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:11,694
If your ambition is real,
do not be afraid of money.

765
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:15,631
I'll buy this.

766
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,235
Soon, there will be a meeting
of affiliate presidents of Moojin group.

767
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:21,504
Gun-woo is a thorn in my side.

768
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:24,474
I'll find a way to get rid of him.

769
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:27,076
Do you even know what the association's
financial director really does?

770
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:31,114
Taking care of things
for someone very powerful.

771
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:34,450
That someone should be needing my service.

772
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:38,087
If that leaks out,
you won't survive either!

773
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:40,389
I'm almost done.

774
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,563
