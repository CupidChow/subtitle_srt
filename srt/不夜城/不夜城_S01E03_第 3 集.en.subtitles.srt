EPISODE 3

2
00:00:55,288 --> 00:01:00,093
CHAIRMAN MOO-IL PARK

3
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,870
Gun-woo Park. Manager of
Special Planning Team at Moojin Group.

4
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,439
Chairman Moo-il Park's only son.

5
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,375
He is fighting on his own
to get his father released from custody.

6
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,578
Moo-il Park. Moojin Group's chairman.

7
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:22,015
He started in heavy industry such as
construction, chemicals and steel.

8
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,085
Now, he is the head of a huge conglomerate
that includes communications,

9
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,719
electronics and distributions.

10
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,523
He is in custody while being investigated
for embezzlement and other corruption.

11
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,426
He will likely receive
a prison sentence soon.

12
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,532
Why did you stop?

13
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,768
Have you not memorized it all yet?

14
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:50,110
Moo-sam Park, president of Moojin Produce.
Moo-il Park's youngest brother.

15
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,812
He's been lobbying in order to seize
control over the group. Right?

16
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,915
The list of 270 important people.

17
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,418
I memorized their faces, experience
and special circumstances.

18
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,820
Then next is Myungsan Group.

19
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:01,988
When do I do actual work?

20
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,725
I've been here a week now,
and all I did was memorize this stuff.

21
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,528
I barely get to see Ms. Seo.

22
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,598
When do I get to do some real work?

23
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,701
This is your work.

24
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,071
Once you finish the business people,
you have to do the same for politicians.

25
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,506
Once you master that as well,

26
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,876
you move onto the people close to
the people you memorized.

27
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,778
I'm going to lose my mind.

28
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,148
Fourteen days.

29
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,282
What is?

30
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,717
Ms. Seo's record.

31
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:34,454
She did the exact same thing last year.

32
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,389
It took her only two weeks
to memorize all of that?

33
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,092
Only at nights, too.
She worked during the day.

34
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,930
If your role model can do that much,
you should shape up.

35
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,269
But why is Ms. Seo not on the list?

36
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,771
She's the person
I'm the most curious about.

37
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,307
I can't tell you about her
even if I wanted to.

38
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,476
I've worked for her for over 20 years,

39
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,612
but I still don't know
what kind of a person she is.

40
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,350
Go.

41
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,086
Go.

42
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,454
Go.

43
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,792
What did I do wrong?

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,095
All I did was work hard to survive.

45
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,132
Why must I be disrespected
by scumbags like that?

46
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,770
-Is being poor a sin?
-Being poor is a sin.

47
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,440
You can package it how you want.
You're the only one who will be fooled.

48
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,008
The world will not.

49
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,411
Can you really make me...

50
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,281
like you?

51
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,486
Go.

52
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,021
Go.

53
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,497
Soon, there will be a meeting
of affiliate presidents of Moojin group.

54
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,237
Unless something changes, the result
will not be in Gun-woo Park's favor,

55
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,505
who wants to close the business in Dubai.

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,207
That's what I want.

57
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,244
Once the chairman is sentenced
to time in prison,

58
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,047
Moo-sam Park will be the new owner
of the group anyway.

59
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,488
You never know
when that rat will betray you.

60
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,523
That makes him easier to control.

61
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,492
That's why I got him on my side.

62
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,860
Then

63
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,063
will you just watch Gun-woo Park
get kicked out?

64
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,834
I know him well.

65
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,037
He's a man of principle.
He won't cut deals or compromise.

66
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,141
It's best that he gets pushed out now.

67
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,310
That's best for him

68
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,279
and for my business.

69
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,387
MONEY, POWER

70
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,425
COLLUSION BETWEEN POLITICIANS
AND CORPORATIONS

71
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,895
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY

72
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,937
MOOJIN GROUP

73
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,406
Wow.

74
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,375
My uncle was busy.

75
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,111
When did he win over so many people?

76
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,514
Yesterday, the executive team
from headquarters

77
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,549
went to see the chairman.

78
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,685
I heard.

79
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,388
The executive team sets the mood,

80
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,292
and he'll hammer it in once the company
presidents make their decision,

81
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:27,860
"Moo-il,

82
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,797
even the company presidents agree.

83
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,866
We can't leave Gun-woo to do
whatever he pleases anymore."

84
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:34,867
Sir.

85
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,170
This is no time for jokes.

86
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,312
I don't mind being branded "incompetent."

87
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,515
But I don't like being a bad son.

88
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,421
JONG-GYU NAM

89
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,995
It's been a while, Mr. Nam.

90
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,997
To what do I owe the pleasure?

91
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,867
Please come to Seongbuk.

92
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,770
Mr. Jang wishes to have you over for tea.

93
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,506
I know you're busy,

94
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,175
but he has something to say
that will be of help to you.

95
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:21,848
Okay, then.

96
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,686
He'll be here in the afternoon.

97
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,999
KOREA-JAPAN CO-OP NIGHT
1988 SEOUL OLYMPICS

98
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,172
What about those punks?

99
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,874
I haven't

100
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,143
met them yet.

101
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,978
Give up.

102
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,315
You are...

103
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,552
no match for them.

104
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,595
Did you call for us?

105
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,864
I almost forgot what you look like.

106
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,833
-Is it ready?
-I was about to head out.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,802
-Take Se-jin with you.
-Pardon?

108
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,338
Ma'am, she doesn't know anything yet.

109
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,973
What is it?

110
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,775
If you know, will you not go?

111
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,411
I heard you asked for some real work.

112
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,382
I will do my best
to live up to your expectations.

113
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,150
Expectations?

114
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,657
Mr. Jo, you and I should head out too.

115
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,608
There are three rules.

116
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,045
First, do whatever Ms. Seo orders.

117
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,914
Second, do not do anything
she did not order.

118
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,649
-Finally--
-Do not

119
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,885
ask any questions.

120
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,988
Ms. Kim already told me.

121
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,424
Then do as you're told.

122
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,259
Don't annoy me by asking questions.

123
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,228
Why are you talking down to me?

124
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,397
I'm sure I'm about your age.

125
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,676
Wow.

126
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:31,611
DOLPHIN CLUB

127
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,045
It sure looks nice and innocent.

128
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:34,947
Why are we here?

129
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,948
Wait in the car.

130
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:37,683
Fine.

131
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,938
Don't mind me. I won't ask what it is.

132
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,723
I'm stiff from sitting in the truck
all day.

133
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,161
Cheongdam and Insa.

134
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,396
There is no consistency.

135
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,865
Where to next?

136
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,201
Jeju Island?

137
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:29,729
What is this?

138
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,182
Hey.

139
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,083
Shit.

140
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,289
You are impossible.

141
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:58,858
Hey.

142
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,160
Who said you could open that?
What if someone saw?

143
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:02,628
How much is all of that?

144
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,630
I don't know. Why don't you ask yourself?

145
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,933
How do you give out money
like you're delivering milk?

146
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,237
What business

147
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,773
is Ms. Seo running?

148
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,354
I heard you've been going around
stealing my clients one by one.

149
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,589
Are you buying them with cash?

150
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,491
Don't get the wrong idea.

151
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,360
We aren't stealing your clients.

152
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,262
We were taking care of your bad debts.

153
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,963
Take your word games elsewhere.

154
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:43,703
I knew about your ambitions
ever since you joined the association.

155
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,940
You plan to eat away at me
until you have it all, don't you?

156
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,943
-Am I wrong?
-My father once told me

157
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,978
that Chairman Eu-sung Son

158
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,449
was once called "the Tiger of Osaka".

159
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,985
He said not to make you an enemy,
but an ally.

160
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,956
I know there have been misunderstandings,
but you and I

161
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,859
will become good business partners.

162
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,894
I'll fill the void

163
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,566
left by Mr. Gi-tae Son and will become
the association's financial director.

164
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,241
You should look before you sit.

165
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,645
Do you even know what the association's
financial director really does?

166
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,047
Of course.

167
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,016
I also know that the top leaders
of the association

168
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,486
take care of certain matters in secret.

169
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,256
Taking care of things

170
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,693
for someone very powerful.

171
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:43,996
That someone

172
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,999
should be needing my service.

173
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,037
Power and influential position

174
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:06,786
He has arrived.

175
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,827
On a good day to write,
the ink is nice and smooth too.

176
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,230
Today is not the day.

177
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:53,899
Put this away.

178
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,216
It's been a while.

179
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,952
I'm sorry for not visiting sooner.

180
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,858
Is Moo-il doing well?

181
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,159
He's the same.

182
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,028
Prison isn't a big deal for his physique.

183
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,733
Your father used to fly around the jungle
when he was in the Vietnam War.

184
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,771
We had no fear and we were driven
by passion back then.

185
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:45,885
Gun-woo.

186
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,353
Yes, sir.

187
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,621
You must not

188
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,390
give up on Moojin Group.

189
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,263
The current government has it in
for your father,

190
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,531
so he has no way out.

191
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,467
That stubborn mule

192
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,403
won't agree to a sick bail.

193
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,640
The best option we have

194
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,610
is you taking over Moojin Group.

195
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,182
Your uncle isn't good enough.

196
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,287
I hear Moo-sam is gathering
the company presidents

197
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,089
to kick you out.

198
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,092
I'll help you.

199
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,397
So...

200
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,967
you help me too.

201
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,713
He's expecting a lot from you.

202
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,015
He believes the new Korea

203
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,751
must be led by the younger generation.

204
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,088
He wants to continue to drive the sleigh.

205
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,856
That's what I heard.

206
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,961
If you want to speed up
and drive through the blizzard,

207
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,263
you need to get rid of the old sled dog.

208
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,300
A young dog like me is better
to whip at, too.

209
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,907
If your greed gets out of control
at a late age, so does your vision.

210
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,376
Be a good guide for him

211
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,546
so that he doesn't get lost.

212
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,188
This is a gift from Mr. Jang.

213
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,157
It will be a useful weapon

214
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,326
for your situation.

215
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,496
My father

216
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,000
pulled Mr. Jang's sleigh all his life.

217
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,837
I'm not interested in taking his place,

218
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,206
so find yourself another dog.

219
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,295
As expected,

220
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,564
you didn't bring any good news.

221
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,033
Yes.

222
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,602
He's stubborn, just like his dad.

223
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,673
If I could get someone like that
under my control,

224
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,810
he will be useful for a long time.

225
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,913
I'll take care of this as planned.

226
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,725
What are you doing here?

227
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,528
How dare you show your face here?

228
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,065
Ms. Seo. You are incredibly bold.

229
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,935
When you think about it, Chunha Financing
is your direct competition.

230
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,303
You came early.

231
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,772
I've told the chairman what I came to say.

232
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,075
What? What was that?

233
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,576
Excuse me.

234
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,382
Hey, Yi-kyung.

235
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,651
Yi-kyung Seo!

236
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,021
Tae-joon Jang. Moo-il Park.

237
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,057
I'm almost done.

238
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,527
Don't worry about me.

239
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,496
You'll have

240
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,998
plenty to worry about in future.

241
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,300
I am prepared.

242
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,884
It's just as you said.

243
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,853
They're in front of Barun Securities.

244
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,022
No.
There's a girl sitting alone in the truck.

245
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,691
Bring the entire truck.

246
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,260
Yi-kyung, that cocky brat.

247
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,729
She needs a taste of her own medicine.

248
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,697
Yes, sir.

249
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,001
Hey. Unlock the door. Unlock it!

250
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,670
You'll get hurt if you don't listen.
Unlock it.

251
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,405
Hey, unlock it.

252
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,040
Unlock it!

253
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,475
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

254
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,111
Unlock it!

255
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:07,980
Unlock it, now.

256
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,149
-I said unlock it.
-Hey!

257
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,985
-Unlock it.
-Come on. Unlock the door.

258
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,454
-Unlock the door. Do you want to die?
-Unlock it.

259
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:17,723
Shit.

260
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,593
Ma'am, it's me.

261
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,195
-What is it?
-I don't know.

262
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,963
-They're trying to take the car.
-Where's Tak?

263
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,398
He went to deliver--

264
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,299
Fuck this.

265
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,638
Hello?

266
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,740
Se-jin. Se-jin!

267
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,278
-What's wrong?
-Call Tak.

268
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,581
Gi-tae is playing games.

269
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,416
Get out. Get out.

270
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,185
Get out!

271
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,687
-Get out.
-Get out!

272
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:50,856
Oh shit.

273
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,570
She's gone.

274
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,305
I'll look for her.

275
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,760
If you can't drive a stick shift, get out.

276
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,462
You'll ruin the car.

277
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,133
Hey, just get out already.

278
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,802
Hey.

279
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,470
-Shit.
-He wants to see you.

280
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,405
Let's go, okay?

281
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,375
Hey. Where are you going? Pull over.

282
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,211
Dang it. Let's go after her.

283
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,513
Hey, wait for us.

284
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,118
Are you going grocery shopping
or something?

285
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,354
Pull over, come on.

286
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,623
I'll take you somewhere nice.

287
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,092
Come on, pretty girl. Pull over.

288
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,860
Hey. Pull over.

289
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,016
Excuse me. Why are you blocking the road?

290
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,884
Get out.

291
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,457
Let's go.

292
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,666
What is this truck for?

293
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,101
There's no logo on the side.

294
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,003
Oh my gosh.

295
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,907
Well, the truth is, I really need to go.

296
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,876
-Excuse me?
-Where's the bathroom?

297
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,745
-I don't know the area.
-But...

298
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:54,846
Where is it?

299
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,533
Sit.

300
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,201
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,371
I was wrong for opening the truck
because I was curious,

302
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,008
and I was wrong
for not remaining in the truck

303
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,344
as I was told to.

304
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,311
Sit.

305
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,380
Don't make me repeat myself.

306
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,991
You say you know you were wrong,
so let's end it quickly.

307
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:43,895
Here's your signing bonus,

308
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,264
which I was going to give you
if I ended up formally hiring you.

309
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,633
I guess it'll be your severance now.

310
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,068
But

311
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,671
I couldn't let them take the truck
with all that money.

312
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,539
I never told you to protect it
with your life.

313
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,108
-Ma'am.
-If you work under me,

314
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,944
these dangerous things
or something even more dangerous

315
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,579
may happen at any time.

316
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,714
You were lucky this time,

317
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,383
but what about next time?

318
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,284
It wasn't luck. I did my best--

319
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,185
Your best?

320
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,154
Says who?

321
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,157
Business is like a huge machine.

322
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,526
Every cog must move

323
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,495
exactly the way I plan.

324
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,099
If you will be a cog
that gets cocky and go astray,

325
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,634
then I don't need you.

326
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,306
I wondered what you would've done.

327
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,513
I don't know what you use that money for,

328
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,182
but the money is very important.

329
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,721
No matter how dangerous the situation,
you'd never lose what's yours.

330
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,925
That's why I was determined...

331
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,561
not to lose it.

332
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,332
Putting your life on the line
just for little money.

333
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,168
Is that what your dad taught you?

334
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,504
Not at all.

335
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,741
It is worth much more than my life.

336
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,410
A god you can see.

337
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,512
That is what money is.

338
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,282
Every coin is a god and a life.

339
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,051
You didn't lose 100 yen on the street.

340
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,820
You lost your mind.

341
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,522
Even a penny has a god residing in it.

342
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,512
Sometimes, a large sum of money

343
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,914
isn't worth more than a piece of paper.

344
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,717
And yet, you can risk your life
for a coin.

345
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,288
You decide the value of money.

346
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,190
This is...

347
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,261
One yen that I cannot lose.

348
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,831
Something more precious than my life.

349
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:05,871
Let's make this a signing bonus.

350
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,241
Thank you.

351
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,209
But you have a homework assignment.

352
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,746
Don't use this money for rent.

353
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,249
-What?
-You can't deposit it

354
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,517
or buy stock with it.

355
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,820
Spend it where you think
it is the most useless.

356
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,323
Don't leave a cent. Spend it all.

357
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,527
-But, ma'am...
-Do you want to learn what money is?

358
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,196
This is your homework.

359
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,251
Don't use this money for rent.

360
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,329
Gun-woo Park.

361
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,342
Manager of the Special Planning Team
at Moojin Group.

362
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,651
You should just leave.

363
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:27,719
Gun-woo.

364
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,655
This is a chance sent from heaven.

365
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:34,192
That's right. Why else do you think
we came at this hour?

366
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,193
I know.

367
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,129
Isn't your son getting married this year?

368
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,665
You should be preparing for the wedding.

369
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,400
You shouldn't be here at this hour.

370
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,937
You can get Moo-sam with this.

371
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:50,375
Baeksong Foundation's executive director
Jong-gyu Nam gave you that intel!

372
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,413
You say you're on my side...

373
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,150
for my father's sake.

374
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,420
How can you tell me to drink
from a poisoned chalice?

375
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:06,157
Why don't you check the contents first
and--

376
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,192
I don't need to look at it.

377
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,766
No matter what, he's still my uncle.

378
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,502
I refuse to fight in the dirt

379
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,804
with my own family.

380
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,073
MOOJIN GROUP

381
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,388
INSURANCE
H SECURITIES

382
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,524
You can't deposit it or buy stock with it.

383
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,994
Spend it where you think
it is the most wasteful.

384
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,764
Don't leave a cent. Spend it all.

385
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,648
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

386
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,324
I understand what you meant.

387
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,793
You were testing me, weren't you?

388
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:50,795
You wanted me to know

389
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,931
how precious money is,
and that I shouldn't waste a penny.

390
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,767
That's why you gave me this assignment.

391
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,903
That's why you showed me
that one yen coin, too.

392
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,440
On my way here, I saw an old man
who collects discarded paper.

393
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,844
He works all day,
but barely earns ten thousand won.

394
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,080
But I have all this money in my bag.

395
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,550
I questioned
what the true value of money is--

396
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:13,685
What are you babbling about?

397
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,721
-Sorry?
-I gave you a math problem,

398
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,456
but you're writing an essay.

399
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:19,991
Are you writing a novel?

400
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:21,893
I was just...

401
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:26,197
I didn't understand why you said
to use the money anywhere.

402
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:30,769
Take that and follow me.

403
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,639
That money you have?

404
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,909
She spends that in half a day of shopping.

405
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,145
The cars that they drive?

406
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,947
That money will barely buy a tire.

407
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,117
It's the same money. What's different?

408
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,591
What's different?

409
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,760
Those people are rich.

410
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,328
They spend on another level.

411
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,696
Wrong.

412
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,966
It's whether or not you're a coward.

413
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,035
That's the difference.

414
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,006
You can't waste that money

415
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,909
because you know it'll be gone
once you use it.

416
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,977
You're afraid of using money.

417
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,114
It's ingrained in you.

418
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,316
You feel safe if you have it

419
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,251
and insecure if you spend it.

420
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,086
That's the poor man's spirit.

421
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,858
Still. I can't spend frivolously
like rich people.

422
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,393
I thought you wanted to be like me.

423
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,362
I thought you envied people like them.

424
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,136
If your ambition is real,

425
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:40,538
do not be afraid of money.

426
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,842
If you fear the weapon you possess,

427
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,611
you can't win the fight.

428
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,321
Why are you here?

429
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,223
Did you put a tracker on me?

430
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,491
Were you discharged already?

431
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,728
They must have kicked you out
for faking your injury.

432
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,197
Hey. This is a designer brand shop.

433
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,999
Go to the market to buy your counterfeits.

434
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,371
So that's what it is.

435
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,507
Are you here to carry your master's bags?

436
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,410
Come. My baby
that I have my eyes on is this way.

437
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,951
I'll buy this.

438
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,186
This too.

439
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,790
Hey. What are you doing?

440
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,859
Me? Homework.

441
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,460
What?

442
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,762
Wait.

443
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,002
Take it.

444
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:20,705
I said, take it.

445
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,842
It's your hospital bill
plus a little for your trouble.

446
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,687
I did as you said.

447
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,857
I spent a lot of money
on the most useless thing in the world.

448
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,629
Good.

449
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,431
That's how you start.

450
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,737
Wow. If I go home with all of this,

451
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,439
my aunt will have a heart attack.

452
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,142
How do you feel?

453
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,677
I'm not sure.

454
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,480
I spent what would take me
two years to earn

455
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,916
within two hours. I'm slightly in shock.

456
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,920
But I'm not afraid as I was before.

457
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:11,789
The homework was worthwhile.

458
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,059
Remember how it feels.

459
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,329
Even if you get used to it,
don't forget it.

460
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,511
I had a little money left over.

461
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,681
It's more of a waste
than Ma-ri's hospital bill.

462
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,384
You don't care
about getting gifts like this.

463
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:41,786
That's why I'm giving it to you.

464
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,071
Good.

465
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,206
My wrist felt empty.

466
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,311
You need to do the rest of your homework.

467
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:08,780
Sorry?

468
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:10,948
How much did you spend today?

469
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,717
Just a minute.

470
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,054
Once I pay for this,
it's almost everything that was in here.

471
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,624
Refill as much as you used.

472
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,861
Stealing, borrowing
or taking from someone.

473
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,763
I don't care how you do it.

474
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,032
A week should suffice.

475
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:29,667
Ma'am.

476
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,086
Yi-kyung Seo speaking.

477
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,587
Where are you?

478
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,023
We need to meet right now.

479
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,126
I just bought it. Why can't I return it?

480
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,994
I didn't swap it out. Check for yourself.

481
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,196
It's what I just bought.

482
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,932
Some people carry it to an event

483
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,134
and then try to return it.

484
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,268
I'm sorry.

485
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,574
Once it is removed from display and placed
in a box, the shoes become used goods.

486
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:10,975
I'm sorry, ma'am.

487
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,756
WE BUY AND SELL USED DESIGNER GOODS

488
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,329
Are you sure?

489
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,463
Do you think

490
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,265
I'm here to joke around with you?

491
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,766
I'm definitely sure.

492
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,235
I have numerous spies

493
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,703
planted within the group.

494
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,240
The Special Planning Team
got a huge bomb. A bomb.

495
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,711
Where could such a critical document
have come from?

496
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,781
Is there someone outside of the group
who's keeping you in check?

497
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,086
-Can you think of anyone?
-I don't know.

498
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,924
That's not important. The company
presidents are voting in two days.

499
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,693
-We need to do something before then.
-Calm down.

500
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,530
You'll soon become
the owner of Moojin Group.

501
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,632
You shouldn't get worked up over this.

502
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,301
If that leaks out,
I won't be the only one who's going down.

503
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,837
You won't survive either!

504
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,338
When a problem arises,

505
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,608
those on the same side should discuss it,

506
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,510
not threaten each other.

507
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,285
Gosh, Gun-woo is a thorn in my side.

508
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,022
I should get rid of him or something.

509
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,826
I'll find a way to get rid of him.

510
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,396
Can I trust you?

511
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,530
You should.

512
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,732
Given the circumstances,

513
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,435
I am your only choice.

514
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:47,972
Has it been too long?

515
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,309
It doesn't sound right.

516
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,447
Your coin and a song I write.

517
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:57,982
Doesn't that sound good?

518
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,019
I'll practice
and play it for you properly,

519
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,388
so let me borrow this coin until then.

520
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,031
Go with me, Yi-kyung.

521
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:18,069
Anywhere. Somewhere nobody will find us.

522
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,171
Leave with me.

523
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,196
Let me make myself clear again.

524
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,431
We'll call it even with what happened
with your truck.

525
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,968
If my father finds out about it,

526
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,806
Yi-kyung will have to answer to me.

527
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,776
My boss wants an amicable relationship
with you as well.

528
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,411
Don't give me that bull.

529
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,282
I heard she asked to become
the association's financial director.

530
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,385
Isn't that why she kicked me out?

531
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,332
We don't have much time.

532
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,568
Make sure all of you are fully prepared.

533
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,204
Are we really proceeding as discussed?

534
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,774
I just don't understand.

535
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,412
No, I understand why. I do.

536
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,615
But the target is Gun-woo Park.

537
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:41,852
I'll excuse myself.

538
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,290
It'll be fatal to Gun-woo Park.

539
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,726
Do you really plan to go that far?

540
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,961
Our relationship?

541
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,832
He is an obstacle to my plan.

542
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,768
That's not a relationship

543
00:38:58,969 --> 00:38:59,937
that I need.

544
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:06,510
It's best to cut all ties
and get rid of any obstacles.

545
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,826
You have no discipline.

546
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:24,528
How about a meeting?

547
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,065
Lend me some money.

548
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:29,900
Ten million...

549
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,937
No, can you lend me 20 million won?

550
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,438
You want me to do your homework?

551
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,774
Why don't you rob a bank?

552
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,978
I got so pissed off earlier
that I considered it.

553
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,849
I've been a client for eight years.

554
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,684
How could they not give me
a loan for 5,000,000?

555
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,853
Banks will give rich people money,

556
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,422
but they won't give poor people anything.

557
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,490
Didn't you know that?

558
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,926
I did, but it's different experiencing it.

559
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,032
You memorized everything, right?

560
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,201
-Huh?
-Do you know who Gun-woo Park is?

561
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:07,571
The only son of Moojin Group's chairman.
Manager in the Special Planning Team.

562
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,007
More importantly, my type.

563
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,343
-What?
-Why do you ask?

564
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:13,911
Well...

565
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,583
I think there's something between him
and Ms. Seo.

566
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,553
What do you mean?

567
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,756
There's definitely something there.

568
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,794
Se-jin, if you're here, come up.

569
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,195
Okay. I'm coming!

570
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,076
Did you want me?

571
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,511
How's the homework going?

572
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:49,413
I'm about to die.

573
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,950
You would've gotten half price at most
for the designer goods.

574
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:57,154
You can't get a loan without collateral.
Right?

575
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,589
So you know.

576
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,592
Why did you assign
such a difficult homework assignment?

577
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,961
Do you like torturing me?

578
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,330
You should look up.

579
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,199
Don't look down or sideways.

580
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,100
-You won't find the answer.
-Sorry?

581
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:13,237
If you want money,
go to someone with money.

582
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,040
That's what you killed yourself
to memorize.

583
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,676
Marriage announcements, obituaries,
and job changes.

584
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,046
You should use the people
you memorized all that about.

585
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,515
Deck yourself out.

586
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,617
We need to go somewhere.

587
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,120
MINISTRY OF STRATEGY AND FINANCE

588
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,991
MOOJIN GROUP

589
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,972
Do you see her in the light blue suit?

590
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,276
She looks like the wife
of the Minister of Strategy and Finance.

591
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,712
Her parents own an insane amount of land.

592
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,581
-To her left.
-Assemblywoman In-sook Kang.

593
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,650
She is serving her third term.

594
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:01,619
Right?

595
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,288
Her daughter is a successful lawyer.

596
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,724
Casually join their conversation.

597
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,660
They will become your lifeline

598
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,529
and money.

599
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:16,534
Especially make sure
Assemblywoman Kang remembers your face.

600
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,168
Do you want to get into politics?

601
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:20,938
I need her daughter more than her.

602
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,574
She'll be useful someday.

603
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:25,809
Whom should I say I am?

604
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,611
Must I spoon-feed you?

605
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,447
No. I'll handle it.

606
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:38,989
Excuse me.

607
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:40,958
Hello, Assemblywoman Kang.

608
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,094
I don't mean to intrude,
but I'm a huge fan.

609
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,031
I'm an attorney as well.

610
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,552
Gun-woo Park has arrived.

611
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,759
He's not that stylish.

612
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,895
-Really? I see.
-Yes, three of us...

613
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:35,512
Gun-woo Park. Manager of
Special Planning Team at Moojin.

614
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,247
Chairman Moo-il Park's only son.

615
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,217
Congratulations.

616
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:44,922
Congratulations.

617
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:47,558
You must be nervous.

618
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,629
Hello.

619
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,130
Hello, sir.

620
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,233
Stop going to other people's weddings

621
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,502
and find your own mate.

622
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,538
I came to check out the bride's friends.

623
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:02,940
Is that so?

624
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:06,510
You didn't come to beg the presidents
for their vote?

625
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,345
Two birds, one stone.

626
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,948
Come here.

627
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,764
I heard you're trying to frame me
with some forged documents.

628
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,701
A nephew shouldn't throw shit
at his uncle.

629
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:34,705
I know you're desperate,
but you're not the type to cheat.

630
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:38,642
Imagine how disappointed your dad would be
if he found out.

631
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,577
Don't worry.

632
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:44,481
I won't suck the company dry like you.

633
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,754
You're the one destroying the company.

634
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,222
Shut down Dubai business?

635
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,592
Why are you pushing for something
so ridiculous?

636
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,729
It's a happy occasion.
Let's use only pleasant words.

637
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,433
When you think about it,

638
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:05,135
what happened to our brother
was your dad's fault.

639
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:09,940
Your dad forced him to go
to the Middle East against his will

640
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,142
and worked him to death.

641
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:13,644
Look what happened.

642
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,712
That's enough.

643
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,817
Moo-yi will cry in his grave.

644
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,053
He's upset enough he died
in a foreign land because of Moo-il.

645
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,324
Now, his nephew is going around
trying to shut down that business.

646
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,892
I said that's enough!

647
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,666
It's a happy occasion.

648
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,936
You shouldn't raise your voice
at someone else's celebration.

649
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,741
Excuse me.

650
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,406
Excuse me. May I ask you for directions?

651
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:26,109
Of course. Where would you like to go?

652
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,645
I'm trying to get to the Grand Hall.

653
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:32,416
Just go this way.

654
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:39,590
Ma'am.

655
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,071
You...

656
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:04,848
Hey!

657
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,051
Are you all right?

658
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:09,887
Are you hurt?

659
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,257
-Are you all right?
-Sorry?

660
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:15,726
That man just now...

661
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,499
-I just saw--
-Quiet.

662
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,201
Come to the front entrance. Now.

663
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:25,102
Sorry?

664
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,204
Don't ask anything. Don't talk to anyone.

665
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,640
-But I--
-You have three minutes.

666
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,915
What's wrong? Can I help?

667
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:39,549
No.

668
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,086
I'm fine. Thank you.

669
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,433
Shouldn't we call the police?

670
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,036
I remember that face clearly.

671
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:01,004
It's that Taiwanese man who abducted me.

672
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:04,608
Hey, you may have been mistaken.

673
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,877
Then why did he run away from me?

674
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,746
I'm sure it was him.

675
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,149
Why did you follow him anyway?

676
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:13,684
What?

677
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,388
For this.

678
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,524
I picked up Gun-woo Park's cufflink.

679
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,226
You followed him
just to give that back to him?

680
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:26,163
Of course, not.
I had something else in mind.

681
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,166
You said before

682
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,934
that I should befriend rich people.

683
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,105
He's the heir of Moojin Group
and he's single.

684
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:38,141
I wanted to use this as an excuse
to talk to him.

685
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,677
Dream on, kid.

686
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,412
What?

687
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,849
If you're after a corporate heir,
find someone else.

688
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:50,087
He will...

689
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,190
be unemployed soon.

690
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:16,146
What is it?

691
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:24,955
-Hey, Mr. Lee!
-Yes?

692
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,865
Are you all right?

693
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,074
I hope his life isn't in danger.

694
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,810
-Goodness.
-There he is.

695
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:47,911
How is he?

696
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,347
Luckily, it's a minor flesh wound.

697
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,815
-Thank goodness.
-Thank goodness.

698
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:55,318
It isn't infected.
He just needs to rest for a few days.

699
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,486
-A few days?
-Yes.

700
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:58,488
-Thank goodness.
-Thank you.

701
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,257
-This is...
-How could a person do this.

702
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:01,658
Goodness.

703
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,404
We paid him and put him on a flight
out of the country.

704
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:16,006
What about the pictures?

705
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,675
Ms. Kim emailed them anonymously
to the company presidents.

706
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,511
Mr. Park will obtain the CCTV footage.

707
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,046
Good work.

708
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,141
I said that's enough!

709
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,211
I think there's something between him
and Ms. Seo.

710
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,146
You...

711
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,714
Hey!

712
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,749
-I just saw--
-Quiet.

713
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,251
Come to the front entrance. Now.

714
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:02,252
Sorry?

715
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:11,761
Did you see that?

716
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:14,631
I saw as soon as I got to work.

717
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:19,169
That means the company presidents all saw

718
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:21,171
these terrible photos too, right?

719
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,507
I heard they were sent anonymously

720
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,443
and Uncle shared the CCTV footage.

721
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:28,411
I heard

722
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,214
Moo-sam, that kid,

723
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,817
didn't tell the police, though.

724
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,887
He said it would hurt the group's image
if word got out

725
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:38,722
that his nephew tried to hurt him.

726
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:39,756
Father.

727
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:41,158
Goodness.

728
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,560
I told Mr. Yoon

729
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,831
to come with the head of HR
along with the documents.

730
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,735
I'll have to get rid of you
before you look any worse.

731
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,971
I have no other choice.

732
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,309
Father.

733
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:05,182
Uncle staged this whole thing.

734
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:09,452
He did it to push me out of the group.

735
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,121
Would I not know something

736
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,623
that you know?

737
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:16,693
Gun-woo,

738
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,462
you can't beat your uncle.

739
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,334
He has the guts to get stabbed

740
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:28,071
in order to become chairman.

741
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:32,475
That's how scary that kid is.

742
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:33,877
In this world,

743
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:38,114
the baneful and desperate ones win.

744
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:39,115
I disagree.

745
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,652
I won't back down like this.

746
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:47,123
I'll make Uncle pay the price

747
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,293
for what he did out of greed.

748
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,933
This hand

749
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,971
isn't one that can fight someone.

750
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,006
You would've been happy

751
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,576
if you had followed your dream
and played the guitar for a living.

752
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:12,916
I'm sorry, Gun-woo.

753
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:18,388
Father.

754
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:40,176
Chairman Moo-il Park paged
his assistant and the head of HR.

755
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,479
I expect a reassignment
by the end of the day.

756
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,315
He wants to fix things
before things get worse.

757
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:47,550
Chairman Park

758
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,754
seems to care a great deal for his son.

759
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,289
Congratulations.

760
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,526
Gun-woo Park is unemployed now,
as you planned.

761
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,564
I'm not the one
who should be congratulated.

762
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:06,036
It'll be a nice gift for Mr. Moo-sam Park
when he gets discharged.

763
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,977
You're all here early.
I don't think I'm late though, right?

764
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:15,679
Ma'am.

765
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:17,714
I need to talk to you.

766
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:19,149
Is it urgent?

767
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,884
It is to me.

768
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,090
I thought about it all night,

769
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,892
and I don't think it was a coincidence.

770
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,162
That Taiwanese man
definitely did something.

771
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:35,765
I'm sure it has something to do
with Moojin Group or Gun-woo Park,

772
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,270
and I'm sure you're the one who hired him.

773
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,841
I'm sure there's a complicated reason
why you had to do it.

774
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,943
-What I want to know--
-You must be bored enough

775
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,845
to play detective.

776
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,948
-Sorry?
-When will you do your homework?

777
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:55,485
I said to refill as much as you used.
Did you forget?

778
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:58,521
I'm looking for a way but--

779
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,156
Just do what you're told.

780
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:03,493
Don't try to find out something
you don't need to know.

781
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:07,697
If you need to know, I would've told you,
even if you didn't ask.

782
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,034
I'm not playing detective.

783
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,104
I just want to know more about you.

784
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,343
What you're thinking and why.

785
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,779
I need to know what big picture

786
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,281
you're trying to draw
in order to help you.

787
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,719
Just as you said before,

788
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,123
I am still a cheap mirror,

789
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:35,959
but

790
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,495
I want to reflect

791
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,331
your true image a little,

792
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:43,533
at least.

793
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:48,838
Be careful.

794
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,807
You might break yourself.

795
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:03,353
I don't like my things

796
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,121
breaking.

797
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,250
It's not for my sake.

798
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,352
You need to escape from this mire.

799
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:39,823
This is Moo-il's son?

800
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,592
We need to end the feud

801
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:44,060
in our generation.

802
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:48,198
What is she up to?

803
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:21,798
Gun-woo made me come this far.

804
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:23,700
I'll reclaim what was taken from my father

805
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,702
from the people who took it.

806
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,371
Please let me continue
to pretend to be nice.

807
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:30,874
Teach me and use me.

808
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,076
My goal and plan are much more important

809
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,212
than stupid memories like that.

810
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:39,282
You'll have to choose one day.

811
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,050
Don't you remember me?

812
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,753
I'm Yi-kyung Seo from Gallery S.

813
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:51,160
