1
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,117
When people face a predicament,

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,318
EPISODE 14

3
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,387
they spew things out without thinking.

4
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,757
They are too desperate
to escape the situation,

5
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,260
so they don't think
about the consequences.

6
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:05,098
I've never heard about the records

7
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,935
that you say Bong-soo gave you.

8
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,872
He recorded all the money transactions,
orders and memos

9
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,874
as well as every secret meeting,

10
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,878
while he was going back and forth,
helping you and Chairman Moo-il Park.

11
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,882
There are over 100 influential people
mentioned in it.

12
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,653
Many of them are still active today.

13
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,758
Why is that?

14
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:36,629
If he had something
that threatening in his possession,

15
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,698
why didn't he use it?

16
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:43,203
Why did he just go back to Japan?

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,509
I can't believe it.

18
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,712
Because he considered you
and Chairman Park

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,482
scum of the earth.

20
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:01,788
Those two

21
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,858
aren't worthy of being treated
like human beings.

22
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,929
Even if I expose them for this
and make them accountable,

23
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,199
those cold-hearted snakes

24
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,269
wouldn't repent or atone for their sins.

25
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,411
It's too late to send them to prison now.

26
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,414
The statute of limitations
expired years ago.

27
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,650
But it can end their political careers.

28
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,586
If people find out

29
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,790
that these dirty deals were made
surrounding the Olympics,

30
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,228
he won't be able to avoid social
and moral criticism.

31
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,733
I have no desire to take revenge for you.

32
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,603
I'm going there to do business.

33
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,144
When you run that business,

34
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,015
there will come a time
when you'll need these records.

35
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,390
Bong-soo sure was

36
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,094
a very detail-oriented fellow.

37
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,931
This was the only item

38
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,599
in her safety deposit box at the bank.

39
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,909
It's your secret weapon
that you can use against me.

40
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,046
Are you sure you want
to hand it over like this?

41
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,950
I never once considered using this

42
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,952
to take you down.

43
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,455
Now that it has become my father's legacy,

44
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,490
it is living up to its worth
to the fullest.

45
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,397
Burn it.

46
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,400
Yes, sir.

47
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,506
I trust the deal has been perfected.

48
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,844
Ms. Seo.

49
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,680
I may be unable to attend the funeral,

50
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:12,685
but I do send my condolences.

51
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,991
Please offer flowers for me too.

52
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,828
I plan to send him off peacefully.

53
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,932
I'm afraid I can't do as you ask.

54
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,654
Let the girl at the cottage go.

55
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,023
It's already been taken care of.

56
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,193
Gun-woo found out somehow and showed up.

57
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,878
Don't worry about Ms. Seo.

58
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,080
She probably went
because she was confident.

59
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,082
You know what she's capable of.

60
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,451
Get some sleep.

61
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,820
I'm sure you didn't sleep a wink
last night.

62
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,160
I'm glad you were with Yi-kyung
when she heard about her father.

63
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,930
I can't even imagine.

64
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,734
Her father passed away,

65
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,570
but she has no time to be sad.

66
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,121
Where's Ms. Seo?

67
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,556
She's heading straight to the airport.

68
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,126
I don't know how long we'll be gone.
Look after the gallery in the meantime.

69
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:01,761
Don't worry.

70
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,663
Ms. Kim, may I go to the airport...

71
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,797
Se-jin.

72
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,834
I'm sorry, but this is our business.

73
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,072
See you in a few.

74
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,759
I need to do the calculations for today.

75
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,998
He'll be waiting,

76
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,967
so that he can go in peace.

77
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,708
My condolences.

78
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,148
Thank you.

79
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,569
Twenty-five million yen.

80
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,405
Plus 37 million yen.

81
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,049
In this bad economy,

82
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,450
this is pretty good.

83
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,820
Don't be too disappointed.

84
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,558
Bong-soo...

85
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,461
He's gone?

86
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,497
Yes.

87
00:08:56,402 --> 00:09:01,374
How could he go first
and leave behind the sinners?

88
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,377
Goodness.

89
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:10,783
How do I

90
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,452
atone for my sins now?

91
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,492
Did his daughter go home?

92
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:21,494
Yes.

93
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,997
We should send a condolence gift
in the company's name.

94
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,566
I'm sure Uncle already did.

95
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,234
Goodness.

96
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,571
That cruel man.

97
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,342
Don't be too sad, Father.

98
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:40,913
Sit down.

99
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:47,587
Do you know
if Yi-kyung is returning to Korea?

100
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,655
Now that this happened,

101
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,326
she'll have to shut down here

102
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:57,997
and take over her father's company
in Japan.

103
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,000
She'll come back.

104
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,836
She won't easily give up

105
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,005
what she wanted to do here.

106
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,874
Didn't you say she and Tae-joon
are enemies now?

107
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,645
Why would she insist on

108
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,449
running a business here
if she has to put up with him?

109
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,052
She plans to defeat Mr. Jang as well.

110
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:25,825
I said there wasn't much on top anyway.

111
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,628
Goodness.

112
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,471
Hello.

113
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,775
You may speak with me today.

114
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,078
I thought Mr. Jang called for me.

115
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,748
It's the same even if I'm the one
who tells you.

116
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,720
Mr. Jang is concerned
that the Neo City Project

117
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,489
is progressing slowly.

118
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,661
If it is to assist TJ Foundation
before the next presidential election,

119
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,929
you need to step up quite a bit.

120
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,431
Look here, Mr. Nam.

121
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,767
I'm hitting the pavement, too.

122
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,568
Leave the group matters to me--

123
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,337
Just because Ms. Seo is out

124
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,073
doesn't mean you may do as you please.

125
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,776
We'd like a status report

126
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,944
on the progress of the project.

127
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,983
Is it his orders?

128
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,285
What difference does it make?

129
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,750
How long have you been waiting?

130
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,856
About three hours.

131
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,330
And her social media page?

132
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,167
She unfriended me that very day.

133
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,106
We've hit a road block
both on and off line.

134
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,341
Let's try elsewhere.

135
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,809
Let's wait a little longer.

136
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,478
It's a waste of time.

137
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,913
You saw her that day.

138
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,416
Mi-yun Jung has no desire to cooperate.

139
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,618
I'm sure she was surprised
because we suddenly showed up.

140
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,687
We can convince her slowly over time.

141
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,621
Se-jin.

142
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:36,789
If they want something,

143
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,658
nothing and no one can stand in their way.

144
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,461
Last time, they threatened us.

145
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,864
This time, they locked up Ms. Seo.

146
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,501
Her father passed away,

147
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,437
but they tried to use that to negotiate.

148
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,941
I am just as anxious as you are.

149
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,376
However,

150
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,679
it's because they're like that,
that we must be more careful.

151
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,250
Don't you get what I'm saying?

152
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,792
Aren't you tired?

153
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,361
You should go home and sleep.

154
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,763
There was a long line of mourners,

155
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,899
both Korean and Japanese.

156
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,301
How about Yi-kyung?

157
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,936
Did she say anything to you?

158
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,038
You pathetic loser.

159
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,107
Ally or foe,

160
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,409
you don't show disrespect at a funeral.

161
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,244
It was no place to talk business.

162
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,182
Regardless, she hit the jackpot.

163
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,384
What?

164
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,754
I heard Chairman Seo
was incredibly wealthy.

165
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,057
She's his only child,
so if she takes it all...

166
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,193
Wow.

167
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,595
She'll bounce back from the loss
from the six-month suspension

168
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,397
in no time at all.

169
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,402
-What?
-If you want an inheritance,

170
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,536
why don't you pray

171
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,238
that I die as soon as possible?

172
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,407
How could you say that?

173
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,345
But I can't say I'm not hurt.

174
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,516
I heard you and Chairman Song
are splitting Yi-kyung's company.

175
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,852
You have a perfectly capable son.

176
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,687
There's no need to benefit a stranger.

177
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,589
Perfectly capable? You?

178
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,393
My foreign investments
are pretty lucrative lately.

179
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,495
You saw the profits.

180
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,764
Don't get cocky just because
you got lucky a few times.

181
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,233
Luck takes skill too.

182
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,468
Don't you glare at me.

183
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,137
Gosh.

184
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,406
Why that brat.

185
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,413
He doesn't trust his own child.

186
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,464
Where's my angel?

187
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,068
It's almost time
for another investment tip.

188
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,314
Hey.

189
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,417
Hey...

190
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,352
Have you heard

191
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,588
from Ms. Seo?

192
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,256
No.

193
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,192
Mr. Jo and Ms. Kim called several times,

194
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,328
but Ms. Seo hasn't called once.

195
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,897
She's probably busy after the funeral.

196
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,934
Don't worry.

197
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,404
She'll take care of the business there,
take a few days off and then come back.

198
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,740
You must be so busy.

199
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,576
I wish I could help,

200
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,478
but I can't.

201
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,580
Thanks anyways.

202
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:50,950
Work hard.

203
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,994
Has the bidding matter been resolved?

204
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,429
Oh, that?

205
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,265
We just held off briefly
to pick from the companies

206
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,800
that Yi-kyung suggested.

207
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,603
We got past the Fair Trade Commission.

208
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,672
The bidding process will begin again.

209
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,476
I'll recommend a construction company.

210
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,078
No, that won't work.

211
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,548
If we use any old company,

212
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,351
there will be a problem
if we are audited later.

213
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,220
A company has already been selected--

214
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,154
Sir.

215
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,858
Do I sound like I'm asking?

216
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,429
Don't go against Mr. Jang's wishes.

217
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,365
And are his wishes, theft?

218
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,770
Ms. Seo, when did you return?

219
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,238
I'm coming from the airport.

220
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,540
I'm sorry for your loss.
You must've been very upset.

221
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:27,179
Reaping the benefits from a field
someone else farmed is stealing.

222
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,581
Is that Mr. Jang's wishes?

223
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,718
Let's call it a professional advice.

224
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,554
Stop playing word games and get lost.

225
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,322
You make me sick.

226
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,562
It's simple.

227
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,065
Construction will be performed
by Geo Construction.

228
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,600
The other companies are not
worth considering.

229
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,735
Look,

230
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,004
you heard what Mr. Nam said.

231
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,574
If I go against Mr. Jang,
it'll be a headache for me.

232
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,342
Then you'll have to choose.

233
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:58,944
Mr. Jang

234
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:00,879
or me.

235
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,683
I really don't think you're
in any position to be so confident.

236
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,118
It was a little annoying

237
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,153
because you and Chairman Son

238
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,056
let Mr. Jang sweet talk you

239
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,058
into betraying me.

240
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,897
The Neo City Project was
our joint project. You and me.

241
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,901
We can't let Mr. Jang
take a piece of the pie now.

242
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,971
Go with Geo Construction.

243
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,582
Sir.

244
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:44,289
During the period of mourning, the child
should quietly honor the deceased parent.

245
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,027
I'll take care of the project.

246
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,999
That's a shame. Okay, then.

247
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,886
What time is the next appointment?

248
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,754
You have about ten minutes to spare.

249
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,422
That's plenty.

250
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,690
Get the car.

251
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:19,791
Yes, ma'am.

252
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,738
Sorry for your loss.

253
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,073
I know nothing I say will help,

254
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,808
but I'm sure

255
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,911
your father is in a better place.

256
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,146
Thanks.

257
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,015
My father is in shock, too.

258
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,185
He asked to send his condolences.

259
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,420
Okay.

260
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,655
How are you?

261
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,924
I'd be lying if I said I was fine.

262
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,692
I'm hanging in there.

263
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,763
Do you plan to continue
challenging Mr. Jang?

264
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,831
He broke his promise first.

265
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,567
I'm not talking about
who's right and wrong.

266
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,502
You're at a disadvantage.

267
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,406
If the group is harmed because of you,

268
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,409
I won't sit still, either.

269
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,580
The world is big,
and there are many enemies too.

270
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,149
-Is that it?
-I'm worrying about you.

271
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,784
Worry about your own family,

272
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,919
especially your uncle.

273
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,498
When is he getting in?

274
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,034
There's a ship coming in tomorrow morning.

275
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,071
Tell him to adhere strictly
to the instructions.

276
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,207
If he violates any term,
he will not be paid.

277
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,575
Yes, ma'am.

278
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:02,995
I knew it.

279
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:04,696
What are you doing here?

280
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,032
Don't mind me.

281
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,734
Why are you waiting in the cold?

282
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,736
Wait inside.

283
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,272
No. I'll leave after I see her.

284
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:15,941
She must have a lot to tend to.

285
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,009
Who knows when she'll come?

286
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,144
That's fine.

287
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,621
Wait in the car.

288
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,794
It would be rude
to refuse too much, right?

289
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:38,864
Thanks.

290
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,721
What did you just say?

291
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,222
A shift in generations.

292
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,492
I said it's time for Chunha Financing
to get a new owner.

293
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,861
Are you telling me

294
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,930
to kick out my father and become chairman?

295
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:13,999
Simply put, yes.

296
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,171
What do you take me for?

297
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,507
My father may not trust me

298
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:26,044
and yes, I have an issue with that,

299
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,746
but what, a coup?

300
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,949
You read me all wrong.

301
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,417
You can't do it alone,

302
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,754
but it's possible with my help.

303
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,625
I've never even dreamed
of pushing out my father

304
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,160
to become chairman.

305
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,595
Don't dream.

306
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,597
Make it a reality.

307
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,134
Just a few months ago,

308
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,969
no one even imagined that Moo-sam Park

309
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,171
would be Moojin Group's chairman.

310
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,641
The person who made that happen

311
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,643
is offering

312
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,679
the same deal to you right now.

313
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,486
You want to make me chairman

314
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,421
so that you can control me?

315
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,690
Come on, now.

316
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,725
It's a mutually beneficial transaction.

317
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,661
There is no unilateral relationship.

318
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,637
What do you take me for?

319
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,006
I may be a troublemaker,

320
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,942
but I'm not a scumbag
who'd take down his father

321
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,110
and take his place.

322
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,180
Call me if you ever change your mind.

323
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,915
That will not happen.

324
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:50,595
Did he refuse?

325
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,066
He saw the bait,

326
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,835
so he'll circle around it.

327
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,305
Now, we create an opportunity
for him to bite.

328
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,185
Ma'am.

329
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,061
Did you have a safe trip?

330
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,029
What is it?

331
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,631
I heard you were back,

332
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,234
and wondered if you were okay.

333
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,804
I'm fine. Is there anything else?

334
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,308
-No.
-Okay.

335
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,518
Are you still looking into
Collins' real owner?

336
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,688
Yes, sort of.

337
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,324
We've hit a wall.

338
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,159
Keep at it.

339
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,328
I may end up needing your help.

340
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,236
There's nothing she can do.

341
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,906
I'm sure she's angry and feels wronged.

342
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,942
She probably wants to get back at me
for her dad's sake, too.

343
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,478
But what could she do?

344
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,215
She went out of control
without knowing her place,

345
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,517
so she shot herself in the foot.

346
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,987
I'll make sure
to collect the contributions

347
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,289
that haven't been paid yet.

348
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:07,559
I wish Chairman Park would be

349
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,996
as clear about where he stands as you are.

350
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,168
Is there a problem?

351
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,503
That fellow

352
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,072
is too calculating.

353
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,542
He doesn't know

354
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:28,113
that if you calculate too much,
you'll end up losing out.

355
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,682
I heard briefly from Mr. Nam,

356
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,284
that he hasn't decided yet
to go with the company

357
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,653
that you selected.

358
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,224
We'll have to wait and see...

359
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,160
which side

360
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,863
Chairman Park takes.

361
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,442
-Get my stuff from the trunk.
-Yes, sir.

362
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,758
-Mr. Lee!
-Yes?

363
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,026
Over there...

364
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,027
Sir.

365
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,567
Even if you consider the long term
investment value,

366
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,202
it is a sure thing.

367
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,116
-Hello.
-How have you been?

368
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,724
You are going to die.

369
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,032
Excuse me.

370
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,401
Sir.

371
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,736
-Sir.
-Sir!

372
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:10,548
CHAIRMAN, MOO-SAM PARK

373
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:26,798
Hello?

374
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,067
He's here.

375
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,169
That foreigner.

376
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:32,570
That can't be.

377
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,373
He returned as soon as he did his part.

378
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,842
He threatened to kill me.

379
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,178
He said it clearly into my ear.

380
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,446
Calm down.

381
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,716
You must be sensitive
because of the project.

382
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,753
Did you send him?

383
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:53,024
If you are overly stressed,
you may become paranoid.

384
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:55,693
Ms. Seo.

385
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,230
Threats like this won't work.

386
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,467
Paranoia leads to suspecting
those around you.

387
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,203
Why don't you get counseling?

388
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:16,848
Send the head of security in here.

389
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,016
Yes, sir.

390
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:26,691
There you are.
Where have you been, my angel?

391
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,596
Okay. Do you have any investment tips
that can make me money?

392
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,631
Yeah, that's right.

393
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,734
Okay, okay.

394
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,140
Why are you so jumpy?

395
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,409
Were you looking at naughty things?

396
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:46,878
Oh, come on.

397
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,380
I'm not a kid.

398
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,784
The association's fourth quarter

399
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,420
operation funds will go through us
then into the association's account.

400
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,355
Compare the figures with Mr. Jo,

401
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,590
and process it if it's okay.

402
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,158
Okay.

403
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,908
This one is huge.

404
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,053
Mr. Jo?

405
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,391
It's me. Come to my office.

406
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,326
Yes. Hurry.

407
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,895
He replied.

408
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,997
He said he'd get all he can
and transfer it.

409
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,967
He believes I'm an investment expert
from Wall Street.

410
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:48,039
He did well with chump change,
so he probably wants to go big.

411
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,277
Pull him along and take him
to the edge of a cliff.

412
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,013
We'll push with one blow.

413
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:57,882
Okay.

414
00:31:58,883 --> 00:31:59,951
How's Mr. Jo's project going?

415
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:06,024
It isn't as simple as you think.

416
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,594
We have a lot to look over.

417
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,431
You're too lax with the
second bidding approaching.

418
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,001
The longer you take to make a decision,
the more upset Mr. Jang will be.

419
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,571
Seriously.

420
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:24,909
Goodness.

421
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,946
Both Mr. Jang and Yi-kyung.
What am I, their punching bag?

422
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,221
Hey, get over here!

423
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,527
Catch up to them.

424
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,578
Call Yi-kyung.

425
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,014
Tell her not to do this,
and that we should talk.

426
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,248
Be quiet.

427
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,804
Remember this.

428
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,109
What takes a lifetime to build

429
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,546
only takes seconds to destroy.

430
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,081
Shit.

431
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,623
Hey, Mr. Jo.

432
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,562
No. Those funds are fine.

433
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,699
Don't! I'll report it to my father myself.

434
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:02,900
Yeah.

435
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,038
I said it's fine! Stop talking!

436
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:08,473
Shit.

437
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,744
What do I do?

438
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,950
That's right.

439
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,689
Calm down. I'll send someone.

440
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,558
He'll tell you the details of the plan.

441
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,228
I'm doing this
because I'm dead either way.

442
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,463
If we fail,

443
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,365
I won't go down alone.

444
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,002
I don't propose plans that would fail.

445
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,403
Okay, then.

446
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,673
Go to Chunha.

447
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,743
Will you really go that route?

448
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,045
What's the problem?

449
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,214
You seem to be speeding without a break.

450
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:54,886
The enemies are speeding.
If I keep the speed limit,

451
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,320
I'll just fall behind.

452
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,723
I hate falling behind more than anything.

453
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,226
Mr. Jo, you go to Moojin.

454
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:05,796
Chairman Park should have decided
to go with Geo Construction by now.

455
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,964
Yes, ma'am.

456
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,108
Is she really okay?

457
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,378
She didn't shed a single tear
throughout the funeral.

458
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,048
She probably cried nonstop inside.

459
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,349
How could she be okay?

460
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,127
These are Mi-yun Jung's request
for custody.

461
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:37,595
How did you get them?

462
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,132
I remembered her talking about her son
on her social media page.

463
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,869
That she missed him a lot,
that she had left him in the US,

464
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:45,937
things like that.

465
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,606
Ms. Moon, did you find these for her?

466
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,908
I have time to kill.

467
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,744
I translated them for her,
while I was at it.

468
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,747
I know you're overqualified
to do this. I'm sorry.

469
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,717
There isn't much we can do with these.

470
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,452
I want to contact her son.

471
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,455
If he's 13 years old,
he must have a social media page.

472
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,158
Then he'd be in touch with his mom.

473
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,927
She's prohibited from doing so
by court order.

474
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,830
She'll be happy if I give her
videos, photos,

475
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,432
or text messages from her son.

476
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,034
Then she may be willing to cooperate.

477
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,137
If she says no, well, at least we tried.

478
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,975
-It's Aesop's Fables.
-Sorry?

479
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,977
The bet on who gets the traveler
to remove his coat.

480
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,914
You're saying you'd use sunshine
rather than wind.

481
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,085
Is that right?

482
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,587
Just a minute.

483
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,426
Hello, Uncle.

484
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,929
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

485
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,701
I sold out my brother
and stepped on my nephew.

486
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,770
Yes, I know.

487
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:57,842
I'm the bastard who should be blamed for.

488
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,044
-Uncle.
-No.

489
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,280
I know what I did.

490
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,683
It was all greed and for show.

491
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,051
Yes, I know.

492
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:14,325
Moo-il, please teach your loser brother
a lesson he won't forget.

493
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,927
If you raise your whip,
I'll gladly receive it.

494
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,331
Stop your fake speech.

495
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:22,900
What do you want?

496
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,904
I was going to weigh my options

497
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,707
between Mr. Jang and Yi-kyung,

498
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,842
but I can't do it anymore.

499
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,978
I'm about to lose my soul, too.

500
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,480
If the chairman can't do it, who will?

501
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,019
Gun-woo.

502
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,755
Can't you take on

503
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,658
the Neo City Project?

504
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,829
-What?
-The group's future is on it.

505
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,198
If you'd find the balance
and pull the reigns,

506
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,634
I'll push from behind.

507
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,436
Uncle, that's--

508
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,470
Forget it.

509
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,373
Don't try to play games.

510
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,276
-Moo-il.
-You want to be chairman,

511
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,877
but you don't want the stress.

512
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:10,915
So you want to throw it on Gun-woo.
Isn't that what you're saying?

513
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:15,519
If we don't do something,
we'll lose the Neo City Project.

514
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,955
We did all the work. Why let
some stray dogs eat from our bowl?

515
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,092
You dragged in those dogs
so that you could become chairman!

516
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,426
It was you!

517
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,662
Now, you want to avoid it?

518
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,964
Moo-il, that's not it.

519
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:27,965
I'll do it.

520
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,471
We must protect the group.

521
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,106
Gun-woo.

522
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,175
If the Parks don't work together,
it'll be as Uncle says.

523
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,545
Moojin Group will be a shell only,

524
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,715
and either Mr. Jang or Yi-kyung
will act like the owner.

525
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,452
Yes. That's what I'm trying to say.

526
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,425
I'll protect the group
and complete your long-cherished project.

527
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,027
I'll do it, Father.

528
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,577
Fine.

529
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,981
I'll put the seatbelt on for you.

530
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,817
Okay.

531
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:28,886
Father.

532
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:29,887
Gi-tae.

533
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,089
How...

534
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,459
You suddenly fainted.

535
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,296
Call Dr. Im.

536
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,666
There was a situation, so we brought you

537
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,535
to a different hospital.

538
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,474
Where am I?

539
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:53,611
Don't worry.
Your safety is utmost priority.

540
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,248
Gi-tae.

541
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,817
You brat.

542
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,286
I'll be back later.

543
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,522
Gi-tae.

544
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,692
Gi-tae...

545
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,700
He may not leave and no one may enter.

546
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,538
We have the entire floor, so stop
anyone who looks suspicious.

547
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,039
Yes, sir.

548
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,313
We can't isolate him forever.

549
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:32,149
Security will become an issue
the longer it gets, too.

550
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,350
Then how long...

551
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,819
Who knows?

552
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,921
At most a month?

553
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:40,324
You'll have to take over Chunha
before then.

554
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,595
Both the company and the association

555
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,398
are filled with people
who follow my father.

556
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,066
That's why I'm offering to help.

557
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,770
We should get rid of people
who will interfere,

558
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,573
and resolve problems that need to be,
one by one.

559
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,343
You may proceed through Mr. Jo.

560
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,381
My father is to blame, too.

561
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:07,785
If he had believed in and accepted me,
I wouldn't go this far.

562
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,556
Miss Ma-ri is here.

563
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:15,526
Dad, what happened to Grandpa?

564
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:17,328
Huh?

565
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,597
Hello.

566
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,902
I wanted to go to the hospital,
but they said no visitors!

567
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,236
Is he very sick?

568
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,540
He needs peace and quiet.

569
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:31,875
You need to be patient.

570
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,378
How sick is he? What's wrong with him?

571
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,549
Moojin and Chunha have been taken care of.

572
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:40,884
Tae-joon Jang is the only one left.

573
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,389
Geo Construction just called.

574
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:52,496
The second tender will follow all legal
and company regulations

575
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:55,633
and will proceed without any collusion
or prior arrangements.

576
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,305
If we find out that someone
is using improper means,

577
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:06,910
the violating company will be prohibited
from participating in the Neo City Project

578
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,979
in any capacity going forward.

579
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,518
As the person in charge
of Moojin's Neo City Project,

580
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,488
I have given you a fair warning.

581
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,724
Please monitor.

582
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:21,825
I will.

583
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:27,698
You may go.

584
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:28,666
Yes, sir.

585
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,744
Sorry, but Geo Construction
can't participate in the second tender.

586
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:44,314
He dumped it on his nephew
and hid in the chairman's office.

587
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:46,050
You should've gone easy on him.

588
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:50,320
My uncle is very greedy,
but he also scares easily.

589
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,524
You and Mr. Jang went at him too hard.

590
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,993
I guess nothing beats blood.

591
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:00,030
It's touching to see you gather together
in times of need.

592
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,965
Leave our company alone.

593
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,668
I'll make Mr. Jang give up, too.

594
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,470
You're in charge of the project, right?

595
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:11,308
Since you suffered in the basement,
I'll move you to the bottom of the list.

596
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:16,013
Enjoy your position until I come back
after taking care of Mr. Jang.

597
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,982
If Mr. Jang goes down,
we'd have no reason to fight.

598
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,152
That's why Se-jin is working
day and night.

599
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:37,434
One hides behind his nephew,

600
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:41,872
and the other was taken captive
by his son.

601
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:48,278
They are both such useless men.

602
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:52,149
Things have gotten strange
ever since Yi-kyung returned.

603
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,852
Do you think she is the one

604
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,688
manipulating these events?

605
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,390
I'm sure her objective

606
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,559
is you.

607
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:08,432
I was going to leave her alone
until her father's 49th-day ritual,

608
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,936
but she is becoming an eyesore.

609
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,841
Look into it carefully.

610
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,543
Yes, sir.

611
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:30,721
You said you didn't eat all day.

612
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,724
Let's eat this and ruin our figure.

613
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:37,494
Se-jin.

614
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:39,630
Yeah?

615
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,698
What if my grandpa

616
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:44,434
passes away?

617
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,505
The last thing I said to him

618
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,241
was that I hate him
for not giving me money.

619
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:54,011
What if that really becomes the last time?

620
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:56,647
Ma-ri...

621
00:46:58,448 --> 00:46:59,683
Grandpa

622
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,087
They say it's bad luck
to write a name in red.

623
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:05,722
I must've lost my mind.

624
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,561
He'll get better.

625
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:13,130
Your grandfather is healthy.

626
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:17,568
He'll watch you meet and marry a great man

627
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,703
and he'll hold your baby in his arms.

628
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,207
Okay?

629
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:29,313
Hello, ma'am.

630
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,483
Okay. I'll see you in a while.

631
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,353
Your boss?

632
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:38,589
Yes.

633
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,257
She came to our company earlier.

634
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,861
It looked like she was discussing
something serious with my dad.

635
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,948
Did I interrupt something?

636
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,516
No, it's okay.

637
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:10,854
Did you get past the wall you hit
with Collins Co.?

638
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:12,956
Not yet.

639
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,325
But I think I've found a way.

640
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,733
You'll target the ex-wife who knows
the inner workings of the company well.

641
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,501
That's not it.

642
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,603
I plan to convince her
on a personal level.

643
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,139
Using her maternal love isn't a bad idea.

644
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:31,241
Targeting, strategy...

645
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,543
I didn't think of things like that.

646
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:38,482
Sure. That reaction is very you.

647
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:41,785
How may I help?

648
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:46,323
You can't. Gun-woo is helping me a lot.

649
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,362
Fine. Let me know
if you ever need my help.

650
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:56,300
You know Ma-ri's grandfather
is in the hospital, right?

651
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,001
I heard.

652
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,836
Do you know how he's doing?

653
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,271
Ma-ri is very worried.

654
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,440
Don't worry on other people's behalf.

655
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,875
You'll make your life more tiring.

656
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:10,080
This is very me, too.

657
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,297
Ms. Kim, may I see you for a moment?

658
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,707
Don't worry on other people's behalf.

659
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,241
You'll make your life more tiring.

660
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,351
RECEIVED E-MAIL

661
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:52,823
What?

662
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,605
She seemed very excited
when she heard about her son.

663
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,341
It may be easier to get her
to help than expected.

664
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:13,910
Don't get your hopes up.

665
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,314
If not, oh well.

666
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,183
Regardless, we'd be doing a good deed.

667
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:25,956
You must be busy with the company.
Maybe I shouldn't have called.

668
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,592
I have something to propose
to Mi-yun Jung too.

669
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,597
There must be a way to help her
with her custody suit in the US.

670
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,533
We have a legal team in the office there.

671
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,301
That would be incredible.

672
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,317
Hello?

673
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:56,980
Nothing is confidential online.

674
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:59,716
A complicated password

675
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,718
can't protect your personal life.

676
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:06,756
You were cheating much before the divorce,

677
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,759
so you will lose the custody suit.

678
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:14,097
Of course,
it would be a different situation

679
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,932
if your husband
doesn't see these pictures.

680
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,502
What do you want?

681
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,138
Collins Co.

682
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:32,282
Did you tell anyone

683
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,584
about today's meeting?

684
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:37,954
No. I suddenly got the call last night,

685
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,489
so I didn't...

686
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:44,494
Are you still looking
into Collins' real owner?

687
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:48,532
Did you get past the wall you hit
with Collins Co.?

688
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:54,171
I saw Ms. Seo last night.

689
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,773
She asked how the investigation was going,

690
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,376
so I told her briefly about Mi-yun Jung.

691
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:09,119
Hello?

692
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,620
Did our guest

693
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,390
go to you by mistake?

694
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,294
I don't think she's here by mistake.

695
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,263
Our talk is going well, you see.

696
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,000
Ms. Jung.

697
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:52,662
How could you cut in line like that?

698
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:54,731
Ma'am.

699
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,900
What did you say to her?

700
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,036
About her son and her husband.

701
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,740
And the information
on Collins' true owner.

702
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,611
We could've gotten it with time.

703
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,412
Next spring?

704
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,114
Or the year after?

705
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,484
This is how you two differ.

706
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:18,688
She prefers to blow them away
using a strong wind than to use sunlight.

707
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:22,559
Did you threaten her or something?

708
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:26,329
I wish I could tell you slowly over tea,
but sorry.

709
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:30,066
I have an appointment I can't be late to.

710
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:31,635
The true owner

711
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,004
is Mr. Jang, isn't it?

712
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:35,939
It is.

713
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,175
Finish this fight for good.

714
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:41,978
Thanks.

715
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,487
I guess now, you and Ms. Seo

716
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,056
won't suffer because of him anymore.

717
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:54,924
Once the evidence is revealed,

718
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,127
his political career is over, right?

719
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:03,833
I've reviewed the script,

720
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,402
and there aren't any sensitive topics.

721
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:06,703
Okay.

722
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,005
Speak slowly

723
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:10,173
and comfortably.

724
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,875
Sure.

725
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,479
Hello.

726
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:17,747
Hi.

727
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,083
-It's been a while.
-Hello, sir.

728
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,918
You're the president
of this station now, right?

729
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,053
Yes, that's correct.

730
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,821
Good.

731
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:28,024
-He's our chief director.
-Hello. It's nice to meet you.

732
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:31,328
I'm still thinking about it.

733
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:33,530
A cruel revenge

734
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,632
or a useful tool.

735
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,702
Which would be more helpful

736
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:40,704
in creating my own kingdom?

737
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,011
Ms. Seo.

738
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:49,612
You are being rude.

739
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,615
It's okay. Let her be.

740
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:57,887
I heard you were back from Japan.

741
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:00,623
Please excuse us.

742
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,172
ASK AN ELDER, LIFE AND HUMANITY

743
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:22,312
"Ask an Elder, Life and Humanity."

744
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,913
The program's title is nice.

745
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,518
The more ups and downs you have in life,

746
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,754
when you get old,

747
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,857
there is much you want to say, too.

748
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,227
You should talk about
how you betrayed my father, too.

749
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,898
A Korean-Japanese
who came over from Japan.

750
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,267
Under the guise of friendship,

751
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,070
you extorted his money and efforts.

752
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:50,907
Bong-soo

753
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,744
helped us achieve what we wanted.

754
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:56,880
And then he was discarded mercilessly,

755
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,982
using the Real-name Financial System
as an excuse.

756
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,919
You were pressured politically,

757
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:04,921
and Chairman Moo-il Park

758
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,590
wanted my father's fortune.

759
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:12,228
It was all in the past.

760
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:14,631
You probably think
you are the sole victor,

761
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,467
since one is in prison,

762
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:19,536
and the other

763
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:22,071
passed away.

764
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,775
Am I wrong?

765
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,780
I must take my throne as the king's father

766
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,917
to be the true victor.

767
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,453
Yi-kyung.

768
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,956
You laid the groundwork

769
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,524
for my return.

770
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,593
However,

771
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:47,096
you can't undo that now.

772
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:54,370
I've obtained evidence on the true owner

773
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:56,306
of Collins Co.

774
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:00,376
You used your wife's nephew

775
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,679
to smuggle out government funds.

776
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,583
Then you put it in your own safe.

777
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,652
Would the people

778
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:11,955
want a king's father like that?

779
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:17,660
HAN FEIZI

780
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,362
It's your favorite book, Han Feizi.

781
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,998
I've memorized a line from it.

782
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,969
"No one gives up in front of a mountain.

783
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:30,507
What really makes people fall

784
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,276
is a small mound of dirt."

785
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,196
What do you think you're doing?

786
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:01,104
I made a decision as I received
my father's ashes.

787
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:03,640
The cunning and repulsive

788
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,475
incarnation of greed.

789
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:10,079
Tae-joon Jang, who is blinded by greed
and dreams of being the king's father.

790
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,315
I swear

791
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:19,188
I will put you there.

792
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:22,625
What?

793
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:26,629
You will sit as the king's father,
as planned.

794
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,998
I will make that happen.

795
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:31,668
But you must

796
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:33,770
follow my orders completely.

797
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:37,140
Are you telling me to obey you?
How dare you?

798
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:38,575
Obey and get on your knees.

799
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:40,910
Otherwise,

800
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,346
the documents on Collins Co.

801
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:45,748
will be shared with the world.

802
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,052
The king's father's reputation

803
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:51,120
or the collapse of an old man.

804
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:54,057
Which do you prefer?

805
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:02,398
It wasn't revenge.

806
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,938
You want to hold the entire world
in your hand.

807
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:10,640
I told you from the start

808
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,309
that I wasn't here for revenge.

809
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,019
You can't

810
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,955
bring this on the air.

811
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,737
I'm still thinking

812
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:45,675
about how to deal with you.

813
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:03,226
Give up.

814
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,463
You are...

815
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:09,532
no match for them.

816
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:12,769
I never said I'd fight.

817
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:14,904
It's just business.

818
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,173
A useful tool.

819
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:38,261
Contributing to Society with Knowledge
and Experience in Politics

820
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:53,276
You must be cold.

821
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:57,080
What happened?

822
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:01,217
Contributing to Society with Knowledge
and Experience in Politics

823
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,420
What?

824
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,823
Weren't you

825
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,693
going to hand the Collins' document
to the prosecutor, media or someone?

826
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,832
Ma'am.

827
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:18,534
Aren't you getting in?

828
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:21,804
You never

829
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,741
gave up anything from the start.

830
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,478
You probably

831
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,247
used that document to strike a deal.

832
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:35,785
You're proceeding with your plan
as planned.

833
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:39,622
Am I right?

834
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,727
Get in. There's no traffic,
it won't take long.

835
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:49,899
Se-jin.

836
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:53,336
I'll take the bus.

837
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,507
You'll have to take a detour.

838
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:01,244
That's what I'd prefer.

839
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,046
Do you mean it?

840
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:08,017
Yes.

841
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:14,524
Get home safely.

842
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,558
You too.

843
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:09,679
