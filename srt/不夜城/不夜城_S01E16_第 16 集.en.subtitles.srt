00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:42,709
EPISODE 16

2
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,511
Why did you tell me to save her?

3
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,379
Was it protection again?

4
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,483
Protection?

5
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,952
Like last time, when you told me
to protect her.

6
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,054
It's bait.

7
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,290
She'll feel like she owes you.

8
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:03,396
She'll blame herself for what I do to you,
whether I fire you or punish you.

9
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,099
That's how she is.

10
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,636
Must I deceive her?

11
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:10,904
If needed.

12
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,650
Your words. Your actions.

13
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,119
She won't suspect any of them.

14
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,222
Not just Se-jin. Gun-woo, too.

15
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,261
Why? Do you have a problem with that?

16
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,831
Se-jin is no match for you.

17
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,433
Even if she's working with Gun-woo Park.

18
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,368
I don't think you need to--

19
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,071
Moojin's Neo City second tender
was postponed.

20
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,342
The strategy to have Geo Construction
acquire the winning company is void.

21
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,514
I'm positive it was Se-jin's doing.

22
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,015
How could she...

23
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:01,821
She's starting to copy me,
since she said she'd reflect me.

24
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,962
Then I should show my respect
and trample her.

25
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:18,705
Say you won't do it again and beg. Okay?
Then she'll forgive you.

26
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,907
She may not mean it.

27
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,676
Ms. Kim, Mr. Jo.

28
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,012
Thank you for everything.

29
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,717
Come on, Tak. But...

30
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,585
Tak.

31
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,548
It's Tak, of all people.

32
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,852
He made a little mistake
because he likes Se-jin.

33
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,954
You should've given him another chance.

34
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:09,889
"A little mistake"?

35
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:17,163
It was wrong that he lost Chairman Son,
but you don't need to kick him out.

36
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,134
There will be immediate problems
without Tak.

37
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,969
Like your security, for instance--

38
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,904
I considered everything
before making my decision.

39
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,839
Let's stop talking about Tak.

40
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,842
When can I see the proposal
for the non-profit bank?

41
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,111
I'll finish it by tomorrow.

42
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,414
I'd like to see it tonight.

43
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,618
If you want to see it,
then I'll have to do it.

44
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,143
We were a step behind.

45
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,480
Mi-yun Jung left the country already.

46
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,017
It'll be difficult to dig into Collins Co.

47
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,254
That's what I figured.

48
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,259
She wouldn't leave such a threat alone.

49
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,434
Do you have another concern?

50
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,638
Tak.

51
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,374
I've been calling,
but he hasn't been picking up.

52
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,477
-He probably got in trouble because of us.
-Se-jin.

53
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,981
There will inevitably be victims resulting
from chasing Yi-kyung.

54
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,917
If you let it bother you,
you can't do anything.

55
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,754
-But--
-Just remember who it is

56
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,322
that we're going up against.

57
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,493
I know.

58
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,995
That's good.

59
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,299
Chairman Son was discharged.

60
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,841
CHUNHA FINANCING

61
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,928
Who is it?

62
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,068
The chairman is here.

63
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,904
So what?

64
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,706
He asked you to come to his office.

65
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,277
Mr. Son.

66
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,146
Fine! Tell him I'm coming.

67
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,671
CHAIRMAN EU-SUNG SON

68
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,539
You can't do as you wish anymore.

69
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,410
I planted my people within the company
and I've increased my share of stock, too.

70
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,179
I'm not the whiny runt who crawls
at your command anymore.

71
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,215
You can't kick me out even if you want to.

72
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,255
Did you hear me?

73
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,261
Father.

74
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,964
Gi-tae.

75
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,734
I...

76
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,003
raised you wrong.

77
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:49,609
I spoiled you and didn't teach you
how to be a good person,

78
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,311
but then I yelled at you
and complained about it.

79
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,582
I'm sure it was hard for you.

80
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,486
You probably felt wronged and hurt.

81
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,458
That's why you were swayed
by what others said

82
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,861
and committed an immoral act.

83
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,632
I did it to myself.

84
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:15,601
Father.

85
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,471
Do you know who I am?

86
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,474
Do you know what year it is?

87
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:30,650
Let's forget the past and start over.
You and I, father and son.

88
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,154
Let's combine forces
so that no one, Yi-kyung or anyone else,

89
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,923
can shake our family or Chunha.

90
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,359
Father.

91
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,665
YI-KYUNG

92
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,233
Gi-tae,

93
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,235
it isn't too late.

94
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,144
Just a minute.

95
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,218
You must be with the chairman about now.

96
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,120
Yes.

97
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:14,260
Just listen. He'll try to appease you.

98
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,730
He must know he can't flip the tables now.

99
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:22,768
He'll say he was wrong,
let's get along, things like that.

100
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,171
Remember one thing.

101
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,341
The things he couldn't do for you
until now

102
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,877
and the things I created for you.

103
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:35,381
Compare the two and then ask him this.

104
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,896
I was wrong too. I know that.

105
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,265
But let me ask you one thing.

106
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,670
Given what happened, why don't you retire
and leave the company to me?

107
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,740
Did Yi-kyung tell you to say that?

108
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,808
I asked if you could retire.

109
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,677
I will, in time.

110
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,947
However, you're not ready yet--

111
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,348
I knew it.

112
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,516
Gi-tae!

113
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,186
From now on, if you need to talk to me,
come to my office.

114
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,821
Don't order me around anymore.

115
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,422
Who could've sent you?

116
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,025
I have no idea.

117
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:43,809
I'm sorry, we're late.

118
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,613
Check who sent them.
I have an appointment to get to.

119
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,566
Seeing how you came to see me
instead of calling me to Seongbuk,

120
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,201
it must be quite important.

121
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:16,042
There's a rumor that Mr. Jang is defecting
and creating his own party.

122
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,443
Is that it?

123
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,515
You can't underestimate his faction
and organization.

124
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:27,253
If you get a free ride,
you will suffer from internal conflict.

125
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,857
What choice does a political rookie have?
I'll have to walk a tightrope.

126
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:36,128
If you join by contributing your share,
you won't need to.

127
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,231
What do you mean?

128
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,501
Donate your personal assets to society.

129
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,838
Donate 90% of the assets known
to the public,

130
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,809
regardless of the results
of the presidential election.

131
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:55,014
Don't split it up,
and don't create a personal foundation.

132
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,416
Give generously. All of it.

133
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,087
Look here. What are you--

134
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,924
You'll need a means of donating.
A bank for the underprivileged in society.

135
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,595
We will set up a non-profit bank
that lends money to the underprivileged

136
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,831
without any collateral,
as a service to society.

137
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,836
This is the proposal for the bank.

138
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,074
Are you trying to feel good
using my money?

139
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,709
It's the opposite.

140
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,247
I will use the bank to turn
that 90% of your assets

141
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:32,318
into 900% during your term in office.

142
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,287
What? 900%?

143
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,790
Do you honestly think that's possible?

144
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,827
My business is making
the impossible possible.

145
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:49,935
Let me think it over.

146
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,106
I will. Exactly 24 hours.

147
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,219
Ma'am.

148
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,425
Those men work for Taeil Services.

149
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,429
Chairman Moo-sam Park of Moojin
gives them work from time to time.

150
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,341
Here are the participants
for the second tender.

151
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:34,446
The company that was colluding with
Geo Construction was Crown Construction.

152
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,282
Of course, I've disqualified them.

153
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,585
Uncle.

154
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,519
Yeah?

155
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,621
Okay. Leave it there.

156
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,390
Is something wrong?

157
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,927
No, nothing. Get back to work.

158
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,962
Talk to me, if you have a problem.

159
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,433
You focus on the Neo City Project.

160
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,608
My uncle seems to be feeling the pressure.

161
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,844
It must be because of Ms. Seo.

162
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,281
If we get pushed back now, the company
and the project will be at risk.

163
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,751
We need to stop Yi-kyung
before she goes any farther.

164
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,487
There's no further lead with Collins.

165
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,357
Once we set up a plan,
we'll see their weakness.

166
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,894
We need to be prepared
for whatever Yi-kyung does.

167
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,397
Is Se-jin in her office?

168
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,067
She went to meet with someone.

169
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,016
Hi.

170
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,985
Who told you?

171
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,353
Ms. Kim.

172
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,323
I called because I was worried,
and she said you packed up and left.

173
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,493
Sorry.

174
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,128
You've got guts.

175
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,064
How could you sneak Chairman Son out?

176
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,567
I can't blame Ms. Seo for being pissed.

177
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,904
Her plan is to rise to the top,

178
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,642
and my goal is to knock her down.

179
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,577
I don't know.

180
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,146
Both you and Ms. Seo

181
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,483
lead such difficult lives.

182
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,118
It isn't easy.

183
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:21,921
That's why I wanted to meet you.

184
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,293
If you don't have a job yet, work with me.

185
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,562
-Are you insane?
-If you help me, it'll be of huge help.

186
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,563
You want me...

187
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:33,766
to betray Ms. Seo?

188
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,069
I know. You said you'd stay loyal to her
no matter what.

189
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,140
But doing whatever she says
isn't being loyal.

190
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:45,811
Stopping her as soon as possible.
That's what's really for her.

191
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,149
I've listened to your nonsense.
Now, listen to what I have to say.

192
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:54,019
Just because I was fired,
don't think it was your fault.

193
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,724
I don't like having anyone feel guilty
because of me.

194
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,594
-I came to tell you this.
-Tak.

195
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,681
It's me.

196
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,950
I just met with Se-jin.

197
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:26,885
I refused.

198
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,790
Okay. I'll call you back.

199
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,274
I'm against it.

200
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,211
Why? You saw what Tak is capable of.

201
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,846
He got fired for helping us.

202
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:59,051
Asking him to work with us is
like rubbing salt in his wounds.

203
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,053
You said you're worried about your father.

204
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,390
Having Tak would be
like having several men.

205
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,358
-Se-jin.
-Are you talking about me?

206
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:08,927
Tak!

207
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,933
I'm happy to see you,
but I can't welcome you. It's awkward.

208
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,469
Did you decide to join us?

209
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,071
It's nothing that grand.

210
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,909
Guarding celebrities is kind of boring.
I feel like this would be more fun.

211
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,545
Will you be the one paying me?

212
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,948
Are you sure?
You'll be going up against Ms. Seo.

213
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,853
There's no need to be loyal to someone
who doesn't need me.

214
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:36,955
I need to make a living, too.

215
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:41,460
Welcome, I'm glad you came. Come and sit.

216
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,981
It's been a while, sir.
Why did you want to see a guy like me?

217
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,451
Have a seat.

218
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:06,919
Okay.

219
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,527
I heard Moojin Telecom and Korea Works

220
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:20,799
are still in fierce competition over
the next generation broadband technology.

221
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,069
If Moojin is a large supermarket,
we're just a local pop store.

222
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,440
We just rely on our technology,
that's all.

223
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,542
It's "all or nothing."

224
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,613
Whichever side develops it first
will monopolize the market.

225
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:43,088
If you're telling me to stop the research
because we'll lose anyway, please don't.

226
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,325
We will stop

227
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,027
our research and development.

228
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,699
I can make up any excuse for stopping.

229
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,534
You can take

230
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,036
the new market.

231
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,741
Nothing is for free.

232
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,245
What do you want?

233
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,048
Actually,

234
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,419
Yi-kyung and I have
some complicated matters between us.

235
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,555
Ms. Seo?

236
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,124
You'll go all-in
on the presidential election now.

237
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,962
She won't be able to
ignore your request, so...

238
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,370
I want you

239
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,540
to become my shield.

240
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,876
-Sir--
-I'm saying

241
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,679
businessmen should help
each other survive.

242
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,652
Does she seem suspicious?

243
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,623
Okay, good.

244
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,260
Don't forget to use a different phone
to call me.

245
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,103
Mr. Kang of Korea Works is here.

246
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,010
I looked it over, and the non-profit bank
looks like a good idea.

247
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,912
Let's do it.

248
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,981
You decided sooner than expected.

249
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,218
You said you'll grow it to 900%,
so I'll trust you.

250
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,688
Without that trust,
I never would've gone to Seongbuk.

251
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,991
The sooner you announce
the donation, the better.

252
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:34,333
My wife will nag quite a bit.
But I can deal with that.

253
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,671
What is it?

254
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,242
I heard somewhere

255
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,645
that you're not getting along
with Moojin Group's Chairman.

256
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,548
I think you've misheard.

257
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:54,052
Leave Chairman Moo-sam Park alone.

258
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,890
I owe Moojin a lot from the days
when I began as a venture capitalist,

259
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,893
and we've been competing
over a new technology recently.

260
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:06,598
If you mess with him,
people would be misunderstood.

261
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,568
It may cause bad rumors
during my campaign, too.

262
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,939
You know what I mean, don't you?

263
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,676
Did Chairman Park ask you himself?

264
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,750
I can't lie in front of you.

265
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:31,290
That's right. I promised to mediate,
for old time's sake.

266
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,261
So please help me look good.

267
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,370
He's greedier than anticipated.

268
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,644
It's disappointing
because he is so obvious.

269
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,247
Chairman Park must have promised
something huge in exchange.

270
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,183
I had no intention of getting rid
of Chairman Park anyway.

271
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,755
I worked hard to make him chairman.
I wouldn't take him down myself.

272
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,492
But thanks to him, Mr. Kang agreed
to make the donation,

273
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,462
so I owe Chairman Park my gratitude.

274
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,230
Is that what it was?

275
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:13,865
What about Chairman Son?

276
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,836
I've hired some skilled paparazzi.
They won't be as good as Tak, but--

277
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:18,970
Mr. Jo.

278
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm sorry.

279
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,744
I didn't notice from the inside,
but it's air-tight from the outside.

280
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:02,080
She's thorough. That's how Ms. Seo is.

281
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,350
I should've just protected celebrities.

282
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,491
Don't you get tired?

283
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,196
If you don't think you'll win,
you can always give up.

284
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,101
No. I don't want to lose Ms. Seo.

285
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:28,774
Se-jin.

286
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:30,609
Turn on the news.

287
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:34,246
Presidential candidate Jae-hyun Kang,
the CEO of Korea Works,

288
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,982
announced he'd make a tremendous donation.

289
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,452
He announced that he'd donate
a majority of his personal assets,

290
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,921
including real estate, stock,
and money to society.

291
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,523
During today's interview,

292
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,793
he said he'd relay his vision
to the people.

293
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,629
I know people are judging me,

294
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,999
saying that I, who made big money
in the IT business,

295
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,367
am snooping around politics.

296
00:23:55,834 --> 00:24:00,839
The reason I want to enter politics is
to reply to a summons for a new world.

297
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,644
I decided to donate my assets
to show how sincere I am.

298
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,947
It's not a small amount,
90% of your personal assets.

299
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,883
How will you make your donation?

300
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,319
I will donate it, just as I said.

301
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,789
I don't plan to donate little by little
and then stop.

302
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,459
I don't plan to create a foundation
in my name, either.

303
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:25,497
Big Love Bank will be operated
transparently and fairly to give hope

304
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,099
to the underprivileged in society.

305
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:35,240
I think I know how Yi-kyung plans
to use that bank.

306
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,509
The charitable loans are fake, right?

307
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,578
They'll use small money
to pretend to do good deeds,

308
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,281
but it'll be used to maintain a slush fund
behind the scenes.

309
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,251
Aren't you being paranoid?
You don't know that.

310
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,386
With the Ms. Seo that I know,
I'm positive.

311
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,991
We'll find out from now on
whether we're right or wrong.

312
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,996
Do you think that Jae-hyun Kang knows?

313
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,197
It's half-half.

314
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,133
He may be being used
without knowing anything.

315
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,547
You should've told us
about Jae-hyun Kang's donation.

316
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,115
Why is that?

317
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,051
Mr. Jang was very surprised and hurt.

318
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,855
Sorry, but he'll be more surprised
and hurt.

319
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:36,001
I'm probably an eyesore to Chairman Son.

320
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,371
He must be nervous
that he'll lose Chunha Financing.

321
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,839
But...

322
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,911
why would Mr. Nam have met him
secretly like this?

323
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:52,150
-Ms. Seo, that was--
-I can guess what it was about.

324
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,487
You probably discussed reducing
my influence over TJ Foundation

325
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,391
or getting the association to join you
in attacking me.

326
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,727
What I really want to know...

327
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,732
is whether it's something you ordered.

328
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,068
That's all.

329
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,472
Did you order him to eliminate me?

330
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,978
-Mr. Jang.
-I'm sorry, sir.

331
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:25,083
I did something foolish
without asking for your permission.

332
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,885
I'm sorry for causing you harm.

333
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,794
This is unlike you to make such a mistake.

334
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,032
My apologies.

335
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:46,037
If every problem
could be resolved with apologies,

336
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,773
life would be so much easier.

337
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,813
I'll let you deal with him.

338
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,087
Nam.

339
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:04,689
Yes, sir.

340
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:08,627
You did great work for me...

341
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:13,565
over the years, no matter how hard it was.

342
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,602
Mr. Jang.

343
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:23,908
You should go out there
and do greater things now.

344
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,849
I'll let you say your farewells.

345
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,951
I'll go now.

346
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:51,636
Tell me.

347
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:55,473
I think Se-jin and Gun-woo Park plan
to investigate the non-profit bank.

348
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,442
That was quick.

349
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,011
I think they plan to contact
Jae-hyun Kang.

350
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,212
I'm sure.

351
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,581
What should I do?

352
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,751
You should help her.
That's why you're there.

353
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,256
Is that a problem?

354
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,027
Will Se-jin...

355
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:18,697
get hurt?

356
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,066
You should ask her directly.

357
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:26,237
Ask whether she wants to get hurt
or give up if she's scared.

358
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,957
Tak, Korea Works is incredible.

359
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,625
They have so many patents.

360
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,261
It really is a legend in the IT world.

361
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,332
They're all the same.

362
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:03,308
How long will I be on stand-by in here?
I'm not built to be indoors.

363
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:07,345
Tak.

364
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:08,813
What?

365
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,448
Thanks for coming.

366
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:17,188
Having you help me makes me feel like
someone understands me.

367
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,194
I'm not built for
your sappy comments, either.

368
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,820
After announcing that he'd donate
his entire fortune yesterday,

369
00:30:55,887 --> 00:31:00,124
Korea Works' CEO Jae-hyun Kang's
approval rating has jumped overnight.

370
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,429
He had been in the single digits
and had consistently been fourth or fifth,

371
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:08,733
but he recorded 18% in ratings
and jumped to second place.

372
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,304
Politicians always say
they work for the people,

373
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:18,209
but they only take care of themselves.
But Jae-hyun Kang seems to be different.

374
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,445
My friends are flipping out, too,

375
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,747
that they never saw a politician
give up their entire fortune.

376
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,684
The job market is terrible right now.
I think it'll be better thanks to him.

377
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,757
Split up the company?

378
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,426
Chairman Son won't want
to make up with me.

379
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,997
Rather than father and son practicing
attrition warfare within the same company,

380
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,465
it's better to split up.

381
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,370
But if we split the company in half...

382
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,038
Did you watch the news?

383
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,507
The non-profit bank
Jae-hyun Kang is creating.

384
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,544
-I did.
-You will invest with him

385
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,812
as one of its founding members.

386
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,483
Of course, it'll be a special bank
unlike other banks,

387
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,152
and your duties will be very different.

388
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,324
Like how Mr. Jang managed his funds
through the association?

389
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,661
Big Love Bank will be Mr. Kang's safe.

390
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:15,967
However,

391
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,603
there is one problem.

392
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:24,008
I made a foreign investment
and lost big recently.

393
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,810
And?

394
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:31,816
It was company funds, so my father
is demanding that I pay it back.

395
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,286
You don't call that a problem.

396
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:43,895
What is it?

397
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,931
You look well. I'm glad.

398
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,635
You are so good at saying things
you don't mean.

399
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,439
I heard there was an error
in Mr. Son's handling of company funds.

400
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,074
It wasn't an error. It was embezzlement!

401
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,643
Even if he wants to remain
the company president,

402
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,545
if he can't refill what he took,
he should step down.

403
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,548
Do you enjoy threatening your son?

404
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,750
Stop talking nonsense and bring the money!

405
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,756
It's not a small amount.
How could he do that?

406
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,266
Here. Check it.

407
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,440
CASHIER'S CHECK

408
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,945
It's the principal plus interest.

409
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:37,949
That's right.

410
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,486
Mr. Son says he has something to say.

411
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,975
I'll take my share of the company stock
and split up the company.

412
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:05,710
What?

413
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:10,715
Call the finance team and the legal team,
since we need to count down to bits.

414
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,922
CHUNHA FINANCING

415
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:25,263
Would Mr. Son and half a company
help Big Love Bank?

416
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,766
Chairman Son would cut off his arm
than split up the company.

417
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,370
He'll end up following his son
and get dragged in.

418
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,412
-Wait downstairs.
-Yes, ma'am.

419
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:46,517
Hey.

420
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,386
They made an appointment
with Jae-hyun Kang.

421
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,922
Go with them. Follow the plan.

422
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,223
Understood.

423
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,534
-They will see you in the parking lot.
-Okay.

424
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,482
Do you know Jae-hyun Kang personally?

425
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,353
-I met him a few times.
-What is he like?

426
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:28,493
He is smart and personable.
Also, he is passionate about what he does.

427
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,962
There's plenty of reason
why he's successful.

428
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:32,730
Why?

429
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:37,702
If Ms. Seo chose him,
there must be another reason.

430
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,138
It's greed.

431
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,807
It's not like I can take it with me
when I die.

432
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,811
What's the point in holding onto it?
It's all greed.

433
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,248
But not anyone can donate
their entire fortune.

434
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,519
It's hard to come to the decision.
Once you do, it's easy.

435
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,955
Ms. Yi-kyung Seo proposed
the non-profit bank, didn't she?

436
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:03,194
Gun-woo, I know you introduced us,
but I forgot.

437
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,464
She worked at Gallery S
under Yi-kyung Seo.

438
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:11,068
I'm sure she proposed the non-profit
for another motive.

439
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,070
Another motive?

440
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,574
To manage a slush fund.

441
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:21,846
I know Ms. Seo is controlling
even Mr. Jang.

442
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,082
You may end up becoming a victim as well.

443
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:26,484
Wait. Hold on.

444
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,590
I heard that Ms. Seo is having problems
with Moojin Group,

445
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:37,228
but I can't trust you
without any evidence.

446
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,664
A slush fund?

447
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:43,100
We will investigate
and find that evidence.

448
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,803
You entered politics with good intentions.

449
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,506
You shouldn't let it get polluted
by ulterior motives.

450
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,443
We will help you.

451
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:57,715
Ms. Seo...

452
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,619
shouldn't hear about our conversation,

453
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:03,721
correct?

454
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,792
It's Jae-hyun Kang.

455
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,660
-Hi.
-Hello.

456
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,628
It's nice to meet you.

457
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,597
-You're so handsome.
-Thank you.

458
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:13,931
I want an autograph too.

459
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,833
-My parents are fans too.
-Really?

460
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,401
-Thank you.
-You're so cool.

461
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:19,370
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

462
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,638
-Good luck.
-He's so cool.

463
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,275
-See you again.
-Goodbye, then.

464
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,717
-Did you get anything?
-Not really.

465
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,152
He doesn't seem to know
that he's being used.

466
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,823
But we made progress.
He said he'd cooperate.

467
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,925
Having a corporate heir's connections
helped.

468
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,761
Otherwise, how would we have met
someone famous like him?

469
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,797
It's all because I was good.

470
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,475
What did you just say?

471
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,710
He has two cell phones.

472
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:04,115
When he talks outside of the office,
he uses a different phone.

473
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,152
Ms. Moon, are you suspecting Tak?

474
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,021
I'm saying we should make sure.

475
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,022
Ms. Moon.

476
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,523
Calm down.

477
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:17,295
Tak saved me several times.
You saw at the hospital.

478
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,363
He helped us, knowing it would
put him in danger.

479
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,034
And he was fired from Gallery S.
How could you suspect him?

480
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,172
Do you...

481
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,941
not trust him?

482
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:37,114
The Yi-kyung that we know would have
an idea of what we're trying to do.

483
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,717
Would she sit back and do nothing?

484
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,688
The suspicions about Tak
are just speculation.

485
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,222
It wouldn't be the first time.

486
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,961
Yi-kyung used you like that, too.

487
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,898
That was...

488
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,701
What I did then was...

489
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,140
What is it?

490
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:08,713
Take out your phone.

491
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,114
Se-jin.

492
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,583
-What's going on?
-Take it out.

493
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,353
What's wrong with you?

494
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,356
Is this it?

495
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:28,032
-That's the one he normally uses.
-Do you have another phone?

496
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,468
-What?
-Show them.

497
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,839
Show them that you're innocent,
so they won't suspect you.

498
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,778
This is quite offensive.

499
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,953
Let me check your coat and inside pockets.

500
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,490
Sorry Tak, but please.

501
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,109
Are you satisfied?

502
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,518
I'm sorry for suspecting you,
but we had to make sure.

503
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,756
I guess I should just protect celebrities.

504
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,995
Tak!

505
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,765
I'm sorry, sir.

506
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:41,772
No. I may not have shown it,
but I felt the same way.

507
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,245
Then you should suspect me, too.

508
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,881
You shouldn't just doubt Tak.

509
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:54,318
Why don't you think I was sent here
by Ms. Seo as well?

510
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,353
Se-jin.

511
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:18,809
Ms. Moon looked like
she'd be very quick to notice things.

512
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,745
So I called you from the hallway.

513
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,483
Suspicion. Guilt. Resentment.

514
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:29,487
Those are worms that eat away at the soul.

515
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:34,191
It's probably eating away at Se-jin
right now.

516
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:36,327
Then

517
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:38,529
am I done?

518
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,531
What about the file?

519
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,199
I planted it.

520
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,035
It'll be noisy for a while.

521
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,737
Stay low for a while.
Consider it a vacation.

522
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,841
Don't tell even me
where you are or what you're doing.

523
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,544
Okay.

524
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,115
Do you want to eat?

525
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:02,052
My grandpa gave me lots of money
to take you out to eat.

526
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,424
Or what, do you want to drink?
Let's drink until we die.

527
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,694
Want to go for a drive?
It's a great stress relief to drive.

528
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,498
Se-jin.

529
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:18,836
GUN-WOO PARK

530
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:28,078
Did you fight with the corporate heir?
He seems to look out for you a lot.

531
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,184
-Ma-ri.
-Yeah?

532
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,455
I want to be good to people,

533
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,492
but I keep making mistakes.

534
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:48,532
So there are more and more people
that I feel sorry for or hate.

535
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:55,205
-That upsets me so much.
-No, you're not like that.

536
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:00,044
Who said that? Bring them to me.
I'll beat the crap out of them.

537
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:01,745
I'll kick them, too.

538
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,017
Yeah, you're too ugly.
You need to smile at all times.

539
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,552
That way, you're bearable.

540
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:09,954
Why you...

541
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,255
Let's go eat.

542
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:22,032
The phone has been turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

543
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,096
SEVEN MISSED CALLS

544
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,674
TAK

545
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:12,082
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

546
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,121
You want me...

547
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,490
to betray Ms. Seo?

548
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:20,858
Don't you get tired?

549
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,929
If you don't think you'll win,
you can always give up.

550
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:32,336
The Yi-kyung that we know would have
an idea of what we're trying to do.

551
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,505
Would she do nothing?

552
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:37,341
The suspicions about Tak
are just speculation.

553
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:38,809
It wouldn't be the first time.

554
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:28,625
Thank you for meeting with me
although I've been removed from my post.

555
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:33,797
I know why you wanted to meet.
We're all in the same boat.

556
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,936
Yi-kyung plans to use my son
to split up my company.

557
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,774
Locking me up in the hospital
wasn't good enough.

558
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:48,512
That's nothing.
She had a thug threaten to kill me.

559
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:49,980
She did?

560
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,449
I used my connections
and barely resolved it,

561
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,752
but my life isn't what it used to be.

562
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,623
Even Mr. Nam got pushed out,
after serving Mr. Jang all his life.

563
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:05,395
Mr. Jang's position isn't very different
from yours.

564
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:07,664
Ever since he lost his authority
to Ms. Seo,

565
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,299
he has been quite a sad sight.

566
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:14,171
I may have left Seongbuk,

567
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,474
but I plan to give my all to my master.

568
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:27,484
I'm sure you feel the same way.
Will you join me?

569
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,288
What do you mean?

570
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:35,025
We need to take down Yi-kyung Seo.

571
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:44,968
Hey.

572
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:47,971
What?

573
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,506
The door is opening.

574
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,612
The door is closing.

575
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,425
Let's go.

576
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:13,096
-What's going on?
-There must be a misunderstanding.

577
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:14,331
About what?

578
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:17,734
They say I stole Korea Works' technology.

579
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:18,669
What?

580
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,406
You're wrong. No one here would do that.

581
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:24,641
Are you Se-jin Lee?

582
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:26,476
-Yes.
-Okay.

583
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:30,681
You'll have to come in the near future
as well for questioning.

584
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,417
-Let's go.
-Don't go with him.

585
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,887
It's okay. It'll be fine.

586
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:39,756
I'm sorry about yesterday.

587
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,326
No, I was...

588
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,027
Let's go.

589
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:10,954
What?

590
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:14,091
Are you saying Moojin planned it
from the start?

591
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,927
To steal our technology?

592
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:20,397
What did you talk about
with Chairman Park?

593
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,367
Don't give me useless lies.

594
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:29,673
I'm sure he promised you something.

595
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,976
He said if I'd mediate on his behalf,

596
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,112
he'd give up the war
on the new technology.

597
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,847
Did you believe him?

598
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:40,284
It was obviously a lie
to make you feel safe.

599
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,353
You met with Gun-woo Park too, didn't you?

600
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:48,091
He knew the real objective
of the non-profit bank.

601
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,060
But you kept it from me.

602
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,063
Including the fact
that you met with Gun-woo Park.

603
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,567
Ms. Seo.

604
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,408
Yes?

605
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,511
Are you sure?

606
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,813
Okay.

607
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:16,853
They found data on our new technology
in the computer they confiscated.

608
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,322
I'm not surprised.

609
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:22,059
They set up an office outside
of the company in order to do that.

610
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,296
Mr. Kang.

611
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:30,434
If you want to win the election,
don't lie to me.

612
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:35,973
If you repeat the same mistake,
you will lose much.

613
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:41,611
I understand what you mean.

614
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,320
Everyone in the legal team ran over
to the prosecutor's office.

615
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:51,989
Even if they found evidence,

616
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:55,058
it doesn't prove culpability,
so don't worry.

617
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:58,895
Moo-sam.

618
00:49:58,962 --> 00:49:59,830
Yes, Moo-il.

619
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:06,503
How would it look if father and son
both end up in prison?

620
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,574
That won't happen. Don't worry.

621
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,910
I know my son.

622
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:19,716
Gun-woo would never steal from anyone.

623
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,318
I know that too.

624
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:26,890
Moo-sam.

625
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,393
Just do two things.

626
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:33,063
Get Gun-woo out safely.

627
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:34,598
And then...

628
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:40,670
find out who did
something this despicable.

629
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,345
Once you do, I'll take care of the rest.

630
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:58,155
The phone has been turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

631
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:04,428
I can't reach Tak. His phone is off.

632
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,698
This was a trap.

633
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,737
There's no way Korea Works' file
would be in our computer.

634
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:18,608
Somebody planted it there.

635
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:23,080
You don't mean Tak did it, do you?

636
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:23,980
If not,

637
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,517
you did it.

638
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:30,954
Did you?

639
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,501
Se-jin. What is it?

640
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:46,536
Where's Ms. Seo?

641
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,771
She's out.

642
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,907
-What is it?
-Where's Tak?

643
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,710
He was fired because of you.
You know that.

644
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,079
He finished his assignment,
so he should be back.

645
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,482
What are you talking about? He was fired.

646
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:02,552
Se-jin, please tell us what this is about.

647
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:16,633
Ms. Kim.

648
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:22,139
Did you hack into Korea Works
by any chance?

649
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:23,974
Did Ms. Seo have you do it?

650
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:28,979
No, I've never heard
of that company before.

651
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:35,285
-That's a lie.
-Se-jin.

652
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,092
Ms. Seo.

653
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:47,397
Prevention of Unfair Competition Act.
Trade Secret Protection Act.

654
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,767
In other words, it's corporate espionage.

655
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:55,805
You can't let someone like that
run the Neo City Project.

656
00:52:55,906 --> 00:53:01,011
I just came from visiting my brother.
I'm busy enough clearing Gun-woo's name.

657
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:03,847
Are you telling me to fire him?

658
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:06,650
I didn't leave the chairman alone
because I'm afraid of Gun-woo Park.

659
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,953
It wasn't because Jae-hyun Kang
mediated for you, either.

660
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:17,727
When I was fighting Mr. Jang for power,

661
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:20,297
I'm sure it was difficult for you
being in the middle.

662
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:23,633
CHAIRMAN, MOO-SAM PARK

663
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:28,905
Even greed needs a break.

664
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,377
Now that situations have been settled
and you've gotten plenty of rest,

665
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,347
you'll have to follow my plan.

666
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,193
And if I don't?

667
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,363
It's difficult to make,
but easy to destroy.

668
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,232
Will you threaten me again?

669
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,286
CHAIRMAN, MOO-SAM PARK

670
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:20,757
Taking this seat away from you
won't take any effort.

671
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,260
Is that what you want?

672
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:30,834
There is only one path before you.

673
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:36,673
Follow me.

674
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,080
Your suspicions were right.

675
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:23,119
Tak deceived us.
He planted evidence in our computer.

676
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,655
I'm sure Ms. Seo made him do it.

677
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,491
I'm sorry.

678
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:30,894
Don't worry.

679
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,931
The company lawyers came by.

680
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,235
They said it may be a long investigation
because of the evidence,

681
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,372
but it'll be difficult for them
to lock me up.

682
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,309
That's not the problem right now.

683
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:49,879
You shouldn't have to go through this.

684
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,316
I was stupid.

685
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,053
If only I had listened to Ms. Moon.

686
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,456
-Se-jin.
-Everything's a mess.

687
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,026
I can't do anything right.

688
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,262
Don't get knocked down as she wants.

689
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,835
Yi-kyung wants to tie me up
and isolate you,

690
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:16,573
and make you blame yourself
and be miserable.

691
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:19,576
That's what she's after.

692
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:24,147
Yi-kyung is fine.

693
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,884
So let's not get tired first.

694
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,687
We knew that, but we still got suckered.

695
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,491
That's why I feel pathetic.

696
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,026
It makes me so angry.

697
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:45,001
Se-jin.

698
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:22,005
Curse me, if you want.
Hit me, if you want.

699
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:26,743
You said

700
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,347
you'll do your job, and I should do mine.

701
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,751
My job is being loyal to Ms. Seo.

702
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,254
I know how you must've felt,

703
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:41,591
since I did it, too.

704
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:48,364
The other person trusts me
without any hesitation, and each time,

705
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,201
it stabs at my conscience.

706
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:54,871
Then it feels like I'll actually bleed.

707
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:56,940
-Se-jin.
-Because I like Ms. Seo,

708
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,175
I want to be loyal, like you.

709
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:00,810
But if I keep at it,

710
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:03,913
I'm the one who will be destroyed.

711
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:09,886
That was too harsh and painful.
That's why I left her.

712
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:15,725
You may have done that,
but I have no regrets.

713
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:21,130
She's the one who should regret it.

714
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,467
She drags people to rock bottom

715
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:29,005
in order to get what she wants,
and corners them into a dead end.

716
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,107
She's a monster.

717
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,477
-Give it up.
-I can't.

718
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:35,478
You...

719
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:37,947
can't win.

720
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:44,420
I knew that when I started.

721
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:45,455
Se-jin.

722
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:04,307
What are you doing? Open up. Se-jin.

723
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,215
Ask yourself, Se-jin.

724
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,050
Do you want to be like me?

725
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:15,952
I'll create you from head to toe

726
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,453
and use you thoroughly.

727
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:19,789
That looks like a new game.

728
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:22,392
It's a game for people
who fear their greed.

729
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:25,161
-I was never afraid.
-That's what you want to believe.

730
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,163
This isn't the end.

731
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,266
I haven't even begun yet.

732
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:32,802
Your world...

733
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:34,971
will become hell from now on.

734
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,493
You should've just hit me.

735
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:33,696
That's your limit.

736
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:34,764
I know...

737
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:38,401
that as a person, this is my limit.

738
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:42,005
Gun-woo doesn't hate you.

739
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,675
He just wants to protect his family.

740
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,378
Tak says he doesn't regret it,

741
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,547
since he was loyal to you.

742
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:54,617
And?

743
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,056
I...

744
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,626
hate you.

745
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:06,996
I regret it to no end.

746
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:11,501
Tell me one thing.

747
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:15,938
Did you want to make me a monster...

748
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,741
like you?

749
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:28,451
Answer my question first.

750
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:33,189
Did you believe you could change me?

751
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:34,424
Definitely.

752
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:38,094
Then I'll answer you, too.

753
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:45,501
You will become me someday.

754
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,410
I thought you'd be happy. Are you not?

755
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:58,948
I'm happy.

756
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:02,618
I just realized, you see,

757
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:06,656
that anything you do,

758
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:09,726
I can do.

759
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:16,432
I'll see you in hell.

760
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:20,103
Sure.

761
01:02:56,672 --> 01:03:01,043
I guess Chairman Park doesn't have
the courage to confront Ms. Seo.

762
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:10,319
Oh well. You and I will have to
team up ourselves.

763
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:13,723
Someone else is coming.

764
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:03,072
