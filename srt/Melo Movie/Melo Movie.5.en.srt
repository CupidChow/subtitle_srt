00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,934
FIVE YEARS AGO, WINTER

3
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,437
Hello. Hi there.

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,105
- Good morning.
- Hi.

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,858
Hello, Mr. Park.

6
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,986
- Were you called on set today?
- No.

7
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,238
Yet you come in
every single day, don't you?

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,949
Do you like being on set that much?

9
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,702
I'm sensing a freak here.

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,124
I love it. I love it so much, Mr. Park.

11
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>And everyone who knew Ko Gyeom knew it.</i>

12
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,554
I told you not to do that.

13
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,890
But why? Am I not allowed to help?

14
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,018
You aren't helping at all.

15
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,438
I don't want people to gossip about me,

16
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,608
so will you please just leave me alone?

17
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,193
But nobody's…

18
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,782
I think you understand now.

19
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:21,998
<i>And that's how I thought</i>
<i>I'd find my peace again.</i>

20
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,084
<i>But…</i>

21
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,835
TAKE ONE EACH!

22
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,506
There aren't any left?

23
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:39,265
Hey, I'm the director here.
Didn't you put one aside for me?

24
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:44,604
You said you'd be too stressed
to eat anything while on set.

25
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,773
You literally yelled your head off.

26
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,526
I did… I did no such thing.

27
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,530
Why couldn't they send enough snacks
for everyone?

28
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,949
Is our budget getting low?

29
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,912
There aren't any left?

30
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,915
I guess I'm too late.

31
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,919
Man, I hate the way you snarf it up.

32
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,006
Excuse me.

33
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,924
- Ms. Kim.
- Are we there?

34
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,468
I need to sit there,
so please switch seats with me.

35
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,803
Sorry?

36
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,431
Why? What is it, Gyeom?

37
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,976
I'll sit next to you.
I was asking you about stuff earlier.

38
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,478
Let's talk some more. Come on.

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,945
I thought we had arrived.

40
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,954
- What is it?
- Yes?

41
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,664
What?

42
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,749
Go back to sleep.

43
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,127
I can go back to sleep?

44
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,666
Can someone give me a hand?

45
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,251
Yes.

46
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,169
Here. I'll help you!

47
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,509
Mr. Ma told me to move those.

48
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,594
All right. What about this one?

49
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,557
- No, let's move that one first.
- We move that one first.

50
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:32,522
<i>Or am I the one who's being weird,</i>
<i>not Ko Gyeom?</i>

51
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,445
It's a no-go, isn't it?

52
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,365
Okay, then. Let's call it a day.

53
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,618
We're wrapping up for today!

54
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,287
- Let's wrap it up!
- Wrap it up!

55
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,163
- Wrap it up!
- Great work, guys.

56
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,665
Good work!

57
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:00,008
WEALTH AND PROSPERITY
PROP

58
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,568
WEALTH AND PROSPERITY
SHOOT CANCELED DUE TO HEAVY SNOW

59
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,201
How are we going to sweep
all this tomorrow?

60
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,087
<i>He was the same carefree guy</i>
<i>he had always been.</i>

61
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,138
What took you so long?

62
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,266
Everyone left a while ago.

63
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,977
- Were you waiting for me?
- Yes.

64
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,020
Why?

65
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,272
To take you back.

66
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,030
Was I not supposed to do this either?

67
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,285
<i>But now,</i>
<i>I'm starting to see things differently.</i>

68
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,203
Why?

69
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,121
Because I like you.

70
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,712
Was that one of your lines?

71
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,839
You know I don't have any lines.

72
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:27,804
<i>I thought maybe his simple ways</i>
<i>were proof of his sincerity.</i>

73
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,853
I like you.

74
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,111
Am I not allowed to like you?

75
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,364
<i>Maybe that's why I was swayed by him.</i>

76
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,036
Mubee.

77
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,954
<i>But…</i>

78
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,580
I…

79
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,128
want to like you again.

80
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,597
<i>…this isn't right.</i>

81
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,602
Hey. Quit talking nonsense.

82
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,027
<i>It would be absurd to fall for it twice.</i>

83
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:25,945
Kim Mubee!

84
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,492
<i>I will never do</i>
<i>something so pathetic again.</i>

85
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:43,963
NO ONE CAN PREPARE YOU
FOR THE LOVE AND THE FEAR

86
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,847
What is it?
Planning on robbing the neighbor?

87
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,724
There is something I want in there.

88
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,477
I'm wondering if there's a way to get it.

89
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,980
It's been a while
since I saw your eyes light up like this.

90
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,649
About the girl who lives there…

91
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,651
She seemed like a decent person.

92
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,239
You saw Kim Mubee?
Wait, you knew about her?

93
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,157
What?

94
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,495
That the girl you were crazy about
a few years ago was our neighbor?

95
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,956
I bet even the kids around here know
that you're into her.

96
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,669
What's been stopping you?

97
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,428
Was it because of me--

98
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,263
No, it's not that.

99
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,019
I swear it's not that.
It was because of me.

100
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,439
And more importantly, she hates me.

101
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,193
Like so many people on the Internet.

102
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,945
Hey, I don't care about that.

103
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:53,032
A star is bound to have
his fair share of fans and haters.

104
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,118
But

105
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,997
I don't want Mubee to hate me.

106
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:05,920
What was that?

107
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,757
"I don't want Mubee to hate me."
Are you nine years old?

108
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,592
What's with you, man?

109
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,011
You don't even know anything!
What do you know?

110
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,263
What's wrong with you?

111
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,316
You might have a problem.

112
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,569
Why is he coming out of there again?

113
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,077
That poor kid wanted
to go home last night,

114
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,037
but you kept him up all night.

115
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,667
Playing video games is the best way
to stop your racing thoughts.

116
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,420
Where's Jeong-hu? Did he leave?

117
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,548
He said he'd be back in a second.

118
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,349
<i>I could've just ignored</i>
<i>Ko Gyeom's nonsense.</i>

119
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,440
<i>But I ended up</i>
<i>not getting a wink of sleep.</i>

120
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,957
This feels like a replay of my childhood.

121
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,587
What were you doing in there again?
And at this time.

122
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,717
Well, Mubee and I spent all night--

123
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,137
I thought we came
to an understanding last time.

124
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,181
What?

125
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,893
I told you not to visit her for no reason.
If you don't have any friends,

126
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,146
I said I'd hang out with you, didn't I?

127
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,112
You're not fun to hang out with.
No offense.

128
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,114
Hey!

129
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,367
You're making me sad.

130
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,912
You hung out at my place
for five hours last time.

131
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,414
That's what we call "having fun."

132
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,957
Hey, we had a good time!

133
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:15,675
You've been so obsessed with me
because of my girl Mubee, right?

134
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,231
You're so not her type.

135
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,232
What?

136
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,027
Hey, what do you know, you little potato…

137
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:40,116
Mubee told me there was a psycho
living across the street.

138
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,868
So why should I help you?

139
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,121
What? A psycho?

140
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,997
She said that?

141
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,541
- Yes.
- About me?

142
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,293
Hey, Woo Jeong-hu. Come have breakfast!

143
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,795
Where is he?

144
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,591
- Jeong-hu, come eat!
- Okay.

145
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,636
- Woo Jeong-hu!
- Yes, Mubee?

146
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,722
- Come on.
- Okay, coming.

147
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,853
Gyeom, your looks just won't cut it.

148
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,771
Why, you…

149
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,401
- What were you doing?
- Damn.

150
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,778
There's a really ugly cat over there.

151
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,918
MELODY

152
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,931
SCREENPLAY BY SON JU-A
DIRECTED BY KIM MUBEE

153
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,657
Why does she keep coming here?
So annoying.

154
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,212
I'm not sure what you said first,

155
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:20,216
but I believe your last words were,
"So annoying," Ms. Kim.

156
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,885
You can lip-read?

157
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,804
Impressive.

158
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,099
I don't want to be here either,
but this is important.

159
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,478
What is it?

160
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,480
He agreed to write the music.

161
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:38,067
Let me remind you
I'm going to have to listen to it first.

162
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,612
Okay, I get it.
But I'm sure you'll like it.

163
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,200
I thought your relationship ended badly.
Are you sure about this?

164
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,162
You will have to check
each other's work constantly.

165
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,706
It'll be hard to avoid a messy fight.

166
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,043
Excuse me, Ms. Kim. We're all adults.

167
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,712
It'd be immature
to fight with your coworker.

168
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,590
We'll see.

169
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,804
What's all this?

170
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,807
Are you scouting locations?

171
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,976
Do you want some ideas?

172
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,853
Aren't you leaving?

173
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,940
Just when I think we're getting along,
you act like we're total strangers again.

174
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,316
Goodbye.

175
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,071
Sure, bye.

176
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,952
Hey! Gyeom, over here!

177
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,247
You met briefly last time, right?

178
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,624
I didn't have the chance
to say hi properly.

179
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,878
It's nice to meet you.
You must've had a tough time.

180
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,963
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, sure.

181
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,757
He's not that kind of guy,
but you know how people are.

182
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,011
He got bashed like that
over a simple misunderstanding.

183
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:51,307
Yeah, I saw Director Koo's interview.
What an untimely coincidence.

184
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,392
It must've felt unfair to you.

185
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,894
I wouldn't say it was unfair.

186
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,855
The review was triggering.

187
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,899
I never thought it was unfair.

188
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,734
Would you like a drink?

189
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,451
Thank you.

190
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,203
Now then, let's have a drink. Cheers!

191
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,758
The thing is, writing has its limits.

192
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,595
It can't show you the writer's
facial expressions or tone of voice,

193
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,933
so I've found that it can come off
as more hostile than intended.

194
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,437
But that's probably because
my writing is lacking in many ways.

195
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:44,526
So… if I had critiqued your movie

196
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:49,698
directly to you like this
with a smile on my face,

197
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,243
it probably wouldn't have sounded
as offensive to you.

198
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:54,954
I humbly ask

199
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,165
for your understanding this once.

200
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:07,883
What did I say?

201
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,011
He may seem like a rude punk,
but he's actually a decent guy.

202
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,223
Now, let's drink
and wash away any ill feelings.

203
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,893
He's getting enough flak
out there as it is.

204
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,728
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

205
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,244
Hang on. Let me.

206
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,757
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

207
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,970
Thank you. I owe you once again.

208
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:56,807
Sure.

209
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,359
Goddamn it!

210
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,947
Hey, you can't hog the entire alley.
Can't you see how narrow it is?

211
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,657
I'm sorry.

212
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,535
My ride is totaled!
What are you gonna do about that?

213
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,288
Mister! I saw the whole thing.

214
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,166
What are you even saying
to the person you hit?

215
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,793
What? Are you saying I hit him?

216
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,587
That guy came at me. Damn it!

217
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,424
I just saw this thing hit that man's arm.

218
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,759
Apologize to him now!

219
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,011
Why should I?

220
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,471
Apologize to him now,

221
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,515
or appear in court and compensate him.

222
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,394
Sorry.

223
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,856
I was just, you know, a little busy.

224
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,191
You call that sincere?

225
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:55,032
I am sincerely sorry.
I did not realize I had hit you.

226
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,493
Yes, sure. It's fine.

227
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,495
Thank you.

228
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,664
Please excuse me.

229
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,137
Are you all right?

230
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,181
Yes.

231
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,480
You always seem so kind.

232
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,524
And

233
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:33,112
your mother seems quite friendly too.

234
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,281
My mom?

235
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,867
That doesn't sound like her.

236
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,162
Well, not exactly "friendly,"

237
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,499
but although she may have a cold look…

238
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,961
You two are quite alike.

239
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,221
You're nothing like your brother.

240
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,892
You seem like a gentle person, but he's…

241
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,977
A bit bubbly, huh?

242
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,566
I probably shouldn't badmouth him
in front of his family,

243
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,486
but if anything, I'd say he's too bubbly.

244
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,030
Which makes him adorable.

245
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,660
There's nothing adorable
about that tall guy.

246
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:28,750
So, does your brother always
make a joke out of everything?

247
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,628
He seems way too carefree.

248
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,339
At times…

249
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,760
when you have something weighing on you…

250
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,389
you try to make light of it

251
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,101
because it's too much to handle.

252
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,106
I rather wish he were carefree.

253
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,697
But he's quite the opposite,
and that worries me deeply.

254
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:16,924
Hey, Jun-tae.

255
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,384
Sure. Sounds good.

256
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,186
Why do you do what you do?

257
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,359
Because…

258
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,820
I like movies.

259
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,491
That's why I ended up here somehow.

260
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,328
Everyone in the industry does.

261
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,790
We're all crazy about movies.

262
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,628
That's just how fascinating movies can be.

263
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,505
Maybe so.

264
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:04,930
But, you know,

265
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,182
I'm done with it now.

266
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,017
Sorry?

267
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,397
I know I'm as crazy about movies
as everyone else,

268
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:18,277
but I feel like I'll end up hating them
if I keep going.

269
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,281
It's just that reading your review,

270
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,366
as well as seeing the people around me,

271
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,203
made me realize
I don't have what it takes.

272
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,749
I thought about ignoring it.

273
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,253
But these days, I feel it in me.

274
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,257
The courage to give it all up.

275
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,808
This isn't because of what you wrote,
so don't be scared.

276
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,479
I just… want to leave it…

277
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:01,236
while I still think…
I can continue to like it.

278
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm so drunk.

279
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,430
I shouldn't do this.

280
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,477
MUBEE

281
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,856
No. Ko Gyeom.

282
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,775
Ko Gyeom!

283
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,028
Yes, you should.

284
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,365
Just this once.

285
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,498
<i>The person you are calling</i>
<i>is not available.</i>

286
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,458
<i>Please try again…</i>

287
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,460
She still has my number blocked.

288
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,547
That's just harsh.

289
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,395
Are you up?

290
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,480
Yeah.

291
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,649
- Here.
- Thanks.

292
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,667
What time did I get home last night?
How did I even get home?

293
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,546
You came home around 2:00 a.m.

294
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,173
in an amusing way.

295
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,885
"In an amusing way"? What do you mean?

296
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,351
What's this?

297
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,938
It belongs to our neighbor.

298
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,278
- I saw Mubee last night?
- You saw Mubee last night.

299
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,113
What? How?

300
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,240
No, don't tell me!

301
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,118
No! Tell me. What happened?

302
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,620
No, don't tell me.

303
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,038
No!

304
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,876
Tell me. Don't leave anything out.

305
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:33,346
<i>You were running very late last night,</i>
<i>so I got up and looked out the window.</i>

306
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,183
Please just open up. Come on!

307
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,852
<i>This person,</i>
<i>who looked like a human air dancer…</i>

308
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,356
Open this door for me, Mubee!

309
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,362
<i>…was flailing about</i>
<i>outside our neighbor's house.</i>

310
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,530
Mubee.

311
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,073
<i>So I went out immediately.</i>

312
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,202
<i>- And it really was you.</i>
- Unblock my number.

313
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,287
<i>But</i>

314
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,415
<i>someone was a step ahead of me.</i>

315
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,791
<i>Kim Mubee.</i>

316
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,504
Be quiet and get lost right now.

317
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,297
Come on, unblock my number.

318
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,552
- Unblock me.
- Let go. Let go of me!

319
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,304
Unblock me this once, please.

320
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,808
Unblock me before you go!

321
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,364
Then I picked you up and brought you home.

322
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,744
To be more precise,
you were dragged in like a dog.

323
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:41,581
Jun! You should've dragged me in at once,
not watched the whole show!

324
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:45,502
You always talk such nonsense,
so I didn't realize how drunk you were.

325
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,713
God! What am I going to do now?

326
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,881
I'll say.

327
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,262
Just yesterday, I was telling her
how thoughtful you are.

328
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,057
This'll make me look bad.

329
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,727
That might be her.

330
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,063
Damn it!

331
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,620
Give it back now.

332
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,252
Get drunk and make a scene
like that one more time,

333
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,087
and I'll call the police.

334
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,505
Okay.

335
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,852
Are you okay?

336
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,442
Come to think of it,

337
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,279
she could've reported me
to the police yesterday,

338
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,406
but she didn't.

339
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:02,078
Could this mean
she doesn't hate me that much?

340
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,582
You're still drunk.

341
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,083
Perhaps

342
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,753
I might still have a chance.

343
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,837
Gyeom.

344
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,256
It's good to be positive, but--

345
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,592
First off, I need a plan.

346
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,763
I'm gonna find Jeong-hu
and shake it out of him.

347
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,853
Better get him sobered up.

348
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,733
Does he even remember it?

349
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,570
Mubee.

350
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,491
Do you remember Jun-sang?

351
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,826
He was your dad's friend.

352
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,455
Yeah, I remember him. Why?

353
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,207
He just called.

354
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,420
He said he had a favor to ask you.

355
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,756
What would he want from me?

356
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,611
What? Where did it go?

357
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,370
Man, who the heck is it this time?

358
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,959
They all just come and go
as they like, huh?

359
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,420
Hey.

360
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,068
Were you at the store?

361
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:03,199
What are you doing?
Who said you could barge in here?

362
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,577
Hey, Hongsi.

363
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,912
I invited her in.

364
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,247
What?

365
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,966
I said I'd work with you.
I never said you could step out of line.

366
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,594
Step out of what line?
I'm here to discuss business.

367
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,180
You think you can still come here
whenever you want?

368
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,809
- Did you change your number?
- What?

369
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,269
Or you must've blocked me.

370
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,064
I would've told you beforehand
if I could reach you.

371
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,276
You blocked her number?

372
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,197
That's really hurtful, you know.
You can't just block someone like…

373
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,198
Be quiet.

374
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,080
So? What is it? Why are you here?

375
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,794
Since we'll be working together,
we'll need to see each other often.

376
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,047
You said you needed my music.

377
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,634
I'm gonna work alone,
so let's stay away from each other.

378
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,303
I can't let you do that.

379
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,597
If you've read the script,

380
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,601
you should know that the music
is the narrative and protagonist itself.

381
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,145
That's why we need to discuss it.

382
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,108
I did read the script.

383
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,698
It seems like
it needs an awesome soundtrack.

384
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,660
Exactly.

385
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,831
To make that kind of music,
we need to share our inspirations,

386
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,707
so I'll come by more often.

387
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,753
"Inspirations"?

388
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,463
"Share"?

389
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,343
Hey, I'll manage on my own.

390
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,429
Don't get the wrong idea, Si-jun.

391
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,765
You don't have the job yet.

392
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,894
The director will listen to your music
to decide if it's worth using.

393
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,021
That's why I have to hear it first.

394
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,273
"Worth using"?

395
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,025
Hey, you two need to calm down.

396
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,028
Did you think she'd just say yes
to an inexperienced songwriter?

397
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:08,491
Hey, don't put it like that.
He does have some experience.

398
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,869
You were the one
who begged me to work with you.

399
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,830
And you've agreed to do it,
so work with me here.

400
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,915
You said you'd bet everything on this.

401
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,794
She has a point.
You said you'd do this, so do your best.

402
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,712
Son Ju-a.

403
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:24,173
Is it pride?
I guess you still haven't swallowed that.

404
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,426
Hey, don't talk like that.

405
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,223
Hey. Just go, okay?

406
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,393
I must've been crazy.
I could never work with you.

407
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,061
I'm not going anywhere.

408
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,479
I made myself clear.

409
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,233
I want to do this movie,
and I've met a decent director.

410
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,735
What I need now is your music.

411
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,321
I have no reason to give up on this.

412
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,490
Fine, go ahead and fight.

413
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,492
You two just won't grow up, will you?

414
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,161
Who's the director anyway?

415
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,499
That's what you're thinking.
It's none of my business.

416
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,001
Anyway, I'm not doing it.

417
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,461
- Do it!
- Do it!

418
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,089
What the hell is your problem?

419
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:09,177
You have to do it.
You're in no position to be nitpicking.

420
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,056
Hongsi, get a grip.
How long are you gonna loaf around for?

421
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,391
Are you telling me
to put up with this crap?

422
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,728
Ju-a, you were a bit harsh. Do you agree?

423
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:22,231
- You regret what you said, right?
- Why are you butting in?

424
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:27,654
This is a great opportunity for you both.
There is no reason to ruin it.

425
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,657
If you're a grown-up, then act like one.

426
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,159
Hey, get up.

427
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,371
Now, shake hands.

428
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,623
A virtual handshake. You're all good now.

429
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,292
Let's just focus on what's ahead, okay?

430
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,378
You stay out of this!

431
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,879
This is our business.

432
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,719
Okay, well,

433
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,848
I'm not sure if this is the right time
to say something like this,

434
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:00,395
but I really want to say it
now that we're all here together.

435
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,527
I have a crush on someone again.

436
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,289
Thanks for the consistent support.
I'll do my best.

437
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,255
Pushover.

438
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,759
Did he just storm out of his own studio?

439
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,890
Obviously because of me.

440
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:42,311
Us acting like everything was cool
probably pissed him off even more.

441
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,986
I owe you an apology.

442
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,363
I had no clue what you were going through.

443
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:58,036
It must've been really tough,
and I wasn't even there for you.

444
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,955
I'm sorry. I mean it.

445
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,626
You don't have to apologize.

446
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,879
I was fine, really.

447
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,591
To be honest, it wasn't even that tough.

448
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,221
Rather than that…

449
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,646
Tell me more about Kim Mubee.

450
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,111
DIRECTED BY KIM MUBEE

451
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,240
Man, that was so immature. Damn it.

452
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,997
I can't believe
neither of them followed me out.

453
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,548
So Gyeom used these to convince you?

454
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,677
And you're gonna hand Kim Mubee over
for these silly things?

455
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,596
I'm not handing her over.

456
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,641
I'm going to set them up just once.
That's all I'm offering.

457
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,059
The tape.

458
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,191
I never got to watch these
when I was a kid.

459
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,528
Why not?
Didn't you watch it with your friends?

460
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,570
I didn't have any.

461
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,907
None of the boys wanted to play with me.

462
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,452
I had a tube in my nose,
and I was always so frail.

463
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,372
Are you all right now?

464
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,875
I got well after a life-and-death surgery.

465
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,211
Don't I look healthy?

466
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,216
It was so painful that I once thought,
"I'd rather die than live like this."

467
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,635
But it's a good thing I held on.

468
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,723
Anyway, Mubee was the only one
who hung out with me back then.

469
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,309
I'd play with her every day,

470
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:50,064
so instead of these, I had to watch
<i>Sailor Moon </i>and <i>Wedding Peach.</i>

471
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:54,569
Hey, consider it an honor
that I'm letting you in on our movie day.

472
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,405
You better give me
something good in return.

473
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,701
Actually, there is
a big opportunity for you.

474
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,745
Should I tell you or not?

475
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,623
- What's this?
- Why? What is it?

476
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,125
Wait! Gyeom!

477
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,127
Okay! I'll tell you!

478
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,921
Okay.

479
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,216
I just need to set up a chance
for you two to meet, right?

480
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,134
That's it.

481
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,890
Do I really have to tell you this?

482
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,725
You better, while I'm being nice.

483
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:26,642
Got it.

484
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,311
Boss.

485
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,562
God.

486
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,572
<i>It's what your dad always used to do.</i>

487
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,408
<i>He heard recently</i>
<i>that you became a movie director</i>

488
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,619
<i>and was very careful about asking you.</i>

489
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,294
<i>If you don't want to do it,</i>
<i>you don't have to.</i>

490
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,557
Mubee's father was a huge cinephile.

491
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,685
He probably saw every movie out there.

492
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,856
This community holds outdoor screenings
around this time every year.

493
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,401
Her dad used to volunteer
to organize it all.

494
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,986
He'd pick the movies too.

495
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,155
It was the best.

496
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,491
Is it happening this year too?

497
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,494
I saw this on the telephone pole.

498
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,414
THE 28TH DORI FOREST
EARLY SUMMER MOVIE NIGHT

499
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,003
Should I take her to it?

500
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:52,728
THE 28TH DORI FOREST
EARLY SUMMER MOVIE NIGHT

501
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:02,363
THE 28TH DORI FOREST
EARLY SUMMER MOVIE NIGHT

502
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,965
<i>This was Dad's favorite time of the year.</i>

503
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,262
<i>He especially loved spending his time</i>
<i>picking the movies.</i>

504
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,180
What should we screen this time?

505
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,726
What do you think?

506
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,856
This is a good one.

507
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,443
How do people not know this movie?

508
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:46,657
<i>He loved digging up movies</i>
<i>made by overlooked directors.</i>

509
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,413
- Aren't you hot?
- No.

510
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,839
Hello.

511
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,510
I heard you wanted to screen my movie,
so I thought I'd stop by.

512
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,179
Director Koo Yeong-sik?

513
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,889
- Yes.
- He must be the director.

514
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,807
- Thanks for coming.
- Yes, I think so.

515
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,101
It's a small event,
but people really enjoy it.

516
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,020
- Thank you again.
- You're welcome.

517
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,272
- This looks good.
- Yes.

518
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,482
How can I…

519
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,652
Thank you, Mubee.

520
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:28,282
Don't mention it.
It must've been a lot of work for you.

521
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:34,288
What a shame your father isn't here
to screen your movie himself.

522
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:39,627
You know how much he loved
and took pride in doing this.

523
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:46,217
Anyhow, it's nice to be doing this again
after all these years.

524
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,221
We'll set up everything else.

525
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,349
You just grab a nice spot
and have a relaxing movie night.

526
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:54,767
Okay.

527
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,272
Mr. Ko, you can leave that
at the tent over there.

528
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,690
- Over there?
- Yes.

529
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,609
Why are you here?

530
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,070
I'm a staff member.

531
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,455
Don't pull too…

532
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,167
Hey, don't pull it too hard.

533
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,463
I think your side is too low.

534
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,217
No, your side is way too high.

535
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,135
What?

536
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,431
Seriously, young lady.

537
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:37,852
I mean, you have to put it up high
for people to notice it.

538
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,271
Don't get smart.

539
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:52,116
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19--

540
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,200
Oh my God!

541
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,328
What just happened? I mean…

542
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,913
I'm sorry.

543
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,958
I couldn't see you
because this was in the way.

544
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,501
I'm sorry.

545
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,752
No, thanks.

546
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,341
Come on.

547
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,636
What were you even doing?

548
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,805
Were you measuring something?

549
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,641
One mat? Here you go.

550
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,476
THE 28TH DORI FOREST
EARLY SUMMER MOVIE NIGHT

551
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,815
Jun. What are you doing?
You should've called me.

552
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,442
I can handle this much.

553
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,194
Wow, what is all this?

554
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,904
It didn't take long.

555
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,034
Don't you love the vibe?

556
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,956
You brought so much.

557
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,627
Hey, you guys!

558
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,718
"You guys"? Since when were you
so close with those two?

559
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:39,390
Wow, they even brought lamps.

560
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,391
Good for us.

561
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,477
Hey, let's go sit with them over there.

562
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,145
It'll be too dark without a lamp.

563
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,523
What? Says who?

564
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,525
What? Says me.

565
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,110
Let's go. I'll hold this.

566
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,487
Let's go. After you.

567
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,252
Please.

568
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,304
Did you make all this yourself?

569
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,764
How is a young man like you
such a good cook?

570
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,266
I just got better at it.

571
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,101
These look so good.

572
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,812
- Jun, may I?
- Sure.

573
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,230
Thank you for the food!

574
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,066
Mom, you've already seen this movie.

575
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,779
It's been so long
since we last came here together.

576
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,949
Are those fried dumplings?
Oh, <i>yubuchobap.</i>

577
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,493
- Take your time and enjoy it.
- Yes, ma'am.

578
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,455
What should I eat first?

579
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,042
Is it good?

580
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,797
One dry martini, please.

581
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,008
We're closed, ma'am.

582
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,343
It's not closing time yet.

583
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,053
We're closed, so just leave.

584
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,890
Sir, are you closed?

585
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,141
- Huh?
- What?

586
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,185
- Closed?
- Closed?

587
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,686
No, not at all.

588
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,439
We won't be closing for a while,
so please take your time.

589
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:13,233
Oh, your bartender told me
that I should leave.

590
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,402
Aw, my head hurts, for God's sake.

591
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,323
Cut the crap, will you? I should just…

592
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,370
I meant only <i>you </i>should leave.
Didn't you catch that?

593
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,747
Should I ask out loud why I should leave?

594
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:42,721
Thank you.

595
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,351
Have you come up with any songs?

596
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,653
- Hey, I--
- Don't you dare say you're backing out.

597
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,197
I know you didn't say yes
just to quit so easily.

598
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:04,493
I get it. I annoy you
and make you mad, but work is work.

599
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,204
Put up with it, just like I do.

600
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,044
What are you putting up with?

601
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,048
I don't know.
Probably the same things you are.

602
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,220
- You know me that well?
- I'd say so.

603
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,412
Wait till I finish my shift.

604
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,054
<i>Let's go now.</i>

605
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,320
<i>- Give me that.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

606
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,948
<i>Why do you have so much stuff?</i>

607
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:26,992
<i>They were in my locker.</i>

608
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,536
<i>It'd be too heavy to carry at once.</i>

609
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,291
<i>You can leave the things</i>
<i>you don't need at school.</i>

610
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,378
<i>That'd be a waste.</i>

611
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,982
<i>There were so many things</i>
<i>that my dad liked.</i>

612
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:14,331
One day,
I'll get to play my own movie here.

613
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:23,423
<i>And I can't forget</i>
<i>the way he looked at those things.</i>

614
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,769
You've already seen this.

615
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,771
Why are you so engrossed?

616
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,568
It feels different every time.

617
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:47,781
The second time and the third time,
they all feel different.

618
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,703
You've seen it that many times?

619
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,206
Because I like

620
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,542
<i>Mubees.</i>

621
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,549
This time, I was flirting.

622
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,727
<i>But what always made me anxious was…</i>

623
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,395
Yes?

624
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,316
Yes, I understand.

625
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:23,901
Okay.

626
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:30,532
<i>…that I never seemed to be</i>
<i>one of the things Dad liked.</i>

627
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,784
Mubee.

628
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,621
Unfortunately, something urgent came up.

629
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,874
I'm sorry, honey. I'll call you.

630
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,924
<i>It felt like just when I could reach him,</i>
<i>he'd disappear again.</i>

631
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,095
Samgeori Meats.

632
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,431
Yes, an order?

633
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:59,269
<i>So I told myself</i>
<i>I'd stop getting my hopes up.</i>

634
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,218
Honestly, I was surprised.

635
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,179
I thought you would've quit ages ago.

636
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:37,349
But here you are,
still working so diligently.

637
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,935
You always said you'd quit this place.

638
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,855
But you've become a total expert,
making all kinds of cocktails.

639
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,319
Are you heading to your studio now?

640
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:55,200
Don't tell me you already wrote a song
or something like that.

641
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,829
I remember
that you used to work really fast--

642
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,962
What are you doing?

643
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,674
What's wrong?

644
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:14,428
You said you knew me
and what I was putting up with.

645
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:15,846
What?

646
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,557
I thought you felt the same.

647
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,642
What are you talking about?

648
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,728
Isn't this what guys usually want

649
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,814
from their ex-girlfriends?

650
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,576
You crazy asshole.

651
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,119
So listen.

652
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,957
Stop testing me. Enough is enough.

653
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,374
Why did you do that?

654
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,088
Because I was angry.

655
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,881
Do you hate seeing me that much?

656
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,594
If you hate it that much, then fine.

657
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,429
I'll stop.

658
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,432
I need time too.

659
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,192
You decided when to break up
and when to show back up so quickly.

660
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,944
Can't you…

661
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,784
at least give me some time to catch up?

662
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,125
I don't understand any of this.

663
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:16,216
But I'm doing my best
to process this ridiculous situation.

664
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,983
I'm sorry. I…

665
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,571
I didn't know you felt that way.

666
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,739
I thought…

667
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,204
since it's been years, I--

668
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,290
You don't know me very well.

669
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,586
I didn't know you very well either.

670
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,256
And that's why we broke up.

671
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:10,478
Where are you going?

672
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,899
You're blocking the screen.

673
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,151
Hey, can you sit down?
I can't see the screen!

674
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,819
I can't see.

675
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,030
<i>Should we go back?</i>

676
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:24,951
<i>Can we go back?</i>

677
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,458
<i>I feel like I'm sinking alone.</i>

678
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,586
Stop playing games

679
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,297
like you did back then.

680
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,342
I wasn't playing when I said I liked you.

681
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:42,886
I don't believe you.

682
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:48,350
You gave me butterflies, made me hopeful,
and then made a fool of me.

683
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:53,480
Do you know how devastating it is
to get excited only to be left alone?

684
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,733
- I am--
- Was that a confession?

685
00:53:58,443 --> 00:53:59,444
What did you say?

686
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,114
You said I gave you butterflies
and made you hopeful.

687
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,077
That sounded like a confession to me.

688
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,704
Actually, I should be the one complaining.

689
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,706
You held out your hand first.

690
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,084
You kissed me first.

691
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,962
The only thing I did first
was confess my feelings.

692
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,547
But why do you keep denying it?

693
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:23,468
Why do you keep doing whatever you want?
What are you…

694
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:26,930
afraid of?

695
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:32,769
<i>I suppose this makes me</i>
<i>the weirdest one again.</i>

696
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,939
I was hoping

697
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,442
you'd easily figure out how I was feeling.

698
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,071
For the weary girl
who found everything so tough…

699
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,659
I wanted to be a simple guy.

700
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:52,080
<i>Ko Gyeom's carefree nature</i>
<i>certainly knows no bounds.</i>

701
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,792
I'm done with all that.

702
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,168
I like you again.

703
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,590
I still like you, Kim Mubee.

704
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:07,637
<i>And I find myself</i>
<i>wanting to believe him once again.</i>

705
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,266
<i>Now, that's just pathetic.</i>

706
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,310
If you keep acting like this--

707
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,822
Let's say I made the first move this time.

708
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:52,307
MELO MOVIE

709
00:55:58,855 --> 00:55:59,689
No, I got it.

710
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,319
- Is it good?
- It's so good.

711
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,199
Here.

712
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,513
Here.

713
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,473
Jesus.

714
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,895
Happy now?

715
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:42,607
So nice.

716
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:46,444
Hey, where's Mubee?
It's about to begin. Give her a call.

717
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,988
- She left her phone here.
- What?

718
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,247
Hey, hold this for me.

719
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,764
KO GYEOM
