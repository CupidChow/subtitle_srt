1
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,353
Jun!

2
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,566
Jun…

3
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,366
I forgot I had a therapy session today.
See you later.

4
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,243
Oh, what…

5
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,084
Damn.

6
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,432
Here's what I've been thinking
ever since I was a kid.

7
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,145
Life seems to have
a fixed amount of happiness.

8
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,192
That's not so bad.

9
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:26,628
What?

10
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,467
Come on.

11
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,637
Yeah, whatever.

12
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,724
Who cares
as long as it gets you to places?

13
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,979
In other words,

14
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,900
there is also a set amount of misfortune.

15
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,030
What? What's going on?

16
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,534
This can't be happening!

17
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,620
No. Come on now.

18
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,395
WAXY CORN
STEAMED CORN FOR SALE

19
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,480
It's simple.

20
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,359
If someone suffers a string of hardships,

21
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,698
they should believe
that good things will soon come.

22
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,076
Good for me. I was hungry anyway.

23
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,163
I get to eat corn and rest.

24
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:49,252
Hey, where on earth
did you find this ancient car?

25
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,922
It's going to keep stalling.

26
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,426
You should get rid of this car
and get a new one.

27
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,262
It's still going strong.

28
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,806
Can you take a look at the wipers too?

29
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,349
They keep popping up randomly.

30
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,351
I'd appreciate it if you could fix it.

31
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:16,905
What's that now?

32
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,242
WARNING: FALLING ROCKS
ROAD CLOSED

33
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,712
DETOUR THROUGH ROUTE 101

34
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,556
All right. I haven't been
working out enough lately anyway.

35
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:52,357
It's like a kind of auto-suggestion,
and it's actually pretty effective.

36
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,109
CHEONHYE MEMORIAL PARK

37
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,904
If I hadn't thought that way,

38
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,991
I probably wouldn't have been able
to tough it out.

39
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,661
I came alone again.

40
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,665
Did you have a fight with Jun?

41
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,585
I guess he doesn't want to see you anymore

42
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,255
because you put him through so much.

43
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,592
When my life hit rock bottom…

44
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,770
I would've easily given up
if it hadn't been for that.

45
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,189
I should go.

46
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,859
I might stop coming too.

47
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,865
Honestly, I don't remember much anymore.

48
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,326
I've got nothing to say.

49
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,371
Jun and I will be fine.

50
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,791
Don't worry about us.

51
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,463
That's why I simply chose
to believe what I did.

52
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,896
It's about time
something good came my way.

53
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,403
What the…

54
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,993
So this is how it's gonna be today.

55
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,870
Good grief.

56
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,415
What? Why isn't this working again?

57
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,167
Oh God.

58
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,353
Are these…

59
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,108
What is wrong with this?

60
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,694
How…

61
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,552
What are you doing here?

62
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,059
Does something need fixing?

63
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,980
To suffer a string of hardships…

64
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,232
Hold this.

65
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,666
-You--
-Why did it…

66
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,923
…is a sign that only happiness is to come.

67
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,345
You fixed it.

68
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,888
Yeah, I guess.

69
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:30,700
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

70
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,208
What is your goal, Mr. Ko?

71
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:45,006
You know, such as fame
or making a lot of money.

72
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,427
Recently, your features have been
the most well-received in our magazine.

73
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,805
Your writing has
a rather cynical approach.

74
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,934
It reads easily,
yet it's sharp and impactful.

75
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,521
How would you like
to become a famous critic?

76
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,859
Famous critic?
Is that an actual job title?

77
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,487
I can make it happen for you.

78
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,406
You can be our magazine's main critic.

79
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,659
It's about time we had a fresh face.

80
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,414
I thought a critic's job
was to just write reviews.

81
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,250
We can take it up a notch
by putting you out in the media.

82
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:26,172
That means presenting yourself on TV,
YouTube, and radio shows

83
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,383
as the hottest movie critic
on the scene right now.

84
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:33,054
Not as Godam the blogger,
but as Ko Gyeom the movie critic.

85
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,935
But I like the way it is now.

86
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:44,232
More people will read your writing
and trust your opinion more.

87
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,984
Your influence will grow just as much.

88
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,197
And it goes without saying
that your fee will increase significantly.

89
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,035
By how much?

90
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,621
A lot.

91
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,457
A lot…

92
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,293
This is a great opportunity for you.

93
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,673
For now, keep up the good work.
But I'm open to something more provoking.

94
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,884
What are you reviewing next?

95
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,264
I'm planning to watch
Director Koo Yeong-sik's new movie.

96
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,424
A BUDDING DIRECTOR
IN PURSUIT OF UNIVERSALITY

97
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,431
His writing is not too shabby.

98
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,602
No, it was me.
I gave him great answers to work with.

99
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,651
I knew it.
He's reviewing every movie but mine.

100
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,030
You think you're all that, huh?

101
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,770
It really wasn't about me.

102
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:46,687
TWO SEASONS

103
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,998
Am I here too early?

104
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,001
Maybe he's still sleeping.

105
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,279
That startled me!

106
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,740
Why was he even out this early?

107
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,639
Who are you?

108
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,727
Am I at the wrong place?

109
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,854
I must be at the wrong place.

110
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,147
Bye.

111
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,488
Who was that?

112
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,574
No idea. Must've got the wrong address.

113
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,826
-When did you get here?
-Just now.

114
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,245
Where have you been all morning?

115
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,456
I fell asleep waiting for you.

116
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,209
I just thought I'd catch a movie.

117
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,630
I've never seen you do that.
Having trouble writing songs?

118
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,759
I love your latest song.

119
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,218
Can I sing it?

120
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,762
Hey.

121
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,556
Don't try so hard to help me out.

122
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,643
I never thought
I'd see your confidence get so low.

123
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,314
I liked you better when you were cocky.

124
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,401
Get up. Let me try recording it.

125
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,870
Aren't you a successful nerd?

126
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,583
A nerd who's plummeting.

127
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,586
Enough browsing. Let's play some games.

128
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,714
-Can I borrow a few of these books?
-Sure.

129
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,467
Or you can just read them here
and spend the night.

130
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,551
Hell no.

131
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,769
Sir, do you have a daughter?

132
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,105
Why, do I look like
I have no family of my own?

133
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,442
Well, you never talked about your family,
so I thought

134
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,195
you were a successful nerd
who lived alone.

135
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,447
That's also true.

136
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,949
Do you live apart?

137
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,369
Who'd want to live with me
when I'm always out making movies?

138
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,079
Pitiful, isn't it?

139
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,792
Hard to seem pitiful when you're sitting
in a very expensive massage chair.

140
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,169
These are all worthless things.

141
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,214
You better navigate your life wisely.

142
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,760
By the way, why aren't you
posting anything on your blog?

143
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,179
I enjoyed your older posts more.

144
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,474
Pros only write when they get paid.

145
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,643
You call this a pro review?

146
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:18,524
Your recent reviews are right on the edge.
Aren't you being too harsh?

147
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,236
I'm only harsh on the bad movies,
not the good ones.

148
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:27,199
Having to coexist already makes critics
and directors mortal enemies.

149
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,661
Don't make those enemies hate you more.
It'll only get tiring.

150
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,708
We're just doing our jobs.
There's no reason to take it personally.

151
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,628
Hey, it isn't always that simple
when you're dealing with people.

152
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,506
Huh? What do you have there?

153
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,801
My brother loves all of these.
How am I ever gonna get them home?

154
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,348
Things would be much easier
if I could replace one person here.

155
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,603
You're trying to kick me out
of my own home now, aren't you?

156
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,860
Sir, can I bring my brother next time?

157
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,403
Whatever. Suit yourself.

158
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,489
You sound like a darn kid
when you talk about him.

159
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,286
Okay. I'll hang out with you
for just two hours.

160
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,621
Oh yeah!

161
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,623
-Get up.
-Oh yeah!

162
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,000
All right.

163
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,254
Hey, close the blinds.

164
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,385
MR. GODAM'S CLEAR-CUT MOVIE REVIEWS

165
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,358
His writing becomes more smug by the day.

166
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,275
Okay.

167
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,905
Ms. Son Ju-a is on her way.

168
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,407
Oh, show her to the meeting room
when she arrives.

169
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,325
Okay.

170
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,120
And you were invited to a preview today.

171
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,540
I don't think I can make it today.

172
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,167
Whose movie is it?

173
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,378
Director Koo Yeong-sik's.

174
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,465
Is it?

175
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,814
I'll do the movie.

176
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,566
Are you sure you can do it?

177
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,362
I wouldn't say that,
but it's worth a shot.

178
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,364
That's all?

179
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:35,452
It reminds me of La La Land
and even Begin Again.

180
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,288
A Star Is Born also comes to mind.

181
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,249
So it's a mix of everything?

182
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,211
But it's also an original story,
and that's what's important.

183
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,880
A universal yet unfamiliar story.

184
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,550
Stories about love
and chasing dreams always sell.

185
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,470
Do you need a more grandiose reason
to make a movie?

186
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,392
I find your overly simplified sentiment
a bit concerning.

187
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,980
As you already know,
this is a story dear to my heart.

188
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,983
I hope you can turn it into a good movie.

189
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,778
Even a dear story can be a flop,

190
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,032
and a neglected story
can be a huge hit in this industry.

191
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,950
I can't promise anything.

192
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,911
Our sentiments really don't mesh well.

193
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,207
You know the music is everything, right?

194
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,125
I do.

195
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,960
May I make recommendations?

196
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,629
You can, but I will be the one to decide.

197
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,964
Fine.

198
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,396
How is it so difficult for this family
to eat a meal together on a weekend?

199
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,398
Everyone is busy, that's all.

200
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,193
Are things at the hospital busy?

201
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,987
It's always the same for me.
How about you?

202
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,699
He's been busy lately
with the clinical tests.

203
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,951
-Which stage is it this time?
-The third.

204
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,495
It's nearly done, then.

205
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,260
Take this.

206
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,888
Put it away. I don't need it.

207
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,307
Si-jun.

208
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,479
Mom and Dad have been waiting long enough.
Come home now.

209
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,943
-I'll take care of myself.
-You obviously can't.

210
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,242
You said that music was just a hobby.

211
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,203
Why did you quit everything
just to live like this?

212
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,081
You must think
you're making the most of your twenties.

213
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,709
Giving everything up for music
seems like an ego trip.

214
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,462
But you didn't give up anything.

215
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,924
-What?
-Tell me one thing you gave up.

216
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,635
Mom pays the rent for your studio.

217
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,471
You get pocket money
for reluctantly eating with us.

218
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,600
You're just doing whatever you want
'cause you have a safe haven to return to.

219
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,981
You should have
something to show for all you've done.

220
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,649
If you haven't made it by now…

221
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,448
Si-jun, how much longer
do you expect us to wait in blind faith?

222
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,577
Hey.

223
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,373
What faith are you talking about?

224
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,750
What?

225
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,004
Has anyone ever
even believed in me just once?

226
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,071
It really is you!

227
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,531
What are you doing?

228
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,492
I don't think this is my seat.

229
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,078
Sit down. They're about to start.

230
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,582
Thank you all for coming to this preview.

231
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,209
I'm Yu Yong-hyeon, and I'll be…

232
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,212
It's our second time
watching a movie together.

233
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:17,132
…Director Koo Yeong-sik and the cast
will come out to meet the audience.

234
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:28,143
Hello. I am Koo Yeong-sik,
the director of this movie.

235
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:33,315
This movie is…
Well, it's neither difficult nor profound.

236
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,777
My movies are known to be rather…

237
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,406
Thank you.

238
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,618
Do you want to have dinner?

239
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,830
I've cut you some slack lately,
but you can't continue acting like this.

240
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,416
What's wrong with family
grabbing a bite together?

241
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,168
What family?

242
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,003
Neighbors are like family!

243
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,674
Stop talking nonsense
and keep your distance.

244
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,883
Do you understand?

245
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,928
Oh, come on!

246
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,282
Well, he accepted that awfully quickly.

247
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,379
What's wrong?

248
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,923
Is something up?

249
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,052
You don't have to tell me.

250
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,431
Sang-sik,

251
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,100
how many years have I been working here?

252
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,686
Let's see.

253
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,896
Wow, six years already…

254
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,903
Are you reminding me that it's time
for another salary negotiation?

255
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,824
Hey, I gave you a massive raise last time!
Are you serious?

256
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,702
It was meant to be a temporary job.
Has it been that long?

257
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,790
So… are you going through
a rough patch right now?

258
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,250
I just think…

259
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,712
I'm a bit pathetic.

260
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,715
Come on, don't call yourself pathetic.

261
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,967
Did you think
it'd be easy to be an artist?

262
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,972
I'll take the trash out for you today.

263
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,934
The way I see it,
you're doing perfectly fine.

264
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,063
-Attaboy.
-Hey, what the hell?

265
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,314
-Stop it.
-Look at you.

266
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,982
That long face doesn't suit you.

267
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,736
Hey, let's have a drink on the rocks.

268
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,237
Okay?

269
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,865
-Sure.
-Get the drinks ready.

270
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,716
Listen, Hongsi.

271
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,012
Blind date.
I forgot that I had a blind date!

272
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,597
What?

273
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,183
You can wrap it up and go home.
I'm leaving first.

274
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,394
I thought we were having a drink.

275
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:20,232
You can drink whatever you want.
Just lock the door before you do.

276
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,191
Bye now.

277
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,735
Seriously, what's your problem?

278
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,907
Blind date, my foot.

279
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,415
Why are you in such a rush?
What do you want now…

280
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,675
Want to have a drink with me?

281
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,060
You don't want to have a drink with me?

282
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,396
No, I don't want to ruin a good drink.

283
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,608
I told you to stop acting
like you know me. Why are you here?

284
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,821
Last time, it was all so sudden,

285
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,115
so we didn't have
a proper chance to talk--

286
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,324
Just cut to the chase.

287
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,254
Do you want to get back together?

288
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,466
Or do you want to just be friends?

289
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,800
Hong Si-jun.

290
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,343
I don't want either option.

291
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,345
Is that clear?

292
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,223
Now go.

293
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,781
You're unaffected as ever.
It's annoying as hell.

294
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,578
Five years ago, I screamed, cried,

295
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,665
and begged you to take me back
or at least remain friends.

296
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,419
You were really something then.
You still are.

297
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,925
-You weren't the only one who suffered.
-Right, I'm sure.

298
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,928
But what's the point of all this now?

299
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,180
I feel nothing when I see you.

300
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,855
What if that's not why I'm here?

301
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,695
I'm not here to get back with you
or to be your friend.

302
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,531
What?

303
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,367
I wrote about us.

304
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:36,910
You wrote what?

305
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,497
As you said, I got desperate
and used anything I could as inspiration,

306
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,082
so I wrote about us.

307
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,173
I want to make it into a movie,

308
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,300
but I need you.

309
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,847
You know better than anyone that
I believed in you for those seven years.

310
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:05,063
I loved your music more than anyone,
and I need it now.

311
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,904
I really need your music.

312
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,018
Did you get to the hospital okay today?

313
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,271
Yeah, I sure did.

314
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,484
I may have overexerted myself.
My shoulders are feeling a bit stiff.

315
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,864
Are they now? I thought the appointment
was yesterday, not today.

316
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,200
Yes, that's right. I was there yesterday.

317
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,162
I guess I'm still in pain from yesterday.

318
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,538
It was today.

319
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,962
Jun… I got a call from the hospital today.

320
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,382
They said you haven't been coming lately,
which is odd

321
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,469
since you said you were there
the day I went to see Mom and Dad.

322
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,471
Well, the thing is,

323
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,766
I was feeling a bit restless,

324
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,060
so I went for a walk around the block--

325
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,770
Do you think you're all better now?

326
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:30,440
You've been struggling to walk recently.
Why do you keep skipping your sessions?

327
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,985
I'm much better now. You know that.

328
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,071
When you've gotten this much better,

329
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,907
it's enough to just
move around the house a little and--

330
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,826
Are you a doctor now?
Who said you could call the shots?

331
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,997
Look, the medical bills are so expensive.

332
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,166
I don't care. Just keep going.

333
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,877
Why would you care about that?

334
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,923
I've been asked to appear on many shows,
so my pay has gone up tremendously.

335
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,008
Expensive, my foot.

336
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,428
I can pay double, even triple that,
so just don't skip it.

337
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,431
Okay. All right.

338
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,271
Did you just raise your voice at me
because you're the breadwinner now?

339
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,981
That makes me sad.

340
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,943
When I got the call, I thought,

341
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,530
"So this is what
parent-teacher conferences must be like."

342
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,740
Don't you dare skip it again.

343
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,411
I heard you.

344
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:46,516
I have high hopes
for the Korean movie industry.

345
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,768
In particular, Kim Yeo-jin's new movie…

346
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,019
What's this?

347
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,021
-I really enjoyed it.
-What's he doing?

348
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,566
That was a positive outlook…

349
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,318
How ridiculous.
What, is he a celebrity now?

350
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,612
Why on earth is he on TV?

351
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,075
That guy looks familiar.

352
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,328
Doesn't he live across the street?

353
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,205
Is he famous?

354
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,832
Not even close.

355
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,419
Anyone can be invited to those shows.
Do you want me to be on it too?

356
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,004
He's eloquent.

357
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,090
You can't talk like he does.

358
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,341
Excuse me?

359
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,179
What are you talking about?
I can do much better than him!

360
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,808
But I think
that's part of my job as a critic.

361
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,809
What's he saying?

362
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,229
Instead of cutting
these new directors some slack,

363
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,231
we must share the hard truth

364
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,651
and keep them on their toes
so they can produce better movies…

365
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,363
-Hello.
-Hello.

366
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,287
What's this?

367
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,372
Oh, hey.

368
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:56,127
I'm looking through the list to see
if this critic recommended your movie.

369
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,296
So? Is it on the list?

370
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,465
No, it's not.

371
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,512
I wouldn't waste my time on a list
that's not even credible.

372
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,765
But he's quite popular
with the younger audience.

373
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,725
Is that so?

374
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,441
LIVE: AN INTERVIEW
WITH RISING MOVIE CRITIC, KO GYEOM

375
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,027
Why is he suddenly everywhere?

376
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,196
We Must Love Each Other.

377
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,698
It's the new movie by Director Lee Ru-ri.

378
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,993
If I were to describe this movie
in one word,

379
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,662
it'd be "easy."

380
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,667
That's my boy! He's good with words.

381
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,712
He's literally popping up everywhere.
What is happening?

382
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,714
He was always an attention seeker.

383
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,468
But you know what?
He earns his keep, unlike some…

384
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:49,806
People ask me if I've been single
since birth because I write harsh reviews.

385
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,224
I have not.

386
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,643
It hurts me more
that you're walking on eggshells.

387
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,187
Walking on eggshells? Me?

388
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,148
Yeah, right. That's absurd.

389
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,733
I can see right through you,

390
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,778
just like last time when you pushed
Ju-a into the bar and left.

391
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,948
What? I pushed Ju-a in here and left?

392
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,283
No way.

393
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,330
Anyway, what did you two
talk about that night?

394
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,459
She wanted to work with me.

395
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,546
Work? What kind of work?

396
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,549
She asked me to write the music
for her screenplay.

397
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,636
That girl really is something.

398
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,972
Goodness, that's cold. Cold as ice.

399
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,394
Am I really that pathetic?

400
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,773
Is that why she's offering me a handout?

401
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,526
You're taking it to the extreme again.

402
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:48,072
You have a tendency
to look at things way too negatively.

403
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:52,911
It's possible… that she's sincerely
interested in working with you.

404
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,080
Who knows? She may have thought
long and hard about this.

405
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,667
Never mind.

406
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,756
I haven't the slightest intention
of getting in between you two.

407
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,300
What am I gonna do with you, pretty boy?

408
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,344
You and that attitude of yours.

409
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,803
You two are…

410
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,139
Nope, I'll say no more.

411
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,393
Just clean those glasses.
Let's get ready to open.

412
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,546
Oh my gosh!

413
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,675
Can I come in?

414
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,386
Sure.

415
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,394
So what did your ex-boyfriend say?
Did he say yes?

416
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,730
He looked at me
like I was insane and then left.

417
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,275
Figures. I would've done the same.

418
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,822
I should've said something nicer.

419
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,657
How am I going to persuade him?

420
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,535
Does it have to be his music?

421
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,954
I wrote it while thinking of him.

422
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,374
But it's no use if I don't like his music.

423
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,711
You will definitely like it.

424
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,589
You seem very confident.

425
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,051
It's just not his time yet.

426
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:36,723
I'm sure he'll become a greater songwriter
than anyone can imagine.

427
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:42,020
Does he know
you have that much faith in him?

428
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,402
That's the problem.

429
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,239
People never communicate these days.

430
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,915
Are you sure
you don't still have feelings for him?

431
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,709
That would complicate things at work.

432
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:08,421
I have zero feelings.
I think I can say the same for him.

433
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,883
He seemed to have a girlfriend.

434
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,926
That's good to hear.

435
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,391
Did you get rid of that guy
who was getting on your nerves?

436
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,979
Get rid of him? No.
He's becoming more clingy, so I've been…

437
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,192
I told you about that?

438
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,526
What now?

439
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,113
We shared quite a lot of stuff, you know.
Civil Servant Kim.

440
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,994
I must've said all kinds of things
to get free Pilates lessons.

441
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,954
So? Tell me.

442
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,372
Not tonight.

443
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,625
Tell me! I'll give you Pilates lessons.

444
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,002
How? You aren't even a Pilates instructor.

445
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,546
I can teach you.
You don't want me to teach you?

446
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,215
Well, I mean…

447
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,467
Do you want them or not?

448
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:00,223
He's the talk of the town right now.
Please welcome movie critic Ko Gyeom.

449
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,808
Hello, I'm Ko Gyeom.

450
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,310
Your writing is getting
a lot of attention.

451
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:08,189
You criticized Koo Yeong-sik's movie
in a daring and brutal way.

452
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,191
Can you bear the consequences?

453
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,945
I stand behind everything that I write.

454
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,155
What disappointed you most
about the movie?

455
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,075
Sir, can you raise the volume a bit?

456
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:19,992
Sure.

457
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:25,331
It doesn't really matter to me
whether a movie has a happy or sad ending.

458
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:29,418
But it's rather irresponsible
to render the ending unimpressive

459
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:33,339
and simply turn it into a tool
to teach the audience a lesson.

460
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,175
That was truly a cutting remark.

461
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,177
I can see why they call you
"the people's critic…"

462
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,512
MOVIE CRITIC KO GYEOM

463
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,306
…and why the public
is so interested in you.

464
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,769
I just think it's a critic's duty
to share accurate reviews with the public.

465
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,313
I do share critical views of movies,

466
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,900
but it's also my job to introduce
well-made movies that don't get noticed

467
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,987
just because
they aren't considered entertaining.

468
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,281
It's a double-edged sword,

469
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,450
but critics need to exist
for those who make movies because…

470
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,994
This is dangerous.

471
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,209
I told you, didn't I?

472
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,171
It took no time for you to become famous.

473
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,007
Well, I don't really care about that.

474
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,926
Will I get more commissioned work now?

475
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,638
You should attend more public events
while people are interested.

476
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:28,060
You're quite eloquent too.
You have more star quality than I thought.

477
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,273
Let's keep up the good work.

478
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,774
Sure.

479
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,069
Now, I'll take my star quality
and make my exit.

480
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,751
How did you get so busy?

481
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,045
I'm seeing you everywhere.
It's such an eyesore.

482
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:58,758
I hate it, but I force myself out there
because they are begging me.

483
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,801
As if. You're reveling in the attention.

484
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,721
Hey, they pay me a lot.
I can deal with the unwanted attention.

485
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,892
Sure, go ahead.
Make a lot of money, my friend.

486
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,315
You're looking awfully down lately.

487
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,359
Are you having trouble writing music?

488
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,402
It's just…

489
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,615
I always knew I was pathetic,
but I feel more pathetic than ever.

490
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,033
Hey, you knew that?

491
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:32,750
Ju-a suddenly started writing scripts,
and now she's made one into a movie.

492
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:37,004
You used to lurk around sets all the time,
and now you're earning your keep.

493
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,673
But what about me?

494
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,676
What am I even doing?

495
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:47,974
Should I just quit?

496
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,894
When I started making music, I thought

497
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:56,482
that I'd know if I had what it takes
and when to give up without being told.

498
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,736
But… I think that ship has sailed.

499
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,660
Now I'm just a fool who runs his mouth
without realizing he'll never make it.

500
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,289
How fucking embarrassing.

501
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,256
Hey, are you crying?

502
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:26,304
Thank God.
It almost got really awkward just now.

503
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,180
Cut the shit and just drink.

504
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,098
You said it.

505
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,184
You should cut the shit
and keep doing your thing.

506
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,397
You know, everyone gets their big break.

507
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,109
And you've always been the best among us.

508
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:42,945
I won't deny that.

509
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:46,907
Cheers.

510
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,331
FILM 25

511
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,749
How could this happen?

512
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,336
Oh my. Is he all right?

513
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,587
I don't know.

514
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,840
What if we take the heat for this?

515
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,258
Tell me about it!

516
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,261
What a way to start the day.

517
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:14,185
DIRECTOR KOO YEONG-SIK RESCUED BY FAMILY
AFTER SLEEPING PILL OVERDOSE

518
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,697
KOO YEONG-SIK RUSHED TO ER
AFTER SUICIDE ATTEMPT AT HOME

519
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,484
Excuse me.
Is Director Koo Yeong-sik all right?

520
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,612
I guess. He had his stomach pumped.
He's been hospitalized.

521
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,199
Where can I go to visit him?

522
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,201
Are you an acquaintance?

523
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,413
Wait a minute.

524
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,915
It's that critic!

525
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,000
Ko Gyeom?

526
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:20,918
It's him!

527
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,169
-It is!
-Why are you here?

528
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,256
-Don't you feel any remorse?
-Tell us how you feel right now.

529
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,676
-Are you here to apologize?
-Do you intend to?

530
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,761
-Please say something.
-A word, please!

531
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,348
-Do you feel any regret?
-Please share how you feel.

532
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,268
Do you think your review caused this?

533
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,815
-Do you feel bad for him?
-Please say something.

534
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,214
Please don't do this here.

535
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,259
My father needs rest right now,
so please leave.

536
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,762
Please go.
You'll only cause a bigger scene.

537
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,223
Okay.

538
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,351
What?

539
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:23,230
-Is he really leaving?
-What? Mr. Ko, one moment!

540
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,399
-Wait!
-Mr. Ko!

541
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,487
FINE LINE BETWEEN CRITIQUING AND ARROGANCE
ARE CRITICS ALWAYS RIGHT?

542
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,876
I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN
DISSING IS NOT THE SAME AS CRITIQUING

543
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,170
THIS IS WHY YOU NEED TO BE HUMBLE
I ALWAYS HATED HIM

544
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,672
ARTISTIC FREEDOM? RIDICULOUS
ARE CRITICS ALLOWED TO TRASH-TALK?

545
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,272
Here.

546
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,108
I'm fine.

547
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,035
Why did you go there
and add fuel to the fire?

548
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,286
You should've laid low.

549
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,873
I don't know.
I didn't really think about it much.

550
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:27,294
Exactly. I told you to play it safe
because critics are easy targets.

551
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:32,883
But hey, Director Koo will be fine.

552
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,553
Don't worry too much.

553
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,180
I'm sure you've realized now.

554
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,892
People don't care
when you write good things about movies.

555
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,981
But the moment you call a movie a flop,
they come flocking in.

556
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:51,652
Then they hide behind critics like you
so they can talk crap about movies.

557
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,154
When something like this happens,
they turn a blind eye

558
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,575
and beat the hell out of the scapegoat.

559
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,494
So don't be too concerned about it.

560
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,831
-I said I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

561
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,001
Don't bother reading comments online.

562
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,004
I don't have to. My inbox is already full.

563
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,840
All right, just ignore them. You got it?

564
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,634
-Come on in!
-Director Kim. Over here!

565
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,428
You called someone?

566
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:22,224
I made plans with her first.
I only invited you out to cheer you up.

567
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,311
And you know each other anyway.
The more the merrier, right?

568
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,105
Director Kim, have a seat. Want a beer?

569
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,190
A bottle of beer, please!

570
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,275
Which beer?

571
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,861
Just anything that doesn't sell well.

572
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:34,778
Here.

573
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,911
Based on what they write about me,
you'd think I betrayed my country.

574
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,997
-What's wrong with people?
-Director Ma!

575
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,708
Park Jun-tae! You're still alive.

576
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,376
-It's been a while.
-Yes.

577
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,711
Where have you been lately?

578
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,548
Well, I screwed up my movie,
so I had to lie low.

579
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:58,052
Hey, don't say it like that.
Why don't you have a drink with us?

580
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,471
No, I have company. Maybe next time.

581
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,555
Really? Okay.

582
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,516
Did you quit smoking?
Let's go for a smoke.

583
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,935
-Shall we? Let's go.
-Yeah.

584
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:08,395
Let's go.

585
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,190
-Have you had a lot to drink?
-Boy, I sure have.

586
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,155
Are you all right?

587
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,532
What do you mean?

588
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:28,749
I mean, you've been grilling that
all by yourself.

589
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:30,709
Should I do it?

590
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,504
It's okay. I'm an expert at this.

591
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,761
-Well--
-It's you, right? The critic.

592
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,890
It is you. I'm Kim Yong-u.
Do you remember me?

593
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,142
You left a review for my movie.

594
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,271
You directed Balcony.

595
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:53,982
You do remember!

596
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,652
-Of course I do.
-You do?

597
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,411
Would you like a drink?

598
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,134
Would I like a drink?
Thanks to you, I'm not in the mood.

599
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,261
You're a funny guy.

600
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,929
Unbelievable.

601
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,643
You made me out to be a freaking idiot,
and now you offer me a drink?

602
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,774
Did you find my review uncomfortable?

603
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,611
I got bashed for no reason.
What do you think?

604
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,281
Hey, you're really something.

605
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:46,952
I guess you'd have to be this brazen
to be able to put out that kind of drivel.

606
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:48,787
And…

607
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,753
are you seriously having a drink
after what you've done to Mr. Koo?

608
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,841
If he doesn't survive this,

609
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,511
then his death will be on you.

610
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,229
What are you doing? Get up.

611
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,148
Who are you?

612
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:19,234
None of your business. Get up. Now.

613
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,792
You didn't have to listen to him.

614
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:40,255
You must be feeling uneasy about all this.
That was freaking rude of him.

615
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,257
Why would I feel uneasy?

616
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,051
What?

617
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,553
Am I supposed to feel uneasy?

618
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,931
I didn't do anything wrong.

619
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,309
I mean, it's not my fault
the movie flopped.

620
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,270
Not all movies do well.

621
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,607
We're all bound to face some misfortune.

622
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,109
This isn't about the movie.

623
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,611
Someone got hurt.

624
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:08,700
I know, and I'm saying
that it's not my responsibility.

625
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,537
It's not my fault.

626
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,625
Mr. Ko.

627
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,878
I never said it was your fault.

628
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:24,466
People who say that
are just looking for someone to blame.

629
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,136
Don't you think the same way?

630
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,265
Have you always been so twisted?

631
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,893
Anything else you'd like to lecture me on?

632
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,191
Ms. Kim.

633
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,611
I want to comfort you, not lecture you.
I'm empathizing, not criticizing.

634
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,947
Didn't you notice

635
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,492
how Mr. Ma and I were trying to be there
for you while watching you closely?

636
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,745
You can pretend
like you're indifferent to your pain,

637
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,914
but don't disregard those around you.

638
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,296
Do you know what made me angry
when I saw you again?

639
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,924
You only cared about your own pain,
just like you do now.

640
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,719
You aren't concerned
about the other person.

641
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:16,870
Okay.

642
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,414
Let's work together.

643
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,129
Starting now,
I'm betting everything I have on this.

644
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,008
What would that be?

645
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,426
My pride.

646
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:38,475
The pride that made me refuse to be
bailed out by someone I once loved.

647
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,768
Si-jun.

648
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,603
So I'm going to make it big.

649
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,106
Even bigger than you.

650
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,003
Mom, I'm leaving now.

651
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,338
You should take this.

652
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,551
Okay.

653
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:24,688
KOO YEONG-SIK

654
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,243
You're Mubee, aren't you?

655
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,579
It's okay. Don't get up.

656
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,415
You still look the same.

657
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,044
And you've grown quite old.

658
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,046
Is that right?

659
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,590
Your mom used to tell me about you.

660
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,176
I was so proud to hear
you became a movie director.

661
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,803
And I loved your movie too.

662
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,516
Hun-dong would've been thrilled
to see this.

663
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,563
So what brings you here?

664
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,982
What happened to you?

665
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,484
Did you really…

666
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:16,448
It wasn't like that.
The reporters twisted it.

667
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:17,574
Really?

668
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,827
I haven't been able to sleep
without sleeping pills for a while.

669
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,746
I also have anxiety issues.

670
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:27,501
That night, I took the pills
after drinking too much and…

671
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,005
I didn't know
things would blow up like this.

672
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:41,431
This line of work sure takes its toll
physically and mentally.

673
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,225
Are you doing all right?

674
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,936
You have to look after your health.

675
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,064
I've been staying healthy to prove

676
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:52,150
that I can do this
without burning myself out.

677
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:57,906
Your dad always bragged about you.

678
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,118
He said you were very smart, unlike him.

679
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,996
If the worst had happened to you,

680
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,459
I would've been left with
only my hatred for movies.

681
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,755
What is it with movies
that make people this way?

682
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,466
Goodness me. I'm ashamed.

683
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,346
You should dust yourself off
and start your next project.

684
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,349
I've loved your movies
ever since I was a kid.

685
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,310
All right. Thank you.

686
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,190
You need to recover,
so I'll leave you to rest.

687
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,401
I would love to rest,

688
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,945
but that kid keeps pestering me.

689
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:40,991
I tell him that I'm fine,
but he still comes by every day.

690
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,858
What are you doing here?

691
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:22,199
I'm… just waiting.

692
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,619
For what?

693
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,960
I'm waiting for something good
to happen again.

694
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,600
And it's you again.

695
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,646
Though I hate to admit it…

696
00:53:56,441 --> 00:54:00,987
my weakness is
that I still open up my heart too easily

697
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,157
to pitiful little things.

698
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,452
I'm tired.

699
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,413
Yeah.

700
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,041
Me too.

701
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:26,179
And I'm afraid that Ko Gyeom
might just be one of those things.

702
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:37,983
MELO MOVIE

703
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,290
I don't think I'm too happy to know

704
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,502
that Kim Mubee is yet again the luck
that follows my misfortune.

705
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:04,259
Because then the next time
and the time after that…

706
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,738
Where'd he go?

707
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,747
What was that? He could've woken me up.

708
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,708
I can't believe he just left me there.

709
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,002
You startled me.

710
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:42,005
What's going on? I thought you left.

711
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,507
And you shouldn't scare people like that.

712
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,135
You looked cold, so I got a blanket.

713
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:51,181
Were you going to let me sleep out here
and not send me home?

714
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,809
Oh, you're right.
Why didn't I think of that?

715
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,562
I'm leaving now.

716
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:01,107
You should stop being so miserable here
and go home already.

717
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,655
You're really frustrating.

718
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,450
Mubee.

719
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,329
Who said you could use my first name?

720
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,041
…I hope that will be the case every time.

721
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:23,880
I…

722
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,302
want to like you again.

723
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:44,938
