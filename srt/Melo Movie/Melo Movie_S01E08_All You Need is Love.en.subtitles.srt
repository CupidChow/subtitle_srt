1
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,223
What kind of movie are you going to make?

2
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,517
An awesome

3
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,228
melo movie.

4
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,315
Melo?

5
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,779
I know that I don't exactly
seem like the romantic type.

6
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,453
Even when I look back on my childhood…

7
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,289
I'm going to school!

8
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,544
I'm home.

9
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,339
I'm home.

10
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,717
I'm home.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,801
How was your day?

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,599
What on earth
are you getting into out there?

13
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,559
Hey, come in.

14
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,732
Hello.

15
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:06,816
Hey there.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,318
We'll play in my room.

17
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:09,652
Sure.

18
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:10,987
Come on.

19
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:17,660
Hey, is Mubee bullying you by any chance?

20
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,331
…romance seemed to have
no place at all in my life.

21
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,166
Let's go.

22
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,172
Hey, watch me.
I can even do a backward roll.

23
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,508
One, two, three.

24
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,260
Kim Mubee!

25
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,267
I was the type of person who'd get bored
sitting at home watching romance movies.

26
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,895
Hey, it was you guys again, huh?

27
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,189
-Run!
-Run away!

28
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,982
Get back here!

29
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,749
CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST

30
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,715
Found you!

31
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,427
Dad, what kind of movie is this?

32
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,263
A melo movie.

33
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,640
What's melo?

34
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,352
Stories about people who love each other.

35
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,436
Love?

36
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,815
That sounds boring.
Why would anyone watch that?

37
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,862
Because watching it makes you feel good.

38
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,030
You need that sometimes.

39
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,366
Like when?

40
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,412
You'll find out when you're older.
Want to watch it together?

41
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,329
Sure.

42
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,749
I didn't know what he meant at the time.

43
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,432
But, well, I think
it was a pretty nice feeling.

44
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,811
Happy birthday to you

45
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,856
Happy birthday to you

46
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,985
Happy birthday, dear Mubee

47
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,363
Happy birthday to you

48
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,467
Maybe that was why…

49
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,904
I picked up the habit of seeking out
all the cliché love stories.

50
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,032
Stanley Kubrick is the best.

51
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,367
The Shining was great,

52
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,620
but I think Dr. Strangelove
was the most groundbreaking.

53
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,623
I say Hitchcock is still the best.

54
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,751
His top seven movies?
I could name them right now.

55
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,169
What about you?

56
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,421
Chungking Express.

57
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,840
No other movies have been able to depict

58
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,593
intense emotions like loneliness
and futility better.

59
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,679
Mubee, what's your favorite?

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,764
Love Actually.

61
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,143
No, your all-time favorite,
not the stuff you watch to kill time.

62
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,021
Love Actually.

63
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,148
Hey, Mubee.

64
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,401
We're film majors.

65
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,988
Don't you think we should discuss
something more profound and artistic?

66
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,782
I guess not.

67
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,659
-Let's drink.
-Drink up.

68
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,576
Cheers.

69
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,583
Even so, a slender woman like her
carrying a corpse like it's nothing?

70
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,128
-Isn't that a bit far-fetched?
-Right.

71
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,504
-If we use a cart--
-Here.

72
00:04:56,587 --> 00:05:01,009
If she chopped up the body like this,
she could carry the corpse in pieces.

73
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,595
Using a bone knife or a saw
would help make nice, clean cuts.

74
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,764
She'd be able to do that by herself.

75
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,519
How do you always know this stuff?
What kind of movies do you watch?

76
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,773
You should definitely do
a thriller next time.

77
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,067
But I'm going to make a melo.

78
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:21,779
Why?

79
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,035
I don't know why.

80
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,122
I heard the news.

81
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,625
You're marrying Eun-gyeong.

82
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,504
ON-SET FILMING VEHICLE

83
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,478
I still don't know what love is.

84
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,652
But I do know there are moments
when you really need it.

85
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,665
Like when someone loses a loved one.

86
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,390
I'm not sure how much time has passed.

87
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,103
The weird thing about death is

88
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,231
that you expect it to change everything…

89
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,876
but… it changes nothing, really.

90
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,800
MOVIE CRITIC KO GYEOM

91
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,350
A SUMMER THAT WENT PAST
WITHOUT HEAT OR STYLE

92
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,060


93
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,111
TO KO GYEOM

94
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,876
No one's life…

95
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,048
including my own,

96
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,133
has changed one bit.

97
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,184
Hey, Gyeom. Wanna grab a drink tonight?

98
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,782
Gyeom, have you eaten yet?
Should I drop some food off later?

99
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,412
Except that people started bothering me
with frequent messages.

100
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:11,842
What're you up to?

101
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:19,350
It looked as if Gyeom was naturally
settling back into his life.

102
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,273
Of all the movies I've seen recently,
that was the hardest watch.

103
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,734
The soundtrack was constantly distracting,

104
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,613
and the character placement was very odd.

105
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,908
I better go watch it again.
What do you think?

106
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,243
Me?

107
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,328
I had no idea what…

108
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,289
We walked together every single day.

109
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,416
-Gyeom.
-Yes?

110
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,376
This is really good. Try it just once.

111
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,336
I really can't eat pineapple pizza.

112
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,046
It's really good. Just one bite.

113
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,550
Trust me.

114
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,511
We ate together
whenever we could make time.

115
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:08,274
We also spent all night
chatting over trivial things.

116
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,152
Oh no!

117
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,200
I told you we had to leave earlier.

118
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,910
We would've made it if we ran.

119
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,414
-I forgot you had such short legs.
-What did you say?

120
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,835
Shall we just walk and sober up?
It's only a 30-minute walk.

121
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,713
No, I don't feel like it.
Let's grab a taxi.

122
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,506
Come on, let's walk.

123
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,883
Come on now.

124
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,594
Let's go. That's it.

125
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,722
-Gyeom, let's just get a taxi.
-Let's just walk.

126
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,142
We were just like
any other ordinary couple.

127
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,821
Except for the sudden…

128
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,509
anxiety that crept in at times.

129
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,514
Hey, Ko Gyeom.

130
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:22,848
Yes?

131
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,518
Look at me.

132
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,616
What are you doing?

133
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,867
Transmitting.

134
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,910
What?

135
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,495
Didn't you receive it?

136
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,798
Bye now.

137
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,235
TO KO GYEOM
HAVE YOU EATEN?

138
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,301
Making movie soundtracks? You?

139
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,219
Yes.

140
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,513
Can you even make a living
doing that these days?

141
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,390
Well, I am responsible
for the movie's entire soundtrack.

142
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,228
Really? Have you started?
What do you have so far?

143
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,026
Want to hear it?

144
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,906
No, next time.

145
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,078
Why are you here?

146
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:53,666
Why didn't you tell me about Jun?
I heard it from the hospital thirdhand.

147
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,004
CONDOLENCES

148
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,506
Give this to Gyeom.

149
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,093
That's all?

150
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,179
It's more than enough.
Our parents have a reputation to uphold.

151
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,681
That's not what I meant.

152
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,059
Don't you have any words for him?

153
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,978
That man had been ill for a long time.

154
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,106
He got unlucky
with the sudden complications.

155
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,025
But Gyeom must've been preparing
for the worst. Am I wrong?

156
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,569
What?

157
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:25,239
Send him to me if he's struggling.
I'll set up a counseling session for him.

158
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,662
What's wrong?

159
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,292
This will be more helpful
than some useless words. See you.

160
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,753
Hey.

161
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,094
This is your first time here, you know.

162
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,726
Fine. Sorry for coming empty-handed.

163
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,895
Get whatever you need with this.

164
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:22,254
You can't part with your loved one
and just be done with it so easily.

165
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,798
Who said she's done with him?

166
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,637
She's moved on with her life
and back to working hard again

167
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,140
as if she could set her feelings
over the breakup aside.

168
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,060
It shows how you can pretend
to go on with your life

169
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,020
when you're actually dying inside.

170
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,317
But what I'm saying is
that even if that were possible,

171
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,363
those broken parts inside
are bound to crop up now and then again.

172
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,074
Don't you think we need more scenes

173
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,494
where the female lead faces her pain
without her realizing it?

174
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,918
Okay. I get what you mean.

175
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,047
Once we edit that part,
I think we'll be almost done.

176
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,550
I thought you'd rewrite the entire script.
This isn't so bad.

177
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,387
Let's end this meeting on that note.

178
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,063
How's Gyeom doing?

179
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,028
I'm not sure.
He seems to be coping in his own way.

180
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,493
I'm sure you're already doing a great job,
but please look after him.

181
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,455
It seems like you're the only person
he can depend on right now.

182
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,547
Has he ever depended on anyone before?

183
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,802
I don't think so.

184
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,930
He was always so cheerful on his own.

185
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,475
I don't think he ever has.

186
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,193
-When did you get here?
-Do you know what the weirdest thing is?

187
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,695
You?

188
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,448
Have you read my recent review?

189
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,200
It was well-written,
so why is everyone bashing me for it?

190
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,163
It's not a critic's job to write
only good things about movies, is it?

191
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,248
I would if the movie was good.

192
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,876
Just take some time off.

193
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,962
I don't get why you're so diligently
dissing all those directors.

194
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,549
I'm not taking any time off.
I'm going to do all the work I can get.

195
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,260
I can rest
when I stop getting work like you.

196
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,262
Just curse at me.

197
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,682
Know what the second weird thing is?

198
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,310
Yeah. Again, you.

199
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:45,147
You come to your office every day,
even though you have no work.

200
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,816
I guess my reason is the same as yours.

201
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,445
It's because I don't like being alone,
you punk.

202
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,326
Any news on your next movie?

203
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,911
Sheesh! Goddamn it!

204
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,956
How can I possibly make a movie
when nobody's willing to fund it?

205
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,126
Who would want to invest in a movie
by a washed-up director?

206
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,636
Dear me.

207
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,518
Moping around after one dead project
is not charming at all.

208
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,396
Gyeom.

209
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,397
Yes?

210
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,569
Are you here to comfort me
despite what you're going through?

211
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,696
Such a frustrating kid.

212
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,407
You know,

213
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,036
that's the thing about the pain of a loss.

214
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,041
At first, there's so much going on
that it doesn't hit you.

215
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,294
But when you need that person
so desperately

216
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,381
and you realize
they can't be there with you…

217
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:58,011
that's when the pain really sets in.

218
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,224
You don't even read.
Why did you buy so many books?

219
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,477
Likewise with death.

220
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,230
No.

221
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,066
It's painful beyond words.

222
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,361
When that pain hits,
you can't do anything about it.

223
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,613
You have to face it.

224
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,661
When that happens…

225
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,456
just don't be alone, okay?

226
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,509
This wasn't what I had in mind.

227
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,013
I came prepared to tease you today.

228
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,973
I'm not appreciating this vibe.

229
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,725
What did you prepare?

230
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,519
-A grand retirement party?
-Hey!

231
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,105
It was only one dead project.
You can't make me retire!

232
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,356
You just wait and see!

233
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,444
I'm not leaving this industry
unless I'm booed off my director's seat.

234
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,573
People in this industry are ridiculous.
They're not getting rid of me.

235
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,119
Wanna play video games?

236
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,874
If you don't start coming here often,
I might stop being nice to you.

237
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,292
Enjoy your food.

238
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,714
What is it? Are you feeling sick?

239
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,883
Indigestion, maybe? My chest feels tight.

240
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,136
Goodness.
Something must be stressing you out again.

241
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,472
My work isn't going so well.

242
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,271
Why are the songs all so depressing?

243
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,189
Are they?

244
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,942
God, that's how I'm feeling lately.

245
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,777
I have no idea how Gyeom is doing.

246
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,238
Hey, Si-jun.

247
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,408
Why don't we close early today
and visit Gyeom at his place?

248
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,080
Hey.

249
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,290
What do you say?

250
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,753
I'm behind on my work,
so I don't think I can.

251
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,133
Is that so?
I guess we can take a rain check.

252
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,178
You must be busy these days.

253
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,889
It's a good thing that you are,

254
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,975
but check in on Gyeom once in a while.

255
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,059
Seriously.

256
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,811
Hello.

257
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,938
Hello there. It's great to have you.

258
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,275
We have two romantic seats back here.
They are for you.

259
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,987
Okay. I'll take the order.

260
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,009
What's wrong with me?

261
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,038
Gyeom seems strange, huh?

262
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,292
I mean, he's constantly pretending
to be okay.

263
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,878
I think he might be suffering all alone
on the inside.

264
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,381
But isn't it always better

265
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,550
to share your struggles with people
than to suffer alone?

266
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:11,139
I don't know.
He might need more time to himself.

267
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:16,853
Were you like him?

268
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,899
When your dad passed away.

269
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,781
Knowing your personality,
I bet that you suffered all by yourself.

270
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,868
I just didn't have anyone
to share it with.

271
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,250
Maybe that's how he is right now.

272
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,754
-Mubee.
-Yes?

273
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:46,842
I'm sorry.

274
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,053
You always kept me safe when I was a kid,

275
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,889
but I wasn't there for you
when things got tough.

276
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,184
I'm so useless.

277
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,687
It's okay.

278
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:03,275
I'm more worried about you.
Are you sure you're okay now?

279
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,610
You're not sick, are you?

280
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,321
I don't lie about being sick.

281
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,451
It gets really lonely
when you suffer alone.

282
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,417
Aren't you going?

283
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,462
I was going to barge in
when Gyeom came home.

284
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,756
Why is that dude still not home
at this hour?

285
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,967
-He must be working.
-Are you kidding?

286
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,761
Where would a freelancer work
if not at home?

287
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,764
And it's dangerous out there.
He should be home by now.

288
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,350
He's got me worried.

289
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,937
Hey, you seem to care more
about Gyeom than you do me,

290
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,273
and it's getting on my nerves.

291
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,154
Aren't you worried about him?
Have you tried calling him?

292
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,948
Gyeom is a grown-up.

293
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,075
You need to go. Now.

294
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,578
-Go.
-Okay, I'll go.

295
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,997
-I'm leaving.
-Yeah, bye.

296
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,165
Bye.

297
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,586
-See ya.
-Yeah.

298
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,045
We're closed.

299
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,714
You're done for the night, right?

300
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,136
Yes.

301
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,806
Can I take a seat?

302
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:03,353
I'm not here to pick a fight or anything.
I just…

303
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,566
I was too depressed to be alone.

304
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,193
Have you been busy?

305
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,614
I said we should meet Gyeom,
but you ignored my text.

306
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,117
Have you talked to Gyeom?

307
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,162
I'm sure he opens up to you more.

308
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,999
So? How is he? Is he having a tough time?

309
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,751
There's not much to say anyway.

310
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,669
You haven't talked to him yet?

311
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,676
Don't tell me
you haven't seen him since then.

312
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,513
Si-jun!

313
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,849
I don't even know what to say to him.

314
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:28,813
What?

315
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,024
Right, the same old Hong Si-jun.

316
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,860
You have no idea
how to express your feelings.

317
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,779
I can't believe I forgot that.

318
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,324
Picking a fight again?

319
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:43,703
If you don't know what to say,
don't say anything. Just be there for him.

320
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,165
Gyeom has known you long enough.
He knows what you're like.

321
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,668
Stop avoiding him.

322
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,879
At least try to make an effort yourself.

323
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,425
Call or visit him,
and tell him what's on your mind.

324
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,932
What are you doing?

325
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,518
I knew it. Indigestion.

326
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,647
You always get indigestion
when you can't say what you want.

327
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,899
I noticed you massaging
that pressure point for a while.

328
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:16,236
You seem so chill all the time,
but your body says otherwise.

329
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,237
Not true.

330
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,322
What's wrong with you?

331
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,493
What's so hard about sharing
a simple word of comfort?

332
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,831
It's because…

333
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,377
You know I tend to be rude when I talk.

334
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,131
It's better to keep my mouth shut.

335
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,758
Words don't sound sincere at all…

336
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,803
coming from the likes of me.

337
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,821
Have you seen your family lately?

338
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,284
You aren't like that.

339
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,538
Yes, you can be super rude sometimes,

340
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,790
but I can feel your sincerity.

341
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,670
Whatever.

342
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,939
Isn't this reserved
for one of your customers?

343
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,107
You can drink it.

344
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,320
How come? What if they come back?
They're obviously a couple.

345
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,655
See the bottles
with pairs of names on them?

346
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,533
Not a single person came back for them.

347
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,369
How can you be sure?
They might've been too busy.

348
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,288
For years?

349
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,790
It's been that long?

350
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,209
They were pathetic enough
to write both their names.

351
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,878
Now they can't even come back
after their breakup.

352
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,174
Did they think they'd last forever?

353
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,010
Nobody expects to break up.

354
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,056
And who says all those couples are over?
What if they come back?

355
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,224
Not gonna happen.

356
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,559
Wanna bet?

357
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,230
You never grow up, do you?
How's 100,000 won?

358
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,441
Deal. I'm going to ask Sang-sik and check.

359
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,863
You never know how things will end.

360
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,166
Hey, stop drinking
from Huni and Soni's bottle.

361
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,334
My God.

362
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,189
Do you want to talk about Jun?

363
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,529
I want to talk about him,
but I can't do it with Gyeom.

364
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,367
Sure.

365
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,250
I remember when I first met him.

366
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,422
I couldn't believe such a handsome guy
was standing at the school gates.

367
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,635
It was even more unbelievable
that he was Gyeom's brother.

368
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,680
You're right. They look nothing alike.

369
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,893
That's why I asked Jun so many times
if they were really brothers.

370
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,978
-You asked him that?
-Yeah.

371
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,661
I'm home. What are you up to, Kim Mubee?

372
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,663
Are you in bed already, Kim Mubee?

373
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,625
Movie directors usually stay up late,
you know?

374
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,469
I guess he's sleeping.

375
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,303
What are you doing here?

376
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,519
Well, I was looking for something.

377
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:56,826
Gyeom.

378
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,286
Yes?

379
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,621
Did you spend the night in your car?

380
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,212
I came home a little late last night.

381
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:15,053
I saw you getting out of your car
the other morning as well.

382
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,971
Come to think of it,

383
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,974
I haven't seen the lights on
in your house lately.

384
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,190
Have you been sleeping
in your car every day?

385
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,489
Why?

386
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,372
Gyeom.

387
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,212
There's…

388
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,173
no one at home.

389
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,264
No one's home, Mubee.

390
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,144
No matter how hard you pretend
to go on with your life…

391
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,439
So I can't go in there.

392
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:14,362
…the broken parts inside
always seem to crop up again.

393
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,741
Why didn't you say any--

394
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,910
But I'm fine now.

395
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,371
I was going to go inside today.

396
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,874
It's a beat-up car,
so it's uncomfortable to be in.

397
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,711
And the house is a mess,
so I'm going to start cleaning.

398
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,673
Are you?

399
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,927
Yes, so you don't have to worry.

400
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,808
And the anxiety repeatedly creeps in.

401
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,644
All right.

402
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,107
I have to get ready for work.
I'll go in now.

403
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,567
Okay.

404
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,929
Ms. Kim, here are the meeting materials.

405
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,783
She has long, straight hair now,
but after one year,

406
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,411
we would have to change
her hair into something

407
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,829
that doesn't overlap with…

408
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,542
About the wardrobe…

409
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,224
I did go inside, but…

410
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,601
Yes.

411
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:54,689
Mubee.

412
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,109
Yes?

413
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,737
I think something's wrong with me.

414
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,617
It's okay.

415
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:39,942
Transmitting.

416
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,779
Did you receive it?

417
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,549
Gyeom.

418
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,468
Yes?

419
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,891
When tomorrow comes…
let's go home together.

420
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,352
Yes.

421
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,305
Sorry.

422
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,893
Hey, wait! What are you doing?

423
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:56,977
Open the door.

424
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,277
So that's the passcode.

425
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,446
Okay.

426
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,156
But…

427
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,034
What's with that pillow
and all that stuff?

428
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,578
What's going on?
It's like you're moving in.

429
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,330
-That's right.
-What?

430
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,665
I am, for a while.

431
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,000
Are you out of your mind?

432
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,461
Your house is right there.

433
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,880
What will you tell your mother?

434
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,716
She's not that uptight.
She liked it, actually.

435
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:29,927
You already told her?

436
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,513
Yes, that I'd stay at the office
since I was too busy.

437
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,852
I mean, "office" can mean
quite a lot of things.

438
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,397
So you lied?

439
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,107
Did I?

440
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,318
But habitual lies are a must
in a mother-daughter relationship.

441
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,405
Goodbye now.
Get more comfortable with your home.

442
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,538
By the way, this feels pretty good.

443
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,040
Leaving you here at home
and going to work.

444
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,126
How so?

445
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,545
Can I expect to come home
to your homemade jjigae?

446
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,213
Why?

447
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,383
Think of it as a preview
of your married life with someone. Bye.

448
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,135
What?

449
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,554
What are you talking about?

450
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,890
Married life with who?

451
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,950
I'll be home right after work.

452
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,577
Make sure you're home then.

453
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,334
Ms. Kim,
you're going to have to visit the set.

454
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,212
Today?

455
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,975
Excuse me?
You left a bottle here five years ago?

456
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:00,893
Yes.

457
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,979
I think we wrote,
"Sang-gyu loves Jeong-yun."

458
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,315
"Sang-gyu loves Jeong…"

459
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,233
It's Jeong-yun.

460
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,318
Right. Ms. Jeong-yun.

461
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,863
-I'll check.
-If you don't have it, it's fine.

462
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,117
I know you. I remember!

463
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,953
My goodness. But it's been too long.

464
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,829
-It's been a while.
-Ta-da!

465
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,207
Sang-gyu and Jeong-yun, right?

466
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,708
Oh my God!

467
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,253
You kept this here all this time?

468
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,296
I'm so touched, really.

469
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,756
-Let's take a picture.
-Yes.

470
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,801
It's been here for so long.
I don't think it's safe to drink it.

471
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,095
-You should throw it out.
-What do you mean?

472
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,347
They've come all the way here to drink it.

473
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:42,601
So why did it take you five years
to come back for it?

474
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,314
Actually, we were broken up.

475
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,817
Then we got back together.

476
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,403
And we're getting married.

477
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,448
Wow, really?

478
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:00,786
Congratulations. In that case,
I should treat you two to a drink.

479
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:03,247
This is one hell of a drink.

480
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,209
Wait a minute.

481
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,378
Is there a thief around here?

482
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,255
I swear there used to be this much.

483
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,216
Is this your bottle?

484
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,134
Yes.

485
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,094
Who are Huni and Soni?

486
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,138
They are my beloved dogs.

487
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,058
Now, let's each take a drink,

488
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,644
although I'm missing some liquor.

489
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,980
Have a drink each.

490
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:31,066
-So when is your wedding?
-Next spring.

491
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,212
Did you get home safely last…

492
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,184
About that whiskey…

493
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,566
You asleep?

494
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,424
I wrote a new song.

495
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,309
SON JU-A

496
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,222
Gyeom! Ko Gyeom!

497
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:32,896
Gyeom.

498
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:37,192
Ko Gyeom!

499
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,653
Gyeom?

500
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,325
Oh my God!

501
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,329
Come on. You startled me.

502
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,081
You startled me more.

503
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,499
Did you just get home?

504
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,254
I mean, what are you doing
with all the lights off?

505
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:03,218
The electricity and gas got cut off.
I guess I was overdue on the bills.

506
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:04,678
What?

507
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,152
Should I have lit more candles?

508
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:24,698
Are you crying?

509
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,075
Were you that surprised?

510
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,963
And to shoo away the sudden anxiety
that creeps in again…

511
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:57,940
Gyeom.

512
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,488
You're not alone.

513
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,660
…just one moment or a few simple words

514
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,661
will do.

515
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,180
I am in love with you.

516
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:46,864
So,

517
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,867
we will never be…

518
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,121
alone from now on.

519
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,724
Hongsi, what took you so long?

520
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,772
Should I have just gone to the bar?

521
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,360
Why are you so surprised?

522
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,613
-Why are you here?
-You said you wrote a song.

523
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,407
I want to be the first to hear it.

524
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,284
I'll play it now.

525
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:06,795
What do you think?

526
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,341
What?

527
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,011
How is it? Is it bad?

528
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,014
I was sure this one was good.

529
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,934
Who else did you share this with?

530
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,352
You're the only one.

531
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,479
Let me be the first to hear your songs.

532
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:25,480
Why?

533
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,524
I listen to a lot of music,

534
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,943
so I can tell right away
if it's good or not.

535
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,696
So how is it? Tell me.

536
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:35,657
It's good!

537
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,161
Let me hear it again.

538
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,747
Why are you in such a rush?

539
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,628
Sit down.

540
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,011
Okay, here goes.

541
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:57,971
-Listen.
-Okay.

542
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,180
Si-jun, you really are the best!

543
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,892
-Was it okay?
-Yes.

544
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:46,144
That was the best thing
I've heard in my life.

545
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,855
I almost cried listening to it.

546
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,732
-Do you mean it?
-Yes.

547
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,442
Is this why you were in a rush?

548
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,778
Yes, I had to have you hear it first.

549
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:55,946
What?

550
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:59,449
Because seeing you smile like that
reassures me.

551
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,746
Come here.

552
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:07,541
I'm so relieved.

553
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,126
I'm proud of you, Hongsi.

554
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,674
STAR - UPLOAD

555
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:40,949
J: WOW! IT'S BEEN A WHILE
I'M ALWAYS ROOTING AND WAITING FOR YOU!

556
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,873
J: AGAIN, ANOTHER GREAT SONG!

557
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:51,293
I HOPE EVERYONE WHO LISTENS TO THIS SONG
HAS A WONDERFUL DAY

558
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,636
J: IT'S SNOWING OUTSIDE!
THIS SONG MAKES THE WINTER WARMER

559
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,306
J: THE KIND OF MUSIC I WOULD HEAR
IN MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS

560
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:07,058
J: COMFORTING MUSIC, JUST WHAT I NEEDED

561
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:11,646
J: THE SOUND REMINDS ME OF THE COLD SEA

562
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,994
Let's go inside. I'm curious.

563
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,167
Ju-a.

564
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:33,919
Yes?

565
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,799
Are we over? Or are we…

566
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,804
on our way back to each other?

567
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:12,582
MELO MOVIE

568
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:42,005
That punk. Clean up a little, man.

569
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,092
Damn it!

570
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,177
What are you doing?

571
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,015
What?

572
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,975
What are you doing over there?

573
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:58,188
You punk. Why do you keep sleeping
in your car and not your freaking house?

574
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,483
Is that why you brought survival supplies?
What is all this?

575
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,196
What? A humidifier?

576
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,864
Isn't this way too extra?

577
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,076
Hey, this one tasted good.

578
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,995
And that blanket gets too staticky.

579
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,042
You knew?

580
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,045
You left me all this stuff.
Of course I knew.

581
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,756
You slept here again?

582
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:29,302
No, Mubee caught me sleeping in here,
so I went back inside.

583
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:30,804
Yeah?

584
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,180
Yeah.

585
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,065
Hey, I--

586
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,983
Screw it. Let's just go to the sauna.

587
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,486
Okay, sure.

588
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,707
I don't wanna hear
your annoying little chitchat.

589
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,836
Does my car stink?

590
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,256
Yeah, man, it reeks.

591
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:10,296
