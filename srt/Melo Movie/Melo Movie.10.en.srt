1
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,109
<i>Even with seemingly endless, dark tunnels,</i>

2
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,070
<i>there is light at the end.</i>

3
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,424
<i>The light in the darkness.</i>

4
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,093
<i>That's what movies were to me.</i>

5
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,685
<i>Inside a simple square-shaped light,</i>
<i>anything was possible.</i>

6
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,148
<i>It made me feel as if I could do anything.</i>

7
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,486
<i>But the world outside of movies…</i>

8
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,239
<i>was always harsh and burdensome.</i>

9
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,327
<i>There were no well-crafted plots</i>

10
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,371
<i>or heartwarming lines.</i>

11
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,249
<i>Life was just lonely</i>

12
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,252
<i>and desolate.</i>

13
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,176
<i>That's when someone showed up.</i>

14
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,179
<i>Kim Mubee.</i>

15
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,159
<i>I don't know if she's walking</i>
<i>through the same darkness as me.</i>

16
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,162
<i>But what matters is…</i>

17
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,041
<i>it's no longer</i>
<i>the square-shaped light that I love…</i>

18
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,717
<i>I love Kim Mubee.</i>

19
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,772
If I share my secret with you,
will you still like me

20
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,441
and not leave me?

21
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,121
I think I'm the reason my dad died.

22
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,133
<i>I think some things are only realized</i>
<i>when you say them out loud.</i>

23
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:14,277
<i>I thought I had escaped my past,</i>
<i>but I was mistaken.</i>

24
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:20,033
<i>All things begin with something</i>
<i>insignificant and simple.</i>

25
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,368
<i>I was just a kid…</i>

26
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,120
Mom, is Dad home?

27
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,540
He sent a present for your birthday.

28
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,375
You should open it.

29
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,466
<i>…who wanted to be loved. That's all.</i>

30
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,803
<i>That's not too much to ask for, is it?</i>

31
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,098
<i>- Whoever unties more wins!</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

32
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,519
<i>Wait for me.</i>

33
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,911
<i>He should've at least tried</i>
<i>not to get caught.</i>

34
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,290
Dad, at the end of the movie…

35
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,172
- You must be Director Kim Seong-hwan.
- Yes.

36
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,508
I'm a huge fan.

37
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,594
I didn't expect to run into you here.
May I shake your hand?

38
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,596
Actually, I'm a filmmaker too.

39
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,641
- Is that so? Thank you.
- Yes.

40
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:30,687
I very much enjoyed your new movie.
How did you come up with such a…

41
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,522
<i>Because a child who was never loved…</i>

42
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,606
It blew me away.

43
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,608
Are you here to see the movie by yourself?

44
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,485
No. I came with my daughter too.

45
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,533
<i>…will spend their whole life</i>
<i>thinking it was all their fault.</i>

46
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:44,993
Mubee!

47
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:53,751
But then I realized that hating Dad
would be the better thing to do.

48
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,005
So I hated him as much as I could.

49
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,090
It wasn't easy

50
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,719
to hate someone
who only showed up occasionally

51
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,595
and was nothing but nice to me.

52
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,182
But I wasn't going to back down either.

53
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,979
Mubee, where's your dad?

54
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,690
I don't have one. He died.

55
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,319
I'm serious.

56
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:24,866
Mubee!

57
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,828
Mubee, is that your dad?

58
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,498
No, I don't know that man.

59
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,463
I wonder what young Mubee was like.

60
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,631
She'd be more difficult to manage
than I am now.

61
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,016
But I guess you get used to
hating someone.

62
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,895
I grew less and less eager to see him.

63
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,607
We were growing apart…

64
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,569
and I was fine with it.

65
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:27,970
<i>But then…</i>

66
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,065
<i>I didn't want to see him like that.</i>

67
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,360
FOUR-LEAF CLOVER

68
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,655
<i>It felt weird.</i>

69
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,415
<i>As if my insides were churning.</i>

70
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,126
Stop it already!

71
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,461
Nobody's going to help you in return.

72
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:04,632
<i>The director said he'd help with mine</i>
<i>after we finish this project.</i>

73
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,800
<i>He means it this time.</i>

74
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,886
And you believed him again?
Whenever you do this, I…

75
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,684
Just spend the rest of your life
chasing movies.

76
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,769
Don't force yourself to be a dad.

77
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,688
I really don't care.

78
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,107
<i>I'll be home tomorrow</i>

79
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,276
<i>for my little girl's birthday.</i>

80
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,777
I'm not a kid anymore.

81
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,531
<i>I just feel bad I wasn't there for you</i>
<i>when you were younger.</i>

82
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:33,035
<i>I better get there before you start</i>
<i>another rumor that your dad died.</i>

83
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,123
I used to pull that trick
because I thought you might show up,

84
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,207
but not anymore.

85
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,878
It's been a while
since I considered myself fatherless.

86
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,380
<i>Mubee, I'm sorry.</i>

87
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,175
<i>What can I do to make it up to you?</i>

88
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,176
Really?

89
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,220
Stop shooting the movie,
and come home now.

90
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,555
Can you do that?

91
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:11,991
Hello?

92
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,701
Yes.

93
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,846
Mubee.

94
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,516
Dad

95
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,685
got into an accident.

96
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,027
I was really mean to him.

97
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:55,535
I thought he was pathetic,
and I was ashamed of him.

98
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,373
I knew it would hurt him,
but I still said those words.

99
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,753
I was suffering, too, so I thought
I had the right to act like that.

100
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,633
But I didn't want him to really die.

101
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,386
I mean it. I just…

102
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,723
I just wanted him to love me.

103
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:04,270
LIFE IS A BEAUTIFUL, MAGNIFICENT THING,
EVEN TO A JELLYFISH

104
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,696
I thought something incredible
would happen if I confessed all that.

105
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,367
But it wasn't a big deal. How lame.

106
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,371
You're right.

107
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,915
It's a good thing.

108
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,418
Strangely, that's how I feel
when I'm with you.

109
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,796
Everything feels okay.

110
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,887
Then continue to stay by my side
like you are now.

111
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,985
What's on your mind?

112
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:56,989
Not much.

113
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,326
You and me.

114
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,787
Thoughts about us.

115
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,500
It's nice being out here.

116
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,628
Should we stay until sunrise?

117
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,257
I'll get on your mother's bad side
if I keep making you stay out all night.

118
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,513
This car may be beat-up,
but I'm glad we get to do this.

119
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,306
My beat-up car can hear you.

120
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,018
Why are you driving such an old car?

121
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,605
Because it's cool.
They drive cars like these in the movies.

122
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,027
People like movies way too much.

123
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,571
Why in the world do you like them?

124
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,203
At first, it was because
I was scared to be alone.

125
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:52,461
After that, because it was something
I could do with Jun.

126
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:02,972
Gyeom.

127
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,475
What's your secret?

128
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,064
My secret?

129
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,650
Well…

130
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,906
It's dark.

131
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,161
It's hard to bear and depressing.

132
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,455
It's not a fun story.

133
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,374
I still want to hear it.

134
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:42,178
As a kid,
I was always afraid to be left alone.

135
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,349
I was sick of watching movies
waiting until Jun got home.

136
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,313
It was hard pretending to be
all nice and smiley.

137
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,691
You were young.
You were allowed to complain.

138
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,110
I was worried Jun would vanish if I did.

139
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,615
It was clear, even to a kid like me,

140
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,494
that Jun seemed like
he could disappear at any moment.

141
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,709
You were way too kind, Gyeom.

142
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,171
I wasn't kind.

143
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,759
When I realized
he'd tried to end his life,

144
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,302
I pretended like I had no idea.

145
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,222
I stayed quiet until the end

146
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,183
in case it really was because of me.

147
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,478
Gyeom.

148
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,729
See?

149
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,857
My secret…

150
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,861
is depressing and cowardly.

151
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,913
We're a mess.

152
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:53,999
Right?

153
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,088
I think dying is really…

154
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,969
shitty.

155
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,306
Yeah.

156
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,434
It is.

157
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,900
Wait, what? Why is the door unlocked…

158
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,027
Hey.

159
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,195
Hey. Did you get enough rest?

160
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,656
You asked for a few days off.
Why are you back so soon?

161
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,909
I had nothing to do.

162
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,583
You don't look like
you enjoyed your time off.

163
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,585
What's wrong?

164
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,591
Sang-sik.

165
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,508
What?

166
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,306
How did we appear to you?

167
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,059
When Ju-a and I were together.

168
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,561
Come on. I can't tell you that.

169
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,982
You'll sulk again.
That's a taboo word, isn't it?

170
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,276
Tell me.

171
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,445
Do you mean it?

172
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,283
Well, I'm only saying this
because you're asking me,

173
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,535
but you two were something!

174
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,039
You would strut around
with a guitar on your back.

175
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,167
She would pack lunchboxes
and follow you everywhere.

176
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,836
I wouldn't say Ju-a was your girlfriend.

177
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,922
She was like a mother to you. No.

178
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,092
I think she might have been
more like a fangirl.

179
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,887
Anyway, she would never get tired.
I'll give her that.

180
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,888
Is that so?

181
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,559
I mean, you know…

182
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,396
I meant that's how it seemed
on the outside.

183
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,233
Hey, do you know how terrible you were?

184
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,569
All you ever talked about was,
"Son Ju-a this, Son Ju-a that."

185
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,698
"I'm gonna eat with Ju-a.
I'm gonna hang out with Ju-a."

186
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,201
Other than the time you spent here working
and working on your music,

187
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,912
you were literally glued to that girl
all the time.

188
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,832
I even thought,
"How can a guy be like that?"

189
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,678
You two made a great couple.

190
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,472
That's what I'm saying.

191
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,563
That's something
you can only do at that age.

192
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:09,319
Do you think you'll ever be in love
or have a relationship like that again?

193
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:15,951
The way I see it, you two were very lucky
to have met each other.

194
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,708
You nutty young'uns were wild and crazy.
Goodness gracious.

195
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,172
I see what's going on. Hey.

196
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,257
You met Ju-a yesterday, huh?

197
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,305
I wanted to see
if there was still a chance for us…

198
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,267
but I don't know anymore.

199
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,482
Si-jun.

200
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,652
What do you think completes love?

201
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,537
Marriage?

202
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,373
Passing away together?

203
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,876
No, you're wrong.

204
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,631
Love is already complete as is.

205
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,092
Do you understand?

206
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,387
If your love was great,
you should be happy with that.

207
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:22,142
How many romance movies do you think
I watched while running the video store?

208
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,479
I'm an expert on love.
That's why women are all over me.

209
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,900
You finish cleaning up.
I wonder how the kitchen's looking.

210
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,194
I LOVE YOU EVERY MOMENT
LET'S ALWAYS BE HAPPY

211
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,831
JU-A, IT'S ME, HONGSI
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

212
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,262
THANK YOU FOR COMING INTO MY LIFE
AND STAYING WITH ME, I LOVE YOU!

213
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,741
I LOVE YOU!

214
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,132
Hello, ma'am.

215
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,009
What are you doing here?

216
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,220
I was about to ring the doorbell.

217
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,804
Mubee is still asleep.

218
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,098
I know. I came to see you.

219
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,524
This is for you.

220
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,569
Flowers? That's random.

221
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,947
Did you come to give me these?

222
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,830
What's all this?

223
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,749
I heard you liked flowers.

224
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:54,586
So I prepared only the kinds
that are easy to grow as a small gift.

225
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,879
Are you mad?

226
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,674
What will I do with all this?
Who's going to plant them all?

227
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,275
Oh, I didn't know you were still here.

228
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,445
I almost couldn't tell you apart
from the flowers.

229
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,697
Be quiet.

230
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,365
Yes, ma'am.

231
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,204
Do you know what the neighbors might think

232
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,998
if Mubee frequents your house?

233
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,002
Then how about I frequent
this house instead?

234
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,128
What do you think?

235
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,630
We'll meet outside.

236
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,804
Hey, make sure you space them out.

237
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,890
Maybe you could show me how it's done.

238
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,060
Maybe not.

239
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,230
You can go inside.

240
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,240
You said you tend to
have too much on your mind

241
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,035
but have trouble opening up about it.

242
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,871
Are you still like that?

243
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,458
I decided to change.

244
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,756
Good. You should say all the things
you want to say.

245
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,467
Some things only end when you do.

246
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,689
What if…

247
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,735
the one who has to hear it isn't here?

248
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,074
They are here even if we can't see them.

249
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,831
I hoped Mubee would date
someone more simple,

250
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,459
but it seems like
she's met someone just like her.

251
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,257
I'm simple when I'm with Mubee.

252
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,721
Then please listen
to what's on my little girl's mind.

253
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,391
She has no one else to lean on.

254
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,976
Is that right?

255
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,980
She probably depends on you
more than you think.

256
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:25,737
I have to open for business,
so make sure you finish what you started.

257
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,194
<i>Mother likes me again!</i>

258
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,525
Why are you sitting out here?

259
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,879
He's done a pretty good job.

260
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,715
Isn't Gyeom cute?

261
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,718
Not in the slightest.

262
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,305
But he seems like a good guy.

263
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,068
What kind of person was Dad to you?

264
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,863
He was a pitiful and foolish man.

265
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:18,785
Someone miserable for much longer
than he was ever happy.

266
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,163
But that's just how

267
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,333
some people in this world are.

268
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,337
People who are never quite good
at what they love

269
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:34,342
yet are foolish enough
not to know when to let go.

270
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:44,519
But he would've given up much earlier
if you weren't around.

271
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,318
He always wanted to show you

272
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,572
how wonderfully he could tell his story…

273
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,493
and how he would never give up.

274
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,040
What a fool.

275
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,083
But you know…

276
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,588
you take after your dad more.

277
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,676
What? What are you talking about?
I take after you.

278
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,429
You don't know how sweet you are.

279
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,060
I can see that in your movie.

280
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,105
You're so warmhearted, like your dad.

281
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:37,656
That's why I'd like to see more movies
made by you.

282
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,136
Mom.

283
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,263
You know…

284
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,309
I have something to say.

285
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,227
Mubee.

286
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,315
I'm sorry…

287
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,071
that I was never kind to you.

288
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:25,078
<i>I realize I'm still just a child</i>
<i>in moments like these.</i>

289
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,164
You wouldn't have had such a tough time

290
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,876
if I had been kinder to you,

291
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,546
but I couldn't be.

292
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,299
I was not even close.

293
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,514
I'm sorry.

294
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:51,229
<i>I got too caught up in my pain</i>
<i>and failed to see those around me.</i>

295
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,225
FROM YOUR LOVING DAD

296
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:32,937
I'm not late, am I?

297
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,690
I had to close the store.

298
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,858
Dad left again?

299
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,195
What were you going to see?
You can see it with me instead.

300
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,199
I can just see it alone.
You never come to the movies, Mom.

301
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,034
Do you even know who Batman is?

302
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,996
Of course I do. He's one of those guys
who fly around in their underwear.

303
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,792
He's not just one of those guys.

304
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,212
And you haven't seen the previous movies,
so you won't understand a thing.

305
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,672
I'll know when I watch it.
Where is it? Let's go.

306
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,757
That way.

307
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,217
Let's go.

308
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:11,703
<i>Why did I not see that I was never alone</i>
<i>and it was always the two of us?</i>

309
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,345
It's okay.

310
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,723
It's okay, Mubee.

311
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,310
It's not your fault.

312
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,273
Don't you hate me?

313
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,027
How could I hate you?

314
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,406
Why am I so stupid?

315
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,744
I'm sorry I complained
about never being loved.

316
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,705
I'm sorry I acted like a kid.

317
00:31:56,205 --> 00:32:02,462
I'm so sorry
for taking your love for granted, Mom.

318
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,675
I'm sorry I didn't show you more love.

319
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,220
You gave me everything.

320
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,188
I'll try to be

321
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,441
a better mom to you.

322
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:30,323
So you can stop being in pain.

323
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,788
Do you think you and I
can live happily now?

324
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:39,832
Yes.

325
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,716
Mom…

326
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,165
Why do you want to sell these to me?

327
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,501
Hey, these are valuable.

328
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,003
- They don't look valuable at all.
- They suit you.

329
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:54,217
Who watches VHS tapes these days?
I don't even have a player for this.

330
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,511
Hey, think of these as shelf decor.

331
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,806
- You're forcing me right now.
- They're freebies.

332
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,015
But you want me to pay?

333
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,185
These are as good as freebies.
Just pay me the trip charge.

334
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,146
So I have to take these home
and pay you the trip charge?

335
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,399
Hey, don't be smart and cold-hearted.

336
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,069
- What are you saying? Forget about it.
- Hey!

337
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,864
Hey, man. You're so clumsy.

338
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,783
- What is this? Lift your leg.
- Why?

339
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,784
Screw this.

340
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:20,952
All good. Get in.

341
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,706
Hey, it's okay. Just go now.
You can pay me later.

342
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,667
I'm gonna look ridiculous.

343
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,128
It suits you perfectly. Go already.

344
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:34,632
After you take those, I need to sell
the next wagon to a big client of mine.

345
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,554
- Bye.
- Okay.

346
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,765
Wait. Why did you take that back?

347
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,559
Hey, you already have too much.

348
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,394
Seriously, man.

349
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,741
Director Ma, where are you?
I told you to get here quickly.

350
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,211
Oh my God!

351
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,379
You surprised me.

352
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,090
What brings you here, Ms. Son?

353
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,718
Wait, how did you know I lived here?

354
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:22,096
"I'm sorry. We won't be able to
move forward with this project."

355
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,514
That's it?

356
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,475
Then you just go off the grid?
Have you lost your mind?

357
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,478
I think I elaborated
a little more than that.

358
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,730
Whatever.

359
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,233
I don't understand
how you can back out like that

360
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,485
without looking for a solution.

361
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,322
Is it because
you can always work on another project?

362
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,325
You're just going to bail
on everyone else on board?

363
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,577
Wow, I didn't think you were like that.

364
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,873
You knew I didn't want to do this project,
but you insisted.

365
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,336
To put it more accurately,

366
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,671
you were too embarrassed
to turn it into a movie.

367
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,673
Seriously?

368
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:02,011
Anyway, you need to figure out a way.
We can go to the production company.

369
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,097
No.

370
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,184
You're not running away
until you give me an answer.

371
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,646
I wouldn't have come
if I was the only one in on this.

372
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:16,317
But there is someone
who put all he had into this project.

373
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,987
You'll have to walk over me to go.

374
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,407
What, are you going to lie down
on the ground?

375
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,175
Hey, Kim Mubee!

376
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,469
What did you just call me?

377
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,180
You heard. The movie's canceled.
You're no director to me.

378
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,184
I knew you were the annoying type
when I met you,

379
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,353
but you're actually worse than I imagined.

380
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,273
You said I looked like a civil servant.

381
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,608
As if. You looked like any other drunkard.

382
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,444
"Drunkard"? Look who's talking. Hey!

383
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,445
What?

384
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:14,458
I'm on my way to find a solution.
Either come with me or stay there.

385
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,130
Right now? A solution? Where are we going?

386
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,717
Director Kim, wait for me, please!

387
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,347
I didn't think we'd meet again.

388
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,100
Are you here to talk about
the contract or something?

389
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,435
I didn't think so either.

390
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,479
The production company
will probably contact you about that.

391
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,734
Then why are you here?

392
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,529
To tell you that I listened to the song
you sent me yesterday.

393
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,032
Song? What song?

394
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,451
That was just--

395
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,870
Did you send it so I'd reconsider?

396
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,584
No.

397
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,421
Then why did you send it to me?

398
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,178
Making that song…

399
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,516
made me feel good.

400
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,313
I can't remember
the last time I felt that way.

401
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,025
It felt so good.

402
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,538
I accepted this project in the first place
to mark the end of everything.

403
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,833
It was going to be
my excuse to give up on…

404
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,588
what I'd been holding on to for too long.

405
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,558
Well, it ended here anyway.

406
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:03,317
But thanks to this,
music made me feel something again.

407
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,529
I got excited.

408
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,952
I sent it to you

409
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,872
because I didn't think
it belonged to me anymore.

410
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,047
Then why don't you hold on
to that feeling just a little longer?

411
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,260
You need real closure
to end things properly.

412
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,098
I'm saying
that I won't give up on this just yet

413
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,600
because the music you sent me was so good.

414
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,229
Of course there are other reasons,

415
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:46,652
but listening to your music last night
was the biggest.

416
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,783
You're saying
you'll give this movie another go, right?

417
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,287
Now I'll have to figure out a way.

418
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:00,207
Whether I look for an investor myself,
protest at the production company,

419
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,627
or cut the budget beyond
what was deemed possible,

420
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,504
I'll manage somehow.

421
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,174
Thank you in advance for the support.

422
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,551
So badass.

423
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,388
I'm not sure it's okay
for the music to top the script though.

424
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,806
Director Kim!

425
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,726
So I'm your director again?

426
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,145
You're my favorite director now.

427
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,901
Let me ask you.

428
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:31,071
Do you two have
any large sums of money saved up?

429
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,826
Just joking.

430
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,330
You should've seen your faces.
I feel hurt.

431
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,602
You should give yourself
more time to think about

432
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,980
quitting music after this, Si-jun.

433
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:09,777
Okay.

434
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,364
But I hope you don't quit.

435
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:15,950
I mean it.

436
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,255
Bye.

437
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,220
I'm going to end it after this.

438
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,350
You said you'd take your time.

439
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,529
Oh, you weren't talking about your music.

440
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,158
No.

441
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,662
Okay.

442
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:29,083
I think I've been holding on to the past
for far too long.

443
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,009
I guess we're really going to
break up, then.

444
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:41,845
Yeah.

445
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,682
After we do…

446
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,690
let's not see each other again.

447
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,820
No matter what excuse you bring,
it won't work.

448
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,115
We can't be friends either.

449
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,954
If I hear something about you,
I'll pretend I didn't.

450
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,375
We'll disappear…

451
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,464
from each other's lives completely.

452
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:34,982
But, Ju-a…

453
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,285
that means we won't be able
to do any of those things.

454
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,920
Have fun conversations, make silly jokes,

455
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,923
and chat all day until we fall asleep.

456
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,842
That's what we both do best.

457
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:02,926
Si-jun.

458
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,139
Can you live the rest of your life
without all that?

459
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,850
You'll miss it all so much.

460
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,146
Waking someone up from their sleep
just to have them chat with you?

461
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,565
Not everyone can put up with that.

462
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,041
How do I get through this?

463
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,004
It'll pass.

464
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,014
Well…

465
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:58,690
If, by any chance, I hurt you a lot…

466
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,074
We were great together.

467
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,031
We were really great, Si-jun.

468
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,783
Weren't we?

469
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,414
That's not how you do it. Look.

470
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,250
It's just like breathing, yeah?

471
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,004
Breathe in naturally.

472
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,181
You like that?

473
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,809
You're such a good role model.

474
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,648
How did you manage
to never get caught smoking?

475
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,652
There are lots of things
you don't know about me, kiddo.

476
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,226
Jun.

477
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,061
Yes?

478
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,152
Could you do me a favor?

479
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:38,864
What is it?

480
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,492
I still don't know much about you,

481
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,663
so visit me in my dreams
from time to time.

482
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,792
I won't get mad or nag you.

483
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,505
I'll let you do whatever you want.

484
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,848
Why did you drink this in secret?

485
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,683
You should've counted me in.

486
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,689
I want to drink with you too.

487
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:19,112
The same goes for smoking.
I'll smoke with you if you want.

488
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:24,868
So…

489
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,373
sometimes…

490
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:40,050
just sometimes, visit me in my dreams.

491
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:43,720
Let's hang out.

492
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,150
What's so funny, man?

493
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,738
Right?

494
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,991
I'm laughing like this.

495
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,829
So why are you crying?

496
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,724
Why don't you call out to me
like you used to?

497
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,936
Because you won't come anyway.

498
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,029
- Jun.
- Yes?

499
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,448
There is something

500
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,035
I haven't been able to tell you yet.

501
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,541
I'll be all right.

502
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,545
I'm going to be fine.

503
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,631
So you don't have to worry.

504
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:06,720
I've lived such a happy life
thanks to you.

505
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,141
So I'll try to live the best I can.

506
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,363
It's not like you to look so down.

507
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,701
I was just at the production company.

508
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,497
I talked a big game
about how I'd find an investor,

509
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,749
but what am I going to do?

510
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,335
I don't have anywhere to get money from.

511
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:04,879
What was that?

512
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:08,258
See? I knew you wouldn't give up.

513
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,350
I watched my dad's movies again.

514
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,271
They're still lousy and as boring as ever.

515
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:25,233
But it was heartwarming.

516
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,945
I'm not sure
what he was trying to say though.

517
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,241
So I plan to give it a shot first.
I might find out along the way.

518
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,452
Attagirl.

519
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:39,706
But how will I make it
if I don't have the money?

520
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,917
Where am I going to find an investor?

521
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:48,381
I'll sell all my VHS tapes
and invest in your movie.

522
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,633
I know how cheap they are.

523
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,635
Hey, every little helps.

524
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,097
But why are you selling them?

525
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,602
I just think I've watched enough movies.

526
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:05,482
My goal was to watch
every movie ever made.

527
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,110
But now I'm more curious about the world.

528
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:14,365
That sounded… somewhat philosophical.

529
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,617
Cool, huh?

530
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,534
Ew!

531
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,954
Speaking of which,

532
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,750
I'm going to quit being a movie critic.

533
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:24,667
What?

534
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,753
I don't feel like watching movies anymore.

535
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:32,842
Hey, since we're on the subject,
why didn't you review my movie?

536
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,261
- I did.
- What?

537
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,764
When? Where? I didn't see it.

538
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,015
Do you want to see it?

539
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,189
Oh, it's at home.
Should I just tell you now?

540
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,525
No, thanks. I don't wanna know.

541
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,652
- No, let me tell you.
- No, it's okay.

542
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,070
- Look.
- I'm really fine.

543
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,988
- So, at first…
- Stop it.

544
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,990
When I first saw the movie…

545
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,701
- Wow--
- Stop. It's going to upset me.

546
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,620
- I'll only tell you the good parts.
- Really?

547
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:01,955
Yes, only the good parts.

548
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:06,543
<i>When I was young,</i>
<i>I hoped to become a 20-year-old overnight.</i>

549
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,462
<i>Just like in the movies.</i>

550
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:23,810
<i>Because being young didn't help me</i>
<i>overcome hardships in any way.</i>

551
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:31,276
<i>Then, when I turned 20,</i>
<i>I quickly wanted to become 30.</i>

552
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,696
<i>I thought I needed to get through</i>

553
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:37,115
<i>those amateur years</i>
<i>to numb myself from pain.</i>

554
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:41,995
<i>But even in my thirties,</i>
<i>nothing really changed.</i>

555
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:48,459
<i>I only began to miss the moments</i>
<i>I once hoped would pass quickly.</i>

556
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,212
<i>That's when I realized</i>

557
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:56,384
<i>that every moment I experience</i>
<i>makes my life last longer.</i>

558
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:11,024
<i>So now I'm going to live</i>
<i>every moment to the fullest.</i>

559
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:18,114
<i>Because life isn't a movie but reality.</i>

560
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,660
1 YEAR AND 6 MONTHS LATER

561
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:28,791
<i>And so, that's the reason I'm here.</i>

562
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,045
I had to get a job.

563
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,135
What was the question again?

564
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:44,432
Mr. Ko, you applied
knowing what our company does, right?

565
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,559
Yes, this is a travel agency.

566
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,479
- You're a high school graduate.
- Yes.

567
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:52,899
But I'm confident I have more experience
than other applicants.

568
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:57,612
- Do you speak any foreign languages?
- Whoa, no.

569
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:01,532
But I've watched many foreign movies
since I was a child…

570
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,495
so I probably can.

571
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,333
Such as Chinese, English, and…

572
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,670
Thank you.

573
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,100
Hey.

574
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:31,854
I nailed it. I'm on my way home now.

575
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,190
Yeah, I'll see you at home.

576
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,823
MOVIE MELODY

577
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:42,907
MELODY, 2024

578
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:46,661
<i>Kim Mubee's movie managed to get made.</i>

579
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,957
<i>And it flopped miserably.</i>

580
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:56,462
<i>No, I wouldn't say it's a flop.</i>
<i>How should I put this?</i>

581
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:03,970
<i>Mubee created quite an artsy movie,</i>
<i>which was very unlike her.</i>

582
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,225
Thank you.

583
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:12,145
<i>But what's more surprising is…</i>

584
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,148
Lastly, please say a word to your fans.

585
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,944
I believe that persistence
is my only strength.

586
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,196
<i>…that Hong Si-jun made it real big.</i>

587
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,450
Thank you very much
for your love and support.

588
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:29,412
<i>It's rare for the soundtrack</i>
<i>to garner more fame than the movie.</i>

589
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,622
- I'm Hong Si-jun.
- Thank you.

590
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,500
<i>But Si-jun managed to achieve just that.</i>

591
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:36,919
Shall we go now?

592
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,302
Goodbye.

593
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,638
Man, what an eyesore.

594
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,391
Is this your idea of a successful
but anonymous songwriter?

595
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,727
You're what they call an attention seeker.

596
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,644
Why are you here?

597
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,188
Are you really not coming later?

598
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,024
We're gonna grill a ton of meat,
and you have to handle the grilling.

599
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,693
Not a chance, you crazy bastard.

600
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,779
Why not? Because of Ju-a?

601
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,823
Do you want me to put up a partition
between you two?

602
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,367
Shut up. I can't go because I have plans.

603
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:12,330
You two make me uncomfortable.
Can't you just get back together?

604
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,749
Whoa, my hands are slippery.

605
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,876
I have to go.
Lock the door when you leave.

606
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,220
Hey, Sonju.

607
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,515
Hey, I can't be there today.
I have to meet a deadline.

608
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,642
What? Why can't you come?

609
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,312
Wait. Are you still writing scripts?

610
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,356
Does anyone want it?

611
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:41,192
Get lost. This time,
I'm doubling down on my writing.

612
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,654
Hey, are you perhaps
avoiding your ex as well?

613
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,073
What do you mean?
I really have a deadline to meet.

614
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,450
Can I invite Hongsi over, then?

615
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,703
Just be impartial
and don't invite either of us, okay?

616
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:55,623
Hey, he wouldn't come anyway.
He's a busy bee.

617
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,085
What's it like to see your ex make it big?
Do you feel bitter?

618
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,004
Yes, I feel bitter as hell. Bye now.

619
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:13,140
<i>Ju-a was green with envy</i>
<i>because the music overshadowed her story.</i>

620
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,810
<i>Life can be so amusing.</i>

621
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:24,235
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

622
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,613
<i>And I've got someone</i>
<i>bothering me at home now.</i>

623
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:28,614
Gyeom!

624
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,830
What took you so long?
We have so much to prepare.

625
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:36,831
Here, take this.

626
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:43,004
<i>Not a roommate.</i>
<i>He's more like a homestay student.</i>

627
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:46,382
<i>I let him move in</i>
<i>because I had a room to spare,</i>

628
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:48,968
<i>but now I regret it.</i>

629
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,346
Hey, you've done all the work.

630
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,434
Gyeom, do you know how hard it was
to do this all by myself?

631
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,769
Hey, we're here.

632
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,230
Did the interview go well?

633
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:02,648
Yes, of course.

634
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,359
Ma'am, I think I'll get the job.

635
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:08,362
You study at night.
Why make it tougher on yourself?

636
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:11,032
I know. I'm just that diligent a guy.

637
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,242
Did Mubee push you?

638
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,702
- No, I--
- Yes.

639
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,662
No.

640
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:18,164
Yes!

641
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,042
When did I ever do that?

642
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:23,794
It's your life. Do what you want with it.

643
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,465
I got the meat that came in today.

644
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:31,427
If you are looking for someone
to take over your butcher shop,

645
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,220
what about me?

646
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,348
- Get a job already.
- Yes.

647
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:38,726
<i>And one important thing.</i>

648
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,103
May I have your attention, please?

649
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,814
Everyone, please welcome Mr. Investor.

650
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,526
<i>Mubee's movie miraculously got made</i>

651

652
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,198
It's so wonderful to see you.

653
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:53,950
What's with him?

654
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:57,036
I'm here today to celebrate
Director Kim's success…

655
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,330
<i>He suddenly announced</i>
<i>that he was a producer</i>

656
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:02,541
<i>who supports the dreams</i>
<i>of young directors. Whatever.</i>

657
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:06,879
<i>Anyway, he's starting anew in his own way.</i>

658
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,840
Now, let me share a word
of congratulations.

659
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:13,135
- Sir, you're good at grilling meat.
- I am?

660
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,553
- Jeong-hu, follow me.
- Okay.

661
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,889
- We have to wash the lettuce.
- Lettuce, it is.

662
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,351
Mr. Ma, here you go.

663
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:26,023
- The woman of the hour!
- Thank you.

664
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,108
You're welcome.

665
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:29,860
Cheers.

666
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,779
Thank you. Congratulations.

667
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,076
- It's so good.
- Right?

668
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:40,997
It's good.

669
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:42,832
The meat is great.

670
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:45,960
So good.

I knew I had an eye for talent.

674
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:30,838
Hello?

675
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,267
DIRECTOR KIM MUBEE

676
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:53,360
<i>Ko Gyeom doesn't watch movies these days.</i>

677
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:58,866
<i>But he sometimes follows me around the set</i>
<i>and bothers me like he is now.</i>

678
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:04,413
<i>According to him, Kim Mubee</i>
<i>is the only movie in his life now.</i>

679
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,255
What are you doing?

680
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,342
Hey, this is my storyboard.

681
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:19,386
Mubee, when the female lead cries,

682
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,889
you should do a wide shot
instead of a close-up--

683
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:24,642
Hey, I told you
not to mess with my projects.

684
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:26,977
I mean, your previous work was excellent,

685
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,980
but emotionally,
you should try a more subtle approach--

686
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,565
- Do you have a death wish?
- What?

687
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,692
What are you, a movie critic?

688
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:40,199
<i>Whenever I'm with Gyeom,</i>
<i>we still switch between genres.</i>

689
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,742
<i>At times, it's a tearjerker.</i>

690
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:44,620
<i>At other times,</i>
<i>a heartwarming family movie.</i>

691
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:48,207
<i>And the rest,</i>
