1
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,014
I'm off to school.

2
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,692
I was 19.

3
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,404
Even then, when my heart
was more fickle than ever,

4
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,699
I was hopelessly devoted to my first love.

5
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,205
To me, there were two types of people.

6
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,377
Hong Si-jun,

7
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,380
and then there was everybody else.

8
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,298
Hongsi!

9
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,767
Just like the first time
I tasted soda as a kid,

10
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,103
I saw bursts of starlight
when I looked at him.

11
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,737
I'm good.
We can't use this tiny thing together.

12
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,489
The rain will make you go bald.

13
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,990
Which would be absolutely cool.

14
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,327
True artists have either
no hair or long hair.

15
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:18,995
Here.

16
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,334
That was what Hong Si-jun was to me.

17
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,963
To someone who only listened
to the Top 100 songs…

18
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,633
Do you have the live album?

19
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,135
Oh, this one?
This isn't an official release.

20
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,137
You always tell me to wait.

21
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,684
…Si-jun's taste in music sparkled
like scattered jewels.

22
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,062
Does it hurt a lot?

23
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,980
How can anyone do this to their own son?

24
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,943
At least I'm out of there for good.
I feel great right now.

25
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,028
Now I can do music all I want.

26
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,324
To someone who never had a dream…

27
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,744
The world is tough.
Living alone isn't easy.

28
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,121
I have you, don't I?

29
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,211
All right. I'll keep you safe.

30
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,258
…he offered the chance to love a dreamer.

31
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,175
Pass.

32
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,302
Goal!

33
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,937
It's a bit late,
but do you want to join me?

34
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,443
Our hearts overflowed with happiness.

35
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,618
Should I try doing something like you?

36
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,289
I'm kinda anxious
that my life is going nowhere.

37
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,499
There must be something I like doing.

38
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,213
What food did you bring today? I'm hungry.

39
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,552
And I always managed to sweep
that sliver of anxiety under the rug.

40
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,430
Ta-da. Stir-fried squid, your favorite.

41
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,514
Sounds good, huh?

42
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,731
GLORIOUS SCREENWRITING CONTEST

43
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,541
So? Do I look presentable?

44
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,920
Why? Are you nervous?

45
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,424
Why would my dear Si-jun be so nervous?

46
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,343
It's the first time I'm meeting them.

47
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,595
Just go and be yourself.

48
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,680
Your music will convince them.

49
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,307
Good luck.

50
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,107
I can't do this. Ju-a.

51
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,027
Can you come with me?

52
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,945
What?

53
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,782
I would love to,

54
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,618
but you know I can't.

55
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,953
Please.

56
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,538
I won't be able to say anything
without you.

57
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,167
But I have to finish the script today.

58
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,681
All right. I'll go with you.
Let me just grab my bag.

59
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,475
Thank you.

60
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:32,355
And after many years, I finally realized

61
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,857
that even in this tiny room,

62
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,570
there was Hong Si-jun,
and then there was everybody else.

63
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,116
There.

64
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,453
He will probably always be
the greatest love of my life.

65
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,789
Here. Okay.

66
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,209
Si-jun.

67
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:54,877
Yes?

68
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,714
Should we break up?

69
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,967
But the thought of leaving him was…

70
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,011
What did you say?

71
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,889
I think

72
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,058
we should break up.

73
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,117
It was a feeling
I could never put into words.

74
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,582
How did I fall in love with Son Ju-a?

75
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,424
I've been watching you for a while,

76
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,094
but don't you have friends
other than that weirdo, Ko Gyeom?

77
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,638
You're good at your studies,
you make music,

78
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,725
and you're good-looking,
so why aren't you popular?

79
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,478
-I am at the beginning of the year.
-And?

80
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,855
As soon as I speak,
they all find out I'm a jerk.

81
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,690
You're casting a shadow. Move.

82
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:03,988
What are you doing?

83
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,865
You're wrong.

84
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,784
Move aside. What's your problem?

85
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,829
From now on, you should only believe those
who look into your eyes when they speak.

86
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,211
Why did I fall in love
with someone so bright…

87
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,755
I think you're really cool.

88
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,426
…and have her turn my life upside down?

89
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,016
I haven't written a sentence
for three hours.

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,851
You mean five hours.

91
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,436
Whatever. I'm sleepy.

92
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,606
I don't have what it takes to be a writer.

93
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,486
Where in the world do you find
this thing called inspiration?

94
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,408
You're so lucky, Hongsi.
You have so many songs inside your head.

95
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,493
I'm jealous.

96
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:56,040
I found it super powerful to have someone
trust and love me wholeheartedly.

97
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,278
It made me want to become
an even cooler person

98
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,490
so I could keep those bright eyes
set only on me.

99
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,626
Sorry. They must've decided
to go with another song.

100
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,336
Let's work together next time.

101
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,008
You're here early.

102
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,971
My laptop is so heavy.

103
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,725
It's not like carrying this around
will help me write anything.

104
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,643
My arm hurts.

105
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,645
Creative work is never easy.

106
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,941
But you're holding out pretty well.
I'm proud of you, Sonju.

107
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,738
Don't you dare leave me
when you make it big.

108
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,948
You better provide for me.

109
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,160
Of course I will.

110
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,330
Who else would provide for you but me?

111
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,292
That's right.

112
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,503
Goodness.

113
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,675
JINGLE GIGS

114
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,593
Wow.

115
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,969
THINK BIGGER, FUN MATH WORKBOOK

116
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,513
Did you stay up all night?

117
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,681
You even do gigs like this?

118
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,017
-Move. What are you doing?
-What the hell?

119
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,770
God, stop touching my stuff and go away.

120
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,355
Hey, aren't these jingles?

121
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:46,400
You said you're not in this for the money,
and you're making jingles now?

122
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,403
-What about it? I need lots of money.
-For what?

123
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,075
You've made in-game purchases, right?
No wonder you got so strong so quickly.

124
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,077
Shut it, okay?

125
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,288
I need to provide for Ju-a
like the responsible man I am.

126
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,957
Hey, what about me?

127
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,584
Provide for me, too,
like a responsible man.

128
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,919
Get lost!

129
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,214
You're being funny.
What's with you all of a sudden?

130
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,466
Are you gonna marry her or something?

131
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,384
Yeah, duh.

132
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,761
Really? When?

133
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,431
I could even marry her tomorrow.

134
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,267
Hello.

135
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,686
What's a good laptop for writers?

136
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,021
Is this light?
What's its storage capacity?

137
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,023
Does this type okay?

138
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,442
It's a good laptop.
Would you like to try it out?

139
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,737
I'll come back with my girlfriend.

140
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,116
It's a present,
so I want to give her what she likes.

141
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,660
It's our seventh anniversary.

142
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,830
She's a writer.
She writes scripts for movies.

143
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,332
Cool, huh?

144
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,460
But then…

145
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,867
with the same eyes and lips
she once used to tell me I was the best,

146
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,869
she spoke of breaking up.

147
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,623
I doubt there's anything
crueler than that.

148
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,231
Did it seem pathetic that I failed
to make it despite all that big talk?

149
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,488
Had she grown tired of my music
that she once said she loved?

150
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,033
Did she not see a future in me?

151
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,675
Did I…

152
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,470
truly become a hopeless case?

153
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:47,623
But by the time the memories faded
and pain became a familiar friend…

154
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,041
I wrote about us.

155
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,292
You wrote what?

156
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,879
As you said, I got desperate
and used anything I could as inspiration,

157
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,464
so I wrote about us.

158
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:01,762
I want to make it into a movie,
but I need you.

159
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:07,476
…she showed up again
with some ridiculous excuse.

160
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,277
What are you doing?

161
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,320
And I began to wonder.

162
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,283
Isn't this what guys usually want
from their ex-girlfriends?

163
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,161
"Should I break her heart?"

164
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,209
"Or make her confess why she came back?"

165
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,712
That was so idiotic of me.

166
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,757
That was my way of liking you.

167
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,927
I just wanted to do everything your way.

168
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,680
Back then, I loved you so much

169
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,475
that I did pathetic things
I didn't have to.

170
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,269
But the funny thing is…

171
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,147
There's nothing left, is there?

172
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,859
Do you want me to say yes or no?

173
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,198
…I found myself hoping
there was still a chance for us.

174
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,430
It was a feeling
I couldn't put into words.

175
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,062
Ju-a.

176
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,647
Yes?

177
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,732
Are we over? Or are we…

178
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,737
on our way back to each other?

179
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,161
When it's hard to tell,
there's only one way.

180
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,666
It looks like we need to talk.

181
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,750
Son Ju-a.

182
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,755
I missed you so much at times.

183
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:05,261
I'd think, "I should get back at her,"
or "I should just go and hug her."

184
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,265
I thought of you so much, I didn't expect
anything to catch me by surprise anymore.

185
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,518
But I…

186
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,150
still get pretty swayed when I see you.

187
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,569
Si-jun.

188
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,279
I thought about hiding it,

189
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,906
but seeing you smile at me again

190
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,325
makes me want to give it one last shot.

191
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,836
Go on three dates with me.

192
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,924
Let's go on a date, Ju-a.

193
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:06,113
WE WERE LIKE STRANGERS
WHO KNEW EACH OTHER VERY WELL

194
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,198
You're awake, right?

195
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,834
You definitely are.

196
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,465
Yes, I'm awake!

197
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,263
Oh, I should get up.

198
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,057
Come on.

199
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,308
Easy there.

200
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,395
We shouldn't be doing
that kind of thing in bed.

201
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,357
When did you even come in here?

202
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,570
What if we're not in bed?

203
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,256
I didn't tell you to move in, did I?

204
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,057
Should I… just stay here for good?

205
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,517
What?

206
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,192
Weird.

207
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,611
It's making my heart flutter.

208
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:56,575
Does she even know
what she's talking about?

209
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,169
-Will you be working late today?
-Not sure.

210
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,215
The producer insisted on coming
to the office, so it'll take a while.

211
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,842
God, why does she always bother you
on your day off?

212
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,679
Happy house-sitting while I'm gone.

213
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,847
Okay.

214
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,685
What you said earlier,

215
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,021
what did you mean by that?

216
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,106
What?

217
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,858
What did you mean
about staying here for good?

218
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,402
I meant exactly that.

219
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,238
-Really?
-Yeah.

220
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,825
As long as Mom doesn't catch me, why not?

221
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,647
Don't worry. She really likes me.

222
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,524
I think she'll hate you from now on.

223
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,235
Bye now. Don't wait up for me.

224
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,238
I might not get to come back here tonight.

225
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,782
Okay. Have a great day.

226
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,588
Is this too casual?
Maybe I should have worn a skirt instead.

227
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,421
Hi.

228
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,055
Let's go.

229
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,808
Hey, why would you hold my…

230
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,601
You can let go.

231
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,854
I'm hungry. Let's eat first.

232
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,939
Yeah.

233
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,639
I don't know where to begin.

234
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,810
First, our budget was quite small, right?

235
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:55,314
The thing is, the investor asked us
to cut down on it a bit more,

236
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,817
and I said that we wouldn't be able
to proceed with the production.

237
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,571
So, in conclusion,

238
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,073
they told me they would pull out.

239
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,184
Jesus Christ! What are you doing here?

240
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,686
Are you throwing these out?

241
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,857
Yeah.

242
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,944
But this one looks perfectly fine.
And it was Jun's favorite chair.

243
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,447
Why are you even here?

244
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,199
That's mean, especially since
we haven't seen each other in a while.

245
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,208
I'm glad you're here.

246
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,130
I have a lot to throw out,
so give me a hand.

247
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,008
Why the sudden cleaning?

248
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,051
No reason.

249
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,847
It's about time I cleaned the house
and got rid of some things.

250
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,435
What? Why?

251
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,145
Nothing.

252
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,648
You couldn't even get rid of an old box
you found, and you returned it to me.

253
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,152
You can't get rid of
your old comic books and VHS tapes,

254
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,405
so it's surprising
to see you throwing things out.

255
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,826
I had to get rid of them at some point.

256
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:56,912
Gyeom.

257
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,248
You can take your time.

258
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,587
You don't have to move on so quickly.

259
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,006
What do you mean?

260
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,674
Back when I was in the US,

261
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,844
I always wrote a will
before big surgeries.

262
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,931
I ended up writing five wills in total,

263
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:20,602
but the process gradually got less sad
as I got used to writing them.

264
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,023
But I came to realize
that my mom had been receiving

265
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,193
all five of those wills
while I was growing numb to them.

266
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,364
Question.

267
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,451
Who does death break down?

268
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,544
Those who are left behind.

269
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:52,676
So you can mourn as much as you want
and take your time getting over it.

270
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,094
Don't force it.

271
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,228
Okay.

272
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,814
Thanks.

273
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,452
We're not that close yet.

274
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,539
Wait. What do you mean,
"We're not that close"?

275
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,584
Gyeom, this is your one and only chance.

276
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,919
It'll feel really snug. I work out a lot.

277
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,255
Come on, let me give you a hug!

278
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,090
Thank you.

279
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,240
Have you ever thought

280
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:03,163
that people might be quite disappointed
once they find out you're not a big deal?

281
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,957
Why? Do you think that while you write?

282
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:06,875
Yeah.

283
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,211
I'm always anxious
that my lack of potential will be exposed.

284
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,340
I feel the same.

285
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,383
You? No way.

286
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,302
You're a natural talent.

287
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,929
I'm no longer naive enough
to believe that.

288
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,391
So I feel anxious and scared.

289
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:31,650
Now that I'm in a similar line of work
as you, I guess I understand

290
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,860
how tough it must've been for you.

291
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,746
I didn't intend
to talk about these things.

292
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,921
I said I missed you at times.
Do you have anything to say to that?

293
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,339
What?

294
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,592
Don't just be here.
Try to be more attentive, will you?

295
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,930
You told me not to feel pressured.

296
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,317
I did, but it feels kind of unfair
that you look so relaxed now.

297
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,072
It's okay to feel a bit of pressure.

298
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,466
Want to listen to this?

299
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,802
What is it?

300
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,389
I like the guitarist on this track.

301
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,890
Do you like this album?

302
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,102
The guitarist has an interesting style.

303
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,074
It was pretty cool at the end.

304
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,744
It's supposed to be presentable…

305
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,120
What's this?

306
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,288
It was on the ground.

307
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,707
This is a first from you.

308
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,461
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

309
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:26,890
Is it good?

310
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,308
Yes, it's still warm.

311
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,790
PRODUCER HA HYEON-SIL

312
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,418
I guess you're coming home
to this house today.

313
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,920
Right. Mom.

314
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,841
Try to be more diligent
if you're going to deceive me.

315
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,177
No mom would turn a blind eye
to what I saw today.

316
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,512
Sorry.

317
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,224
You know how much
Gyeom has been through lately.

318
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,938
Why are you the one with the long face?
Is something wrong?

319
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,691
No.

320
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,452
So? Are you going to keep living
at the office for a while?

321
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,538
I won't have to go for a while.

322
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,081
Which office are you talking about?

323
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,209
The house opposite ours
or your actual office?

324
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,383
The project got canceled.
The investor is pulling out.

325
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,552
And?

326
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,805
Well, it can't be helped.

327
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,308
That's it? You're letting it go?

328
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,103
Yes.

329
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,273
Don't worry.

330
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:44,027
I won't do anything foolish like Dad
and get into debt just to make a movie.

331
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,944
What?

332
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,822
I don't have to make a fuss
to keep this project alive.

333
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,576
I'll just take some time off
and pick up another movie.

334
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,662
You're mean.

335
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,749
What use is being smart?

336
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,543
If that's your attitude,
you should've quit a long time ago.

337
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,213
A lot of people just wasted their time
because of you.

338
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,131
Mom.

339
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,884
Did Dad seem foolish to you?
That's no way to talk.

340
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,846
-Don't you know how proud he was of you?
-Am I wrong?

341
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:16,059
He put his family aside his whole life
because he was busy chasing dreams.

342
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,393
Isn't that foolish?

343
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:18,853
What?

344
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,980
Have you ever taken a day off?

345
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:25,276
When you were working yourself like this,
what was Dad doing?

346
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,696
He practically lived on set
to get paid some paltry sum,

347
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,283
which he used up to make movies,
but he couldn't even do that properly.

348
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,789
You might've been okay with that.

349
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,749
But what about me?

350
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,879
I had to spend my whole life
waiting for Dad to pay attention to me.

351
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,381
Didn't you feel sorry for me?

352
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,716
Did you ever take pity on me

353
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,469
for having no choice but to hate him
to get his attention?

354
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,141
Do you still hate him that much?

355
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,692
Dad never cared about me.

356
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:10,321
He'd show up and spend time with me
like I was homework he was behind on.

357
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,490
I wasn't stupid enough to not see that.

358
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,408
Mubee.

359
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,618
I hate that name. It's so…

360
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,455
It's so pathetic.

361
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,645
MUBEE

362
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,605
Is she busy?

363
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,820
You don't want to go home, do you?

364
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,155
Yeah, I do.

365
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,907
I cleaned the house
and threw out everything I needed to.

366
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:59,537
I didn't know you could throw stuff out.
You usually hoard everything.

367
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,123
You're right.

368
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:06,794
Turns out I have a mountain of stuff,
while Jun only had…

369
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,131
He had less than a backpacker would.

370
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,396
What's this?

371
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,065
Jun's bottle.

372
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,400
He'd come by from time to time.

373
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,361
He came to drink here? And you served him?

374
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:36,032
Just one drink at a time.
I'm sure he needed a drink at times.

375
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:39,368
Hey, why are you telling me this now?
Why didn't you tell me?

376
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,371
Good grief. Stop that, okay?

377
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,957
You don't need to know everything he did.

378
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,006
Well, I don't know anything.

379
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,260
I really know nothing about him.

380
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,473
I have no idea
what Ko Jun's life was like.

381
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,979
Why didn't he have anything
to leave behind?

382
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,444
Hey.

383
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,031
Ko Jun's life belongs to Ko Jun.

384
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,535
No one gets to have a say in his life,
not even you.

385
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,452
What?

386
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,288
He chose to live the life he did.

387
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,291
So you live your life to the fullest.

388
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,842
Such a know-it-all.

389
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,887
I may not be able to cry with you.

390
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,686
But I can talk some sense into you
when you're being foolish.

391
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,481
Damn you.

392
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,782
Hey, worry about your own life.
Are you gonna keep that up with Ju-a?

393
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,744
What?

394
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,330
How do you know about that?

395
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,792
What would I know? I don't know anything.

396
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,502
But I guess something is going on.

397
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,756
Just go, okay? The bar's closing.

398
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,592
Hey, do you want me to

399
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,553
give you some advice?

400
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,265
Like what?

401
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,062
Si-jun.

402
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,069
It's your life, not mine.
Don't ask me for advice.

403
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,654
Get lost, you punk.

404
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,369
That crazy bastard.

405
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,472
FOUR-LEAF CLOVER
KIM HUN-DONG

406
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,783
Put that away!

407
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,871
He's right. You can do that
after you finish your meal.

408
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,290
It's still…

409
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,874
Try this, Ji-u.

410
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,626
…as boring as ever.

411
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,212
-What's this?
-It's delicious. Try it.

412
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,410
Where has she gone this early?

413
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,790
So you're saying you just came to see me?

414
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,417
Yes.

415
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,964
But were we ever close enough
to meet this early in the day?

416
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,633
We used to pull all-nighters
for days on end.

417
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,385
What are you talking about?

418
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,220
I guess you're right.

419
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:13,100
So why are you here?
Are you here to talk behind Gyeom's back?

420
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,853
Does Gyeom talk behind my back?

421
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:16,979
Nope.

422
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,735
You must have a question about directing.

423
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,905
I knew I was your mentor,
not Director Chu.

424
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,740
So what do you want to know?

425
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,826
I just came as a comrade.

426
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,912
What kind of comrade?

427
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,081
I know your project got canceled.

428
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,666
Are you here to tease me too?

429
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,752
Mine did too.

430
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,046
What?

431
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:46,050
I notified the staff this morning.
It felt awkward to go to the office.

432
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,219
I had nowhere else to go.

433
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,765
So I was wondering
what you did to pass the time.

434
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:57,228
So… the production company wanted
to call it off due to lack of investment,

435
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,230
and you just said okay?

436
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,731
Yes.

437
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,035
What is it that you want me to tell you?
That you made the right choice?

438
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,954
You made the same choice, didn't you?

439
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:18,124
Sure. They said they had no money,
so I just scrapped it.

440
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,709
Exactly. That's what I did too.

441
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,503
It was the right thing to do.

442
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,255
But are we really the same?

443
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,716
I directed 12 feature films

444
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,469
and five short films
if I included all my screenplays.

445
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,181
But you, on the other hand,
only released one feature.

446
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:39,186
I understand it must be worse for you
to have your project get canceled, but--

447
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,355
No, it's quite the opposite.

448
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,108
Director Kim, they would say to me,

449
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,445
"Oh no. I'm sorry, Director Ma.
We have no money to make the movie."

450
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,615
Then I'd just say, "Screw this,"
and wait for the next opportunity.

451
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,162
I don't mind sharing my story a bit later.
It's not a big deal.

452
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,914
But it's different for you young people.

453
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,836
If you don't tell your stories now,
they are going to fade away.

454
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,882
Some stories need to be told
at that very moment.

455
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,677
And you're dying
to put your story out there, aren't you?

456
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,763
So stop wasting time on your thoughts.

457
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,809
Go to the production company to protest
or find an investor yourself, okay?

458
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,145
Do whatever it takes to make it happen.

459
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,940
I'm not sure
I need to put that much effort into it.

460
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,401
I'm not exactly saving lives here either.

461
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,111
Who told you to save lives?

462
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:33,324
I'm telling you to make a movie!
That's what you want to do, isn't it?

463
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,494
This is odd.

464
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,663
I've seen tons of people
forced to give up on this work,

465
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,416
but not one person
sticking around against their will.

466
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,837
It's time for you to decide.

467
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,464
Kim Mubee.

468
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,009
I don't know
how you ended up in this industry,

469
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,428
but nevertheless,

470
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,515
it was all your choice.

471
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,695
Why isn't he picking up?

472
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,115
Where are you going?

473
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,619
Why weren't you answering my calls?

474
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,080
It was on silent.

475
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,541
Have you heard about our movie?

476
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,543
Yes, I heard.

477
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,462
I'm confused as to
how this happened so suddenly,

478
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,091
but it's not official yet,
so there must be a way to overturn this.

479
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,592
Is that why you are here?

480
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:36,679
Are you okay?

481
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,932
Yeah, well…

482
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,060
I'm more used to things not working out.

483
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,772
Things were too good to be true.

484
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,276
We'll talk to the production company.
All we need is an investor.

485
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,612
Or we can go with crowdfunding.
We don't need a large budget to--

486
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,530
Sure.

487
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:00,995
That aside…

488
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,831
how about we go now?

489
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,083
On our second date.

490
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,501
What?

491
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,838
I just don't want to think
about anything else right now.

492
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:20,973
Good grief.

493
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,892
I know you have no work,
but you're calling me way too often.

494
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,313
I'll fill you in on the details in person.
Where are you now?

495
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,481
I'm overseas. Hawaii.

496
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,150
Wow, it's a kangaroo.

497
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,193
A kangaroo in Hawaii, my foot.

498
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,529
Stop your nonsense.

499
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,365
Grab a drink with me
and Director Kim later, got it?

500
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,201
Come and comfort
the poor souls in distress.

501
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:45,706
Why do you say "poor souls"?
I'm sure you're the only one in distress.

502
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:50,461
Haven't you heard?
Kim told me her project got canceled.

503
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:58,218
I need to go.
And stop drinking so much, for God's sake.

504
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,554
DIRECTOR MA SEONG-U

505
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,389
MUBEE

506
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,108
Your call cannot be…

507
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,742
Maybe she needs some time to think alone.

508
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,081
Goodness, are you throwing this away?

509
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,874
It looks perfectly fine.

510
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,126
May I take it?

511
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,173
No, I'm not throwing it out.

512
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,860
Si-jun.

513
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,030
Yes?

514
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,199
Let's go to your studio
since we're nearby.

515
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,328
I have to listen to your music again.

516
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,249
Hearing your music convinced me
our movie was gonna do well.

517
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,042
Let's go.

518
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,312
Not this one.

519
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,399
The first song you made.
Can you play that?

520
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,094
You said you wanted a male voice.

521
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,111
I love this song.

522
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,865
I really hoped
it would feature in our movie.

523
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,660
But it's an awesome song,
so it'll do well wherever it's featured.

524
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,829
Why don't you just release it?

525
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,499
It's Ms. Kim's fault
for missing out on this masterpiece.

526
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,794
Never mind.
We'll find a way to get this movie going.

527
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,050
Can we talk about something else?

528
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,803
Don't tell me you're shaken
over this setback.

529
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,555
Don't worry. I'll make sure--

530
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,807
There's no need.

531
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,563
I'm going to quit now.

532
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,943
What? Quit what?

533
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,238
Music.

534
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,533
What?

535
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,535
I've held out for long enough.

536
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,454
I'm too ashamed to pretend
that I have what it takes.

537
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,624
And above all…

538
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,090
I'm tired now.

539
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,678
You can't quit.

540
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,974
Why not?

541
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,270
-Am I not even allowed to give up?
-No, you're not.

542
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,938
Someone as talented as you--

543
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,439
Stop that already!

544
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:45,654
You treating me like this
is why I can't stop being a goddamn idiot.

545
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,700
Stop going on about me being talented.
I don't want to hear it.

546
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,579
Why do you keep getting my hopes up
and making me forget my place?

547
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,998
Why do you keep butting in on my business?

548
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,188
Damn it.

549
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,876
MELODY

550
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,637
Some stories need to be told
at that very moment.

551
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,682
And you're dying
to put your story out there, aren't you?

552
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:40,811
Dad.

553
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,356
Why do you want to make a movie so badly?

554
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:49,403
Well, because
there's a story I want to tell.

555
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,155
What kind of story?

556
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,231
Oh, right.

557
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,275
I don't have a lighter.

558
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,489
I guess you can't help me out now.

559
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,675
I went around the entire neighborhood
looking for you.

560
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:37,761
Really?

561
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,679
No, I found you right away.

562
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,932
Why were you looking for me?

563
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,059
Come to think of it,

564
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,978
you did say that you'd ask for help
if you needed it.

565
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,857
I'd need to be near you
to hear you ask for help.

566
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,486
You did say

567
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,448
that you'd ask for help if you needed it.

568
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:02,160
I'd need to be near you
to hear you ask for help.

569
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:18,927
Come here.

570
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,076
Shall we go?

571
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,620
Give me that.

572
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,359
For God's sake.

573
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:29,873
Son Ju-a!

574
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,960
You big jerk!

575
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,421
You're still so self-obsessed.

576
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:40,091
Do you think I'm a joke for humoring you
and supporting you all along?

577
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,719
I butted in on your business?

578
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:46,223
Don't I have the right after all the shit
I went through for seven years?

579
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,307
I didn't ask you to.

580
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,977
It was suffocating
to see you pinning your hopes on me.

581
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,064
You'd get excited over some lousy song.
That drove me nuts!

582
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,816
You made it impossible for me to give up.

583
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,527
How dare you talk about my love that way!

584
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,741
It was suffocating? Was it so wrong of me
to want the best for you?

585
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,993
I don't even care what happens now,

586
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,829
but you always treat me
like a poor guy who needs saving.

587
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,791
All I wanted was to go on a date with you,

588
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,794
but you keep making me feel
like a hopeless case.

589
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,840
Good. This is more like the Si-jun I know.

590
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,385
You always blame me.

591
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:27,055
Was it my fault that we broke up
and your career didn't take off?

592
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,849
Then why else did we break up?
You left me!

593
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,309
Because you're selfish.

594
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:35,438
You're so selfish that you don't deserve
to have someone by your side.

595
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,359
You don't care
about my thoughts or feelings.

596
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,528
You only care about your hardships.

597
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,781
You ignore me when I'm right next to you!

598
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:49,536
All I ever wanted was to be with you.

599
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,955
Was that too much to ask for?

600
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,873
Was that so selfish of me?

601
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:57,043
You're the one who left me
and came back on a whim!

602
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,757
Why did you have to come back
and make me hopeful again?

603
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,972
You were the one who complicated things
by saying you were swayed.

604
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,100
You don't want the person I am now.

605
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:15,020
You're still looking for the Son Ju-a
you knew back then.

606
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,742
Because I'm still trapped
in that day you left me.

607
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,082
Everything I want is in the past,

608
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,336
so who cares about the future?

609
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:56,353
Maybe knowing each other so well
is actually quite unfortunate.

610
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,941
Such relationships can share
the greatest love,

611
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,861
but they can also be so much more hurtful.

612
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,580
And…

613
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:30,053
you can't help but realize
that the end is drawing closer.

614
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:03,628
I can never seem to figure Ko Gyeom out.

615
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:08,049
Shouldn't you be concerned for me
that my movie got canceled?

616
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,387
I don't know.
I'm pretty sure Kim Mubee will be fine.

617
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:13,805
How so?

618
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,015
Because you'll do it anyway.

619
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,017
Is that what you think?

620
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,272
You said you wanted to make
"an awesome melo movie."

621
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:36,494
But why did it have to be a melo?

622
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,542
I just

623
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,129
wanted to tell the sweetest story.

624
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,008
A story about people loving each other.

625
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,061
All I wanted

626
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,565
was just to be loved.

627
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,281
And I could feel that…

628
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,160
If I share my secret with you,
will you still like me?

629
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,746
And not leave me?

630
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,796
…I wanted to share everything with him.

631
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,771
I think I'm the reason my dad died.

632
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:07,585
MELO MOVIE

633
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:18,471
Gyeom, what's your secret?

634
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:23,726
My secret?

635
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,148
Well…

636
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:40,196
