1
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,952
My dad would sometimes say…

2
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:42,459
that I was too softhearted
because I took after him…

3
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,085
I'm going to keep it.

4
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,838
I said no. Put it back where you found it.

5
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,506
No, I'm going to keep it.

6
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,925
Mom and Dad are busy.
Who will take care of it?

7
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,678
I will do everything!

8
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,263
And how will you do that?

9
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,890
Nobody will be helping you.

10
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,517
Come on, Mom. Please!

11
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,435
No.

12
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,103
Please, Mom!

13
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,940
-Take it back!
-…and that I became attached too easily.

14
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,819
Hey.

15
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,238
Are you…

16
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,618
going home like that again?

17
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,790
This won't do. Hop on the back.

18
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,005
From now on,
tell everyone you're my little brother.

19
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,552
Where are the kids
who've been bullying you?

20
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,680
Hold on tight.

21
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,186
Especially to pitiful little things.

22
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,729
You know,

23
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,732
those things go away easily,

24
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,110
so you may end up feeling hurt.

25
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,403
But I take after Mom.

26
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,405
Right.

27
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,368
You are brave, just like Mom,

28
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,994
so I'm sure you'll bounce back.

29
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,706
Goodness, you've grown so much.

30
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,085
I should buy you a bigger bicycle.

31
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,087
How about a pretty red one?

32
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,674
Enjoy your ice cream.

33
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,928
Perhaps Dad already knew what was to come.

34
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,556
KONG

35
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,493
PROPERTY FOR SALE

36
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:58,720
Hey there,

37
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,599
lady who pretends to be mean
but is actually kind as hell.

38
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,563
-I was practicing my line.
-That's not your line.

39
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,815
You've memorized my lines again.

40
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,984
Your interest in me is overwhelming.

41
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,156
But this one isn't little…

42
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,660
Giddyap, horsey

43
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:27,081
Giddyap, horsey

44
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,208
Giddyap…

45
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,876
…nor is it pitiful at all.

46
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,714
-Have a safe trip home, sir!
-Take care!

47
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,634
-Good work, sir!
-Bye, Director Ma!

48
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,385
-Good night!
-See you again!

49
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,970
Hit the road!

50
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,472
Next round!

51
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,890
-Let's go!
-Next round!

52
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,892
-You've done well. Bye!
-Good job, guys.

53
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,477
Round three!

54
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,401
He's just the weirdest person
you'll ever meet.

55
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,363
Hey, one second.

56
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,532
As you can see,
I've had too much to drink today.

57
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,826
Yes, so go home already.

58
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,787
-No, wait.
-What are you…

59
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,418
Be my designated driver just this once?

60
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,136
Just leave it here
and come back for it tomorrow.

61
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,640
That'd be pretty careless
in a country of bicycle thieves.

62
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,017
It doesn't even look expensive.

63
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,354
My brother bought it for me.

64
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:52,125
Hey, aren't designated drivers
supposed to give their friends a ride?

65
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,752
Zip it, or I'll drop everything and leave.

66
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,675
Red is definitely a tacky color.

67
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,471
The thing is,

68
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,808
my brother said
red is, hands down, the best…

69
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,606
Are you and your brother close?

70
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,859
Wanna hear about him?

71
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:24,198
My brother is tall and handsome.

72
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,535
He was super popular in high school.

73
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:32,540
-Girls bombarded him with chocolates…
-I'd never get attached to him.

74
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,045
There's just no way I would.

75
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,800
Wait. Let me see that scene again.

76
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,303
Maybe my dad's prophecy,
or curse, or whatever…

77
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,848
-Hey, Seong-tae.
-Yes?

78
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,184
Is Gyeom still out of reach?

79
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,352
Yes, that's right.

80
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,854
He wanted to see the editing process…

81
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,899
…was the reason
I got left alone yet again.

82
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,709
KO GYEOM

83
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,552
At first, I was worried.

84
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,639
It's your day off. Why don't you rest?

85
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,019
Then came the anger.

86
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,898
And in the end…

87
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,066
Shitty, huh?

88
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,401
Sorry?

89
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,985
I meant your days recently.

90
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,697
No, ma'am.

91
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,624
You don't seem like the type
to be naturally quiet.

92
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,586
Your long face tells me
you're going through something.

93
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,257
I'm sorry.
I had something else on my mind.

94
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,718
You know,

95
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,681
when you're making a movie
like we are now,

96
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,933
you can do more than just forget.

97
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,938
You have the opportunity to gather
all those distracting thoughts

98
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,982
and burn them to ashes.

99
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:25,862
Work it off.

100
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:31,033
Work yourself to death,
and make your own movie later.

101
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,456
As for what you've got going on in there,

102
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,876
use it as kindling and burn it away.

103
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,963
Ma'am, we are ready.
Would you like to come and check?

104
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,133
Sure. Let's go.

105
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,930
It became clear what I needed to do.

106
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:58,519
That day, I decided to work
and just forget about him…

107
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,437
Kim Mubee!

108
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,230
Yes?

109
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:06,027
…and believe that he'd died
just like everything else.

110
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:14,577
Fortunately, his blood pressure
and vital signs have stabilized.

111
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,080
But he suffered severe brain damage
from cardiac arrest,

112
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,709
so it may take a great deal of time
for him to gain consciousness.

113
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,962
Everyone said
it was a miracle he survived.

114
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:29,008
There was a bit of confusion
as there was no CCTV in the area.

115
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,346
But the dashcam footage showed
no other cars nearby.

116
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,147
We'll have to rule it as an accident
caused by the early morning fog and rain.

117
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,109
They said it was lucky
the accident wasn't a lot worse.

118
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,779
And what was it that they said?

119
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,198
If we see no improvements
in the next two weeks,

120
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,534
I recommend you prepare for the worst.

121
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,411
"Prepare for the worst."

122
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,249
So you really do say that.

123
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,406
Why are you here again?

124
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,907
To give Jun a break.

125
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,493
He's super annoyed
with you never leaving his side.

126
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,415
As it turned out,
all those words were nonsense.

127
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,834
If that's true,
try kicking me out yourself.

128
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,671
Because my brother
would never let me go through

129
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,590
this "prepare for the worst" stuff.

130
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,008
Okay, now.

131
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,469
Recovering enough to lead a normal life?
I don't know about that.

132
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,387
Like this.

133
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,973
It'd take at least six months,
maybe even years.

134
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,188
Now lower your bottom lip.

135
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,484
His communication impairments
make it unlikely he'll fully recover.

136
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,405
Want to go pig out on pork cutlet later?

137
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,493
Hello.

138
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,329
Have…

139
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,790
you eaten?

140
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,669
Want to go…

141
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,966
pig out on

142
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,762
pork cutlet later?

143
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,181
Sounds good!

144
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,770
Above all, the patient's willpower
counts the most with rehabilitation.

145
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,357
I simply can't guarantee
how long the recovery will take.

146
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,775
Want to take a break?

147
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,240
There's underwear too.
So change it regularly.

148
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,325
Sir.

149
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,535
About this month's rent--

150
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,454
You've gotta be kidding me.

151
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,332
It's fine. Don't worry about that.

152
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,003
I'll pay you back later.

153
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,551
And you? How are you holding up?
Is it getting too much for you?

154
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,056
Nothing is too much.

155
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,726
I think I was born to be a caregiver.

156
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,940
I've been away for too long.

157
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,775
-I'll get going now.
-Sure.

158
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,027
-See you again.
-Yeah.

159
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,446
Call me if you need anything.

160
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,948
I will.

161
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,456
Hello?

162
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,292
Hello, this is Kang Ji-yun with Film 25.

163
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,837
I reached out to you via e-mail.

164
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,381
Are you free to talk
on the phone right now?

165
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,717
How much are you offering?

166
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,051
Sorry?

167
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,930
Do you mean the writing fee?

168
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,058
We cannot offer you too much, but--

169
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,643
How much per word?

Mr. Chairman,
congratulations on your discharge.

00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,151
You're at it again.

178
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,907
I took care of the Hongsi Gang.

They won't mess with us again.

00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,712
Let me escort you to the pork cutlet place
with your reservation, sir.

181
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,630
All right.

182
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,676
-Let's go, Executive Director Ko.
-Yes, sir.

183
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,181
There are moments like these in movies.

184
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,019
Hey, have you ever seen this go so fast?

185
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,399
Don't make me laugh.
Can't you see me working out?

186
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,371
Jun, are you okay?

187
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,706
-Want some water?
-Yes.

188
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,790
Okay.

189
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,709
Get up first. Oh no.

190
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,465
Here.

191
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,969
It's that kid again.

192
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,347
Hey, what are you doing over there?

193
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,516
-Get to work, will you?
-Yes, sir.

194
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,941
Jun!

195
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,987
-Jun, come here.
-Okay.

196
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,905
Oh man.

197
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,573
Sorry.

198
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,617
One, two…

199
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,454
Slowly.

200
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,084
Times like these usually fly by
as short shots in a montage sequence.

201
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,341
And this phase of my life
seemed to fly by just like that…

202
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,267
though quite some time has passed.

203
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:40,689
FIVE YEARS LATER

204
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,488
Even so, this isn't right.

205
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,075
We'll move on to the next question.

206
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:57,206
The person in one of the back rows,
second from the left.

207
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,958
Could you please stand up?

208
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,258
I enjoyed your movie, Ms. Kim.

209
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,554
To barge back into my life like this…

210
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,475
But I have one question.

211
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,646
That's just absurd, isn't it?

212
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,460
Here already?

213
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,962
Why are you in my studio?

214
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,880
Just be grateful I'm here for you.

215
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,966
I have to go back out. What's up?

216
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,014
Is something going on? Where's Jun?

217
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,932
At the rehab center.

218
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,226
By himself? That's progress.

219
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,063
Hey, what's wrong?

220
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,566
Nothing.

221
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,695
Were you at the movies?

222
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,781
I gotta go.
Turn the lights off when you leave.

223
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,962
All I wanted was to check it out.

224
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,404
"What kind of movie could she have made?"

225
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,573
-A lot happened last year.
-I was curious.

226
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,869
And the principal's health
dwindled after that.

227
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,459
DIRECTED BY KIM MUBEE

228
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,385
Did you enjoy the movie?

229
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:19,223
Allow me to invite the main cast
and the director to the stage.

230
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,850
Please welcome them
with a round of applause.

231
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,946
But…

232
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,496
I really didn't mean to do that.

233
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,350
But I have one question.

234
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,644
Is this really a melo, a romance movie?

235
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:12,943
I know that hybrid genre movies
have become more mainstream lately.

236
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,405
But the narrative leading toward
a fatalistic view of the world

237
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,574
felt rather gloomy to me.

238
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,535
If this is a movie about love,

239
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,788
why did you choose to go
with this type of narrative?

240
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,926
Yes.

241
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,016
I was asking about your reasoning.
"Yes" doesn't sound like--

242
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,226
Yes, I have my reasons.

243
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,692
I'm afraid our time is up for today,
so we'll move on to the next program.

244
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,779
Finally, let's hear from the main cast
and the director themselves.

245
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,741
Hello, I'm U-Ju,
and I play one of the main cast.

246
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,577
-Hi, I'm a huge fan!
-Hello!

247
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,204
-I'm a fan.
-You were great.

248
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,788
Drink after work?

249
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,021
Han-sol.

250
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,189
Yes?

251
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:36,443
Where can I watch
the recording of today's session?

252
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,112
I'll send you the link.

253
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,822
Okay.

254
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,800
Do you know about the origin
of Jack Daniel's?

255
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,885
Let me explain it to you.

256
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,222
It's a full house tonight. Where were you?

257
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,057
You told me to take out the trash.

258
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,726
Take orders from table two, will you?

259
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:15,816
The story of Jack Daniel's goes back
to the time when slaves from West Africa…

260
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,984
Come on in!

261
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,247
He should be cleaning the tables
as soon as the customers leave,

262
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,999
but he just sits around instead.

263
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,711
Listen.

264
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,882
I'm going to quit
if you don't hire another part-timer.

265
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,302
All right, punk. I've been looking.

266
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:48,181
But the hiring market is tough these days.
I can't seem to find anyone.

267
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,184
Find one within the month, or I'll walk.

268
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,646
Fine, do as you wish.

269
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,734
You've been singing "I'm gonna quit"
for five years, you punk.

270
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,068
Good grief.

271
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,740
Who would've known
my business would take off in five years?

272
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,869
I know.
Why did it have to become so crowded?

273
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,039
Back then, my dear Ju-a said,

274
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:16,126
"Sang-sik, retro is the way to go.
You should redo the whole store…"

275
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:26,303
What I'm saying is that I had no idea
that these outdated VHS tapes

276
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,056
would help my business so much.

277
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,148
-You're not in touch with her, are you?
-Of course not, kid.

278
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,901
Me? In touch? With Ju-a?

279
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,402
No way!

280
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,363
Don't you dare.

281
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,283
Boy, you're being so immature.

282
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,035
Listen, man.

283
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,454
I am a man of loyalty and sincerity.

284
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,207
I have no idea how Ju-a is doing!

285
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,045
My back hurts.

286
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,381
Did I work too hard today?

287
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,356
Damn it.

288
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,190
Gyeom!

289
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,441
This late?

290
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,572
Come on!

291
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,073
Gyeom!

292
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:54,951
Hey.

293
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,538
-Have you lost your mind?
-Come with me.

294
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,956
What? Hey!

295
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,043
Hurry up, man!

296
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,257
People will think we're delinquents
sitting here like this.

297
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,052
Damn you, jerk!

298
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,180
Hey, have you lost it?

299
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,017
You knew about this.

300
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,312
You left it there on purpose, right?

301
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,897
Oh, you saw that?

302
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,527
That was quicker than I expected.
I thought it'd take you a week.

303
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,279
Are you a lunatic?
When was this even published?

304
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,032
This week.
I bought it as soon as it came out.

305
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,993
Since when did Ju-a start
writing scripts for…

306
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:39,788
Forget it.

307
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,416
-Did you see it?
-See what?

308
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,501
The movie she wrote.

309
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,461
I watched it as soon as it came out.

310
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,421
You crazy bastard!

311
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,298
Why would you go watch that?

312
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,259
Why not?

313
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,553
Hey, there's no reason for me not to.

314
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,972
Plus, Ju-a wrote it.
All the more reason to watch.

315
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,516
Are you serious?

316
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,773
-Want to hear about it?
-Get lost, you punk.

317
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,279
What are you so mad about?

318
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,158
Just be like,
"Oh well, she must have worked hard."

319
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,998
How can you be okay?

320
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,834
-What do you mean?
-For me…

321
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,921
Let's say she called it quits
because she hated my guts.

322
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,674
She was friends with you for ten years.

323
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,884
But she didn't visit once
after Jun's accident.

324
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:39,139
That's unacceptable. So how could you
watch her movie like it's no big deal?

325
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,224
God! You're such a pushover.

326
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,394
You know

327
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,023
that I get curious as hell
when it comes to movies.

328
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,609
I couldn't help myself.

329
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,699
But

330
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,828
I ended up watching another movie
out of my stupid curiosity.

331
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,761
-What you did…
-I know.

332
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,220
That was a dick move.

333
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,221
Was I that bad?

334
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,348
Why did you do it?

335
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,144
No idea.
My mouth moved faster than I could think.

336
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:32,067
What can you do?
It was messed up from the start.

337
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,449
You'll never see her again anyway.

338
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,015
Is this really a melo, a romance movie?

339
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:09,938
I know that hybrid genre movies
have become more mainstream…

340
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,053
Congratulations, Ms. Kim!

341
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,139
Hey, you're overdoing it again.

342
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,351
No, I mean it. Our box office numbers
are much higher than expected.

343
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,269
Yeah?

344
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,273
There you go again,
pretending you don't know.

345
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,691
Thanks.

346
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,651
Have you read the reviews?

347
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,486
Do I have to read them?

348
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,157
A lot of directors can't wait
to read their reviews.

349
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,451
You should look them up.
They're really good!

350
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,035
Cheers!

351
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,331
That burns!

352
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,127
We'll be doing a few more Q&A sessions.
Is that okay with you?

353
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,172
Well…

354
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:22,469
Do you remember the last question
we had in our last discussion?

355
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,720
The last…

356
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:27,182
Oh, the guy who talked about the narrative
and how it's gloomy?

357
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,059
How odd. There's always one.

358
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,978
Ignore what he said.

359
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,898
I mean, the question wasn't so bad.

360
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,984
Everyone had to sign up
to be there, right?

361
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,029
Yes, some of them signed up
and won a spot.

362
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,198
Some were invited. Why do you ask?

363
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,658
No reason.

364
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,246
Why, thank you! Cheers!

365
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,915
Cheers.

366
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,724
Good morning, Ms. Kim!
Get something for that hangover.

367
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,186
Oh, don't worry
about what you said last night.

368
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,270
Leave it to me.

369
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,733
What is she talking about?

370
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,322
Whatever.

371
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,785
That's all. Thank you!

372
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,335
You can go now.

373
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,553
RETURNING HOME IN GLORY

374
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,137
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR PARK SEONG-TAE

375
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:49,848
Darn it.

376
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,520
Seong-tae. I'm busy right now.
I have to check something. Hang up.

377
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,939
You're reading the reviews again,
aren't you?

378
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,942
I'm telling you.
This time, it was received very well.

379
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,026
Hey, man!

380
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,697
Why do you keep stopping me?
That's even more suspicious.

381
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,699
Just tell me.

382
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,493
It's bad, isn't it?

383
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,454
No, it's… it's good, really.

384
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,123
Hang up.

385
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,040
It's true.

386
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:26,009
RETURNING HOME IN GLORY?
THE RISE AND FALL OF DIRECTOR MA SEONG-U

387
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,761
THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS MOVIE?
IT MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE

388
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,147
Damn these critics. How ridiculous.

389
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,987
Hello.

390
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,908
Director Ma!

391
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,027
You shoe thief!

392
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:30,949
You okay there?

393
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,831
There, my bad!

394
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,002
You come and go as you please, don't you?

395
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,631
After all that movie-watching,
you must think you're the main character.

396
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,802
That's some way to tell me
that you missed me.

397
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,430
You were such a pest, but you took off
as soon as filming wrapped.

398
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,810
Keep that up in this industry,
and your career will end for good.

399
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,607
Did something happen?

400
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,027
Just some things.

401
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,363
Spare me the complicated details.

402
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,031
Do you make a living for yourself?

403
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:15,201
To be honest, I gave you roles
because I'm a generous guy, you punk.

404
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,619
You should be grateful.

405
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,708
But I still had quite a screen presence.
I'd say I was a scene stealer.

406
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,084
Stop stealing scenes.

407
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,087
My movie flopped
because you stole everything.

408
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,172
Wait a minute. It was your fault.

409
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,260
Come on. Don't say it flopped.
I liked your new movie.

410
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,804
You saw it?

411
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,806
How was it? Was it okay?

412
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,434
I liked it.

413
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,768
I knew it!

414
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:45,231
The audience thought it was good.
What's wrong with those clueless critics?

415
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,150
They don't know what they're saying!

416
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,239
Get up.

417
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,490
-What, me?
-Yeah.

418
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,118
We can't say goodbye like this.

419
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,203
Come along.

420
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,596
Isn't it nice to be called "Director"?

421
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,097
Hardly.

422
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:22,393
Why didn't you warn me
that it was the busiest job on set?

423
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,480
I'm running around more now
than when I was a rookie.

424
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,736
That means you're doing it right.

425
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,366
Anyway, your retrospective is coming up.

426
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,704
Doesn't that sound like
something you'd do for a dead person?

427
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,374
It doesn't feel right. I don't want to go.

428
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:50,463
It's your own retrospective.
You, of all people, should be there.

429
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:51,923
Is that so?

430
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,842
What about you?

431
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,305
Have you found peace
now that you've made a movie?

432
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,227
I don't know.

433
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,354
I'm not sure yet.

434
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,945
You're back.

435
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,448
Ko Gyeom? How long has it been?

436
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,492
-What?
-Look who showed up!

437
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,409
Gyeom!

438
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,121
You all haven't ditched Mr. Ma yet?

439
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,580
What have you been up to?

440
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,250
Hey, get back to work now. Back to work!

441
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,918
-You. Come this way.
-Okay.

442
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,799
Hey, sit over here.

443
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:35,716
Sure.

444
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:40,054
Sir, you're a little too fond of Gyeom.

445
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,722
It's the other way around.

446
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,434
Let's talk about movies for once.

447
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,520
Seong-tae is way too boring.

448
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,106
Yet I still haven't ditched you, sir.

449
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,108
Wow, I'm thankful to death.

450
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:53,818
What's this?

451
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,071
-Director Chu's retrospective?
-Yeah.

452
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,532
She's not the type
to do something like this.

453
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,743
I wonder what's gotten into her.
It's at someplace really far too.

454
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,330
Her movies are all so great.

455
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,499
Please say all my movies are great too!

456
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,002
Your movies?

457
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,630
A few of them are great.

458
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,842
-I hate this punk.
-I agree.

459
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,428
Oh, right. You know her, don't you?

460
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,305
She used to work with us. Kim Mubee.

461
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,683
She joined Director Chu's team
and made her debut recently.

462
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,728
Weren't you two close back then?

463
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,188
Am I mistaken?

464
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,442
Director?

465
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,069
Gyeom hasn't been here in a while.

466
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,447
-Can we have dinner tonight?
-Shall we?

467
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,449
I'm sorry.

468
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,744
I have to be home early today.

469
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,293
Gyeom.

470
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,213
Yeah. What? Do you want water?

471
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:03,262
What have you been doing lately,
other than working and looking after me?

472
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:08,017
Well, I've been doing pretty well.
Watching movies and meeting people.

473
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,102
Have you?

474
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,854
Are you worried about me?

475
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,024
I'm faring well, old man.

476
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,901
It's just

477
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:23,366
we used to talk so much
when we watched movies.

478
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:28,788
Yeah, it was more like a chat session
than a movie night.

479
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:34,126
It was really fun hearing you talk about
just about anything, you know.

480
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,589
Remember? You even told me
you had a crush on someone once.

481
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,759
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?

482
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,262
I was young back then.

483
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,432
I did all the talking
while you just listened.

484
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:59,277
But now, for some reason, it seems like…

485
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,447
you're doing all you can…

486
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,576
not to enjoy your life.

487
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,294
You're wrong.

488
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:22,383
It's just that I've now matured
into a calm, decent grown-up, okay?

489
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:06,093
The thing that has bothered me the most
about Ko Gyeom's return…

490
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,140
is that all my efforts
to believe that he was dead

491
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,851
had gone to waste.

492
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,065
Once again, I was looking for an answer…

493
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,988
to the question
I'd asked myself over and over.

494
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,244
MELODY

495
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,718
Why did he disappear like that?

496
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,555
Mom.

497
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,391
Yes?

498
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,477
Don't you miss Dad?

499
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,313
I mean,

500
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,316
what if Dad hadn't died?

501
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,694
What if he'd gone on a trip instead?

502
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,322
What's all this nonsense in the morning?

503
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,908
Come and sit. Let's eat.

504
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,078
How would you feel if he came back?

505
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,548
It's just a thought that came to me
while reading a script last night.

506
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,809
I'd like that to happen.

507
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,942
It seems the house
across the street was sold.

508
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,610
That place?

509
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,863
Who would move in there?

510
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,031
It's been empty for ages.
It must be run down.

511
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:51,949
I know.

512
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,621
Eat your spinach.

513
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,253
It's like we're going on a trip, right?

514
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,547
I told you to go alone.
Why are you taking me?

515
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,676
This is someone
who made a mark on Korean filmmaking.

516
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,678
You can't miss it because it's too far.

517
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,599
Keep that up in this industry,
and your career will end for good.

518
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,516
Look at you.

519
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:22,354
I haven't been
in a beat-up car like this in a while.

520
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,398
Classy, isn't it?

521
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,650
Who cares
as long as it gets you to places?

522
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,569
Speed bump!

523
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,366
Hey, you're trying to kill me here.

524
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,578
Sir, let me show you something cool.

525
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,042
I have my reasons for buying this car.

526
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,210
Show me what?

527
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,093
Go!

528
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,909
DIRECTOR CHU HUI-YEONG'S RETROSPECTIVE

529
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:20,579
NEVERTHELESS, CONTINUE,
AND JUST MOVE FORWARD

530
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,848
Congratulations!

531
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,024
Are you working on your next movie?

532
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,861
Well, I never stop preparing
to make movies.

533
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,447
But we will have to see.

534
00:42:56,323 --> 00:43:00,244
Were there any actors
you wanted to work with?

535
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,204
I wouldn't say that.

536
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:06,709
That is something I'll need to think about
once the script is complete.

537
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,296
There are so many good actors
in Korea right now…

538
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,220
I know I sound crazy.

539
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,975
But that day,

540
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:28,355
Ko Gyeom looked like someone
who was returning home from his trip.

541
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:07,186
I thought I saw a sense of relief
and inexplicable exhaustion in him.

542
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,675
Ms. Kim, here you are. I was calling you.

543
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,636
Even better.
I thought I'd tell you in person.

544
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,306
-It's about what you told me last time.
-Sorry? What do you mean?

545
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,309
When we had drinks the other day,
you asked me to find someone.

546
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,270
By that, you mean…

547
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,357
That person at the Q&A
who asked you a rude question.

548
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,943
Oh, no. It's okay now.

549
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,070
You said he was a total fraud.

550
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:01,865
I've been watching that clip nonstop
to find out his seat number.

551
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,202
It turns out
that he was one of our invitees.

552
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,787
You didn't have to. It's okay.

553
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,956
It's not okay.
Do you know what's even crazier?

554
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,207
That person was--

555
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,543
Hey, Gyeom!
What are you doing? Come this way.

556
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,170
Well, he was a movie critic… What?

557
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,090
-This jerk! It's him!
-No, it's not.

558
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,925
-No, you have the wrong guy.
-It's him!

559
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,886
-He doesn't look like him.
-Wait. That's the guy.

560
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,304
No, you're wrong.

561
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,726
-I'm telling you.
-No.

562
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,644
-That's not him.
-But…

563
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,646
-No.
-Oh, I get it now.

564
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,816
Did he give you a bad review?

565
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,860
No, it's not that.

566
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,154
Unbelievable.
That's what critics are like.

567
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,031
They only say bad things about movies.

568
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,867
Yes, I guess so.

569
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,287
Ms. Kim.
Directors and critics are enemies, okay?

570
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,414
Oh my. It's almost time.

571
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,665
We have to go!

572
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,625
Goodness, look at the time!

573
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,513
Director Kim.

574
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,183
Congratulations on making your debut.

575
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,891
Where are you?
Everyone is saying hello here.

576
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:51,809
Party's up next!

577
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,895
Something came up,
so I have to go back early.

578
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,480
I'm really sorry. Bye now.

579
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,513
This is just the worst.

580
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,395
Oh God!

581
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:43,026
How did you disappear like that?
How are you so fast?

582
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,611
Did you follow me?

583
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:48,323
You dropped your car key and ran off.
I thought you wanted me to follow you.

584
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,036
Give me that.

585
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,461
What are you…

586
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,466
Be my designated driver just this once?

587
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,478
Since when were you a movie critic?

588
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,940
Since I started getting paid
for writing reviews?

589
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,442
Did you review my movie too?

590
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,319
-Not yet.
-Are you going to?

591
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,572
-That's up to me.
-Why did you even come to see it?

592
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,241
-I was curious.
-Curious about what?

593
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,119
I wanted to see
what kind of movie you had made.

594
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,747
You were curious about me.
That's why you looked me up.

595
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,332
Who, me? No, I didn't.

596
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,751
I heard her calling me a fraud.

597
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,752
Apparently,

598
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,006
directors and critics
are supposed to be enemies.

599
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,455
You've changed a lot.

600
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:24,962
Though, even back then,
I didn't think you were the quiet type.

601
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,764
Were you ill?

602
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,643
No.

603
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,813
Then, did someone die?

604
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:45,816
No.

605
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,402
Did you commit a crime and get locked up?

606
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,571
-That's not it either.
-Then what?

607
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,714
You must've thought I was that easy.

608
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,554
Don't show up in front of me ever again.

609
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,334
Hey, Mom.

610
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,002
Hey.

611
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,673
Looks like some major renovations.
How long has it been?

612
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,512
I heard they're flattening the floor
for someone in a wheelchair.

613
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,930
Is that so?

614
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,025
Excuse me.

615
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,074
I live right across the street.

616
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,077
Excuse me!

617
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,583
What are you doing here?

618
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,629
I'm fixing my house.
Wait, what are you doing here?

619
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,631
You're my neighbor?

620
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,138
You're my neighbor?

621
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,556
Are you crazy?

622
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,474
What? Wait a minute.

623
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,602
You're making it sound like
I followed you all the way here.

624
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,522
Then what? Are you saying
this is all a coincidence?

625
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,987
Gyeom, how about jjajangmyeon for lunch?

626
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,697
Jun, hold on.

627
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:43,535
My brother picked this house, you know.
I don't like what you're implying.

628
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,081
But how can this…

629
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,041
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

630
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,461
Keep your enemies closer, right?

631
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,588
What?

632
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,381
You said we were enemies.

633
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,224
Let's try to get along
like the enemies that we are.

638
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,552
No, it's okay. We won't need one.
I'll care for him myself.

639
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,054
Will you?

640
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,138
One moment, please.

641
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,233
Have some corn.

642
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,114
I don't want any.

643
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,661
What's gotten into her? She loves corn.

644
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,463
