1
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,027
This is how Alfred Hitchcock explained
the nature of suspense.

2
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:33,867
First, the audience witnesses
someone placing a bomb under a table.

3
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,119
Then the main character,

4
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,581
without a clue, leisurely enjoys
a cup of coffee at that very table.

5
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,643
Knowing that the bomb could blow up
at any moment,

6
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,729
the audience feels anxious and nervous.

7
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,365
That's how I feel right now.

8
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,835
I saw the bomb being planted
right before my eyes…

9
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,925
-Hello.
-Hello!

10
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:32,842
Hi!

11
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:39,182
…and not knowing when it will explode
makes me kind of nervous.

12
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,477
That's why I'm here.

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,229
You must've just moved in.

14
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,730
Yes, here is some tteok.

15
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,690
Thank you. You're so kind.

16
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,150
-It's nothing.
-No.

17
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,112
-I'll see you around.
-Not nervous. I'd say I'm annoyed.

18
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,284
Mom, did someone come by
and give you tteok?

19
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,328
Tteok? What tteok?

20
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,040
Never mind. You should go.

21
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,376
-Bye.
-Make sure you eat.

22
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,293
Okay.

23
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,087
He visited all the neighbors but us?

24
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,675
And what really pisses me off is…

25
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,481
Goodbye.

26
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,580
…that he's somehow even more annoying
now that he's trying not to bother me.

27
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,243
Hey!

28
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:04,827
What's wrong?

29
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,164
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,082
What was that?

31
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,714
I have no idea what he's trying to pull.

32
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,229
I'm just doing my best, you know.

33
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,897
Jun, the flowers have bloomed.

34
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,691
Yeah. When did that happen?

35
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,276
Mom, I'm leaving.

36
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,069
-Gyeom?
-What?

37
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,737
Make sure you take your medicine.

38
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,406
-Gyeom?
-Okay!

39
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,907
Hey!

40
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,661
Gyeom!

41
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,414
She told me never to show up
in front of her again,

42
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,166
and moving right next door to her
seems crazy to me.

43
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:56,963
Jun.

44
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,091
What did you really like about this house?

45
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,009
What?

46
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:07,724
I told you. I'd often see this house
on my way to the rehabilitation center.

47
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,101
Why? Do you not like it?

48
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:15,356
I mean, I need a solid reason
if I'm going to even use it as an excuse.

49
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,942
This is just so unfair.

50
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,152
What?

51
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,154
Nothing. Let's go inside.

52
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,199
So I tried to avoid her

53
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,161
until I could think of a proper excuse.

54
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,078
Hello.

55
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,832
I'd like some pork shoulder
to make jjigae…

56
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:41,174
As I mentioned before,
she's the type that really stands out.

57
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,760
How much would you like?

58
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,511
Just a kilogram, please.

59
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,977
But now she seems… How should I put it?

60
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,065
Hey! You okay, kid?

61
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,775
What's your problem? Out of my way.

62
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:01,778
But…

63
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,156
-Give me a ride too!
-What is that?

64
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,909
Now, one person at a time.

65
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,078
Here it goes!

66
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,330
Faster?

67
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,708
Here we go!

68
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,544
-Faster!
-Even faster?

69
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,756
-Hold on tight.
-Faster!

70
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,841
-Here we go!
-Make it more fun!

71
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,262
She seems different somehow.

72
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,729
Ma'am, let me take that.

73
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,773
-It's okay!
-Just give it to me.

74
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,692
You act just as lovely as you look.

75
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,362
-Let me pull yours too.
-No!

76
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,948
-I'm fine!
-Come on, I'm going that way anyway.

77
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,161
Take your time, ladies!

78
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,496
Yes, ma'am.

79
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,791
There were sides to her
that I'd missed before.

80
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,796
He's such a strange guy.

81
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,969
What? What are you looking at?

82
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,229
Are you gonna knock on our door
or something? I dare--

83
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,693
What? Is he really coming over?

84
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,153
What's happening?

85
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,905
What's he doing? Why?

86
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,120
Oh no. What do I do?

87
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,707
Wait a minute.

88
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,462
Did I do something wrong?
Why am I trying to hide?

89
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,339
Seriously?

90
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,344
Who is--

91
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,140
Mubee!

92
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:08,070
KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE,
BUT YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER

93
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,107
Who is--

94
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,027
Mubee!

95
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,701
What?

96
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:00,122
Turns out,
I'd missed quite a lot of things.

97
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,380
Are you really Jeong-hu?

98
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,548
Yeah.

99
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,219
But your…

100
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:20,226
Wait, do people's genes change
when they go to the US?

101
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,937
Probably. Everything is bigger there.

102
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,940
Have you gotten healthier now?

103
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,944
As you can see.

104
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:30,861
Hit me.

105
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,617
And you never reached out once?

106
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,833
How could I reach out to you?
I didn't have your number.

107
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,586
Your number changed
when I was done with surgery.

108
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,254
You should've called my house.

109
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,505
That number was canceled.

110
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,923
You should've sent an email.

111
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,049
Do I know your address?

112
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,509
Then what do you call it?

113
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,845
Yes, social media.
You should've looked me up.

114
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,680
Do you have a "social media" account?

115
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,681
No.

116
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,434
See?

117
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,773
I was worried you might have moved
and I'd never see you again.

118
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,817
I even thought about people search--

119
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,279
I'm so glad.
You've been through so much, Jeong-hu.

120
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,491
But how did you get so tall?

121
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,078
Your place hasn't changed at all.
It looks exactly the same.

122
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,289
-Hey.
-Yes?

123
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:27,043
Did you get bullied
or something in the US?

124
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,339
I'm sure there were kids who teased you
because you were small.

125
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,425
You gave me something for that.
Don't you remember?

126
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,385
I did?

127
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,638
One second.

128
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,684
You told me to pull this out
if anyone tried to bully me.

129
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,730
Hey!

130
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,607
When I couldn't even speak English,

131
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,901
I kept this photo on me
like a lucky charm.

132
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,321
Then no one messed with me.
I guess they thought I was crazy.

133
00:10:55,404 --> 00:11:00,826
Hey, anyone born in this country
in the '90s has a photo like this.

134
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,580
These were my glory days.

135
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,793
TAE KWON DO

136
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,340
Mubee!

137
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,515
What are you doing?

138
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,058
Let's move.

139
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,810
Today is our housewarming party.

140
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,270
Let's move after the party.

141
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,816
Stop talking nonsense.

142
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,193
When will Si-jun be here? Call him.

143
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,407
What the…

144
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,451
Now.

145
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,375
TWO SEASONS - WRITTEN BY SON JU-A
DIRECTED BY MOON YEONG

146
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,462
Would you like to buy a ticket?

147
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,964
Yes.

148
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,383
That one. Two Seasons.

149
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,468
One ticket for Two Seasons?

150
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,971
Which showing would you prefer?

151
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,600
Never mind. Thanks for your help.

152
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,063
Two tickets for Two Seasons, please.

153
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,280
Hong Si-jun.

154
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,416
Want to watch it with me?

155
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,938
Looking for the switch box?

156
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,733
It's way in the back on the right side.

157
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,986
But I wouldn't put lights up in the yard.

158
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,988
It'll attract a lot of insects.

159
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,239
Wait, who are you?

160
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,825
I used to live here. Good to meet you!

161
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,749
I was visiting the house across the street
and thought I'd come by.

162
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,543
-Why were you at that house?
-Because there's…

163
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,421
Do you know them?

164
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,257
No, I don't.

165
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,470
I'm here to see my girl, Mubee.

166
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,349
So you do know her.

167
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,018
Well…

168
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,523
Do you want to see the house,
or are you gonna keep standing there?

169
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,982
Really? Can I?

170
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,236
Easy there. You think I'd let you?

171
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,658
You have a weird way with words.

172
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,036
I actually came to ask

173
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:53,541
if you happened to see a steel box
in the shed back there.

174
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,544
Oh, that thing!

175
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,295
-Is it still around?
-Yes!

176
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,005
Seriously?

177
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,591
It's over there.

178
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,717
-Over there?
-Yes.

179
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,719
I wasn't expecting this at all!

180
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,394
What am I thinking? Over there.

181
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,187
-I think it was there. Yes.
-There?

182
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,106
-Here?
-Yes.

183
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:21,944
Sorry!

184
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,990
-Is the box stainless steel?
-Yes, stainless steel.

185
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,658
It's near the recyclables.

186
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,078
My childhood memories are in there.

187
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,496
Are they?

188
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,791
All right. I see.

189
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,546
It's not here.

190
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,798
Yeah. It was never here.

191
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,508
What?

192
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,849
It's not here?

193
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,267
Not here. No.

194
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,644
I see.

195
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,233
The guy across the street is a nutcase.

196
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,486
You went over there?

197
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,322
Yes, I had something to ask.

198
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,198
Why? Do you know him?

199
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,160
No, I don't.

200
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,251
What is up with you two?

201
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,640
Have some mandarins.

202
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,475
Sure.

203
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,275
It's nothing.

204
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,796
I saw you walking
into the theater by chance.

205
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,132
I wondered if I should say hi or not.

206
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,011
Then I saw you glaring at the poster
for a while.

207
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,358
Did Gyeom tell you about it?
He watches every movie that is released.

208
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,740
Are you going to just sit there
in silence?

209
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,036
Was it just by chance?

210
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,414
What?

211
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,792
We've never run into each other before,
and you suddenly showed up.

212
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,128
So what?

213
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:49,341
You vanished without a trace, and what,
thought now was a good time to show up?

214
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,473
You really think I'm that immature?

215
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,393
If you came to boast, go on.

216
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,645
Congratulations.

217
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,106
You must have worked hard
for the last five years.

218
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,360
I thought you were just bored
when you said you'd write a script,

219
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,112
but you did it.

220
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,075
Yeah. Thanks for the congratulations.

221
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,289
I can tell what you must've been thinking
of me for the last five years.

222
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,209
If you're that proud of me,

223
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,130
why did you hesitate so much,
then decide not to watch the movie?

224
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,798
It's just…

225
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,177
because it's a melo.

226
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,473
I thought it might be about me.

227
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:39,975
What?

228
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,438
I heard artists use anything they can
as inspiration… when they're desperate.

229
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,776
Sorry, but I wasn't that desperate.

230
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,736
Weren't you?

231
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,074
-Good for you, then.
-You're funny.

232
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,534
Did you ever use our story in your songs?

233
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:00,913
Yes.

234
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,207
"Yes"?

235
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,710
I tried, wondering if there was at least
some inspiration left for me after.

236
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:11,048
We dated for seven years,
but I couldn't even write seven bars.

237
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,270
So? Are you closer to your dream now?

238
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,690
To be a successful
but anonymous songwriter.

239
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,235
You seem to have the anonymous part down.

240
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,655
So? Are you successful?

241
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:41,078
Don't blame me for lack of inspiration.
Maybe you don't have what it takes.

242
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,254
What I meant was--

243
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,965
It must've been tough
pretending to have faith in me.

244
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,050
No. What I meant was--

245
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,093
Are you done?

246
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,554
What? Got more to brag about?

247
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,472
Can I go if you're done?

248
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,557
Hong Si-jun.

249
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,103
Right.

250
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,692
You showing up like this was fun,
but you can stop acting like you know me.

251
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,237
Gyeom and I aren't your friends anymore.

252
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,762
This one's called "money tree."

253
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,015
-"Congrats on your move"?
-There's wine too.

254
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,349
Okay. Just look ahead!

255
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,269
-Hey, Gyeom and Jun!
-Hey, you're here.

256
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,521
-Hi.
-Why did you bring so much stuff?

257
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,023
We hardly brought anything.

258
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,776
-Nice place, Jun.
-Here's your money tree.

259
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,195
It'll make you rich.

260
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,821
-Thanks.
-Nice fire.

261
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,616
Let's throw some sweet potatoes in there.

262
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,910
-Follow me. Let's go wash these.
-Huh?

263
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,329
-Just follow me!
-But I need to…

264
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,914
This place seems nice!

265
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:11,168
I mean, she lives right across the street.
It's impossible to stay out of her sight.

266
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,713
But I still did my best.
Shouldn't she be making some effort too?

267
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:22,429
But she does things
that make her stand out too much.

268
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,557
How can I not look at her
if she's doing backflips in front of me?

269
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,558
She does backflips?

270
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,103
-No, man. It was a figure of speech.
-Did you have enough?

271
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,980
-And hits it!
-My stomach's gonna burst.

272
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,023
That's the one.

273
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,901
-The man in pink?
-Yeah.

274
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,363
-Bye, then.
-Bye. Do you know the way?

275
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,280
He's good-looking.

276
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,076
-Bye. Get home safe.
-Bye!

277
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,250
What gives?

278
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,002
What's he up to now?

279
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,046
Then pow!

280
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,464
-She's gone.
-Get down.

281
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,383
The meat will get overcooked, man!

282
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,718
What do we have here?

283
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,888
We've got no beef, only pork,
and even that looks charred!

284
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,973
Are you kidding me?

285
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,058
-It's not burnt.
-It is. Eat this.

286
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,187
Hey, so…

287
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,690
-Listen.
-In Papillon…

288
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,109
He said he used to live here.

289
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,237
I wasn't even curious.
I just happened to find out.

290
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,447
I think the problem is

291
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,867
that I keep finding out things
I don't even wanna know.

292
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,202
For crying out loud.

293
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,746
-Man, I need more customers.
-This is driving me crazy.

294
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,831
It's just the wine.

295
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,751
Sales were bad yesterday too.

296
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,964
He was probably just a kid
who lived across the street.

297
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,049
He looked way younger.

298
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,552
I talked with him for a moment,

299
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,014
and he was a bit of a rude little punk.

300
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,100
And so immature too.

301
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:53,937
It's nice to see you finally
looking spirited like in the old days…

302
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,442
but honestly,
you're acting really weird now.

303
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,528
If you've moved on,
stop paying attention to her.

304
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,574
If you want to give it another shot,
go apologize or give her an excuse.

305
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,535
After all, you disappeared without a word.

306
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,245
Being the one left behind

307
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,247
feels like shit.

308
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:25,677
I know it was a tough situation for you…
but Jun's gotten a lot better.

309
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,180
The accident was out of your hands.

310
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,229
Things are much better for you now.
Why can't you just go tell her?

311
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,485
Whatever.

312
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,534
Or is there…

313
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,455
something I don't know?

314
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,458
Nah, it's nothing like that.

315
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,924
Never mind. Let's go inside. It's chilly.

316
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,490
MOVIE CRITIC GODAM

317
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,838
So you refuse to critique my movie, huh?

318
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,092
Ridiculous. It's not like I care.

319
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,142
What was that?

320
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,065
Jun, you must be tired.
You should go inside.

321
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,359
Today's party…

322
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,406
Didn't it seem like a scene
out of the movies we watch?

323
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,492
Having a barbecue with friends.

324
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,204
Sitting down and chatting together.

325
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,584
Is that why you liked this place?

326
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,380
No particular reason.

327
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,761
Whenever I passed by this street,
that wall always caught my eye.

328
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,349
Do you remember watching Cinema Paradiso?

329
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,769
Seeing them projecting a movie
on a white wall outdoors,

330
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:44,608
you said you wanted to live in a house
with a white wall someday.

331
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:49,738
Then again,

332
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,658
you were quite young,
so you probably wouldn't remember.

333
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,375
So you did this for my sake again?

334
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,963
What? What do you mean by that?

335
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,843
When you said you wanted to live here,
I thought that just this once

336
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,387
you chose something for yourself.

337
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,557
It was for me again.

338
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,270
Ko Jun, you're such a boring guy.

339
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,105
It's not like that.

340
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,816
I genuinely liked this place.

341
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,777
The neighborhood seemed nice as well.

342
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,623
It'd be nice if you could want something
for yourself for once

343
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,376
and not just for my sake.

344
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,468
Now I don't even have a good excuse.

345
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,264
We moved here practically
because I wanted to.

346
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,330
I do want something for myself.

347
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,584
I did a lot of things that I wanted to do.

348
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,711
Did you?

349
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,546
Such as?

350
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,591
Tell me at least one thing
you did as you pleased.

351
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,267
See? Just having to think about it
shows there isn't anything.

352
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,189
Want to watch a movie?

353
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,234
You always use that trick on me.

354
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,945
And you fall for it every time.

355
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,489
Not anymore.

356
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,658
I'm not a kid.

357
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,119
What's on today?

358
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,501
A Beautiful Mind?

359
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,669
That sounds great.

360
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,920
-Right?
-Yeah.

361
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,547
Okay.

362
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,643
Hey, Seong-tae!

363
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,560
Yes?

364
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,730
Hey, about the posters,

365
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,149
wouldn't it be better
to set them up back here?

366
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,944
I'm sure he'll take photos of those later.

367
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,698
What's with you?
You've done interviews before.

368
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,867
That's when my movies did well,
so I was all excited, but now,

369
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,661
don't I look pathetic?

370
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,332
You look like the most stand-up guy.

371
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,251
I shouldn't have agreed to do this!

372
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,254
-The public will chew me up!
-You'll be fine.

373
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,092
You'll be fine!
I mean, you saw the reviews.

374
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,178
You know he's very complimentary
about your work.

375
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,098
Hey, critics are never to be trusted.

376
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,351
They smile in your face
and tear you to pieces behind your back.

377
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,234
-Why are you here?
-Good to see you, Gyeom.

378
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,403
Mr. Ma is about to have an interview.

379
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,113
-Hello, sir.
-You can wait out--

380
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,823
What are you doing?

381
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,074
-What?
-What's he doing?

382
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,868
What's with him?

383
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,245
I'm here for the interview.

384
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,330
Knock it off.

385
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,498
I'm serious.

386
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,429
I mean,
I wasn't exactly trying to hide it.

387
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:28,099
I was going to bring it up
when the time was right.

388
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,352
Do you have to be so serious about this?

389
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:36,274
You know how much I hate
those critic bastards, don't you?

390
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,485
Remember Wealth and Prosperity--

391
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,820
Of course I know.
You don't have to remind me.

392
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,864
Everyone was a bit too harsh back then.

393
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,827
I thought all the critics
in the world were assholes.

394
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,291
But not this one.

395
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:59,339
In his post, I saw a deep understanding
and profound love for my movie.

396
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,674
Right.

397
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,218
And it was you who wrote it?

398
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,387
Yes, because this one was good.
I can't say the same about…

399
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,141
What are you doing?

400
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,727
Thank God.

401
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,270
What?

402
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,191
You are actually good at something!

403
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:24,280
Do you know how worried I was
every time I saw you act, kid?

404
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,784
I thought,
"This kid loves movies so much."

405
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,453
"But he's got zero talent."

406
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,832
"How tough must it be for him?"

407
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,835
Why didn't you tell me
you had this talent?

408
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,711
I had a talent for acting, but--

409
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:42,048
Last night,
I read through your entire blog.

410
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,052
I lost track of time
and read every single post.

411
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,806
Your sentences are simple
and easy to read.

412
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,059
That means you wrote them
without having to think much about it.

413
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,062
But I put a lot of thought into those.

414
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,898
And what's more,
they make you want to watch the movie.

415
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,067
That's what a review should do,
nothing more.

416
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,489
So I thought I could trust a guy like that
and do an interview with him.

417
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,824
This is wonderful.

418
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,703
From now on, we stick together like glue.

419
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,122
You can review all my movies--

420
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,832
No way.

421
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,791
Why not?

422
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,086
I just don't like the sound
of us "sticking together."

423
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,506
Such a little cutie pie!

424
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,176
I bet you'll make me look good
with this interview.

425
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,345
You have my full trust!

426
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,807
What are you talking about?
I'm going to write it just as it is.

427
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,476
Let us begin.

428
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,561
Yes, sir!

429
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,566
Yes, Producer.

430
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,986
Out of all the scripts you gave me,
I liked Melody best.

431
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,279
That one?

432
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,157
You're more serious
about melos than I thought.

433
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,492
Can I meet the screenwriter?

434
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,494
Sure thing. I'll set up a meeting.

435
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:54,829
Oh, right.

436
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,999
About that critic before,
have you read his reviews?

437
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,001
No, I'm not interested.

438
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,670
Give me a call
after you have a meeting confirmed.

439
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,339
Okay.

440
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,470
MR. GODAM'S MOVIE REVIEWS

441
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,430
2017, WEALTH AND PROSPERITY

442
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,522
He's reviewed every single one
of Director Ma's movies.

443
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,651
He obviously only writes reviews
for those he likes.

444
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,570
How can he be this biased as a critic?

445
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,330
You've been coming here often.

446
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,085
As a kid, I thought it was so silly

447
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,546
when I saw people in movies
drinking alone in bars.

448
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,132
I'd be like,
"Stop being pathetic and go home."

449
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,802
"Don't spend so much
on such a small drink."

450
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,054
But you get it now?

451
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,181
Yes.

452
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,893
Who cares?
I'm just here to drink what I want.

453
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,647
Also, the bartenders talk to me
so I don't get bored.

454
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,482
They listen to what I have to say.

455
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,278
I don't have anyone to talk to, you know.

456
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,615
Everyone around me is from work.

457
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,450
I have no friends.

458
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,829
I can't share this with my family either.

459
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,915
Yes, right.

460
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,167
That's right. Sure.

461
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,881
Did you nod at what I just said?

462
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:30,842
Yes.

463
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,845
Who said you could eavesdrop?

464
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,307
You should've talked more quietly, then.

465
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,702
That was how it ended. The end.

466
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,872
My seven-year relationship gone,
just like that.

467
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,666
The guy was an asshole.

468
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,919
But I said those things to him
when I met him the other day,

469
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,465
so he must think I'm a bitch.

470
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:17,138
Why does this story sound so familiar?

471
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,224
Because relationships are all the same.

472
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,393
People are basically the same.

473
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,896
-Have another drink.
-Okay.

474
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,820
I feel so much better
now that I've let it all out.

475
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,657
I didn't have anyone to share this with.

476
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:43,539
I can't believe I met someone
who understands me.

477
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,708
So what do you do?

478
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,962
I work for the country. A civil servant.

479
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,964
Wow, that's what I was thinking.

480
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,551
You have that civil servant look.

481
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,931
What about you? What do you do?

482
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,185
I'm an instructor. Pilates instructor.

483
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,773
No wonder.
I thought you had great posture.

484
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,733
You're sitting up so straight.

485
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,362
It's your turn now. I'll listen.

486
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,405
Do you have a boyfriend?

487
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,324
Anyone you're flirting with?

488
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,243
No, I don't have anything like that.

489
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,870
Why do I feel that you do?

490
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,666
Come on, just tell me.
You said you didn't have friends either.

491
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,590
-Here it goes.
-Okay.

492
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,926
Something absurd happened to me.

493
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,261
Okay, what is it?

494
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,598
I had a boyfriend a while ago.

495
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,559
And I kissed him.

496
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:45,893
But then…

497
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,907
This is so great,
making a friend like this!

498
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,118
Tell me about it.

499
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,955
Right! Let's exchange numbers.

500
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,790
I'd love that.

501
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,504
I had fun!

502
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,672
Bye.

00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,829
Come on.

507
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,921
Hello, sir.

508
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,383
Could we ask for your cooperation?

509
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,134
We received a report.

510
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,637
I didn't report anything.

511
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,391
No, someone reported you.
They said you'd been following a woman.

512
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,059
What? Me?

513
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,812
Oh, it's not that. I--

514
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,397
What is that in your pocket?

515
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,315
This? It's just…

516
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,151
Don't pull it out. Take a step back.

517
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,201
Should I get in? Okay.

518
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,541
Police?

519
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,891
She really is someone I know.

520
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,060
Then why were you trailing behind her?

521
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,647
She told me to stay out of her sight,
so I was following from behind.

522
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,898
What?

523
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,318
I know that sounds kind of weird, but…

524
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,988
I was just on my way home.
We live right across the street.

525
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,364
Do you really live here?

526
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,743
We had a local resident report
a strange man following a woman.

527
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,245
I moved here recently.

528
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,249
Wait, do I have to be questioned for this?

529
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:28,366
Why did you come to help? I wouldn't
have been surprised if you didn't.

530
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,994
The alcohol must've clouded my judgment.

531
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,874
Maybe I should just take you back there.
Or will you be quiet?

532
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,931
Why won't you apologize to me?

533
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,604
Shouldn't you be sorry
for just disappearing like that?

534
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:05,820
Do you always get away with things
by making silly jokes?

535
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:10,825
I'm sorry.

536
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,285
I mean it.

537
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,635
Do you still write reviews?

538
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:30,970
What?

539
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,597
Do you still write reviews?

540
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,516
Yes, of course.

541
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:41,397
I mean, do you write reviews
for every single movie you watch?

542
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,275
No, I watch way too many.
I can't review them all.

543
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,945
Anyway, why do you ask?

544
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,740
I've been thinking.

545
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:55,327
You're being so obvious
with your efforts to avoid me.

546
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,496
-It's really annoying.
-Right?

547
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,500
I was thinking the same.
Let's just say hi when we run into--

548
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,627
-You can have this neighborhood.
-What?

549
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,755
I'll rarely be home once filming starts.

550
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,384
So you can have it. I'll leave instead.

551
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,262
Wait, you really don't have to…

552
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,985
Nice to meet you for the first time.
I'm Son Ju-a.

553
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,571
I'm Kim Mubee.

554
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,409
Director Kim really enjoyed your script.

555
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,536
Thank you.

556
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,038
So you were a director.

557
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,292
I guess so. And you were a writer.

558
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,714
Which script would you be talking about?

559
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,632
Melody.

560
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,302
I'm sorry,
but I can't let you work on that.

561
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,763
What? But why not?

562
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,933
It's the first script I ever wrote,
so it has its faults.

563
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,227
We'll have to edit it extensively anyway.

564
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,024
There are others
that may be better to work on.

565
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,776
There's Love Me If You Can.

566
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,695
I'm also working on a new script.

567
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,697
I said I liked this one.

568
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,783
Why are you bringing up other work?

569
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,620
As the person who wrote this,
I don't like this script.

570
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,124
Did you plagiarize some other work?

571
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,709
What did you just say?

572
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,378
Please. Oh my God.

573
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,380
An incoming call at this moment?

574
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,881
Please excuse me.

575
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,843
Please don't fight, you two.

576
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:41,976
A civil servant?

577
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,105
I always wanted to learn Pilates.
What a shame.

578
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,357
I could say the same for you.

579
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,235
By the way,

580
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:55,030
I knew your story sounded familiar.

581
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,032
It's your own story, isn't it?

582
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:58,867
No, it's not.

583
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,160
It most certainly is.

584
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,621
It's almost identical to what you told me.

585
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,791
Yes, that's why I can't do this.

586
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,587
I wrote it out of desperation
when trying to make my debut.

587
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,089
So please take a look at my other work.

588
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,300
But I like this one.

589
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:17,845
It is raw and clumsy
in the best way possible.

590
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,555
Let's just go with this.

591
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,724
What's the big deal? Are you embarrassed?

592
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,313
I thought it might be about me.

593
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:31,609
I heard artists use anything they can
as inspiration when they're desperate.

594
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,695
It'll be so embarrassing.
It's a hard no from me.

595
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,364
Well, it shouldn't be.

596
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,410
People in this field always
sell their own stories.

597
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,875
Then let me edit it a bit.

598
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,129
I once saw a documentary.

599
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:55,507
This screenwriter even visited her ex
after their ugly divorce

600
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,676
for the sake of perfecting the movie.

601
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,095
The story was about their good times.

602
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,514
Do you know the name of that movie?

603
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,146
It's a total classic!

604
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,481
Exactly.

605
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,860
So think hard
about what the right decision would be.

606
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,991
I'm sorry. That was an unexpected call.

607
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,579
That was an interview request for you.
Would you be up for it?

608
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,373
Haven't we done enough interviews?

609
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,376
Let's keep striking
while the iron is hot, okay?

610
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,879
So? Have you two talked everything out?

611
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,428
Hey, you there!

612
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:44,598
Hey!

613
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,561
Are you here for a visit again?

614
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,356
Yes, I am. What about it?

615
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,441
This is becoming a habit.

616
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,110
We have that kind of relationship.

617
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,114
You clearly know my girl Mubee.

618
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:04,118
You called her "my girl"
last time as well.

619
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,370
Because she's my girl.

620
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,831
Can you say that to her face?

621
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,127
Well, I only call her that sometimes.

622
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,921
-I think you're just friends.
-Excuse me?

623
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,589
What are you to her?

624
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,096
Don't act like
you two have something going on.

625
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,892
How do I put this?

626
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,852
God.

627
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,730
You're being ridiculous.

628
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,774
Forget we ever said hi.
Let's just go our separate ways.

629
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,153
Holy! You found this? No way!

630
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,532
I put it aside to throw it away,
but I guess it found its owner.

631
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,785
I knew these would be here.

632
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:51,373
Well, I have the mechanical clear version
of the First Gundam.

633
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,291
You interested?

634
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,378
For real?

635
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,612
Hello!

636
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,490
I'm leaving now.

637
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,117
I'll be there on time.

638
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,452
Okay.

639
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,243
-Hello, Ms. Kim.
-Hi.

640
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,537
The interviewer just arrived. Coffee?

641
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,038
No, I'm good.

642
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,127
I'm sorry I'm late.

643
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,712
I'm Kim Mubee…

644
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,009
It's faster to get off at the next stop.

645
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,518
My name is Ko Gyeom.

646
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,354
Are you kidding me?

647
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,607
The magazine often asks me
to do interviews.

648
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,860
I'm not in a position
to turn these gigs down yet.

649
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,321
Have a seat.

650
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,490
Or will you leave
and let me have the office too?

651
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,587
Are we done?

652
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,840
No, I have a few more questions.

653
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,093
Let me see that.
You're making them up, aren't you?

654
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,512
Are these all your questions?

655
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,766
Don't take it the wrong way.

656
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,851
I ask this many for any other movie.

657
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,982
I won't take it the wrong way
because there's nothing between us.

658
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,946
I thought we were cool
after I apologized to you.

659
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:13,116
An apology isn't something cheap
you can make with one word.

660
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,368
You should learn that.

661
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,216
I'm busy. Go ahead with your questions.

662
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,552
In that case,

663
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,098
let me ask a few questions about you.

664
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,893
-Why is your name Mubee?
-Why would you want to know that?

665
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,355
Because people are gonna be curious
if a director is named Mubee.

666
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,150
They'll think, "Wow.
She must really love movies."

667
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,027
I hated movies.

668
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:50,988
Why?

669
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,745
I just loathed the people
who praised movies,

670
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,581
making them out to be something
that deserves to be loved.

671
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,835
They make such a big deal out of it,
don't you think?

672
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,587
As if it's some serious art
or a lifelong dream.

673
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,257
People fussing over it like that.
It's ridiculous.

674
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,429
Yet you're making movies yourself now.

675
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,847
Because it's just work.

676
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,892
I want to show I can make movies
without making a big deal out of it.

677
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,102
Show whom?

678
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,940
The man who gave me this ridiculous name.

679
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,035
This wasn't one of your questions.

680
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,954
I'd prefer to stop
than carry on this chitchat.

681
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,457
Do you still hate movies?

682
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,251
I'm too smart to get a job that I hate.

683
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:50,547
Then… will you watch a movie with me?

684
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:57,179
As an apology. I learned
that this is how to apologize properly.

685
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,897
Nice try, but no.

686
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,022
What is that?

687
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:19,256
Then… will you watch a movie with me?

688
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:25,387
As an apology. I learned
that this is how to apologize properly.

689
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:27,764
That guy

690
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,517
must be a real nutcase.

691
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:46,301
MELO MOVIE

692
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,141
Me too!

693
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,938
So? Am I more fun to play with?

694
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,273
Yes!

695
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,817
Let me take a break.

696
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,114
Hey, wait.

697
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,908
-It's too fast!
-What?

698
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,326
What's his deal?

699
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,496
Guys, it's too fast!

700
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,878
What's on the menu today?
You bought so much!

701
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:24,714
-You'll carry these home for me?
-That's right.

702
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,841
-My goodness.
-I'm free today.

703
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,969
I should make you something tasty.

704
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,806
-I can try some?
-You bet!

What was that?

706
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,979
Hello. Good morning.

707
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,612
-Sit over here.
-Hello, ladies.

708
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,156
I've been well, of course.

709
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,993
-Did you get home all right that day?
-I did.

00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,704
I asked you to save some japchae for me.

711
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,289
Don't worry. I'll make it again.

712
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,874
All right.

713
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,459
-I'll be waiting.
-Sure!
