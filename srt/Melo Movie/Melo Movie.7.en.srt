00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:16,391
<i>Ko Jun was never one</i>
<i>to be surprised by anything.</i>

2
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,272
KO DONG-HUN, HAN YUN-JU

3
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:27,193
<i>Even when he was thrown into the world</i>
<i>at 20 years of age</i>

4
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,112
<i>with his nine-year-old brother…</i>

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,033
WONDER VIDEO

6
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,330
<i>…he calmly accepted it.</i>

7
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,211
Thank you.

8
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,007
- Eat up.
- Okay.

9
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,509
<i>He was kind to everyone.</i>

10
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,180
<i>Especially children.</i>

11
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,978
<i>But at times,</i>
<i>when he was silently deep in thought…</i>

12
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,189
Oh man.

13
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,027
<i>…people said they found him</i>
<i>somewhat hard to approach.</i>

14
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,863
Get out, damn it!

15
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,908
Hey. Take this and get lost.

16
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,703
You useless prick.
You'll report me to the Ministry of Labor?

17
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,581
You piece of shit.

18
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,833
Goddamn it.

19
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,464
<i>No matter what people did,</i>
<i>he neither got angry nor cursed at them.</i>

20
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,094
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

21
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,011
JUN

22
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,723
<i>Happy birthday, my dear Jun</i>

23
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,560
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

24
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,149
You stayed up to do this for me?

25
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,275
Yeah.

26
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,530
Thanks.

27
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,411
<i>He was someone</i>
<i>who'd never really be happy either.</i>

28
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,053
<i>Sometimes I wondered</i>
<i>if he ever felt anything at all.</i>

29
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,306
<i>But sad movies made him cry.</i>

30
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,353
Jun, are you sad?

31
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,647
Yes.

32
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,910
<i>He was very different from me in that way.</i>

33
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,709
Jun, come out quickly.
We're going to miss the bus.

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,839
Isn't that what I used to wear
in my freshman year?

35
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,591
Yes. You weren't wearing it anymore.

36
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,342
Jun, that's completely out of style.

37
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,511
Who cares? It's perfectly wearable.

38
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,681
Let's go.

39
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,269
<i>He never wanted anything.</i>

40
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,731
God, I'd better not walk too close to him.

41
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:15,195
You did well as the head of the family.
How did you save up this much?

42
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,906
Hey, step on the lower left side here.

43
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,075
Anything you want to do with the savings?

44
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,829
You know, like buy something
or go on a trip?

45
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,247
What about you?

46
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,751
If I wrote down a list of things
I wanted to buy, do, or go to,

47
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,086
it would take me all day.

48
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,464
Really? What are they?

49
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,381
Tell me.

50
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,346
It's your money.
Is there anything you want to do?

51
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,973
Not sure.

52
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,269
<i>He didn't particularly</i>
<i>like anything either.</i>

53
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,521
Let's do what you want.

54
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:04,452
<i>Sleeping for 12 hours on his days off</i>
<i>was the closest thing he had to a hobby.</i>

55
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,039
I was like, "Mr. Driver!
You forgot about me!"

56
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,874
"Please take me with you!"

57
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,961
<i>And he spent the rest of his day</i>
<i>watching movies with his brother.</i>

58
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,671
So we were eating the corn.

59
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,924
I think she might be into me as well.

60
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,259
- Really?
- Yeah!

61
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,892
<i>Ko Jun always went above and beyond</i>
<i>as the good big brother…</i>

62
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:35,275
<i>as if it was the one and only role</i>
<i>he had in life.</i>

63
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,409
<i>I'm not sure if he even had</i>
<i>anyone he could call a friend.</i>

64
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,633
<i>I never heard him talk about</i>
<i>falling in love either.</i>

65
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,430
SEVEN CONTACTS

66
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,612
Jun! Can you hear me?

67
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,530
Jun!

68
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,034
Jun. Are you okay?

69
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:35,043
<i>And truly, Ko Jun was never one</i>
<i>to be surprised by anything.</i>

70
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,966
<i>Even this time,</i>
<i>he simply accepted everything.</i>

71
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,219
What is it?

72
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,682
Nothing. I have to use the restroom.

73
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:03,196
<i>I didn't know a single thing about Ko Jun.</i>

74
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,577
<i>There was a bit of confusion</i>
<i>as there were no CCTVs in the area.</i>

75
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,665
<i>But the dashcam footage showed</i>
<i>no other cars nearby.</i>

76
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,877
<i>There was no sign of brake failure</i>
<i>or any other malfunction.</i>

77
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:06,259
<i>We'll have to rule it as an accident</i>
<i>caused by the early morning fog and rain.</i>

78
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:11,013
MARCH 6

79
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,437
MARCH 7

80
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,691
MARCH 16

81
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:27,947
MARCH 31

82
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:34,495
APRIL 2

83
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,666
There isn't any fog.

84
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,883
It isn't slippery either.

85
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,601
There is just no way.

86
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,698
<i>Ko Jun hid many things.</i>

87
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,788
<i>He opens his eyes again every morning…</i>

88
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,125
<i>and spends another day just like that.</i>

89
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,419
<i>As if…</i>

90
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,907
<i>As if… he never really wanted to live.</i>

91
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,749
Gyeom.

92
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,293
Yes?

93
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,794
There is…

94
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,631
something I have to tell you.

95
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,315
I guess that explains

96
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:12,028
my random tumbles
and drowsiness these days.

97
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,783
They say I'll be fine once I start
therapy again and to be careful.

98
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,661
Doctors always tell you
the worst-case scenario, you know.

99
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,207
I'd been skipping therapy sessions,
so I think he was trying to warn me.

100
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,460
Okay.

101
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:50,900
THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE
NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE

102
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,782
What time are you heading…

103
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,784
Are you up, Mother?

104
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,452
What's with you?

105
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,664
- What do you mean?
- Why have you been waking up early lately?

106
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,000
Because I'm busy with work?

107
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,420
No, you don't look that cheerful
when you're busy with work.

108
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,549
You shouldn't make comments
about how people look. I'm off to work.

109
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,844
- Are you seeing someone?
- No, I'm not.

110
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,805
Try to be more sincere when you lie.

111
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,226
I am not dating, ma'am.

112
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,771
What's the point of telling
such a shameless lie?

113
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,440
Let's see.

114
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,360
The thing is, you're always
supposed to deny a dating scandal.

115
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,823
If I make it official, I'll have to face
tons of questions and annoying scrutiny,

116
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,410
not to mention you waiting for me
to get home and making me uncomfortable.

117
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,620
It'll be tiring for both of us.

118
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,792
Anyway, once again,
I'll be working late today, ma'am.

119
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,671
You're my kid, all right.

120
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,382
So clever and so smug.

121
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,359
Hey there, Ko Gyeom!

122
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,404
Why do you look so lost in thought?

123
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:24,034
I guess that wall is useless
since it's low enough for you to see over.

124
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,579
If you redo the wall,
can you make it a bit lower?

125
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,415
It's hard to stand on my tippy-toes.

126
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,922
What's gotten you thinking this early?

127
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,719
What is it? Is something wrong?

128
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,597
I'm tired.

129
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,349
Then you should be sleeping
instead of being out here.

130
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,771
Plus, please don't forget
that my mom lives right across from you.

131
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,609
Right. I've been meaning
to say this for a while.

132
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,904
When are you gonna stop
calling me Ko Gyeom?

133
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,114
What else would I call you?

134
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,825
Things haven't changed much
since we started dating.

135
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:09,413
Before, you'd say, "Hey, Mr. Ko Gyeom."
And now you say, "Hey, Ko Gyeom."

136
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,750
I feel like I'm losing out somehow.

137
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,127
- My tone of voice has changed.
- No, it hasn't.

138
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:20,758
No. You sound a bit more
like a thug now, actually.

139
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,053
Anyway, think of a pet name for me.

140
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,097
Are you serious? A pet name? Like what?

141
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,184
I'm serious. Think about it.

142
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,320
- Opposite House?
- Are you house hunting or what?

143
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,823
Ko?

144
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,075
My brother is also a Ko.

145
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,871
- Gyeom?
- That's just my name.

146
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,665
Then you pick one.

147
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,502
How about "babe"?

148
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,837
Ew!

149
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,673
That's hurtful.

150
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,467
Over my dead body.
Let's just use our first names.

151
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,971
Then how will everyone know
we're in a relationship?

152
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,389
Why do they need to know?

153
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,851
You're upsetting me
first thing in the morning.

154
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,019
That's enough. I'm going to work.

155
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,355
Get more rest, Ko Gyeom.

156
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,775
Hey, you never leave for work this early.

157
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:25,364
Didn't you come out early
to take a stroll around the block with me?

158
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,995
Well, if you know that,
what are you waiting for?

159
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,258
KO GYEOM

160
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,639
Han-sol.

161
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,726
Han-sol.

162
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,399
We just said goodbye.
Why are you calling me already?

163
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,652
I arrived safely.

164
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,406
You dropped me off right outside…
You're here early.

165
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,992
That was a very unnatural way to hang up.

166
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:10,993
What do you mean?

167
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,661
"What do you mean"?

168
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,165
We have a scenario meeting, right?
Come in.

169
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,010
This is far better
than the previous version.

170
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,264
In the scene where the two reunite,
the tension feels much more real.

171
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,849
In this scene…

172
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,728
What? What is it?

173
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,772
It smells.

174
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,898
What does?

175
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,944
The smell of freshly baked bread,
freshly brewed coffee,

176
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:49,031
and freshly extracted sesame oil
is no match for the smell

177
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,659
of a fresh romantic relationship.

178
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,870
We aren't close enough to discuss
our personal lives during a meeting.

179
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,538
- You're dating someone.
- No.

180
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,374
- You are.
- I'm not.

181
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,167
- Liar.
- What's with you?

182
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,211
- I bet 100,000 won.
- You're on.

183
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,838
Something's off.

184
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,549
Anyway,

185
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,222
the song our male lead writes
in this scene will be our main theme.

186
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:18,686
I'll have to meet the music director later
and discuss this in more detail.

187
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,854
- You're meeting Si-jun later?
- Yes.

188
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,772
Where?

189
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,482
Why do you ask?

190
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,485
Well, of course, as a writer…

191
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,737
It smells.

192
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,824
I smell the scent of lingering feelings.

193
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,576
Ms. Kim!

194
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:39,915
You're up, Jun.

195
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,668
Hey, when did you get here?

196
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,585
A while ago.

197
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,131
You took quite a long nap.

198
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,217
Yes, you're right. I slept for a while.

199
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,345
Where's Gyeom?

200
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,641
He called me over to house-sit
because he had to go grocery shopping.

201
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,728
He's treating me like his pet dog now.

202
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,648
Why watch the house? You're here,
and there's nothing worth stealing.

203
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,483
It's not the house. It's me.

204
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,695
What were you reading?

205
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,114
Jun.

206
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,825
Jun, are you okay?

207
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,160
Hold on.

208
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,953
Slowly.

209
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,497
Sit down.

210
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,047
Maybe it's because
I stayed in bed for too long.

211
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,174
Have some water first.

212
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,721
Jun.

213
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,475
I was ill for a long time myself,
so I can sense these things.

214
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,686
Are you sure you're okay?

215
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,483
I'm fine.

216
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,987
Your cardiopulmonary function
has rapidly declined.

217
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,074
If you develop complications from this,

218
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,786
it could lead to death
in the worst-case scenario.

219
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,704
You should begin drug treatment at once…

220
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,665
I'll be fine.

221
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,096
Mr. Hong, your music is going to be
the defining element of our movie.

222
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,515
- So I look forward to it.
- Okay.

223
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,434
If there is a certain mood
or reference you have in mind,

224
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,852
feel free to let me know.

225
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,815
Let's have our next meeting
at your studio.

226
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,110
Sure, but

227
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,405
do screenwriters usually stay
in the director's office?

228
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,662
We had a meeting earlier,
but she won't leave.

229
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,875
Maybe she doesn't have a place of her own,
or she's waiting for someone.

230
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,837
I'll get going now.

231
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,879
Take her with you.

232
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,216
Me? Take her?

233
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,427
Why should I?

234
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,847
Well, aren't you two old friends?

235
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,724
So you already know.

236
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,812
This is all getting a bit weird, isn't it?

237
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,273
With you and Ko Gyeom too.

238
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,233
Ko Gyeom told you?

239
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,985
What do you think?

240
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,155
The entire neighborhood
probably knows by now.

241
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,740
Anyway,

242
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:23,328
you're both mature and professional,
so this won't be a problem, will it?

243
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,252
What?

244
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,506
I just remembered
something Ju-a once said.

245
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:39,428
She said she'd write a script,
use my music, and let Gyeom star in it.

246
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,350
So sitting here like this
seems kind of funny, I guess.

247
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,979
Ew! Have you not seen him act?

248
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,732
You have a rather unbiased opinion
of your boyfriend.

249
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,358
You have my trust, Director.

250
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,860
I'll see you next time.

251
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,156
Don't tell Ms. Son
that Gyeom is my boyfriend.

252
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,075
It'll only complicate things.

253
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,410
Sure.

254
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,204
Well, I didn't tell her.

255
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,390
I'll send the money to your account.

256
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,479
Gyeom is whose boyfriend?

257
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,233
I'm dating your daughter, ma'am.

258
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,239
Mubee said she wasn't seeing anyone.

259
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,700
We haven't been dating for long.
It's been about two weeks.

260
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,786
She told me that this morning.

261
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,746
- Really?
- Are you sure you'll be okay?

262
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,998
My feelings for Mubee are sincere--

263
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,668
Dating her won't be easy.

264
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,923
She may look soft on the outside,
but she's a tough man on the inside.

265
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,424
Don't worry.

266
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,095
She doesn't look soft on the outside.
I mean, she does, but…

267
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,139
If you're expecting a cutesy relationship
based on her looks,

268
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,599
you won't last long.

269
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,477
I know that her looks
are the only cutesy thing about her.

270
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,728
Dating her for her looks?

271
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,274
Sadly, I'm also dating her
for the tough man she is on the inside.

272
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,360
I guess people with the oddest tastes
come by once in a while.

273
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,823
I'm sorry, but does that mean
Mubee had someone else in her life…

274
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,118
What's your weakness?

275
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,246
- Sorry?
- You're cheerful and eloquent.

276
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,332
You seem like a nice person
who's well put together.

277
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,876
But everyone has weaknesses.

278
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,383
At times, I have too much on my mind.

279
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,884
That's not a weakness.

280
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,805
But I don't know
how to resolve those thoughts.

281
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,730
Here. It's on the house.

282
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,650
Your brother used to buy it a lot.

283
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,072
I knew you would love me.

284
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,365
That was for your brother.

285
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,742
May I call you Mother?

286
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,659
Ew!

287
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,539
Mubee must take after you.
Please excuse me.

288
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,629
Good people end up falling sick.

289
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,674
Sorry?

290
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,428
Share your thoughts with others
from time to time.

291
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,765
Try saying mean and pathetic things too.

292
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,683
That can help resolve them.

293
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,644
Someone might even try to help.

294
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:36,938
Right.

295
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,158
They're not compatible at all,
so how are they even dating?

296
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:51,661
I mean, Kim Mubee isn't the type
to stand someone like Gyeom.

297
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,704
Don't you agree?

298
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,374
She's the type to ignore
Gyeom's bubbly remarks.

299
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,125
How did they get together?

300
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,549
More importantly, one is a filmmaker,
and the other is a movie critic.

301
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,886
Those two simply cannot coexist.

302
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,222
Especially not for romantic purposes.

303
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:14,309
That's like an inconceivable error.
Ko Gyeom and Kim Mubee?

304
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,894
Hey, aren't you going?

305
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,813
What? Going where?

306
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,981
- On your way.
- Where are <i>you </i>going?

307
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,942
- On <i>my </i>way.
- Aren't you going to eat?

308
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,068
Eat with you?

309
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,153
Why did you think I waited?

310
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,991
I don't think we should eat
across from each other.

311
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,704
This way, please.

312
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,791
We can eat without having to
sit across from each other.

313
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,751
Good for you.

314
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,754
I'd like one tempura udon.

315
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,214
Udon with fried tofu, please.

316
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,476
I thought you didn't like udon.

317
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,770
You always ordered rice bowls
at udon places.

318
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,105
You remember?

319
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,024
I have a good memory for no good reason.

320
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,903
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

321
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,388
You can go if you're done.
I'm going to take my time.

322
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,026
I like udon.

323
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,444
Yeah?

324
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,822
Do you know
why I used to order rice bowls?

325
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,117
I'm sensitive to hot food,
so I have to eat it slowly.

326
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,369
But you eat hot food really quickly.

327
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:02,000
I couldn't get more than a few bites,
so I ended up ordering rice bowls instead.

328
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,587
Don't be ridiculous.
What kind of stupid reason is that?

329
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,797
You hate waiting when you're done.

330
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,968
I would've waited if you'd told me.
I'm not a psycho.

331
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,064
What else did you do then…
that made me seem like a psycho?

332
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,990
Go on. This is interesting.

333
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,952
I don't like <i>Star Wars.</i>

334
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,205
I just can't relate to sci-fi movies.

335
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,207
No way.

336
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,878
We had the same taste in movies.
You and I watched it so many times.

337
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,380
It was your all-time favorite.

338
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,882
Go home and watch <i>Il Postino</i>.

339
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,927
That's my all-time favorite.
We don't have the same taste.

340
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,183
And soccer.

341
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,977
Don't say you're not an Arsenal fan.

342
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,563
I only watched soccer because of you.

343
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,149
I didn't even watch the World Cup
after we broke up.

344
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,195
Legos.

345
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:17,284
I don't get why people spend hours
sitting around building it.

346
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,787
We built Legos on our seventh anniversary.

347
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,497
And then we broke up.

348
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,169
Hey, you're making me look ridiculous.

349
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,298
You made an idiot out of me
by not mentioning stuff,

350
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,300
and now, you're saying you did it for me?

351
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,634
That was so idiotic.

352
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,511
What?

353
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,932
That was so idiotic of me.

354
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,937
That was my way of liking you.

355
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,067
I just wanted to do everything your way.

356
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,113
Back then, I loved you so much

357
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,824
that I did pathetic things
I didn't have to.

358
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,205
Weird thing to say while eating udon.

359
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,225
How did all that love disappear overnight?

360
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,732
If you did love me so much…

361
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,404
there should've been fragments
or ashes of it left behind.

362
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,117
Where did something that great go?

363
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,956
It's been years.

364
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,001
Everything is in the past,

365
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,420
both for you and me.

366
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,509
There's nothing left, is there?

367
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,918
Do you want me to say yes or no?

368
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:51,980
What now?

369
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,648
Jun wants to eat out tonight.

370
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,109
What are you saying?
I got all the groceries.

371
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,902
Plus, he doesn't like eating out.

372
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,947
Man, did you actually believe him
when he said that?

373
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,283
Jun is probably sick
of cooking all the time.

374
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,242
Hey, I cook too.

375
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:09,748
Anyway, I found a nice restaurant.
Grab what you need. Let's go.

376
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,752
Hey, why bother going out
when we only have to make the soup?

377
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:18,339
I guess every family comes with a father
who complains about eating out.

378
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,257
What?

379
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,093
Nothing, Father. Never mind.

380
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,434
Hey, Mubee!

381
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,351
Hey.

382
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,647
Why are you out alone at night?
Always stay with your pack.

383
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,899
I don't have a "pack."

384
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,692
Right, you don't have any friends.

385
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,196
I had one, but you took him from me.

386
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,408
Hey, you don't need a friend anymore.
I'll be your pack from now on, okay?

387
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,496
Am I the only one
who's finding these two gross?

388
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,916
We're going out to eat.
Do you want to come?

389
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,795
Please say no. I'm not yet ready
to face you two being together.

390
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,840
You haven't had dinner, right?
I'll let you join my pack.

391
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,593
Thank you for letting me join you.

392
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,471
- Let's go.
- Okay.

393
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,311
- Let's go.
- I had too much work.

394
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,814
- This is so weird, Jun.
- All right.

395
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,525
- I'm tired.
- Me too.

396
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,859
Wait for us!

397
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,861
- No, go on ahead.
- Oh well…

398
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,570
- Gyeom.
- Yes?

399
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:46,988
Are you busy?

400
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,907
I'm working, as you can see.

401
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,994
- Do you want to go for a drive?
- A drive?

402
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,872
The weather is great.
I want to get some fresh air.

403
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,374
- Right now?
- Let's go.

404
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,335
Which one? This one?

405
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,503
- No, this one.
- The white one?

406
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,505
Yeah.

407
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,090
- When you're ready.
- Okay.

408
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:32,951
Jun!

409
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:35,745
Nice.

410
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,000
Nice shot!

411
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,344
Let's go.

412
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,599
Is the orange juice good here?

413
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,601
- Yes, it's good.
- It is?

414
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,812
He's such an eyesore, you know.

415
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,772
I'm sick of seeing him at this point.

416
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,901
When did you start doing stand-up comedy?

417
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,724
There was a huge willow,

418
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,809
but the lake near it was all dried up.

419
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,437
The tree was so pretty though.

420
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,230
Tell people to fill up the lake.

421
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,523
<i>Please. I can't do that.</i>

422
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,527
- Wait, can I?
- Who cares? You're the director.

423
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,280
"Everyone!
I need to shoot this movie here."

424
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,365
"Go get some water and make me a lake!"

425
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,951
<i>"Drop a few ducks in it too."</i>

426
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,165
It's so hard to find the perfect location.

427
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,542
<i>It is tough.</i>

428
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,879
There's a perfect place in <i>My Girl</i>.

429
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,881
- Why don't you go there?
<i>- Where is it?</i>

430
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,884
I don't know. Pennsylvania, maybe?

431
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,848
Come to think of it, the girl
in that movie reminds me of you.

432
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,143
She must be really cute.

433
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,895
<i>No, not that.</i>

434
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,856
She has no friends
except a frail kid who's her sidekick.

435
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,858
Do you want to be my sidekick too?

436
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,906
Maybe I should've gone with you after all.

437
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:39,327
You need to look after your brother.
Did you take him to the hospital today?

438
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,703
Yes.

439
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,499
I'm so proud of you, Ko Gyeom.

440
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,961
<i>It isn't easy to care for a patient,</i>
<i>even if they're family.</i>

441
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,714
<i>But you've done it for years.</i>
<i>You're such a kind brother.</i>

442
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,843
Sometimes I knuckle him on the head
when he's asleep.

443
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,262
<i>That's a relief.</i>

444
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,433
I thought you were just a nice guy,
so I was starting to feel some distance.

445
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:06,938
<i>Nobody in this world is that nice.</i>
<i>You have to vent when things get tough.</i>

446
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,608
Right? Is there anyone like that?

447
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,861
It takes stamina to be a good person.

448
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,990
When you get too tired and annoyed,
you can take it out on me too.

449
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,575
I'll let you do that for now.

450
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,743
"For now"?

451
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:24,664
Yes, I'm going to write everything down
and make you pay for it later.

452
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,126
But for now, I'll be generous,
so you can vent all you want.

453
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,754
I feel like I'm talking to a loan shark.

454
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,925
You should go inside.
Get away from the mosquitoes.

455
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,426
<i>Call me a loyal blood donor.</i>

456
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,847
<i>I'm going inside. Drive safely.</i>

457
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,265
Bye.

458
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:00,700
Gyeom.

459
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,786
Yes? Are you feeling uncomfortable?

460
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,205
Should we go on a trip?

461
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,041
What? A trip? All of a sudden?

462
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,962
Yes, a trip abroad. Somewhere far away.

463
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,382
We could go to Europe. Or Hollywood.

464
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,719
You said you always wanted
to go to Hollywood.

465
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:23,806
We can go on a road trip to LA,
like in the movies.

466
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,266
After you recover.

467
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,768
Why? We don't have to wait.

468
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,897
Neither of us will have
as much free time then.

469
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,775
Let's go when you get better.

470
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,695
I'm totally fine right now. Look.

471
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,323
Actually,

472
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,869
I looked up some stuff earlier today.

473
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,581
There are some good deals
on flights next month.

474
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:50,875
What's going on?

475
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,211
What? What do you mean?

476
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,463
You've been acting weird lately.

477
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,676
Have I?

478
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,513
Why are there suddenly
so many things you want to do?

479
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:08,351
You keep inviting people over,
saying you miss them,

480
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,269
and wanting to go places.

481
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,774
You never used to want
anything for yourself.

482
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,238
Why are you acting
like you're going somewhere soon?

483
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,198
It's making me anxious.

484
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,662
It's because I never did those things,
so I want to try them now.

485
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,789
I know. So let's do them.

486
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,708
But not all at once,
like cramming your homework.

487
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,127
We'll take our sweet time.

488
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,362
Have some tea and go to sleep.
You must be tired.

489
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,034
Is it too much to ask?

490
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,204
What?

491
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,957
I wanted to be prepared, just in case.

492
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,128
Can't you just…

493
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,923
turn a blind eye and humor me?

494
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,341
"Just in case"?

495
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,303
Just in case of what?

496
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,138
You know,

497
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,223
just in case.

498
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,149
How far does this "just in case" go?

499
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,320
To your death?

500
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,992
Mine doesn't go that far ahead.

501
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,957
You need to think that far ahead.

502
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,172
No one can prepare you for death.

503
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,633
If it happens suddenly,

504
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,637
those who are left behind
must deal with it.

505
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,435
Gyeom, so don't just try to avoid it…

506
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,941
Were you preparing me ahead of time?

507
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,613
You don't care about doing these things
before you die.

508
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,491
You're just worried
that I'll suffer after you're gone.

509
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,621
I'm so sick and tired of this.

510
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,998
Gyeom.

511
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,333
Let me stick to one thing.

512
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:41,962
I've been suffering enough trying
to keep you alive for all these years.

513
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,717
But now you want me
to help you die in peace as well?

514
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,223
I'm sorry.

515
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,769
I should've thought about your pain--

516
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,271
You being like that
is even more suffocating.

517
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,400
You're apologizing to me
in this situation?

518
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,319
Just say that I made you suffer.

519
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,988
That I ruined everything for--

520
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:20,709
Just say it.

521
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,381
It'll leave a scar.
Place your hand in cold water now.

522
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,508
Jun.

523
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,929
I really didn't want to ask you this.

524
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,105
Have you ever wanted to die?

525
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,444
What are you talking about?

526
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,529
Or should I put it this way?

527
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,121
Have you ever wanted to live?

528
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,976
I want to live.

529
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,854
I'm doing this now because I want to.

530
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,652
Do you even have the right to say that?

531
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:44,752
Gyeom.

532
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,505
From now on,

533
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,591
do whatever you want.

534
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,427
You want to leave quietly?

535
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,679
Go ahead.

536
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,473
You want to die?

537
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,099
Go ahead.

538
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,353
But I'll keep trying to keep you alive.

539
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,522
Because…

540
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,984
Because I can't go on without you.

541
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,992
If you die, you'll be leaving me behind.

542
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,120
You'll abandon me
and make me an orphan again.

543
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,624
What you said about protecting me
will be a lie.

544
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,838
So go ahead and do whatever you want.

545
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,643
Ko Gyeom?

546
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,480
Kim Mubee, did you have a good trip?

547
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,691
Gyeom, is this everything for Jun?

548
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:57,069
Yes, we're keeping it simple
since he'll be discharged soon.

549
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:00,489
He asked me to pack the books
on his desk as well.

550
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,657
Okay.

551
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,661
Wait, that one's mine.

552
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:08,580
This one? Isn't this Jun's?
I saw him with it before.

553
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,957
No, it's mine.

554
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,668
No wonder I couldn't find it.

555
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,504
Okay. I'll load these in the car.
Come out when you're ready.

556
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,422
Okay.

557
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:44,575
<i>I thought I had no such thing</i>
<i>as a will of my own.</i>

558
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,795
Jun!

559
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,260
Jun!

560
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,178
<i>But, Gyeom,</i>

561
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:09,308
<i>you used to call out to me</i>
<i>when you were crying…</i>

562
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:15,606
<i>…as if it had always been</i>
<i>the two of us against the world.</i>

563
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,483
Gyeom.

564
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,450
<i>I think that was the day.</i>

565
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:32,456
<i>For the first time ever,</i>
<i>I had something called a will of my own.</i>

566
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,883
<i>And I chose you, Gyeom.</i>

567
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,237
- Jun.
- Yes?

568
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,239
I'll buy you a drink. What do you say?

569
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,491
Well,

570
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,660
I appreciate the offer--

571
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:13,080
Again? Why don't you have a life
other than looking after your brother?

572
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,749
What a waste of your youth.

573
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,418
It's a big waste.
You're too responsible, kid.

574
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,472
<i>The responsibility</i>
<i>would weigh on me at times.</i>

575
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,626
<i>But I never regretted it once.</i>

576
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:19,938
Jun.

577
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,100
Gyeom.

578
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:40,519
<i>You were the only thing</i>
<i>that kept me going.</i>

579
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,405
Jun, look. A cat and mouse that can talk.

580
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,004
Okay. Ready?

581
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,381
Look ahead. Push down on the pedals.

582
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,633
Look straight ahead. Here we go.

583
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:13,719
Pedal.

584
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,138
Push! Keep the pedals going! Go!

585
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,726
You did it. Gyeom, you did it!

586
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,396
<i>You gave me many surprising moments…</i>

587
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,442
Excuse me.

588
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,278
That's my brother.

589
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:33,780
My brother.

590
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:34,948
Thank you.

591
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,207
<i>…and many moments of happiness.</i>

592
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,799
- He's a wuss.
- Even I could beat him.

593
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:53,717
Hey.

594
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,139
Which one of you called Ko Gyeom
an orphan bastard?

595
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:00,849
Raise your hand.

596
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,685
<i>I often got angry without you knowing.</i>

597
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,777
Why are you crying?

598
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,656
Seriously?

599
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,621
Up there, on the left side.

600
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,498
- Where?
- Over there.

601
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,461
You should paint each spot properly
before you move on.

602
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,297
I'm fine.

603
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,800
Hey. Eat this and hang in there.

604
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:38,553
<i>There were a lot of things</i>
<i>that I liked and wanted to do.</i>

605
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,813
<i>And I did have a friend</i>
<i>who I clicked with very well.</i>

606
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,865
<i>Gyeom.</i>

607
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:03,703
<i>Sometimes my life made me</i>
<i>feel like I was in water.</i>

608
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:08,792
<i>I was unable to tell</i>
<i>if I was sinking or floating.</i>

609
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,002
<i>I was just at a loss.</i>

610
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,799
<i>And the foolish mistake I made back then…</i>

611
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,762
<i>was the one thing</i>
<i>I wanted to hide from you.</i>

612
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,902
<i>There's only one reason</i>
<i>I open my eyes every morning.</i>

613
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,866
<i>I really do…</i>

614
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,162
<i>want to live again now, Gyeom.</i>

615
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:27,829
MELO MOVIE

616
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,247
He's taking the photo now!

617
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,334
I want to take it with Jun too.

618
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,086
Hey, what are you doing? There's no space.

619
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,838
- Take her away.
- Just a second.

620
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,757
- Jun, smile!
- Why are you standing there?

621
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,508
- What are you doing?
- I want in!

622
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,053
Stand closer to each other, please.

623
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,971
- Put your arm around him.
- Okay.

624
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,057
Yes, that looks good.

625
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,059
- On the count of three.
- Okay.

626
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,644
One, two, three.

627
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,197
<i>Jun…</i>
