1
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,517
I've had only one dream since I was a kid.

2
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:40,081
KO GYEOM, AGE NINE

3
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,625
To watch every single movie ever made.

4
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,091
JURASSIC PARK

5
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,388
NEW RELEASES

6
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,767
And I was in the perfect environment
to make that dream come true.

7
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,196
Hey!

8
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,324
Did you watch the others?

9
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:15,825
Yeah.

10
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,412
Don't you get bored
watching movies by yourself all day?

11
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,581
I love it.

12
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,840
Sir?

13
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,760
Sir!

14
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,099
-This, please.
-For God's sake.

15
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,976
You didn't have to wake me.
Let him watch it!

16
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,770
Good grief.

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,064
-Off to work?
-Yes.

18
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,363
Here's the rent for this month.

19
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,365
I'm sorry it's late.

20
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,952
Man, don't work too hard.
You look exhausted.

21
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,371
-Take care of yourself.
-Okay.

22
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,789
Don't worry about him.

23
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,583
I've never known a kid
to have so much fun alone.

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,796
Because living in a video rental store

25
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,215
was like living in paradise for me.

26
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,469
Gyeom, I'm off.

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,979
And it was all I needed.

28
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,985
Gyeom!

29
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,237
Stick to the green stickers, remember?

30
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,073
You haven't even hit puberty yet.

31
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,831
Goodness. What time is it now?

32
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:59,762
And not long after…
I got to watch everything I wanted to.

33
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,812
-What are you doing?
-Oh my God!

34
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,482
Oh, I was just helping out.

35
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,612
This one's been rented out, but the case
wasn't put upside down to let people know.

36
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,323
Hey, what's that?

37
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,287
Didn't you say it was empty?
Don't even think about it, young man.

38
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,665
-See you.
-Bye.

39
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,793
And cut back on the videos.
Your eyeballs might pop out.

40
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,837
-Bye.
-One more thing.

41
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,173
I'd watch the one next to it.

42
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,217
Take care, boss!

43
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,976
But around that time,
I had a new kind of concern come up.

44
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,230
Starting today, I refuse to talk
to anyone who hasn't watched this.

45
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,482
What's that? A good skin flick?

46
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,485
Don't you know Tarantino?

47
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,112
Just watch the first five minutes.
You'll see.

48
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,656
The dude made a sick movie.

49
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,368
Why are you always here watching videos?
Are you gonna run a rental store?

50
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,411
Worry about yourself, Si-jun.

51
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,790
He'll likely make something
out of watching this many movies.

52
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,376
Worry about what?
A genius never worries about himself.

53
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,670
-So you're a genius now?
-For sure.

54
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,755
-So I don't have to worry?
-That's right.

55
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,676
-No, you should worry.
-I love and respect movies so much.

56
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,511
If I became a rental store owner,

57
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,847
it'd be a loss to the movie industry.

58
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,601
That was the beginning
of my great contemplation.

59
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,355
I probably should do something
with this, right?

60
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,190
That's right.

61
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,193
Think about the 10,000-hour rule.

62
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,864
You spent this much time watching movies,
so you'd better make it worth your while.

63
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,659
Okay.

64
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:48,204
I'm going to think hard about my future.
Don't try to stop me.

65
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,042
-Hey, I'll play this now.
-Yeah.

66
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,139
That day, I began contemplating
as the opening sequence began to play.

67
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,644
And I had my answer by the time
the end credits started rolling.

68
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,648
Yes, that's what I'll do.

69
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,110
Guys, look at me.

70
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,531
Isn't it obvious how I should contribute
to the movie industry?

71
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,370
That's a tough one, Gyeom. I wonder how?

72
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,458
He's got a weird look on his face.
It's obnoxious.

73
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,381
Bang!

74
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,424
And so,

75
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,136
that's the reason I'm here.

76
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,096
KO GYEOM, AGE TWENTY-SIX

77
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,601
I had to… become… an actor.

78
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,562
WEALTH AND PROSPERITY
OPEN AUDITION

79
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,939
Well, sure. I love this kind of stuff.

80
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,152
Yeah, he came with a story.
So what was my question again?

81
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,154
You haven't asked anything yet.

82
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,822
Right? Right.

83
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:09,118
So you're 26 years old.
Did you start after finishing college?

84
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,330
Oh, no. I'm a high school graduate.
I never graduated from college.

85
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,331
Doing what?

86
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,583
I had to make money.

87
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,253
Sang-sik was closing his video store,
so I needed some money.

88
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,505
You bought his store?

89
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,590
No, I bought his videotapes.

90
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,009
You're an interesting kid.

91
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,805
I bought your movies
in a five-pack bundle for 20,000 won.

92
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,518
I like that. I really do.

93
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,687
I like nutcases who show up
out of nowhere, don't I?

94
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,148
These kinds of guys tend to be geniuses.

95
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,277
You've played many small parts.
Are you any good?

96
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,695
I'm not so bad.

97
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,448
Okay. Show me whatever you have.
I'm ready.

98
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,369
One moment.
Let me just get into character.

99
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,689
That was it.

100
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,775
What?

101
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,361
Should I leave?

102
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,281
What?

103
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,950
Yeah, sure. Get up.

104
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,996
You will let me know, won't you?

105
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:35,913
Sure.

106
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,248
Thank you for your time.

107
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,833
Yes, go on now.

108
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,553
You know when you get that gut feeling?

109
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,227
That day, I got that gut feeling…

110
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,822
Mubee, you're here.

111
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,666
…when I heard that name.

112
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,216
I've had only one wish since I was a kid.

113
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,801
Who's Kim Mubee?

114
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:13,803
KIM MUBEE, AGE NINE

115
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,888
I wanted to change my stupid name.

116
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,643
Is it you?

117
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,354
This won't do. Where are your parents?

118
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,855
I'll have to talk to them.

119
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,774
-I don't have any.
-What?

120
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,151
You don't have any parents?

121
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,736
They passed away.

122
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,447
What… Really?

123
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,074
Both of them?

124
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,367
Yes.

125
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,451
Oh God.

126
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,246
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,205
Who are you?

128
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,291
I'm her dad.

129
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,210
He's my stepdad.

130
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,045
Her biological dad.

131
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,258
I'm so sorry.
She's a bit different, you see.

132
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,262
Because this name wasn't meant for me.

133
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,724
Sweetie, you can't ignore me forever.

134
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,933
ON-SET FILMING VEHICLE

135
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,436
This time, I'll be off for a while.

136
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,189
Where should we go?
The amusement park we talked about?

137
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:18,951
Yes, Director.

138
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,953
No, it's okay.

139
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,371
Yes.

140
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,792
Yes, I'll go.

141
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,878
Okay. Bye.

142
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,176
Mubee.

143
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,553
When I'm done with this movie,

144
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,556
I promise I'll hang out with you
every single day.

145
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,226
After this movie,
there will be another movie.

146
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,897
And after that,
you'll have another one waiting.

147
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,150
Movies are all you care about.

148
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,654
Not true.

149
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,490
I'm going to make my own movies now.

150
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:02,495
I'll be able to use my time however I like
and spend a lot more time with you.

151
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,791
I mean it, okay?

152
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,384
I always had to compete with my own name.

153
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,976
And the way I chose
to win that competition…

154
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,771
Hey, did you guys bully him?

155
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,356
Yeah. So what?

156
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,150
-Hey, run.
-Get back here!

157
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,151
It's Kim Mubee!

158
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,736
…was rather simple.

159
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,199
TEACHERS' OFFICE

160
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:52,503
Let's call it the childish rebellion
of a kid desperate for attention.

161
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:01,971
Mubee, why do you always lie
about your dad being dead?

162
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,474
It's not a lie.
He's pretty much as good as dead.

163
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,896
Back then, I had no idea…

164
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,579
DAD

165
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,127
…that this ambivalent feeling
would go on for quite a while.

166
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,255
Plus,

167
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,133
I never actually wanted it to happen.

168
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,472
-I'm sorry for your loss.
-My condolences.

169
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,279
I'm Kim Sang-guk from Geona Media.

170
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,408
If there's anything you wish to share…

171
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:10,873
I used to think I'd win
this childish competition someday.

172
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,230
Maybe I wasn't even eligible
to compete in the first place.

173
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,621
FOUR-LEAF CLOVER
KIM HUN-DONG

174
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,503
That's when I faced it for the first time.

175
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,594
Daddy.

176
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,930
Daddy!

177
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,058
I faced what I had been
competing against all along.

178
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,522
The movie I watched that day…

179
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:25,614
was the most boring movie
I had ever seen in my entire life.

180
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,413
And so that's the reason I'm here.

181
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:39,670
KIM MUBEE, AGE TWENTY-SIX

182
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,171
Hello?

183
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,217
Yes, I have them. I'm on my way. Okay.

184
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,972
I'm not here to make a movie
dedicated to him,

185
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,558
take revenge for him, or anything.

186
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,101
Nothing that ambitious.

187
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:05,070
I wanted to show him how pathetic it was
to devote his life to a terrible movie.

188
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,169
Mubee, you're here.

189
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,360
What a pretty name.

190
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:02,252
MELO MOVIE

191
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:09,802
IT WILL BECOME SCENIC WHEN DAWN COMES

192
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,814
Mr. Part-timer, sir?

193
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:26,652
Could you please
move a little quicker than that?

194
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,488
At this rate, we'll never open the store!

195
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,657
No one will be coming in anytime soon.

196
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,034
You little punk. Don't you dare jinx it.

197
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:34,952
Hey.

198
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,414
What if a customer walks in right now?

199
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,625
If someone walks in right this instant--

200
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,213
You're not open yet, are you?

201
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,590
Good grief. You again?

202
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,635
You should eat dinner first.
I brought food from my place.

203
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,888
Goodness. Your mother packed us
a bunch of food again.

204
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,224
Please thank her for me.

205
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,142
I will.

206
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,854
Oh my. Look at this.

207
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,649
Is it still pretty slow here?

208
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,317
Yeah, no one comes.

209
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,405
Get rid of those old tapes.
They make this place look outdated.

210
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,573
Outdated?

211
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,952
You punk. The only outdated thing here
is your awful mindset.

212
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,163
-You mean those?
-They have their use.

213
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,042
Take your time.

214
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,795
These are side dishes.
I'll leave them in your studio later.

215
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,005
Okay.

216
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,759
Look at you, biting and chewing
like an annoying little brat.

217
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,843
Hey, Ju-a.

218
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,180
You're clearly spoiling him way too much.

219
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,265
Are you dating a man or raising a kid?

220
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,268
-See, there you go.
-Careful!

221
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:45,856
Why did you move out
if you were going to starve like this?

222
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,901
What a messed-up way to waste your youth.

223
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,779
Hongsi is going to pursue music
seriously now.

224
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,030
You should support him.

225
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,783
Dropping out of a good university
to pursue music?

226
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,451
Count your blessings, punk.

227
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,870
You should get his autograph now.

228
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,456
Hongsi is gonna become
a super famous songwriter.

229
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,291
He's been working so hard.

230
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:08,003
Not that hard.
I'm taking it easy, going with the flow.

231
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,423
As you can see,
I'm more talent than effort.

232
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,344
God, you're so smug.
I could just shoot you dead now.

233
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,512
Ju-a.

234
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,348
Stop following around a loser like him.

235
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,643
You should at least
be living a decent life.

236
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,896
Get a decent job,
then call it quits with this loser.

237
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,106
Seriously!

238
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,442
Like I told you,
I only plan to work here briefly.

239
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,069
Very briefly.

240
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,656
Stop calling me a loser. You're no better.

241
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:42,287
Actually, I was thinking about going after
something I really want, like Si-jun.

242
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:47,126
Good grief. This damn loser has ruined
yet another perfectly normal kid.

243
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,629
Anyhow,

244
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:55,425
where did the last member
of the three nutty friends run off to?

245
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:17,573
As everyone had expected,
I became an actor.

246
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,170
Enemies are never obvious.

247
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:35,591
You can never tell
whether someone is friend or foe.

248
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,594
I knew I'd get stabbed in the back.

249
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,560
-What's he doing?
-I've been waiting for it all along.

250
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,443
What's he doing? Director?

251
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,360
Cut!

252
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,155
Hey! Ko Gyeom!

253
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,370
-Pull him out.
-I was so getting into it.

254
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,997
Of course

255
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,459
I've yet to find the perfect role for me.

256
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,921
Are you kidding me? Where is the AD?

257
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,255
Damn it.

258
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,138
I was just standing there that time.

259
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,767
If you were just standing there,
how did you ruin the scene?

260
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,810
What's with your eyes?

261
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,562
That's just how my eyes are.

262
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,941
Yes, why do they look so irritating?
Just stay out of the shot.

263
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,194
Eh? I'm an actor. I should be in the shot.

264
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,155
"Eh"? You'll stay out of the shot
because I told you so.

265
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,407
Give me the storyboard.

266
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,912
But to be honest,

267
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,665
just being on set is good enough for me.

268
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,541
Go away!

269
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,255
After all, it makes me feel like
I'm in a movie.

270
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,678
We're done with Ji-hyung.
Please focus on Du-yeop.

271
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,680
Right. Like this? Yes, I got it.

272
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,681
Thanks.

273
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,936
And it was here

274
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,022
that I discovered a new movie.

275
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,459
Excuse me, sir.

276
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,796
You could start off with the full shot,
go back and forth with the waist shot--

277
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,797
Not you again.

278
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,343
Why do you… have this in the first place?

279
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,845
Are you the director?

280
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,680
I just thought it was great.

281
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:50,267
Of course it's great.
Stop lurking around and go!

282
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,352
-Yes, sir.
-He's just saying that.

283
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,480
Damn it!

284
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,568
Who set this up? You're quite slim.

285
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,157
-Is this the place?
-Yes, right here.

286
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,576
Hey, we have to do this in one take, okay?

287
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,495
-Make sure you rehearse everything.
-Sure.

288
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,755
She might not realize this,

289
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,008
but she's the type that really stands out.

290
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,648
She always dresses in black
like she's a shadow.

291
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,110
-Cut!
-But her eyes sparkle so brightly.

292
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,739
I have it here. I'll do it out now.

293
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,748
Their hair can't be too short.

294
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,584
She seems like
a quiet and attentive person…

295
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,547
Are you all right?

296
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,051
…but she can be quite confident.

297
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,638
-Crap.
-This is for you.

298
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,723
The set is ready.

299
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,060
They're waiting for you.

300
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,359
Director, you're the best!

301
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,194
You're amazing!

302
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,739
Enjoy your food.

303
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,741
Thank you. You too!

304
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,430
One more thing.

305
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,766
For some reason,

306
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,853
she just piques my curiosity.

307
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:12,117
Usually, when a person
becomes curious about someone…

308
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,996
This is what happens in melo movies.

309
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,472
Lately, I've had another wish.

310
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,936
All the other seats are taken.

311
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,732
It's for this guy
to stop taking an interest in me.

312
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,568
I mean, why do you always eat alone?

313
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,945
Yes.

314
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,408
But I asked you why.
"Yes" doesn't make any sense.

315
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,285
Your name is Kim Mubee, right?

316
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,204
Wow, what a coincidence.

317
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,956
He'd suddenly show up like this…

318
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,043
I mean, I'm a huge movie fan.

319
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,212
But your name sounds like "movie."

320
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,464
I never thought
I'd meet an even bigger fan.

321
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,634
In case you don't know,
you don't get to choose your own name.

322
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,427
You're right.

323
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,847
…and go on about things
I didn't even ask about.

324
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:16,765
There you are.

325
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,682
Yes, please sit.

326
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,685
Gyeom, you must be hungry
after all that action.

327
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,270
-Enjoy.
-Sure.

328
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,731
There's one thing
I really don't like about him.

329
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,108
Please let the actor through!

330
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,193
It's Kang Hun!

331
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,533
Hey, looking great!
Have you been working out?

332
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,534
Do I look good?

333
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,663
You can stop bulking up.
You look perfect now.

334
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,463
Are those the same outfits?
Different brands, maybe?

335
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,799
I just put on whatever they gave me.

336
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,802
No wonder they say
the face completes fashion.

337
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,178
Sir?

338
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,807
Right. Gyeom, when we start filming…

339
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,018
It's that he stands out too much.

340
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,436
All good? Let's go.

341
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,898
And he's such a busybody too.

342
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,067
Do you even know about Stephen Chow?

343
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,318
How could I not?

344
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,070
-What's his best movie?
-King of Comedy.

345
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,364
Hey, that's my favorite too.

346
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,117
I know. You paid homage to it
in your movie Wave Wave.

347
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,244
The scene
where the character teaches acting.

348
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,789
You noticed that?

349
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,628
Sure!

350
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,843
He was always surrounded by people.

351
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,971
They call him Cinderella, you know.

352
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,180
Why?

353
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,641
When he auditioned,
he got an immediate no.

354
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:45,312
But do you remember
the director's limited-edition shoes?

355
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,646
-The white ones?
-Yes.

356
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,897
He put those on and left!

357
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,649
What? So what happened?

358
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,987
He seemed to be so popular
that everyone was talking about him,

359
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,739
even when he wasn't there.

360
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,908
Then he didn't leave the studio
and eventually landed a role.

361
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,828
So why don't I like that about him?

362
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,164
These are…

363
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,666
Where do I take this? To the set?

364
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,667
Actually…

365
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:14,174
He's such a nuisance to someone
who wants to live a quiet life.

366
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,054
Excuse me.

367
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,390
It's all right. It wasn't even heavy.

368
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,059
Can you not talk to me?

369
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,560
Why not?

370
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,190
I have personality issues, so I hate it
when people try to make friends with me.

371
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,735
Not everyone is a whelp
with golden retriever energy like you.

372
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,528
So bear with me. Bye.

373
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,908
Thanks for helping with that,
but you don't need to from now on.

374
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,825
Okay?

375
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,674
"Whelp"?

376
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,592
What should I order? Pizza?

377
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,552
Hey, what's a whelp?

378
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,262
A whelp?

379
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,100
Whelp…

380
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,185
Whelp.

381
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,354
DICTIONARY
WHELP

382
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,106
"A puppy that eats poop."

383
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,233
"A puppy that eats poop"?

384
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,150
Yeah.

385
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,777
I knew it.

386
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,863
People wouldn't use that word
unless they were interested.

387
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,951
Is it like some kind of pet name?

388
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,911
I didn't know Gyeom was here too.

389
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,496
Hey.

390
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,669
Ta-da.

391
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,296
-Guess what this is.
-What?

392
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,756
Whelp…

393
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,511
I signed up for this.

394
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,639
A screenwriting contest.

395
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,142
Screenwriting? You?

396
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,145
Yes, I want to give it a real shot now.

397
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,691
-Watching you sparked some things in me.
-Really?

398
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,193
Let's motivate each other.
What do you say?

399
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:02,240
Your songs will inspire my writing,
and my writing will inspire you.

400
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,828
I'll let you play a part from my script.

401
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,455
I guess you haven't seen him act.

402
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,332
-Is he bad?
-Like a bad accident.

403
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,711
Thanks, but I'll have to
review the script first.

404
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,302
What? You aren't staying for pizza?

405
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,262
Today's that day. It's movie day.

406
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,514
Watching a movie with your brother again?

407
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,893
Why do you always
follow him around like a whelp?

408
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,936
You just called me a whelp.

409
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,940
I guess it is a pet name, then.

410
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,402
Oh man.

411
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,029
What is he going on about?

412
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,864
-What about a whelp?
-No idea.

413
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,074
How does pepperoni pizza sound?

414
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,619
-Pepperoni again?
-This is bad.

415
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,370
It's the best one. Trust me.

416
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,706
Is there anything else?
Let me see the menu.

417
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,957
Hey, guys?

418
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,376
Pepperoni looks the most delicious.
What do you say?

419
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,212
I have a crush on someone.

420
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,678
-We had that last time.
-This one's the best.

421
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,848
-I've tried them all with Gyeom.
-Without me?

422
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,310
All right. Thanks for your support.
I'll do my best.

423
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,146
You can't go wrong with the classics.

424
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:26,616
SAMGEORI MEATS

425
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,955
I'm back.

426
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,294
I'm glad I take after you
personality-wise.

427
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,589
Life would've been so tiring
if I was like Dad.

428
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,425
What's this?
You never bring up your dad first.

429
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,013
It's just that I met someone
who's as tiring as Dad was.

430
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,563
It might've been a tiring life,
but it was a decent one.

431
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,147
When you were with Dad?

432
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,818
Still, it's a relief
that you take after me.

433
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,989
If you were like Dad,
it would've been a pain in the neck.

434
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,054
-What's up?
-Hey.

435
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,890
What's on for today?

436
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,476
We talked about Stephen Chow last time.
How about one of his movies?

437
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,480
You're the expert.
I'll follow your guidance.

438
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,993
Here's to another great day.

439
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,170
Wait, I didn't catch that.

440
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,178
Are you telling me

441
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,681
you're foolish enough to fall for her
just because of her name?

442
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,433
Of course not!

443
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,311
I started liking her name
because I fell for her first.

444
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,812
Why did you fall for her?

445
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,649
I just discovered her.

446
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,526
Hey.

447
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,656
This is just like that time
you got excited about discovering a tape.

448
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,242
No. This time, I feel even better.

449
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,413
What's your plan now?
She told you not to talk to her.

450
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,040
Please, bro!

451
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,709
Do you know
how many melo movies I've seen?

452
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,003
-What?
-Come on!

453
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,822
Did you just try to trip me up?

454
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,449
At least I didn't chat you up.

455
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,870
So you're finally being killed off.

456
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,540
-Do you have any plans after work?
-I'm busy.

457
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,126
I see. I'm busy too.
I need to memorize my lines.

458
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,335
You have no lines.

459
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,299
How did you know that?
Perhaps you are interested in me?

460
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,934
Looks delicious.

461
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,269
Enjoy your meal.

462
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,354
-Yesterday was a bit colder.
-Sit here.

463
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,234
Nice, there's bulgogi.

464
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,126
You were stabbed to death yesterday.
Why are you still here?

465
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,337
Maybe I was resurrected?

466
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,342
Stop talking nonsense.
And what's with the facial hair?

467
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,428
It turns out
I actually had a twin brother.

468
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,513
More nonsense.

469
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,933
What? I mean it.
You know the director needs me.

470
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,355
It was you?

471
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,150
How dare you use my facial hair?

472
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,529
-I haven't finished--
-Follow me.

473
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,780
Put this away for me.

474
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,272
I was going to offer you a ride
since it's pretty late,

475
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,357
but that backpack looked heavy, so…

476
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,568
I live nearby.

477
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,319
It's dangerous at this hour.

478
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,621
Do you always come this prepared
just so you can avoid asking for help?

479
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:09,709
Yes, so stop glancing around to see
if you can help me with anything.

480
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,049
I'll let you know when I really need help.

481
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:17,967
Happy now?

482
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,475
Stop following me,
or I'll pull out what's in my pocket.

483
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,815
But at times…

484
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:38,446
Now, it is time for the lady of the hour
and the most beautiful bride in the world.

485
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,323
Please enter!

486
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,177
…the weirdest coincidences
can actually happen in life.

487
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:47,807
Friends of the bride and groom,
please come up for a group photo.

488
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:55,231
I swear it's a coincidence.
Can't you see how surprised I am?

489
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,732
Ma'am, please go up a step.

490
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,150
I didn't say anything.

491
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,278
What brings you here?

492
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,613
I do wedding video gigs from time to time.

493
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,448
Are you here for a friend?

494
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,368
The groom's friend for ten years
since high school.

495
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,413
That's the role I'm playing
for my gig today.

496
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,042
The bride and groom are very lucky.

497
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,544
-How so?
-One, two, three.

498
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,546
If you become a famous filmmaker,

499
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,632
they'll be happy
that you shot their wedding video.

500
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,803
Did I say I wanted to become a filmmaker?

501
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,640
You are going to make a movie, aren't you?

502
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,477
I really want to know
what your movie will be like.

503
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,604
When are you gonna start?

504
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,066
Hey, it's uncanny that we met here.

505
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,820
How about we do wedding gigs as a team?
I can host. You can shoot videos.

506
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,572
No.

507
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,955
A coincidence that made me think
that we might be bound by some fate.

508
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,833
Get on the bus, everybody.

509
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,501
Hi.

510
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,338
-Why did you get on this bus?
-Yeah, whatever.

511
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,672
Why are you on this bus?

512
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,674
The other bus is full. Can I join you?

513
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:07,094
Sure, you can.
But does he have a scene today?

514
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,139
Nothing wrong
with tagging along and hanging out.

515
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,390
Let me come along.

516
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,859
Over here, Gyeom. You can sit here.

517
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:28,240
-You don't have any scenes today, do you?
-No, I don't.

518
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,577
-Then you can help us out today.
-Sure.

519
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,458
Wait. Was I just disappointed?

520
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,873
Hey, you don't wanna do that.

521
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,583
You sound like a gangster.

522
00:40:58,747 --> 00:40:59,957
FARM-FRESH WAXY CORN

523
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,500
-Hello.
-Hi.

524
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,296
I'll take 20,000 won's worth of corn.

525
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,631
-I'll pay you first.
-Sure.

526
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,549
-Here.
-Okay.

527
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,553
Thank you.

528
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,390
Here. Enjoy it while it's hot.

529
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,642
Okay. Good luck with the sales.

530
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,068
That's my bus!

531
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,321
Hey!

532
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,575
Stop!

533
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,337
Wait for me! Please…

534
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,301
You too?

535
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:16,283
I've heard the buses stop early
at places like this.

536
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,826
There's one in 30 minutes.

537
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,204
Exactly. The world's become
way too convenient.

538
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,372
Damn it!

539
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,219
I have a question.
Have you always been this twisted?

540
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,681
Have you always put on a jolly face?

541
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,183
The world is more than what you see.

542
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,851
It's definitely more than movies.

543
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,813
You won't let a single comment go.
Are you a good fighter?

544
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,814
Yes, I am.

545
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,149
I surrender.

546
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,167
What kind of movie are you going to make?

547
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,386
An awesome…

548
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,558
melo movie.

549
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,479
Melo?

550
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,156
Did you laugh at me?

551
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:40,117
No, I choked on my food. Laugh at you? Me?

552
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,660
I would never.

553
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:46,457
What about you?
Are you really going to keep acting?

554
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,878
I'm well aware that I must keep acting

555
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,756
so the industry doesn't miss out
on a great talent.

556
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:58,969
But…

557
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,975
I like movies, that's all.

558
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:09,980
What?

559
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,775
I simply like movies!

560
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,818
Movies, as in films.

561
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:18,614
It wasn't some tacky pickup line
to say that I like you or--

562
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,032
I didn't say anything.

563
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,951
Then what's with the look?

564
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,413
You just…

565
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,709
reminded me of someone
who said the same thing.

566
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,989
There are other seats.

567
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,117
Sitting alone can get scary, you know.

568
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,952
I'm talking about myself.

569
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,788
Well, sure.

570
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,249
I'm going to get some sleep.

571
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,441
DAD

572
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,235
Yeah, what?

573
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,581
Were you dreaming?

574
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,292
No.

575
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,335
You were crying.

576
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,507
It's hot in here. I guess I was sweating.

577
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,093
You held my hand.

578
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,472
Oh, I… I'm sorry.

579
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:08,640
It was a mistake.

580
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:15,939
All right, then.

581
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,843
FILMING WEALTH AND PROSPERITY
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION

582
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:49,306
Sir, Mr. Kim from Geona Media will stop by
for a short interview later.

583
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,975
It's your first movie in a long while,

584
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,102
and today is our last day on set.

585
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,146
An interview on set? What a bother.

586
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:03,028
I always feel sad on the last day
and during the wrap party.

587
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,739
Even the word is depressing.

588
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,075
"Wrap" means it's all over.

589
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,119
It makes me worry
that my career's a wrap too.

590
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,996
Gyeom, what do you think?

591
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:14,998
One moment.

592
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,214
-Get ready. Let's begin shooting.
-Yes, sir.

593
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,677
Excuse me. It's you, right?

594
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:28,887
Who are you?

595
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,850
I'm Kim Sang-guk from Geona Media.
Don't you remember me?

596
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,936
You're Mr. Kim Hun-dong's daughter.

597
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,815
You were in high school back then,
so I wasn't really sure.

598
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,192
But seeing you up close,
you haven't changed.

599
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:46,488
Anyway, do you work here on set?

600
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:51,159
Are you here to live out
your father's unfulfilled dream?

601
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,913
That's very admirable.

602
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,456
It's nothing like that.

603
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,792
What was your name again?

604
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,502
It was really unique.

605
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,462
That's right. Mubee!

606
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,632
When I first saw your name, I thought,

607
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,385
"Mr. Kim really devoted his life
to the art of film."

608
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,303
Wait a second.

609
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,346
So the daughter

610
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,350
of a man who met a wrongful death
walks in his shoes to pursue his dream.

611
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,436
Okay, that's a nice story.

612
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,815
It's nothing like that,
so please stop making up stories.

613
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,657
I wouldn't put it that way!

614
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,659
Anyway, I got your point.

615
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,329
It was nice to see you. See you around.

616
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:40,667
Let's go.

617
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,327
Hey, I'm clocking out after this.

618
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,204
Goodness. Of course you are.

619
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,248
Would you believe that there's a bar owner

620
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,834
who lets his part-timer clock out
before 8:00?

621
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,795
Yeah, he's right here.

622
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:29,341
But it's only for today, okay?
What did you say today was?

623
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,343
-Our seven-year anniversary.
-Exactly!

624
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:34,888
That's why I'm letting you go.
Why are you in such a rush anyway?

625
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,140
I have to buy something
before the stores close.

626
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,309
-Hurry.
-Okay, time to go.

627
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,061
-Come on, quickly!
-Okay!

628
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,232
-I'm leaving, okay?
-Yeah.

629
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,192
-Don't forget to lock up, boss.
-Okay.

630
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:50,612
That damn loser only calls me boss
in times like these.

631
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,078
Yeah, I'm on my way.

632
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,541
I'll see you at the studio. Okay.

633
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,259
All right.

634
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,971
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

635
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,350
Great job, everyone!

636
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,688
Wrap parties make me…

637
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,941
so sad!

638
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,696
Sir, your nose is running.

639
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:40,203
Gyeom, I need your honest opinion.

640
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:44,666
How was my work this time?
I know you've got a keen eye.

641
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,753
My honest opinion will hurt you again.

642
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,921
Are you saying it was bad?

643
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,465
No, that's not…

644
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,799
You've hurt me already.

645
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:54,801
Seong-tae!

646
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,471
Sir, it's all right!

647
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:01,975
Stop crying over that kind of stuff!

648
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,561
Movies can flop. No big deal.

649
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,480
You fucking jerk!

650
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,383
I thought you'd be the first
to run from these parties.

651
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,927
Why are you still here?

652
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:40,430
You love these parties more than anyone,
so what brings you out here?

653
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,099
You did say

654
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,019
that you'd ask for help if you needed it.

655
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,231
I'd need to be near you
to hear you ask for help.

656
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,993
You told me not to talk to you at first,
but look at you, flashing me a smile.

657
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:06,706
Talking to people
and getting closer to them

658
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,917
makes me uncomfortable.

659
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,336
Why?

660
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:16,633
Because they will all leave one day.

661
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,262
Doesn't it ever get hard
to be so negative all the time?

662
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,348
Doesn't it ever get hard
to put on a jolly face all the time?

663
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,813
I don't trust people who only
present themselves in high spirits.

664
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:33,316
They are always the first to leave.

665
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,821
I've been drawn to Kim Mubee
for some reason.

666
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,449
I think I finally know why.

667
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:52,419
Then…

668
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,133
if I share my secret with you…

669
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,013
will you like me?

670
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,269
And not leave me?

671
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:14,793
Was that

672
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,254
a mistake too?

673
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:22,842
No.

674
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,936
Okay, then.

675
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:47,117
Maybe she is getting through…
the dark night just like I am.

676
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:04,843
What did you say?

677
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:07,512
I think

678
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,347
we should break up.

679
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:49,012
Just like that, the dark night passed,
and the dawn came.

680
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,769
And Ko Gyeom disappeared just like that.
