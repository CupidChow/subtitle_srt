1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,849
Do movies reflect life?

2
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:19,185
Or does life resemble movies?

3
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,064
I was born in the year

4
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:27,402
when the movie starring the most famous
kid in the world hit theaters.

5
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,493
That was probably when it all started.

6
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,080
Movies have accompanied
my life ever since.

7
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:48,298
One wonderful thing about movies
is that anything is possible in them.

8
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,678
They made me feel like
I could do those things in real life.

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,728
But by the time I realized
some things were only possible in movies…

10
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,980
Well, it didn't matter.

11
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,609
They had already brought so much joy
to my ordinary life…

12
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,122
though they may also have made me
miss out on some things.

13
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,462
I admit I was a bit regretful
when I had to drop out of college.

14
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,214
STUDENT WITHDRAWAL FORM

15
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,175
Because I've always wanted to
make the most of college.

16
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,972
But it was all right.

17
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,059
All those things were in movies as well,

18
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,604
and movies have always been
part of my life.

19
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,693
That just might be
how my life came to resemble movies.

20
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,821
I'm here to meet…

21
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,533
the director.

22
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,289
Hello there. Who wants some chocolate?

23
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,624
Me!

24
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:56,259
But it was no Western action movie
or a movie set on a college campus.

25
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,137
I knew you were the shoe thief.

26
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,347
Hey, let go.

27
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,266
Sir, please give me a role.

28
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,559
What are you on about?

29
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,769
I could even be an extra.

30
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,314
I'm really talented at standing still.

31
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,482
-I don't need any lines.
-Seong-tae!

32
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,403
It wasn't a comedy either…

33
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,491
but a melo movie.

34
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,708
And if this movie had an ending,

35
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,295
it would surely be…

36
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,314
What is it this time?

37
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,113
Oh my God. What's all this?

38
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,657
You're always like this.

39
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,534
You hold it in until you explode
and can't control yourself.

40
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,912
Is something stressing you out?

41
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,334
If you keep acting like this--

42
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,515
Mom. Why did you date Dad?

43
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,643
Where is this coming from?

44
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:33,815
I just want to know why you went out
with a guy obsessed with movies

45
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,818
only to spend
the rest of your life in boredom.

46
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,741
You think he was the one
who did all the pursuing.

47
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,119
Actually, I pursued him more later on.

48
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,622
What? Why on earth would you do that?
What did you see in him?

49
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,040
Well…

50
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,212
It's a secret.

51
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,715
I want to keep some sides
of him to myself.

52
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,551
Whatever. I don't even wanna know.

53
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,097
I'm hungry. Let's have breakfast.

54
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,933
So you like the guy next door?

55
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,352
What? Who? No, I don't.

56
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,439
That's your thing.
You pretend to hate what you like.

57
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,525
I do? Hey, that's not true--

58
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,861
I know you. You take after me.

59
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,779
It's not like that.

60
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,783
Don't leave a decent kid hanging.
If you like him, just go out with him.

61
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,578
He might get tired of waiting
and leave you.

62
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,583
What, do you think I'm a kid or something?

63
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,771
What is it?

64
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,523
Huh? What do you mean?

65
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,109
Oh, don't mind me. Keep working.

66
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,581
Hey, get out of here.

67
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,292
You were the one who got it wrong.
Don't take it out on me.

68
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,795
Please get lost. I'm begging you.

69
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,845
You have five minutes.

70
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,765
If you have something to say,
spit it out, then beat it.

71
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,892
Hey, Mubee and I--

72
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,144
Hey, how old do you think we are?

73
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,813
-In the international age?
-What…

74
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,774
Are we teens? Are we in our twenties?

75
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,068
When are we ever gonna stop
talking about girls?

76
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,406
Yeah, you've got a point.

77
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,870
But what's this?

78
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,955
TWO SEASONS

79
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,124
Hey!

80
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,170
I just wanted to check it out.

81
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,338
Hey, Hongsi.

82
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,383
You're too old to be embarrassed
by these things.

83
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:09,011
Just say it loud and proud, "I got curious
and watched the movie my ex wrote."

84
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,639
No, I was checking to see
if she wrote about me.

85
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,391
So? Did she?

86
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,062
Well… I guess she also had
stories to tell that weren't mine.

87
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:18,980
What?

88
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,483
Man, are you that stupid?

89
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:23,901
What?

90
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,529
Don't you think
she might've tweaked it a bit?

91
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,156
What an idiot.

92
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,741
Everything she wrote is about you and her.

93
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,454
You didn't know that? Unbelievable.

94
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,956
I'm ashamed
I almost shared my concerns with you.

95
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,124
I'm gonna go.

96
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:43,254
How could you not know any better than me?
You're hopeless, man.

97
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,426
Hey, explain yourself before you go.

98
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,427
Forget it.

99
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,929
I can't hang out with an idiot like you.
I'm off.

100
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,350
You better work hard and earn yourself
that job on Kim Mubee's movie.

101
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,561
Idiot.

102
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,899
Finish what you were saying!

103
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,776
Hey! Don't come back!

104
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,072
You always show up whenever you want.
Don't you ever come back!

105
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,007
He can't be right.

106
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,301
STUDIO BE

107
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,930
Compared to the budget I had in mind…

108
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,225
this is only half.

109
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,101
I know.

110
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,689
But I believe we can overcome
this poverty… I mean, adversity.

111
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,690
How, you ask?

112
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,734
-By cheering each other up!
-Let's go!

113
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,818
We've got this.

114
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,862
The music is the biggest problem.

115
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,948
Music royalties are expensive,

116
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,867
so we're going to need
as many original songs as we can get.

117
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,952
You're right.

118
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,873
Music is the heart of our movie,
so let's pour a good chunk of our budget--

119
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,292
I wouldn't use the word "pour"
with this budget.

120
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,129
Where are we gonna find

121
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,383
a talented, affordable, fresh producer
with immense potential?

122
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,553
For now…

123
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,721
-Look.
-Oh my.

124
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,811
The two of them are besties now.

125
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,398
Han-sol, let's set the record straight.

126
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,191
I'm swamped,

127
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,069
but she keeps showing up uninvited.

128
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,461
God, you startled me.
What are you doing here?

129
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,881
You're awfully late to work.
Why didn't you answer your phone?

130
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,260
Hey, is everything okay?

131
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,637
I was at a funeral.

132
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,098
Oh, someone passed away?

133
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,017
This kid who did sync sound.

134
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,728
He died yesterday.

135
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,522
I heard he collapsed
on his way home from a shoot.

136
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,776
That punk said
he'd show me a script he wrote.

137
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,570
Damn it.

138
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,241
My goodness, why is everything so futile?

139
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,660
Were you two close?

140
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,412
We're all pretty much family.

141
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,498
What was the cause of death?
Was it from overworking?

142
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,210
I thought things had improved a lot
on movie sets. Is that not true?

143
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,882
Come to think of it…

144
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,593
You know Director Kim, right?

145
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,887
I'm talking about Kim Mubee.

146
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:42,433
Her father was in the industry too.
He passed away from overwork.

147
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,854
The industry had a lot of issues then.
His death gained a lot of media coverage.

148
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,691
His name still comes up
every time something like this happens.

149
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,360
So she must be exhausted.

150
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,239
God, I have a feeling
this time won't be any different.

151
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,953
Get some rest.
You look like you're having a hard time.

152
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,529
Do you like pizza?

153
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,114
Why do you ask?

154
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,324
Just tell me. Do you?

155
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,285
Yes, I do. Why?

156
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,163
Pepperoni or Hawaiian?

157
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,081
Hawaiian.

158
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,500
That's a bit disappointing.

159
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,878
Cooked pineapple
should not exist in this world.

160
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,172
I don't have time
to listen to your nonsense.

161
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,384
So, you know the pizza joint
at the three-way street, right?

162
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,802
I'll be there.

163
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,845
And?

164
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,431
You can avoid me if you want.

165
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,350
But if we do bump into each other,
let's grab a slice.

166
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,815
What was that?

167
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,571
This is getting really awkward
as I think I know who you're dealing with.

168
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,488
Sorry?

169
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,992
No, never mind.
You'll find out sooner or later.

170
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,706
So why are you here today?
Don't you have anything else to do?

171
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,999
Here's the thing.

172
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,294
When someone asks you
to give them some time,

173
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,005
how much time does that mean exactly?

174
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,965
A week? A month?

175
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,429
If this is about your personal life again,
I want no part of it.

176
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,183
Anyway, can I meet with that songwriter?

177
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,226
I want to hear some of his music.

178
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,771
He should have a few songs ready.

179
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,939
Don't worry.
I'll set up a meeting right away.

180
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,608
Are you sure about that?

181
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,653
If he asked you for some time,
I'm guessing you two had a big fight.

182
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,822
God, you're so annoying.

183
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,745
Let's grab something to eat.
I have more to say.

184
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,539
Are you busy?

185
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,211
No.

186
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,684
Excuse me.

187
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,104
May I have another Coke?

188
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,107
I'm sorry,
but are you going to order any food?

189
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,445
Okay.

190
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,074
I'll get some pizza to go.

191
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,827
It looks like I got stood up after all.

192
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,455
Was someone going to join you?

193
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,791
No, she didn't say she was coming.

194
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,627
Which pizza would you like?

195
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,713
One slice of pepperoni and…

196
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,717
And a slice of Hawaiian
with a lemon and lime soda, please.

197
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,969
We'll eat here.

198
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,596
Sure.

199
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,100
What a coincidence.

200
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,853
Tell me about it.

201
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,855
Seriously,

202
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,816
what a small neighborhood.

203
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,199
The pepperoni pizza is good here.

204
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,291
What?

205
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,420
Nothing. I just hope
we run into each other more often.

206
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,266
Ms. Kim!

207
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,028
What?

208
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,031
-What is it?
-Come on already.

209
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,032
But…

210
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,410
Hello.

211
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,460
-Good?
-You cooked it well.

212
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,420
Yesterday, you said…

213
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,637
Bye!

214
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,476
Here.

215
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,353
What? But it's…

216
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,229
You're running late. Hurry along!

217
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,442
Have a great day!

218
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,875
Huh?

219
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,561
Thank you.

220
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,646
Enjoy.

221
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,069
You're a little later than usual.

222
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,200
I had fun. See you tomorrow!

223
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,371
Ms. Kim?

224
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,457
What are you doing here?

225
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,425
You got off a little late.

226
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:33,969
I did.

227
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,986
What's next?

228
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,658
Where are we going to
run into each other next time?

229
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,371
Please. Who knows?
Everything's purely coincidental.

230
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,335
Ms. Kim Mubee.

231
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,590
Do you want to run into each other
again tomorrow?

232
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,845
At six o'clock,

233
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,515
in front of the takoyaki place

234
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,183
by chance.

KIM HUN-DONG'S DEATH BY CAR ACCIDENT
DUE TO LONG HOURS OF WORK…

237
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:10,232
I got home safely.
I'm going to sleep well, so don't worry.

238
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,125
That was good. Come out.
Let's go grab some coffee.

239
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,087
I really like this song.

240
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,303
What? Why won't it open?

241
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,066
I told you to fix this door.

242
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,943
It's okay when you close it gently.

243
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,446
Let's talk about what on earth
you've been working on over coffee.

244
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,626
Did you unblock me?

245
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,763
Where are you going?

246
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,015
Oh, funny seeing you here.

247
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,892
Are you here for coffee?

248
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,604
Yeah. My studio's here,
so there's nothing funny about it.

249
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,651
Right. Your studio is nearby, isn't it?
I just have some business in the area.

250
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,695
Really?

251
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:21,989
You're not here for me?

252
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,284
No, I really have something to do.

253
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:26,910
Sure.

254
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,914
I need to take this call.

255
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,587
I unblocked you.
Wait here if you want to talk.

256
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,467
Hello?

257
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,553
Yes.

258
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,392
You must be Son Ju-a.

259
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,436
Do you know me?

260
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:58,317
You know, everyone has that one name
that follows them around.

261
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,111
A name that everyone
around you would know.

262
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,029
What?

263
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:06,033
For Si-jun, that name is Son Ju-a.

264
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,127
I'm going.

265
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,588
You're not going to finish up today?

266
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,505
Next time.

267
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,848
Why are you here again?
Are you going to keep spying on me?

268
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,809
Let's go to the studio.
I wanna hear your songs.

269
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,438
-I'll manage on my--
-The director wants to see you.

270
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,149
I wanna check them out first.
Is that a problem?

271
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,737
Not exactly, but…

272
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,072
Hey.

273
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,283
Come on.

274
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,635
It's not finished yet.

275
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,638
I'm going to add some piano here.

276
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,433
And drums from here.

277
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,645
I'm going to build it up
and leave just the vocal in the end.

278
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,568
The rest isn't done yet.

279
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,329
Hongsi.

280
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,373
You really are a genius.

281
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,667
How did you come up
with a melody like this?

282
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,337
You're amazing, Hongsi. I love the song.

283
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,099
You can go if you're done listening.
I have to get back to work.

284
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,687
Why don't you get a male vocalist
to sing this song?

285
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,106
I thought it'd work well
as the female lead's theme.

286
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:04,276
It'd be nice to have the male lead
sing this himself.

287
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,279
I'll think about it.

288
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,239
Just sing it yourself now.

289
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,657
No, thanks.

290
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,952
Come on. Just do it.
You sing the guide track anyway.

291
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,580
-What are you doing? Don't touch me.
-Get up.

292
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,498
-What the hell?
-Let me hear it.

293
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,960
-Stop touching me.
-Hurry.

294
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,589
We'll just see how it sounds, so relax.

295
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,799
I'll play the track.
You can start singing.

296
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,234
Why can't I hear him?

297
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,742
Something's wrong.
I can't hear your voice…

298
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,996
That is so childish!

299
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,959
Hey, let's stop here.
I'll do this alone later.

300
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,962
Why do it later?
Just get it over with right now.

301
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,302
What's with this?

302
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,472
Hey, did you slam the door?

303
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,140
It just closed on its own.

304
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,476
Man, it's doing this again.

305
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,936
What is it? Is it broken?

306
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,480
Damn it.
I was really gonna get it fixed today.

307
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,482
You've been leaving this unfixed?

308
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:29,236
You should've fixed it right away.
Who knows what might happen?

309
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,909
Try calling up a local locksmith.

310
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,786
You do it. My phone is out there.

311
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,080
You're still as hopeless as ever.

312
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,291
My jacket!

313
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,629
What are we going to do? Help!

314
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,798
I think we're stuck in here!

315
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,134
Someone open the door! Is anybody there?

316
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,685
Hey. Are we going to just stay here?

317
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,522
Gyeom might stop by later.
He comes by almost every day.

318
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,524
Really? Around what time?

319
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,942
That I don't know.

320
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,403
He doesn't follow a schedule.

321
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,281
Gyeom, you're our only hope.

322
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,372
Hey, it's starting to feel stuffy.

323
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,666
Just say anything at all.

324
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,341
Was the song bad?

325
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,760
What?

326
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,138
You didn't say anything.
I was embarrassed.

327
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,764
No, it's not that it was bad.

328
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,475
It's just that the vocal…

329
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,563
The girl I met earlier. Did she sing it?

330
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,148
Yes.

331
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,192
You two must be quite close.

332
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,193
Why do you ask?

333
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:56,072
I mean, you two must be very close
if you shared all those things.

334
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,117
What are you talking about?
Say it so I can understand.

335
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,995
Do you know what she did when she saw me?

336
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,497
"Son Ju-a"?

337
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,126
That's what.

338
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,339
Yu-rim never makes faces like that.

339
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,798
She really did.

340
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,721
What in the world
did you tell people about me?

341
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,557
Why could she say
that my name follows you around?

342
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,603
Hey, answer me.

343
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:30,148
You already know what it means.
It's one or the other.

344
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,818
I either constantly bad-mouthed you

345
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,071
or constantly missed you.

346
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,742
Or both.

347
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,507
It must be frustrating to be locked up
when you want to storm out like always.

348
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,092
Yes, it bugs me.

349
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,428
I always hated you storming out
after blurting out what was on your mind.

350
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,554
It serves you right.

351
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,448
You said this was our story.

352
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,244
Yes. What about it?

353
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,747
So why'd you make the woman look cool
and have her ask the guy out first?

354
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,082
I asked you out.

355
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,177
Go out… with me.

356
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,138
Okay.

357
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:47,225
Hey, think before you answer.
I'm really serious about this.

358
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,269
I'm serious too.

359
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,270
I mean…

360
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,564
This is frustrating.

361
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,984
You and I are friends.
We can't get together this easily.

362
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,988
You just asked me out.
Why can't we get together?

363
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,742
If we start dating now…

364
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,118
Then what?

365
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,997
I won't break up with you, ever.

366
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,333
So think it over.

367
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,175
Stop smiling.

368
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,599
I said stop smiling.

369
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,818
Don't be ridiculous.

370
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,238
You only asked me out
because I followed you around first.

371
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,199
What kind of nonsense is that?

372
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,869
I liked you and followed you around
way before you asked me out.

373
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,329
Shut up. I liked you first.

374
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,873
The whole school knew
that I liked you first.

375
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,793
You were only into music
and couldn't care less about me.

376
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,004
Hey, I played the guitar every day
just to impress you.

377
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,923
I went to that school because of you.

378
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,007
You know I…

379
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,053
What? Wait a minute.

380
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,806
The school?

381
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,809
Yes, it was far from my home,
but I went there just for you.

382
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,976
See? I liked you first.

383
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:17,732
Wait.

384
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,902
Then when did you start…

385
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,538
Gyeom! Ko Gyeom!

386
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,546
-Hey!
-Gyeom, open the door!

387
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:43,800
Right.

388
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:52,183
I wonder how you two got locked in there.

389
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,143
I wanna find out so badly.

390
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,020
Don't let your imagination run wild.

391
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,689
I'm going.

392
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:02,110
Record the guide track with your voice.
I'll schedule a meeting with the director.

393
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,697
What? Kim Mubee is coming here?
Hey, invite me over.

394
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,948
Why should I?

395
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,702
I want to listen to Hongsi's new song.
I deserve to do so.

396
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,956
Please. Just tell me the date.
I'll behave.

397
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,458
Hey, it's a work meeting, not a playdate.

398
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,931
What did you two do in there?

399
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:33,600
Shut it.

400
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,729
Do you have to fix that door?

401
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,439
What do you mean?

402
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,400
I just thought you could put me in there
with Mubee later--

403
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,318
Can you just go?

404
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,695
I'm going to even if you tell me to stay!

405
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,197
I have important plans today.

406
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,033
Don't care, not gonna ask.

407
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:53,828
I have to go and run into someone
by chance, so bye now.

408
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,439
Hi. How can I help you?

409
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,743
Is this too much?

410
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,334
If she freaks out,
I'll just say I got them for Jun.

411
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,284
Gyeom.

412
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,412
Jun.

413
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,622
Were you on your way home?

414
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,375
What?

415
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,714
Let's go home for now.

416
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,516
Thank you.

417
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,945
Hello. How many would you like?

418
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,864
-Seven, please.
-Seven, it is.

419
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,871
I'll really be careful. Okay?

420
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:05,334
I must've been lost in my thoughts
for a moment back there.

421
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,920
Nothing happened, so it's all good.

422
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,507
Hey, Gyeom.

423
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:16,387
I know I'm in your care,
but aren't you being too harsh on me?

424
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,098
Why aren't you surprised?

425
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,600
What?

426
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,852
You have everyone around you frightened,

427
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,772
but you never get surprised
and always stay calm.

428
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,405
You're right.

429
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,325
I guess I wasn't aware of my surroundings.

430
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,123
I'm hungry. Let's have dinner.

431
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,668
Do we still have some bulgogi left?

432
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,962
Even when you woke up after the accident…

433
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:56,928
Even then…

434
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,349
you weren't surprised one bit.

435
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:08,439
I don't get how you could remain so calm
after waking up from such an accident.

436
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,197
I was?

437
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,786
Jun.

438
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,416
Why do I feel like you're…

439
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,970
I'm home.

440
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,055
Good day?

441
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,641
Yes.

442
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,863
He said we should run into each other.
What is he playing at?

443
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,208
Don't show up in front of me ever again.

444
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,835
You can have this neighborhood.
I'll leave instead.

445
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,130
Stop talking nonsense
and keep your distance.

446
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,675
I'm done with all that.

447
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,600
I was pretty shitty to him.

448
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:53,980
Don't leave a decent kid hanging.
If you like him, just go out with him.

449
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,357
He might get tired of waiting
and leave you.

450
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,111
Fine, then. Be my guest.

451
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,037
What?

452
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,581
What's what?

453
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:16,002
It's nice to sleep
next to my brother after so long.

454
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,378
You slept here?

455
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,547
Why? Don't you like it?

456
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,384
You seemed to like it
when you put your arms around me.

457
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,052
Did you think I was Mubee?

458
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,804
Don't be so gross.

459
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,639
"Gross"?

460
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,310
Hey. Up until middle school,

461
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,812
you slept next to me
because you'd get scared.

462
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,647
What are you talking about?

463
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,066
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?

464
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,152
You wet your bed back then.

465
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,070
-What?
-After watching that movie--

466
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,947
I did no such thing!

467
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,741
You got scared and wet--

468
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,326
I did not!

469
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,997
You can't beat up your big brother.

470
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,419
Think about what you did wrong.

471
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,254
Gyeom.

472
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,882
I'm sorry.

473
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,094
You're lame.

474
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,180
Get up. Let's eat.

475
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,203
Come and eat.

476
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,120
Okay.

477
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,247
Going out this weekend?

478
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,124
Yes, to work.

479
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,376
You are?

480
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,173
Why?

481
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,424
Nothing.

482
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,719
You're pretty done up for work,
that's all.

483
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,399
Jun, why was the front gate open?

484
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,860
There was a bit of a battle last night,
so we forgot to close it.

485
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,737
-Come on in.
-Sure.

486
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,663
What? Is the little potato
walking in with a bowl of potatoes?

487
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,623
You keep calling me "potato."

488
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:21,502
So I always end up buying them
at the market. I've been potato-lighted.

489
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,212
So why are you here today?

490
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,798
You're so sly.
You only call me when you need me.

491
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,217
I was bored, that's why.
Mubee said she was busy.

492
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,930
You must be doing well by yourself.
Don't need my help anymore?

493
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,682
When did I get your help?

494
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,936
Gyeom, you'll pay dearly for that.

495
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,271
I know Mubee very well--

496
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,232
Hey, you only know her history
up until middle school.

497
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,818
You useless punk.
This guy is totally useless.

498
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,070
Hey!

499
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,574
-Mubee will never like you.
-Sure.

500
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,868
-Not when she sees your true colors.
-Sure.

501
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,749
I'm sorry for not showing up yesterday.

502
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,793
Something came up…

503
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,220
About our coincidental plans yesterday…

504
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,097
You're even eating the skin?

505
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,061
I heard that the skin is more nutritious.

506
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,566
Are you busy right now?

507
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,406
Wow, we have so many visitors today.

508
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,293
Are you busy right now?

509
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,046
I have never been busy in my life.

510
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,130
Then,

511
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,966
will you come with me?

512
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,053
I have to go somewhere for work,

513
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,181
and I need to carry some stuff,
but Jeong-hu's busy.

514
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,099
If you have time--

515
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:05,064
I guess I have no choice but to help out.
Give me one moment.

516
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,614
Hey, you can eat my food.

517
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,032
Gyeom!

518
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,831
Did she say I was busy? Did she--

519
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,585
Drink up. You're choking.

520
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,506
Hey. I can drive.

521
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,759
-You don't even know where we're going.
-Wherever it is. Just hop in.

522
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,225
Do you have sunglasses?

523
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,643
I do.

524
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,144
Okay.

525
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:48,816
What is this?

526
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:50,943
Okay.

527
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,577
Here we go.

528
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,667
Man, I'm stuffed.

529
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,547
They're supposed to be grown-ups,
and they're using me as an excuse?

530
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,548
Isn't that silly?

531
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,634
Even little kids would have
more mature relationships than theirs.

532
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,012
They're both cute.

533
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,057
I'm disappointed in Mubee.

534
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,977
At least,
she should've acted like a grown-up.

535
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,816
Jun, do you want to watch a movie?

536
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,529
Are these all Gyeom's picks?

537
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:40,451
He must've been cooped up at home
all the time to watch this many movies.

538
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,121
Is that why he still acts like a kid?

539
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,000
How about this one?

540
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,631
-Jun.
-Yes?

541
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,927
Jun, you've been drowsy a lot lately.
Are you tired?

542
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,973
Yes, I'm a bit tired.

543
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,477
Let me take a quick nap.

544
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:44,098
Well, I'm sorry
for not showing up yesterday.

545
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,184
Yesterday? For what?

546
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,772
We were supposed to meet by chance…
Oh, did you not go?

547
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,775
We were? I didn't go.

548
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,945
That's a relief.

549
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,975
-This can't be happening.
-What?

550
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,938
Man, I have a guest with me today.
This is way too embarrassing.

551
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,190
Hey, hang in there!

552
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,865
Please, no. Hang in there, you fool.

553
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,790
-Well, this is a very old car.
-Wait, so…

554
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:57,254
Did the car just stop here?

555
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,257
Yes.

556
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,719
This is bad.

557
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,194
We should've just taken my car.

558
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,654
Yes, okay.

559
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,867
Hey, don't say that in front of my car.

560
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,955
I wanted to get there before sunset,
but I guess that's not happening.

561
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,166
We can come back out tomorrow.

562
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,584
Excuse me?

563
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,837
I'm busy, you know.
Do you think I'm here to hang out?

564
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,048
Aren't we here to hang out?

565
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,843
You said you needed to carry some stuff,
but you were empty-handed.

566
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,597
And you said Jeong-hu was busy
when he was eating potatoes at my place.

567
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,434
Wasn't that your way
of asking me to hang out?

568
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:02,945
It's the first time you have proposed
that we do something together.

569
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,831
Five years ago, when you disappeared…

570
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,669
You're really good at bringing up
subjects that put me on the spot.

571
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,254
Was it something…

572
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,757
to do with your brother?

573
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,135
I've thought about it

574
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,638
since you moved next door
and I met your brother.

575
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,808
You used to love
talking about your brother.

576
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:38,939
But your brother was different
from what I heard in your stories.

577
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,984
So I took a wild guess.

578
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,572
Then… what took you so long to ask?

579
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,162
I don't like complicated things.

580
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,917
I don't like getting close to someone.

581
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,588
I prefer not to go deeper
into a person's life.

582
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,757
I know myself.

583
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,760
Once I find out one thing about someone,
I'll want to know more.

584
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,680
Then I won't be able to help myself
from falling deeper.

585
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:15,225
In the end, I'll become an idiot
who fails to realize

586
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,644
that the person is about to leave me.

587
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,817
So I didn't want to know more about you.

588
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:28,113
You seemed to have
an exceptionally complicated side to you.

589
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,868
Then what changed?

590
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:37,915
The thing I hate the most
is when someone disappears without a word.

591
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:43,128
Even though you did what I hate the most,
I'm finding that I still like you.

592
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,384
That can only mean
I can't find a reason to hate you.

593
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,476
So I just decided…

594
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,480
to let things get complicated.

595
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,697
If I understood you correctly…

596
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,949
I like you.

597
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,051
It's clear that this time…

598
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,514
my life has become a melo movie.

599
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:40,560
No matter what kind of person I am?

600
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,855
No matter what kind of person you are.

601
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:08,231
And I know for sure
that this movie will have a happy ending.

602
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,733
But life goes on
far longer than any movie.

603
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,373
Oh man.

604
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,628
Thank you for the food.

605
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,007
We all have to carry on with our lives.

606
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,021
Gyeom.

607
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,815
Yes?

608
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,567
But for some people…

609
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,068
There is…

610
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,905
something I have to tell you.

611
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:44,452
…life is much shorter.

612
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:56,173
MELO MOVIE

613
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:26,865
