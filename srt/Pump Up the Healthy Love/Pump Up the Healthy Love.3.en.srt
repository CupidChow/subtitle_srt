I heard you're giving Ms. Lee a refund.

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,550
Yes.

10
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,250
Why? Is it because she failed to lose weight?

11
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,950
What do you mean she failed?

12
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,690
I even made her fit into that children's clothes.

13
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,280

You can't put this in your body.

40

It's none of your business. It's my body.

41
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,210

Why are you doing this?

45
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,450
Whenever something happened,

46
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,430
you've eaten unhealthy and stopped working out.

47
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,060
Is that how you've been torturing your body?

48
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,280
Torture?

49
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,120
Since you treat your body poorly,

50
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,830

Ms. Lee, it's not that-

55
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,660
I tried, too.

56
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,320
I didn't ask for much.

57
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,840
All I wanted was...

58
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,230
for the man I liked to remember me as

59
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,940
someone less weird and small.

60
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,570
That was the only thing, but

61
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,310
nothing works out, no matter how hard I try.

62
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,840
Wow, it must've been so upsetting.

63
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,650
- It was.
- Not you, but Ms. Lee.

65
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,180
She didn't get to eat makchang, right?

66
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,590
That wasn't upsetting. That was a good thing.

67
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,290
Eating makchang doesn't kill you.

68
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,670
Empathy for clients is a requirement for trainers.

69
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,630
No, it's a basic requirement for a human.

70
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,780
If the trainer shows empathy,

71
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,320
will the client gain muscles?

72
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,050
They might not gain muscles,

73
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,900
but the gym will have more members.

74
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,250
If we don't change, we'd actually go down.

75
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,450
Don't say that, Rosa.

76
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,730
A book I read says your words dictate your future.

77
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,890
Spit out your words. Do it.

78
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,530
I came here because I didn't want us to fail.

85
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,930
It was a very stormy day 10 years ago.

86
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,550
A skinny man went missing
and returned in three days.

87
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,630
He said he was blown away by wind,

88
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,660
but no one believed him.

89
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,870
How could a storm blow someone away?

90
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,150
So, the man who got blown away found people

91
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,710
who could relate to what happened to him.

92
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,330
He quickly was joined by 120,000 people

93
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,410

They need to work out more than anyone,

99
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,650
but these 120,000 people avoid it
more than anyone.

100
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,870
I'll make them my clients.

101
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,760
You get 120,000 clients if you succeed with one,

102
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,840
but if you fail with one, you get 120,000 haters.

103
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,430
I won't fail.

104
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,780
What if you do?

105
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,060
Can you promise you'd quit as a director

106
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,390
and leave the gym if you fail?

107
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,080
I promise.

108
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,560
- Director.
- Alex.

109
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,340
Don't worry.

110
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,500
There's no way I'd be leaving.

111
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,030
What did you want to talk to us about?

112
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, we wanted to sponsor the SMF club.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,290
Sponsor?

114
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,500
Yes, our gym is offering free training sessions

115
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,590
for bulking up.

116
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,220
If you could just attend the sessions and

117
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,200
write brief reviews on your website...

118
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,560
We get offers like this often.

119
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,640
But most of us aren't interested in fitness.

120
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,030
But you should still give it a try.

121
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,990
We're confident we can succeed.

122
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,850
Pardon me. Here's the pork skin.

123
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,310
We didn't order this.

- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

126
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,190
Why do they give us
complimentary food without asking?

127
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,480
If we don't finish,

128
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,000
they charge 3,000 won for food waste.

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,920
People don't let men be small eaters.

130
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,910
There's a financial burden for it,

131
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,480
but it's as if it's not physically burdening.

132
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,570
Your stomach is like muscles, too.

133
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,200
If you train your stomach by exercising,

134
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,080
you can digest well and feel less burdened.

135
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,300
How about you start with light sit-ups?

136
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,810
So, you mean...

137
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,270

- Yes, yes.
- You guys are anchovies, too?

00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,090
Ma'am, how could you call them anchovies?

143
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,040
These men are humans, not anchovies.

144
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,920
How would you feel if someone called you a pig?

145
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,880
What? Pig?

It's clear who thinks of us as anchovies.

Let's go, guys.

152
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,020
Do you know why we don't go to the gym?

153
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,880
It's because people like you mock us like this.

154
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,510
You can eat all the anchovy noodles, okay?

155
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,120
We, anchovies, are too full. Bye.

Excuse me. Excuse me!

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,950
What do we do, Director?

159
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,230
Don't worry, Alex.

160
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,370

Hello, we're 24-Hour Health Club.

164
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,240
We're looking for members to work out

165
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,600

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,390
you've been posting for hours now.

170
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,840
I'll never give up on our gym.

171
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,840
You seem to really love our gym.

172
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,010
I can totally sense it.

173
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,600
It's the place that trusted me first.

174
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,510
Pardon?

175
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,040
Since I started working out late,

176
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,230
I had nowhere to go as a trainer.

177
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,680
I was older...

178
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,280
and didn't win any awards.

179
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,920
But only Director Dong believed me.

180
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,800
He apparently could tell from my shoulders

181
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,970
that I took fitness seriously.

182
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,300

00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,800
I want to become strong like you, Director.

365
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,160
Okay.

366
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,810
But working out made me bigger
and stronger than anyone.

367
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,040
- Like me, you can-
- No, no.

368
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,030
I don't even expect to be like you.

369
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:15,000
I just don't want to be mocked
by my name, Kang Cheol Nam.

370
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,440
Someone skinny with a tadpole belly
has the name Kang Cheol Nam.

371
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,750
Even I find it ridiculous.

372
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,760
Don't worry.

373
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,220
You'll have a body that suits the name.

374
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,080
I'll turn you into the Iron Man.

375
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,610
But I'm afraid.

376
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,810
I won't hurt you.

377
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,950
Well, they keep staring at me.

378
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,440
Let's try the burpee, then.

379
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,360
It's a great workout that strengthens all muscles.

380
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,630
Okay. Breathe deeply.

381
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,200
When I say "One,"

382
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,770
you'll go down and come back up.

383
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,100
- One!
- One.

384
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,910
Mr. Kang? Don't just lie down. You need to get up.

385
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,440
I know,

386
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,840
but I have orthostatic hypotension.

387
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,370
Give me a little moment.

388
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,390
What the orthostatic hypotension?

389
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,540
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

390
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,010
Body strength comes from the lower body.

391
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,040
Especially the thighs.

392
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,670
Raise your legs up slowly.

393
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,220
With vigor. One!

394
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,710
One.

395
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,850
Is this right?

396
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,920
It can't be.

397
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,500
Come down.

398
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,150
How?

399
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm scared.

400
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,290
Hug me.

401
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,630
Let's move on to the next equipment.

402
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,350
[Roy Gym]

403
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,800
Unni, their treadmills don't squeak.

404
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,480
My goodness. Look at this.

405
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,120
Gosh, the towels smell good.

406
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,450
My goodness.

407
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,690
Gosh, gosh, gosh.

408
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,580
My goodness. Seriously...

409
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,970
Hello, hello, hello.

410
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,470
Work out comfortably. Yes, yes.

411
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,130
Okay, we will.

412
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,790
I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

413
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,920
Well, let's see...

414
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,010
You do mukbang
with your husband on YouTube...

415
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,930
No, that's not you.

416
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,990
Gosh, she's this big.

417
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,070
And I'm this big.

418
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,030
Yes, so small. So small.

419
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,800
- Fighting.
- Fighting.

420
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,600
- He's funny.
- My goodness.

421
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,630
Unni, the director here is so friendly and polite.

422
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,620
[Joon Seok, thank you for caring for me]

423
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,130
He was glued to his phone when he was with me.

424
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:52,690
Is he ignoring my message? Why? Why? Why?

425
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,550
Why did he clear my name, then...

426
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,790
Hey, how can you drive like that?

427
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,940
Are you trying to kill yourself?

428
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,890
- Sir!
- You're all okay, right?

429
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,590
Gosh, seriously.

430
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,930
Are you okay?

431
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,760
I'm standing.

432
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,840
I'm the only one standing.

433
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,400
Squats improve the core strength

434
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,840
and it improves the
whole body's muscle strength.

435
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,480
It lets you stand straight

436
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,380
and makes you strong enough to stand alone.

437
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,770
What you achieved by working out
isn't wearing that outfit,

438
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,260
but what's inside you.

439
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,170
Wow, you're amazing, lady.

440
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,480
Wow, you're so strong.

441

She must work out.

442
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,420
- So cool!
- Wow!

443
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,350
Get up.

444
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,680
So, will you leave for practice right after this?

445
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,890
Why do you ask? Should I stay

446
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:02,480
and practice something else?

447
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
Practice what?

448
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,210
Something like this?

449
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,040

450

Hey!

00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,810
You scared me.

452
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,990
Oh, my God.

453
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,590
Why did you suddenly barge in?

454
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,760
Should I press the doorbell at my house?

455
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,500
- Push me.
- What?

456
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,860
Push me, I said.

457
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,000
Gosh, what's with you?

458
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,240
You can't push me, right? Can you?

459
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,040
What? Did you gain more weight?

460
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,110
What are you saying? Try pushing me.

461
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,690
Oh, okay.

462
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,580
You can't push me, right? Both try.

463
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,350
Okay.

464
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,230
- I stood today.
- What?

465
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,670
Everyone else fell, but I stood alone.

466
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,540
What are you saying? Try to explain.

467
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,430
I'm not someone who depends on others.

468
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,340
I'm able to stand alone!

469
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,980
I'm able to stand alone!

470
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,510
I'm so happy!

[24-Hour Health Club]

472
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,330
Geez, I decided to get refunded.

473
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:30,410
That fitness buff would mock me
if I said I'd start again.

474
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,840
This isn't the only gym.

475
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,630
I'll go somewhere else.

476
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:42,320
But it's easier to go here
than somewhere else.

477
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,900
I can't. I can't. It's too embarrassing.

478
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,330
You work out, right?

479
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,340
I can tell by just looking from behind.

480
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,980
That you work out.

481
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,830
Do I have that kind of body?

482
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,210
Of course. It's obvious.

483

Hold on.

you're new, and everybody's new.

- Aren't you a high school student?

Gosh, no one has told me that before.

Wow. Anyway, we don't have time.

505
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,350
Should we start working out?

506
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,880
Baby.

507
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,500
Okay.

508
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:11,360
Here are the pretty white ones that suit the baby.

509
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,440
Let's start with the 1 kg ones.

510

Hold them.

511
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,770
1 kg?

512
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,980
No.

513
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,110
They're 5 kg.

514
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,580
Aren't they too heavy from the beginning?

515
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,660
The dumbbells aren't heavy. Your body is.

516
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,310
You can totally do it.

517
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,070
Only you don't know that.

518
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,700
Start.

519
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,150
Gosh, so heavy.

520
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,340
They were so heavy.

521
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,480
Yes. Looks like you've done this before.

522
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,940
Five. Nice.

523
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,610
Six.

524
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,760
Impressive. Great.

525
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,740
Your form is great.

526
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,850
Why does he compliment whenever he counts?

527
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,890
I can't focus. Stop, stop.

528
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,600
Compliments make the client lazy.

529
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,990
I have no criticisms to make.

530
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,840
Nine.

531
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,060
It's already nine?

532
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,630
Only count when my form is good.

533
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:09,240
Yes, stop. Put them down.

534
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,080
- Already?
- Why? Does it hurt?

535
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,200
- No.
- Stop? Was I really stopping at 10?

536
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,940
You say I'd to 10,

537
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,310
but you keep saying, "One more. One more"

538
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,940
and make me do 15. Isn't that how it is?

539
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,960
I'll go drink some water.

540
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,950
Yes, sure. This way.

541
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,870
Okay.

542
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,780
You lunge when you go get water, Ms. Lee.

543
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,420
You maintain the lunge form.

544
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,240
Go lower! Sit lower!

545
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,380

00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,760
But I can't digest.

728
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,550
Got it. Should we get the real digestive aid, then?

729
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,020
It's the heaven's food.

730
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,570
Heaven...

731
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,130
You call that heaven's food?

732
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,280
Sweets make you feel like you're flying.

733
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,720
It's because of the insulin spike
from the increase in blood sugar.

734
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,650
The insulin spikes?

735
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,060
Yes.

736
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,950
Let it spike. My mood is spiking, too.

737
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,650
Go ahead.

738
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,010
Liquid sugar is the worst. Let go.

739
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,490
What are you doing right now?

740
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,030
I'm in class right now. Let go.

741
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,260
- Let go.
- Let go.

742
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,720
- Let go.
- What are you doing?

743
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,840
- Don't look at me like that.
- Be nice, okay?

744
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,730
- I'm being nice already.
- I don't think so.

745
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,670
Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang!

746
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,940
Are you okay, Cheol Nam?

747
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,490
Is he dead? He can't die!

748
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,150
Call me 911, please!

749
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,640
Mr. Kang!

750
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,990
It's acute pancreatitis.

751
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,970
Make sure he drinks a lot
of water to avoid dehydration.

752
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,380
He can leave once he finishes the IV.

753
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,220
Thank you.

754
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,090
My goodness.

755
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:24,580
I'm sorry. He overdid it because of me.

756
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,570
It's not your fault, Mi Ran.

757
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:29,950
- It's because my body's this way.
- Oh, no.

758
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,480
You'll be back to normal
once you recover and work out again.

759
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,260
Yes, I'll be back...

760
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:39,150
to my weak and skinny state.

761
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,580
This is the cycle skinny men go through.

762
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,620
I've been through this before.

763
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:49,720
But I wanted to be different this time.

764
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,920
Lately, someone's been parking
his truck in front of my cafe.

765
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,380
Sir, sir, you can't park here.

766
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,080
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

767
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,430
But as soon as he saw my body,

768
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:09,190
he changed his attitude.

769
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,560
Where am I supposed to park, then?

770
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,990
There's public parking nearby-

771
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,310
Where am I supposed to park if no one lets me?

772
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:18,180
It's just for a moment, okay?

773
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,640
He said a moment,

774
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,840
but it became a day,

775
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,730
two days, and weeks.

776
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,720
Even when there are parking spots,

777
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,970
he blocks the entrance of my cafe.

778
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:35,510
Why could that be?

779
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:38,330
Because you seem the easiest and weakest.

780
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:40,740
That's why you need to become strong.

781
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,380
Even I, who was born 1.5 kg,

782
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,560
got this body through exercising.

783
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,570
No, I don't think I can do it.

784
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:52,430
I try, but nothing changes.

785
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,050
I used to fall in buses all the time,

786
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:03,710
I swayed in all directions with every turn.

787
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,730
But recently, a bus suddenly stopped,

788
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,580
but only I was standing.

789
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,740
Everyone else fell, but only I was standing.

790
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,320
That made me realize that

791
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,830
my body has been changing without realizing it.

792
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:22,640
I'm sure your body is changing like mine.

793
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,820
I'll tell him.

794
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:00,440
I said you can't park in front of my store!

795
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,710
What the hell?

796
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,280
M-Mr. Kang.

797
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,820
Our bodies remember.

798
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:41,260
The effort he put in to lift the pole every day.

799
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,830
It's on parking right now.

800
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,750
It won't budge, no matter how hard you try.

801
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,640
I think we should stop him.

802
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,590
He can do it alone.

803
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,820
Okay, I'll move.

804
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,920
I'll move, okay?

805
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,510
I'm moving!

806
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,150
Why did you grab the rock earlier?

807
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:53,780
I was scared thinking you'd bash his head.

808
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,390
I was going to use it since it's sloped here.

809
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,700
It would've been dangerous if the car slipped.

810
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,230
You were sweet even in that moment.

811
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:09,880
I'll start working out again once I feel better.

812
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,560
I don't know when it'd be,

813
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,890
but I'll keep trying to become like the Director.

814
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:16,520
Fighting.

815
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,190
- Great.
- Okay.

816
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:26,880
Cheol Nam is so impressive.

817
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,270
It couldn't have been easy to do that.

818
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,420
It's thanks to you.

819
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,070
Thank you.

820
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:39,310
We're already here.

821
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:41,260
- Ms. Lee-
- Director-

822
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:46,160
You go first.

823
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,560
Well, I...

824
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,650
Would you work out with me again-

825
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,830
What did you say?

826
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:03,000
Yo, baby.

827
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,990
Are you here to work out?

828
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,270
You started working out somewhere else.

829
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,160
I'm glad you did.

830
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,450
We got a brand new machine just now.

831
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,580
They normally only sell to hotels,

832
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:21,060
but I managed to get it.

833
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,120
Let's go now.

834
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,640
I...

835
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,180
I'll get going now.

836
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,430
Take care.

837
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:39,530
Don't go.

838
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,260
Don't go, I said.

839
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:52,060
What are you doing right now?

840
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,710
- Let go of her.
- You let go.

841
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,140
- You let go.
- You let go.

842
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,580
- You let go!
- You let go!

843
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,040
You let go!

844
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:04,660
Our gym is getting a mirror with a light today.

845
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,600
Work out with me

846
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,550
and take a post-workout photo

847
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:11,990
and get more than 22,000 likes.

848
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,210
22,000 likes?

849
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:15,630
Yes.

850
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,240
Let's go.

851
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,760
Is a gym a photo studio?

852
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,320
No.

853
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,150
You have almost 30% of body fat.

854
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,080
I can let you lose it better than anyone.

855
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,850
You have hidden intestinal fat. Especially...

856
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:33,880
the fat that's all over your stomach.

857
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,610
I'll burn all of it.

858
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:39,200
Stop fat-shaming me with your sweet talk.

859
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,060
Come to me.

860
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,210
Come to me.

861
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,990
I'll go get my sneakers.

862
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,370
I won't count unless your posture is proper.

863
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:53,620
One.

864
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:54,960
One!

865
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,260
One!

866
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,280
Let's move on now. Why are we still at one?

867
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,900
Face forward and pull properly. One!

868
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,830
One!

869
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:06,890
I shouldn't have come here.

870
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,350
Face forward.

871
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,150
One.

872
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,960
[24-Hr Health Club]

873
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,390
Many people should come
if Mr. Kang posted a comment.

874
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,420
That won't happen easily.

875
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,900
You'll be responsible if you fail again.

876
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,010
- Geez.
- What the...

877
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,670
What's with your faces?

878
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,650
You're making me feel bad for coming.

879
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:57,970
We were told we'd get 120,000 members by now.

880
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,400
120,000 members?

881
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,990
Did you raise the price? Is it 120,000 won?

882
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,070
No, ma'am. It's 30,000 won.

883
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,660
Oh, 30,000 won?

884
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,330
I wouldn't pay 120,000 won to come here.

885
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:12,590
It's because it's still too early in the morning.

886
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:14,660
Everyone must be busy now.

887
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,530
I'm running out of patience.

888
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,540
Are they really coming?

889
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,250
They are.

890
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,510
They are. They said they will.

891
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:32,120
They're here.

892
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,150
We're here!

893
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,690
Gosh, were you waiting for us?

894
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:53,220
Why were you waiting for us?

895
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,240
Just admit it.

896
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,680
You failed to get members.

897
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,000
They haven't left work yet.

898
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,080
Just admit that you failed.

899
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:28,020
Huh? It's SMF.

900
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,320
That person is...

901
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,120
He looks familiar.

902
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,790
I know. I know.

903
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:43,750
It's Yun Sung Bin, an Olympian.

904
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,190
The Iron Man of Korea.

905
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:48,220
His thighs are 67 cm thick.

906
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:00,210
The cafe owner told me that...

you're known for lower-body workouts.

908
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,990
Can I make my thighs 70 cm thick?

909
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:06,540
Yes, you can.

910
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,680
Alex!

911
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,620
Come this way.

912
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:16,660
What's wrong?

913
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,820
There's a bug down here.

914
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,500
It's a ladybug.

915
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,090
Are you scared of this? They're really cute.

916
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:29,250
I'm scared of bugs.

917
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,090
It's safe. Come down.

918
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:35,010
Come this way. Come this way.

919
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,880
Go inside. Go inside.

You barely survived this month,

923
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,740
but I won't tell you to leave.

924
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,350
No, someone should leave.

925
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,680
You'll have to leave this time.

926
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,170
Pardon?

927
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,340
I'm telling you to leave.
