Hello.

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,700
There are countless villains at the gym.

10
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,690
Shit!

11
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,220
Bloody hell!

12
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,710
Damn it!

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,560
The one who appear kind,

14
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,860
but when they face their limit,

15
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,050
they reveal the evil side like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

16
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,340
What's this? Sweat?

17
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,280
Gross.

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,960
The one who grosses out others by leaving traces.

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,390
It's the Aquaman.

20
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,370
Gosh, gosh. I reserved that treadmill.

21
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,340
Don't you see my water bottle here?

22
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,060
You can't just do that.

23
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,610
You said you reserved the inversion table earlier.

24
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,510
Unni, what's going on?

25
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,550
My gosh. She's a new member.

26

She doesn't know the rules around here.

27
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,210
So, I was explaining them to her.

28
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,700
You're the only one who cares about the gym, Unni.

29
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,740
Excuse me. Sorry, sorry.

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,750
She needs more room.

31
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,810
I reserved it.

32

39
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,430
Sir, you need to stretch after exercising.

40

I can't believe anyone's body can be in this state.

189
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,110
Am I that terrible?

190
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,740
Flexibility, muscle strength, fitness,

191
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,140
endurance, and reflexes.

192
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,180
You're in the bottom tier for all of them.

193
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,090
You're basically a zombie.

194
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,010
Zombie?

195
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,380
The whole day has been...

196
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,460
But there's still hope.

197
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,080

198
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,370
It means you do have muscles.

199
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,920
Could you tell me if I can't change quickly?

200
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,760
I need to seek another solution.

201
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,900
- Another solution?
- Another solution?

202
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,030
Yes.

203
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,510
Ms. Lee,

204
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,260
there's no other way to get fit.

205
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,860
Honest movements.

206
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,640
Only they can make you fit.

207
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,900
But...

208
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,720
you can still do it.

209
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,170
Can I really do it?

210
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,320
1.5 kg.

211
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,040
I was born lighter than that small dumbbell.

212
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,650
But I miraculously become the David of Asia.

213
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,800
I'll let you turn into a human

214
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,930
from a zombie, too.

215
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,460
Stop calling me a zombie, okay?

216
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,730
It's not very nice to hear.

217
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,160
Thank you for today.

218
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,540
Anyway, thank you.

219
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,280
Gosh. I'm okay, right?

220
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,140
What are you doing?

221
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,640
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

222
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,210
What's the deal?

223
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,300
- Bye.
- Take care.

224
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,120
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,320
Director, Ms. Lee...

226
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,860
I know it, too.

227
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,800
The first time is exciting for everyone.

228
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,290
First love, first kiss, and...

229
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,370
Sounds like there's only cold water again.

230
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,150
It's because of muscle pain.

231
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,500
Her muscle pain must be severe.

232
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,280
That's because of cold water.

233
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,340
You know just by hearing the scream.

234
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,620
Of course.

235
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,090
The scream from the first muscle pain is

236
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,320
very thrilling and sweet.

237
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,620
I remember my first muscle pain, too.

238
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,940
I've never experienced it in my life.

239
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,330
I wasn't used to it at first.

240
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,010
It felt like my whole body was angry.

241
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,910
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,350
Is this normal?

243
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,370
It can't be good for you.

244
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,590
Gosh, lady.

245

Look at your hair here.

246
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,240
My gosh. Why should anyone

247
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,700
pick up someone else's hair?

248
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,560
Are you losing hair or something?

249
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,850
You lost a whole bunch.

250
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,350
I didn't get to wash my hair.

251
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,730
- You did. You did. It's wet.
- It's wet.

With me?

256
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,820
What are you talking about?

257
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,450
I'm shy, too.

258
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,200
Gosh, I'm sorry.

259
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,930
I'll clean the hair.

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,000

261
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,730
I'm scared.

262
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,240
- Where is it?
- The awakened muscles were saying hello.

263
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,540
I couldn't stop laughing.

264
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,420

Why did you suddenly have to work out, then?

331
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,550
Can working out really change my life?

332
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,200

371
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,670
Bye.

372
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,500
You'd better watch it.

373
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,830
What are you talking about?

374
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,690
Wow, this is great.

375
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,370
I thought our gym should have a selfie zone, too.

376
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,030
All popular gyms have at least one.

377
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,050
#WorkedOutToday. #HealthGram.

378
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,790
Stuff like that.

379
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,780
Why does a gym need a photo zone?

380
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,270
Alex,

381
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,700
muscles aren't for photos.

382
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,900
They're for your body.

383
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,370
Okay.

384
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,050
Try putting one together.

385
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,920
We need to try something for our gym.

386
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,350
- Okay, thank you.
- Right.

387
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,840
Do you know what's replacing that hair salon, by the way?

388
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,400
That place?

389
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,910
A 24-hour gym.

390
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,400
There'd be another gym, right in front of ours?

391
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,010
No, we're moving there.

392
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,780
If Total Life Care becomes a success,

393
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,420
we'll be moving there.

394
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,950
It'd be well-lit, too. Wouldn't that be great?

395
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,050
Gosh, I'm dying.

396
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,020
Mi Ran, are you okay?

397
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,330
Pardon?

398
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,680
You don't have to hide it. We all know.

399
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,950
Mi Ran, you secured the seats for the

400
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,490
fall honeymoon package, right?

401
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,090
Yes, I got the schedule from the local company.

402
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:43,110
I'm adjusting the schedule to add a restaurant.

403
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,190
I know you're busy. Thanks for working on it.

404
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,530
Sure.

405
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,060
By the way, Mi Ran,

406
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,410
what's the busiest job in the world?

407
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,860
A package tour company worker?

408
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,880
A rushed job.

409
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,450
Chief, you're going too far.

410
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm sorry. Was that not funny?

411
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,850
Gosh, I can't suppress my desire to joke.

412
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,330
I mean, she just had a breakup.

413
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,480
But you keep giving her honeymoon packages.

414
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,740
I know work and life should be separate,

415
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,730
but it's painful for me to watch her as a coworker.

416
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,460
Who had a breakup...

417
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,110
What? Did you and Joon Seok break up?

418
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,230
Is that why he transferred to the TF team?

419
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,540
Is that true?

420
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,750
Mi Ran, is that true?

421
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,940
Mi Ran, there's no need to put up with it.

422
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,060
You've been looking sad since earlier.

423
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,780
You groan, too.

424
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,350
It's because I worked out yesterday-

425
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,060
Yes, yes. If it's hard,

426
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,290
I'll give this package to Ye Jin.

427
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,920
- Yes.
- No, I can keep working on it.

428
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,780
Mi Ran, don't worry.

429
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,410
Take this instead. It's scheduled for next week.

430
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,270
You can work on Hot Springs Tour for Elders.

431
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,830
Ye Jin, I appreciate your concern,

432
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,140
but I'm really okay.

433
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,600
Hawaii is my specialty.

434
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,140
I'll work on it.

435
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,210
Of course, you're a pro, Mi Ran.

436
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,110
Are you okay?

437
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,960
I love it.

438
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,670
I'm dying.

439
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,990
By the way, did Joon Seok find someone else?

440
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,430
No, it's not like that.

441
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,130
Did he grow tired, then?

442
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,240
I suppose. You were together for a long time.

443
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,100
It's not like that-

444
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,200
You're so sure I'm the one who got dumped.

445
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,250
It's not like that.

446
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,180
You seemed to be having a hard time.

447
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,070
I'm trying to be nice.

448
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,500
I was wondering how I could help.

449
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,150
Because we're supposed to love our co-workers.

450
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,470
You don't have to help me.

451
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,470
I'm the one who broke up with him.

452
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,820
Pardon? You did?

453
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,390
Why?

454
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,550
Good morning. What did you have for breakfast?

455
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,930
Are you seeing a new man?

456
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,390
- Who? Me?
- A new man?

457
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,650
- A new man?
- What? Who has what?

458
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,720
Here, here, here.

459
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,720
What are you doing, Ye Jin?

460
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,310
He's so handsome.

461
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,800
He's so handsome.

462
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,770
- Daebak.
- His body is amazing, too.

463
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,220
He's no joke.

464
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,890
Why would someone like him date you-

465
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,380
- What?
- Why not?

466
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,360
He's a perfect match for Mi Ran.

467
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,960
I think she can do better.

468
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,080
I know.

469
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,420
I'm saying it's a relief, Mi Ran.

470
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,970
I was worried my wedding would

471
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,840
make you feel uncomfortable.

472
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,280
Wedding?

473
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,180
Oh, right. The wedding.

474
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,860
Joon Seok will come to her wedding, too.

475
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,050
I thought you'd find it awkward to see Joon Seok.

476
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,330
Seriously.

477
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,190
Why would it be awkward?

478
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,010
Why don't you come with him, then?

479
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,900
The venue has tasty food.

480
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,840
That'd be great. Bring him.

481
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,680
I guess you could.

482
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,520
Yes, I'll try mentioning it.

483
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,470
I'm so excited.

484
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,120
Fighting.

485
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,060
He's no joke.

486
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,020
Yesterday...

487
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,250
Did you see it?

488
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,010
You're lying.

489
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,920
What?

490
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,320
Is someone there?

491
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,840
Come here.

492
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,950
Let's sit.

493
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,740
What?

494
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,060
- Let's go.
- Okay, okay. Go.

495
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,640
I think I need to rest for a few weeks.

496
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,250
Is it because of the muscle pain?

497
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,050
Resting won't make it go away.

498
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,740
You need to create worse pain

499
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,710
to make the current pain disappear.

500
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,420
Let me help you right now.

501
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,640
No, I just made an appointment
for a fat-dissolving shot.

502
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,550
Fat-dissolving shot?

503
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,970
Do you not trust my Total Life Care?

504
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,920
If you trust me and work hard for three months,

505
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,420
you could change your life.

506
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,820
There's no time.

507
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,370
I need to wear my combat uniform.

508
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,630
Combat uniform?

509
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:24,400
Yes. I bought one today.

510
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,000
Let me try this on.

511
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,110
Oh, this?

512
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,590
There's only a small size left right now.

513
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,700
Let me still try it on.

514
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,130
Okay.

515
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,740
Huh? What's going on?

516
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,820
Gosh.

517
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,750
A-Are you okay?

518
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,470
Should I recommend something else to you?

519
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,730
No, I'll buy this.

520
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,610
I think it's totally his style.

521
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,680
So,

522
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,030
you want a fat-dissolving shot to fit into clothes?

523
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,870
How could you be so weak?

524
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,780
Cancel it immediately!

525
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,060
I dissolve the fat, not the shot!

526
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,990
- I won't cancel it!
- Cancel it!

527
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,850
I don't want to! I need to wear my combat uniform.

528
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,290
Cancel it! I'll let you wear that uniform.

529
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,580
Really?

530
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,170
I'll give you a full refund if you don't fit in it.

531
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,500
Full refund?

532
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,320
Will you cancel it, then?

533
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,550
Is that even possible?

534
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,820
1.5 kg.

535
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,940
I was born lighter than that small dumbbell.

536
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,000
To get this body, I have-

537
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,550
Gosh, gosh. That's enough. That's enough.

538
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,670
I asked if it's possible.

539
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,600
It's possible.

540
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,910
But you'll be in hell starting now.

541
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,320
I'm in hell already.

542
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,390
Let's start.

543
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,480
Huh? W-What's all this?

544
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,600
You need to go down in size
until you see your ex.

545
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,170
We'll go through three types of hell

546
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,440
and judge the body of yours.

547
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,020
- Judge?
- Firstly,

548
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,460
it's the Lie Hell.

549
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,560
Come on!

550
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,790
Let me try just one bite.

551
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,700
- No, not this time.
- I didn't want it earlier.

552
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,390
I'm sorry.

553
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,600
I'll be conscientious and have just one bite.

554
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,170
Unni. That's not a bite...

555
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,820
Gosh, seriously!

556
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,480
That's one bite for you?

557
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,840
Do you want to die?

558
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,410
Gosh, it's so tasty.

559
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,460
You were never planning to have just one bite.

560
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,980
Wasn't it all a lie?

561
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,420
No, that's one bite for me.

562
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,190
Lie, lie, lie!

563
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,880
Lying that you'd only have one bite,

564
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,660
you consumed a large amount of calories, Ms. Lee.

565
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,460
You're drinking blended chicken breast

566
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,340
twice a day as a diet punishment.

567
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,840
I'm happy to eat as a punishment.

568
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,500
Is this food waste?

569
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,560
Pretend it's sweet and drink it.

570
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,750
Diet is all about the mindset, too.

571
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,100
Okay. Next is Lazy Hell.

572
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,590
Hey, hey, hey! Ji Ran, hurry. Hurry.

573
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,690
What? What? What?

574
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,560
Turn the lights off. Good night.

575
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,630
What's wrong with her?

576
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,280
I know what to eat tomorrow.

577
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,460
I'll eat tteokbokki tomorrow.

578
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,550
You ate tteokbokki.

579
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,130
Even though your four limbs were intact,

580
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,630
you moved as little as possible

581
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,400
and degraded your muscles increasingly.

582
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,630
I was so tired that day.

583
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,420
For lazily neglecting your body, Ms. Lee

584
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,990
will be given a full squat punishment.

585
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,860
What are you doing?

586
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,170
Stop making noises. You're relaxing the abdomen.

587
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,430
- What does that mean?
- Again!

588
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,500
Tell me what that means.

589
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,660
Gosh... I can't do it.

590
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,190
Huh? What? Isn't it heavy?

591
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,840
Three.

592
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,470
It's time to head to Murder Hell.

593
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,230
Murder?

594
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,080
I've never killed anyone.

595
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,220
By saying, "I can't do it.

596
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,770
I'm no good,"

597
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,390
you've been killing
the capable Mi Ran countless times.

598
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,030
Gosh, what kind of bullshit is that?

599
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,910
For doing that, Ms. Lee is...

600
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,250
Yes?

601
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,650
You're being given the "I can do it" punishment.

602
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,070
Pardon?

603
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,430
I can't... I can't do it anymore.

604
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,600
You can do it, Ms. Lee.

605
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,610
A little more.

606
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,000
A little more!

607
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,940
I can't do it. I can't do it!

608
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,570
You can't say, "I can't do it."

609
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,890
You can do it, Ms. Lee.

610
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,720
You need to believe that you can.

611
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,550
You can do it.

612
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,070
I can do it.

613
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,440
You can do it!

614
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,650
I can do it!

615
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,890
Nice. You can do it.

616
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,970
I can... I can do it.

617
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,320
- You can do it.
- I can do it.

618
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,630
Look forward.

619
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,670
Open your eyes. We're here.

620
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,920
Wow.

621
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,140
Look.

622
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,350
You said you couldn't, but you finished the course.

623
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,080
You did it, Ms. Lee.

624
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,130
Director Do,

625
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,430
once I'm through this hell,

626
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:23,320
I'd be able to be confident in front of him, right?

627
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,020
Of course.

628
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,990
Well...

629
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,570
To be honest, I had no faith in Total Life Care.

630
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,520
- Pardon?
- I thought I'd die if I didn't do anything.

631
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,080
I was hurting so much that I wanted to die.

632
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,470
So, on a whim, I spent...

633
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,250
five million won.

634
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:48,380
But now, I believe in it completely.

635
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,370
Total Life Care.

636
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:55,520
You care more about my body than me.

637
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,520
So, when you say, "You can do it,"

638
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,130
I know I can do it.

639
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,710
I believe in you more than myself now.

640
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,780
I'm glad you finally learned that.

641
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,450
Gosh!

642
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:12,080
Wow, I'm finally escaping hell!

643
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,920
Right, did I show you my combat uniform?

644
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,410
No.

645
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,380
Do you want to see it?

646
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,140
What do you think?

647
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,710
An idol group wore it recently, too.

648
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,520
Isn't it pretty?

649
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,640
Is this the combat uniform?

650
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,760
I heard men like this kind of style.

651
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,970
Let's lunge our way back.

652
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,100
I was in a good mood. What's wrong?

653
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,490
I didn't know you wanted

654
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,820
Ready to lunge.

655
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,800
Gosh, what's the problem?

656
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,350
- Ready!
- Really?

657
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,910
- Ready!
- Really?

658
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,490
Don't look back.

659
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,880
Go.

660
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,220
I'll start you.

661
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,700
A hero saves a person's life.

662
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,300
He must. He must.

663
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,480
[24-hour Health Club]

664
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,090
Almost there. Last one!

665
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,130
Are you okay?

666
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:20,020
Gosh, I'm okay. I need to wear my combat uniform.

667
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,780
You told me that you'd...

668
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,650
let me wear this dress.

669
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,030
If you say you can do it, I can.

670
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,410
I'll work hard without doubting from now on.

671
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,670
I can do it, right, Director?

672
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,630
Of course.

673
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,550
I can do it! I can do it!

674
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,840
I was too loud.

675
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,070
I'm sorry.

676
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,290
I'll go now. Thank you.

677
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,210
I can do it, right?

678
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,990
You can do it.

679
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,500
I can do it. I can do it.

680
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,620
You can do it, Lee Mi Ran.

681
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,660
Because Director said you can do it.

682
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,650
You can do it. You can wear the dress.

683
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:06,380
Are you afraid, Do Hyeon Joong?

684
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,520
Alex, what are you doing?
You have the Zumba class next.

685
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,820
Do you really want me to do it?

686
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,540
You agreed to teach it starting today.

687
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,340
I know I did,

688
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,230
but I'm too nervous. Could you do it for me?

689
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,520
I had a nightmare last night, too.

690
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,070
Gosh, what are you doing? Won't you teach us Zumba?

691
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,060
I need to lose weight! Hurry up!

692
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,240
Right now!

693
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,790
Okay.

694
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,250
They're all here now.

695
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,700
And I have a personal training session, too.

696
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,350
But still...

697
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,310
Are you telling me to cancel the Zumba class?

698
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,450
There's no need to.

699
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,920
Don't worry. I'll do it.

700
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,070
What's going on? Stop him!

701
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,250
Director! Director!

702
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,000
You're my hero, Director!

703
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,630
Focus!

704
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,660
Right. Right. Left.

705
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,870
Doo Ri, is this really Zumba?

706
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,920
I don't think so.

707
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,470
I'm running out of breath.

708
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,720
Don't get tired, guys.

709
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,540
We've been doing Zumba for three years.

710
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,780
We have no muscles, but we can dance.

711
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,230
Stop! Stop!

712
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,690
We're all going to die!

713
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,160
Call 911! Right now!

714
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,420
Not 911. Order a jjajangmyeon set. Right now.

715
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,900
Jjajangmyeon?

716
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,560
Hello, sir. This is Doo Ri.

717
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,480
I, Do Hyeon Joong, finally found the answer.

718
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,780
What's the deal?

719
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,510
He said I'd lose the muscle pain soon.

720
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:48,970
I need to give it a moment to go away.

721
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,880
They're open early today.

722
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,250
Looks tasty.

723
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:18,170
This well-fermented kimchi.

724
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,750
You sizzle it in the pork belly fat

725
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:25,150
and wrap it with rice and pork belly.

726
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,020
You finish with the soybean stew broth.

727
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,110
You don't need a fatigue reliever.

728
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,870
This is what you need.

729
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:44,400
Gosh, what am I doing here? I'm sorry.

730
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,410
My gosh...

731
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,560
Rotisserie chicken.

732
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,630
It's so hard to get this stuff these days.

733
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:05,190
You dip it in salt and take a huge bite.

734
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:07,390
When you think you're choking,

735
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:09,900
you take a bite of the refreshing radish kimchi.

736
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,490
It refreshes your throat and chest.

737
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:15,460
You don't need digestive medicine. This is what you need.

738
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,790
Looks tasty.

739
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,800
Wow, the Delimanjoo.

740
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,690
Wow, it smells better than perfume.

741
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,830
It makes everyone turn around.

742
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:42,620
When you smell the Delimajoo and turn around...

743
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,080
Mi Ran.

744
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,950
Joon Seok.

745
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,620
Let's eat it while it's warm. Say, ah.

746
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,950
What are you doing?

747
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,620
You scared me.

748
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,850
You should be thankful, okay?

749
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,210
If it wasn't for my fist,

750
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,260
you would've eaten all those carbs.

751
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,760
Gosh...

752
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,050
What? Give it to me.

753
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,580
What are you doing?

754
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:38,070
I'm increasing your movement range.

755
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:41,390
Gosh, crazy hell training...

756
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,480
Let's go to the gym.

757
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,720
Hold on.

758
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,950
We're done working out today. We're doing it again?

759
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,300
- There's no end to working out.
- Pardon?

760
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,030
You keep doing it without giving up.

761
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,350
Let's go.

762
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,990
No, no, no. I can't work out anymore today.

763
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,480
I really can't... I'll die if I do more! I'll die!

764
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,810
I'm dead.

765
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,730
You're back to life.

766
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,060
I won't eat it. I won't.

767
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,650
There really was no end to working out.

768
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,820
I didn't notice my body changing.

769
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,880
- Here's the report.
- Thanks, Mi Ran.

770
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,620
Sure.

771
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:28,220
But I kept following the Director's instructions.

772
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,720
I just got grumpy some days.

773
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,760
And I got annoyed some days.

774
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:37,930
Nice, nice!

775
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:41,520
16. You're almost there. 16. Go down.

776
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,530
Okay, you can do it.

777
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,610
You can do it.

778
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,100
Nice. 17!

779
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,890
Because that was the only way to save myself.

780
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,850
By the way, what did you have for lunch?

781
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,180
Why do you ask?

782
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:07,670
Because your breath sounds sweet.

783
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,890
I had gamjatang.

784
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:13,510
Once it enters your mouth,

785
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,370
gamjatang must turn into gamja tanghulu.

786
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:20,750
Do you want to feel the savoriness and sweetness

787
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,470
at the same time?

788
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:24,470
Gosh, that's so sexy.

789
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,840
Come here, babe.

790
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,850
Fit, please. Please.

791
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:41,350
Please fit.

792
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,110
Gosh, daebak.

793
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,140
Am I really...

794
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,000
Am I wearing this?

795
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,670
Whoa, I can sit, too!

796
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,100
Wow! It fits!

797
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,000
Hey, Lee Ji Ran! I'm wearing this dress!

798
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,140
I fit into this dress!

799
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,330
Hey, Lee Ji Ran!

800
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,680
Hey, I'm wearing the dress!

801
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,360
Hello. I thought you were sleeping-

802
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,260
Hey, I'm wearing this dress!

803
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,770
So, what?

804
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:03,000
This dress! It's size 55! Size 55!

805
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,860
So, what do you want?

806
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,890
Seriously!

807
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,940
Gosh, what's wrong with her?

808
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,870
♫ I can't stop this feeling ♫

809
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:22,190
♫ The unstoppable feeling ♫

810
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:26,650
♫ My weak heart keeps poking out ♫

811
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,480
♫ I can't stop this feeling ♫

812
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,380
Keep the balance.

813
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:44,000
- Director! Director!
- Yummy.

814
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,960
Where? Where is he?

815
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,720
Director! Director!

816
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,710
Look at me. Look.

817
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,520
I can sit, walk in this.

818
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,070
I even ran all the way here.

819
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:57,620
I'm wearing it. The combat uniform.

820
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,800
Why are you so happy? Of course, it fits.

821
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,640
I said you can do it, didn't I?

822
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,450
Yes, it's all thanks to you.

823
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:13,310
Can I ask you just one more favor?

824
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,330
Don't even say you'd skip training.

825
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:18,570
Please go to the wedding with me tomorrow.

826
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:21,580
Wedding?

827
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,740
Go with her.

828
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:27,200
Go with her! Go with her!

829
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,100
Go with her!

830
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,640
Tomorrow is like the World Cup
and the Olympics for me.

831
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,080
So, you, my coach

832
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,610
need to keep me strong like right now.

833
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,260
Help her!

834
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,730
Help her! Help her!

835
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,210
Fine.

836
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:53,550
I'll help you with your World Cup until the end.

837
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:04,350
Ms. Lee?

838
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,890
Do the lower body workout since you're here.

839
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:10,470
Why say that when I'm in a good mood?

840
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:15,450
So, will the three of you join in?

841
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,250
Take care, everyone.

842
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,720
It's a beautiful night.

843
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,980
Fighting.

844
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,500
See you tomorrow, Director!

845
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,820
- Ms. Lee.
- Yes?

846
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,040
This isn't the dress I saw yesterday.

847
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,290
Your biceps and femoral regions seem stressed.

848
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,750
Are you even able to breathe?

849
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:32,750
These are my sister's clothes. As for that dress...

850
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,350
my sister ran away wearing it.

851
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,620
But...

852
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,150
But?

853
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:48,410
This is for the better.

854
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,880
This is more his style.

855
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,560
And it was hidden deep inside her closet.

856
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,130
I think it's really expensive.

857
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,200
Nice.

858
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,580
Do I look very uncomfortable?

859
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:07,270
Yes. I feel uncomfortable looking at you.

860
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,060
I feel annoyed hearing that.

861
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,370
Let's go.

862
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,960
How annoying.

863
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,730
Isn't that Mi Ran?

864
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:26,160
That must be him. Her new man.

865
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,310
Oh, really?

866
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,610
- It's Mi Ran.
- Yes.

867
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,960
How about we do thighs afterward?

868
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,530
We haven't done it in a while.

869
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:37,730
- Thighs?
- No, we did it yesterday. Why do it again?

870
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,880
- Yesterday?
- Let's to the chest, then.

871
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,180
Chest?

872
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,660
How about the butt instead of the chest?

873
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,620
I find the butt most exciting.

874
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,590
- The bride... The bride...
- Yes, she's here.

875
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:53,160
Seriously.

876
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,400
You came.

877
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,140
- Yes.
- Hello.

878
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,340
Mi Ran, why are you so pretty today?

879
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,480
Gosh. I went to a hair salon.

880
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,850
- Hair salon...
- You look so pretty today.

881
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:05,370
Seriously.

882
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,710
This is my-

883
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,180
I know. I know. It's the one you're seeing, right?

884
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:14,440
Pardon? The one she's seeing?

885
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:25,440
By the way, you both look so healthy.

886
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,550
No, he means you look great together.

887
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,670
We'll go inside, then.

888
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,640
Okay.

889
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,730
I'm sorry. I was so flustered.

890
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,940
What's this?

891
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:47,520
My biceps are on fire today.

892
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,550
Try removing your hand.

893
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:50,960
You're so crazy. Let go.

894
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,190
Seriously. You must be crazy.

895
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,770
Your muscles are still so weak.

896
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,600
Let's do the arm workout today instead.

897
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,580
I want to do the butt.

898
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,440
Butt, my foot.

899
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,580
You still can't remove it. What's the problem?

900
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,180
Go easy on me.

901
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,540
Will we really go to the gym today?

902
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,510
Isn't that obvious?

903
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,070
What's wrong?

904
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:19,240
Let's just go.

905
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,930
Pardon? The game hasn't even started.

906
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:24,590
I don't think I could do it. I want to leave.

907
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,410
No...

908
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,300
Are you running away?

909
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,790
Yes, I am. I don't think I could do it.

910
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:35,180
That's not true.

911
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,830
You can do it, Ms. Lee.

912
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,810
Do you know what the hardest thing at the gym is?

913
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:45,950
It's going there every day.

914
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:50,390
And you achieved that difficult thing.

915
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:58,220
You couldn't do the squats with just the pole at first.

916
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,070
But you lift 30 kg now.

917
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,470
You couldn't do five reps of the burpee at first.

918
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,560
You do three sets of 10 now.

919
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,400
And most importantly, you...

920
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,900
learned from the 1.5 kg miracle,

921
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:18,010
Do Hyeon Joong, himself.

922
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,250
Seriously.

923
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:32,830
Okay. Suck your tummy in.

924
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,440
Lower the shoulder joints.

925
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,410
Straighten your torso.

926
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,930
Relax your neck.

927
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,570
Okay.

928
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,390
Nice.

929
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:50,700
Go. Stand confidently.

930
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,950
Joon Seok.

931
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,510
Have you been well?

932
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,370
Long time no see.

933
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,180
Yes, Mi Ran.

934
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:22,560
You look great.

935
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,050
You look a bit different.

936
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:28,450
Well, I started working out.

937
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:33,350
The groom will walk down the aisle now.

938
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:36,300
A big round of applause, please.

939
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,330
Please welcome the groom.

940
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,470
Mi Ran.

941
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:49,040
You know what I said at the park?

942
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:55,470
Fighting!

943
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:00,280
Yes, the groom came in energetically.

944
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,310
Please applaud them one more time.

945
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:08,080
That lady is glowing.

946
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:10,760
- What's that?
- What?

947
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,350
She must be crazy.

948
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:16,160
What? What's her problem?

949
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:23,040
Gosh, what's this? What's this?

950
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,740
"I love sex"?

951
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,390
Mi Ran, why do you have to...

952
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:34,940
And here comes the highlight of the day.

953
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:38,350
The bride will be walking down the aisle.

954
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:43,020
She's more beautiful than anyone today.

955
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:46,330
Please welcome the bride.

956
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,900
Oh, no...

957
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,810
Director.

958
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,340
Let's go, Ms. Lee.

959
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,740
[We thank Kim Joon Hyeon for the special appearance]

[Epilogue]

961
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:49,470
But it's still a wedding. I should be proper.

962
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:58,470
The design is great,

963
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:01,370
but the sleeves are too short.

964
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,690
I can't raise my arms.

965
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:07,200
When did I buy a shirt like this?

966
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,450
I can't breathe.

967
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,040
Not this one.

968
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:16,930
Yeah. Simple is best.

969
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:33,060
Gosh, I can't move much.

970
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,320
I'm ready.

971
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:58,350
[Pump Up the Healthy Love]

972
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,530
♫ My weak heart keeps poking out ♫

973
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:06,710
♫ I can't stop this feeling ♫

974
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:10,350
♫ I'll say however I feel ♫

975
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:14,730
♫ Girl, I can't stop this feeling ♫

976
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:22,350
♫ I want to speak more whenever I see you ♫

977
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:25,860
I think you're the one
who gets in your way the most.

978
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,640
I get in my way?

979
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,850
I heard you're giving Ms. Lee a refund.

980
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:32,360
Will the feeling grow muscles if you reciprocate it?

981
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,360
I hope you stop being nosy with me.

982
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,170
I can live well on my own.

983
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:39,150
Long time no see, Do Hyeon Joong.

984
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,290
What the... a huge gym?

985
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:44,360
What? Looks like our members are going there.

986
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,260
Did he open a gym here because of you?

987
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,280
Shouldn't you be responsible as a director?

988
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,900
I'll turn them into my clients.

989
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:52,460
What if you fail? Can you promise you'd

990
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,700
quit as a director and leave the gym?

991
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:55,890
Help me.

992
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:57,670
Come to me.
