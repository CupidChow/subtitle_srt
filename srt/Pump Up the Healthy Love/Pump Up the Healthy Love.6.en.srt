00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,000
We made a reservation at an octopus restaurant.

188
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,720
Pollock doesn't make you fat.

189
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,460
Yes, yes.

190
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,290
Okay, seven.

191
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,270
Director, don't worry.

192
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,520
I'll make sure tons of people sign up.

193
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,320
Yes.

194
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,000
It's tasty. It's tasty.

195
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,010
Gosh, I feel so light since I exercised.

196
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,670
I became so fit.

197
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,400
So fit. So fit.

198
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,840
What are you doing? It's so distracting.

199
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,090
You're kicking up dust. Stop.

200
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,060
Guys,

201
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,570
do you want to get thin?

202
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,660
I've been in such great shape lately.

203
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,260
So, I want to recommend something to you.

204
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,320
What are you trying to sell? Don't bother.

205
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,160
We've been fooled plenty of times.

206
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,940
What is it? Squalene? Pomegranate?

207
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,430
Or barley sprouts?

208
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,240
It's nothing like that kind of stuff.

209
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,400
Don't be shocked.

210
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,800
Okay. I used to look like this.

211
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,530
You saw it, right? Okay...

212
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,820
But I became like this.

213
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,820
Gosh, seriously.

214
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,880
I look like this with a filter, too.

215
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,640
Isn't that someone else?

216
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,510
Cut the preamble and get to the point.

217
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,000
We made a reservation at an octopus restaurant.

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,430
Director Do's...

219
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,120
Total Life Care.

220
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,720
What? You want us to sign up for the expensive PT.

221
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,490
It's nothing like other PT.

222
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,690
Not only does he plan your meals,

223
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,000
you get intimate 1:1 workout sessions,

224
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,450
and he cares for your body as if it's his.

225
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,650
And you get to nurture health and friendship here.

226
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,520
And you chat and laugh together like this, too.

227
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,260
It'd be so nice.

228
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,830
I'm sure it is. It's just expensive.

229
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,090
By the way, why do you work so hard for the gym?

230
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,200
Do you get a cut?

231
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,250
No, it's not like that. I just really love it.

232
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,750
If you work out with him,

233
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,750
you get to work out anytime during the day.

234
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,100
Unni, we'll be late to our octopus place.

235
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,300
- Gosh!
- Let's get going.

236
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,060
Octopus?

237
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,550
Come on.

238
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,890
She's coming.

239
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,910
It's hard. They're not easy to please.

240
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,880
It'd be nice if they just got started.

241
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,220
I think they still feel negative
about the idea of PT.

242
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,310
But still, thank you, Ms. Lee.

243
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,210
Don't mention it.

244
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,660
I wanted to be helpful.

245
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,240
How can I help you?

246
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,010
Director Do, will you really train me

247
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,050
privately for 24 hours?

248
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,600
Of course.

249
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,060
- 30%.
- Discount.

250
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:06,770
If so, maybe I'll start tomorrow.

251
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,650
Thank you.

252
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,060
She acted like she wouldn't do it.

253
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,460
What's going on, anyway?

254
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,990
This is all thanks to you.

255
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,440
W-What is it?

256
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,600
Ms. Lee.

257
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,740
Yes?

258
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,040
Did you know?

259
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,690
Know what?

260
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,460
You have...

261
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,860
calluses here.

262
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,560
Calluses?

263
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,600
Congratulations.

264
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,190
You have calluses on your hands.

265
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,500
It's a badge of honor for people who work out.

266
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,900
A valuable badge only people like us have.

267
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,210
People like us?

268
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,940
People like us?

269
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,520
Yes.

270
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,250
<i>He said "us." Us.</i>

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,810
Put this on.

272
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,060
Pardon?

273
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,500
People like us don't put lotion on our faces,

274
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,660
but we need to put hand cream.

275
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,860
It'd be hard to lift dumbbells
if your hands bleed.

276
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,470
Thank you.

277
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,300
It smells so good.

278
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,560
You can keep it, then.

279
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,440
That's not what I was asking.

280
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,560
I bought one and got another for free.

281
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,260
You shouldn't have.

282
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,190
<i>I'm home, Lee Ji Ran.</i>

283
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,020
Gosh, why are my hands so sore today?

284
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,300
Hey, do you have a hand cream?

285
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,500
My trainer said people who work out like us

286
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,420
need to moisturize our hands. Seriously.

287
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,040
Right. I got a hand cream as a gift today.

288
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,960
I almost forgot about it.

289
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,740
Take your shirt off.

290
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,010
What?

291
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,460
What?

292
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,670
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

293
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,050
Why is your face rotten?

294
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,830
- Take your shirt off, I said.
- What?

295
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,280
This? Why?

296
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,920
I'll throw it away.

297
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,080
Take it off.

298
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,250
Hey, l-let go. Why throw away good clothes?

299
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,660
- Dan was wearing that when he was here.
- This?

300
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,850
I'm throwing away everything
that has Dan's trace on it.

301
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,590
Take it off now.

302
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,180
G-Gosh it hurts...

303
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,340
Why? What's this fuss about now?

304
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,540
Seriously. You pinched me.

305
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,270
What is it? Did you fight?

306
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,580
We broke up.

307
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,790
Give me a break.

308
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,480
In a few hours, you'll be like,

309
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,170
"I love you" and whatnot

310
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,180
and kiss each other. I don't buy it.

311
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,420
It's for real this time.

312
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,100
He can't write songs because
I make him too happy.

313
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,890
He said he needs to be deficient.

314
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,560
Dan writes songs?

315
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,530
I thought he was your shadow.

316
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,890
He's a genius artist, okay?

317
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,310
Take it off now, I said.

318
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,590
It's my shirt.

319
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,820
Let go of me.

320
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,080
Hey! Are you okay?

321
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,890
Let me see. Let me see.

322
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,870
Geez, why did you have to pull me?

323
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,040
It's my shirt.

324
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,920
Take it off, I said.

325
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,320
I told you to take it off, didn't I?

326
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,510
I'll throw all of them away.

327
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,360
The world without Dan

328
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,120
is completely meaningless, Unni.

329
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,160
I miss Dan.

330
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,750
Hey, stop crying. Don't cry over stuff like that.

331
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,820
It's over if you broke up already.

332
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,330
Don't make it sound so easy.

333
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,900
I'm not making it sound easy.

334
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,530
When I first broke up with Joon Seok,

335
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,630
I thought my life was ruined.

336
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,340
But look at me now. I moved on, and I'm fine.

337
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,010
Moved on, my foot.

338
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,930
How do I know you forgot about him?

339
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,680
Geez, how upsetting.

340
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,300
Here. Look.

341
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,550
What's this?

342
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,750
[From Joon Seok: Message was deleted]

343
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,340
Last night, I got this message,

344
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,380
but as usual, I ate chicken breast,

345
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,400
read a self-help book,

346
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,130
and I even came back from the gym just now.

347
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,760
What do you think? Can you believe me?

348
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,680
Unni, you got this explosive message,

349
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,540
but how could you be fine?

350
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,920
How? How is this possible?

351
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,980
I don't know. I guess working out

352
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,910
put calluses on my heart.

353
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,840
Do you really want to forget Kang Dan?

354
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,740
Yes.

355
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,690
Very, very, very much.

356
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,360
Should I help you forget?

357
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,540
Yes.

358
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,910
Just trust me.

359
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,510
You can become like me, too.

360
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,840
Unni!

361
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,010
How upsetting. How come no one
in our family seems fine?

362
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,860
Stop crying. Stop.

363
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,670
Last one. One.

364
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,750
Good work.

365
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,530
You've never done PT before. So, I was worried.

366
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,870
But you're more fit than I thought. You're good.

367
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,160
Wasn't it hard?

368
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,850
No, this isn't hard at all.

369
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,590
I make kimchi with 100 cabbages alone.

370
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,460
I'm sure I'm as strong as you.

371
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,250
But fitness isn't all about strength.

372
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,160
If you're strong but inflexible,

373
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,070
you get injured.

374
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,550
Your shoulder muscles were very stiff today.

375
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,220
Stretch a lot at home.

376
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,370
Okay, Director Do. I'll stretch a lot.

377
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,260
That's it for today's session, then.

378
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,530
Get home safely.

379
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,670
Okay. High-five.

380
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,770
Finally.

381
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,290
What day is it today? Yes.

382
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,250
It's an upper, lower body,
and cardio day. Everything!

383
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,840
Okay, I'll start with my back, then.

384
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,620
Director Do.

385
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,010
You haven't left yet?

386
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,170
No. I do things properly when I learn something.

387
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,800
Could you teach me how to stretch the flank again?

388
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,160
I'm a PT member.

389
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,670
I can ask that much, right?

390
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,270
Of course.

391
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,800
Hold this cloth firmly at your shoulder width.

392
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,840
And move it up like this.

393
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,050
And tilt sideways like this.

394
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,900
Pause for 15 to 30 seconds like this.

395
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,000
And move back up like this.

396
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,380
Gosh, thank you.

397
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,290
I pay money for PT.

398
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,530
You'd be happy if I became good, right?

399
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,040
Of course. I appreciate that

400
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,010
you're so passionate.

401
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,490
- Really?
- Yes.

402
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,750
Finally.

403
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,860
Now, it's truly all about me.

404
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,860
Once again, bon appétit.

405
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,590
Director Do!

406
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,360
What's the beverage you always drink

407
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,650
after you're done working out?

408
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,730
I tend to do everything properly.

409
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,230
You mean, the protein drink?

410
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,100
This is chocolate milk.

411
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
You told me not to drink shikhye.

412
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,020
But you've been drinking chocolate milk?

413
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,850
- It's protein.
- It's protein.

414
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,340
It's the same thing.

415
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,990
It's tasty.

416
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,000
Finally.

417
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,670
It's truly, truly all about me now.

418
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,400
Okay. Bon appétit.

419
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,130
Director Do.

420
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,320
Can I try this, too?

421
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,960
I've always been curious about it.

422
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,730
<i>The dominating force
of this gym and this area</i>

423
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,360
<i>started torturing me 24-7.</i>

424
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,890
Director Do!

425
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,100
What's this for?

426
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,310
It's a belt.

427
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,920
Director Do,

428
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,770
I think we should get an air purifier.

429
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,490
And a conditioner is important
for female members.

430
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,180
It must be so dusty.

431
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,500
The members cough a lot, too.

432
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,010
Should we get one from the store?

433
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,590
They're having a sale right now.

434
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,810
Director Do. Director Do. Director Do.

435
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,720
Director Do. Director Do.

436
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,700
Director Do!

437
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,560
Director Do. Director Do,

438
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,790
what's that thing?

439
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,500
- Director.
<i>- We're leaving now.</i>

440
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,470
<i>Good night.</i>

441
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,800
That was good.

442
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,430
Director Do!

443
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,380
Look at this. My muscles are growing.

444
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,930
My biceps are popping up.

445
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,640
Aren't you going home, Ms. Im?

446
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,070
Why? Are you sick of working out with me?

447
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,370
You told me to ask anything 24-7.

448
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,940
Of course not.

449
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,130
But resting is a part of working out, too.

450
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:55,950
Your muscles grow when you're resting.

451
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,320
What are you saying?

452
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,240
I pay so much for PT.

453
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,140
I need to get the most out of the 24-hour gym.

454
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,570
I'm getting hungry. I should order jjajangmyeon.

455
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,910
There's a 24-hr Chinese restaurant.

456
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,350
What the 24-hr.

457
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,900
- Mi Ran.
- Yes.

458
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,930
What should I do?

459
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,160
I just met with the president.

460
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,330
He wants to schedule the next live show.

461
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,140
The new Hawaii package was a big hit.

462
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,710
Really?

463
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,390
Congrats.

464
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,560
Thank you. Thank you.

465
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,280
You might actually go to Hawaii at this rate.

466
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,630
Gosh, that's...

467
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,450
Of course, I should go to Hawaii.

468
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,330
Let's go to Hawaii.

469
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,080
Huh? Why?

470
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,680
Huh? Why?

471
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,850
Huh? Why?

472
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,040
My gosh.

473
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,480
Congrats, Mi Ran.

474
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,040
Thank you.

475
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,350
- By the way, Mi Ran...
- Yeah?

476
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,770
Never mind.

477
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,050
I think it'd only stir you up.

478
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,180
Okay, don't tell me. I don't want to hear it

479
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,680
and get all upset.

480
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,710
It was Joon Seok who recommended you

481
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,690
to the Hawaii PR team.

482
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,600
- What?
- Aren't you surprised?

483
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,170
But I can't bring myself to understand.

484
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,320
On my wedding day, it seemed like

485
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,330
Joon Seok was totally done with you.

486
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,380
Why did he recommend you for the Live Market?

487
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,010
Did he want to send you to Hawaii?

488
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,640
So, he won't see you anymore?

489
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,730
Or did he want to create a meme out of you

490
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,180
and humiliate you?

491
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,940
Why are you always curious about reasons?

492
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,800
Aren't you curious?

493
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,900
Your ex-boyfriend recommended you to the PR team.

494
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,700
They said they liked my proposal.

495
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,180
Well, I know that, too.

496
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,500
But I'm just worried.

497
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,620
I appreciate you worrying,
but Joon Seok isn't so petty.

498
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,900
I know that well.

499
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,390
Okay.

500
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,920
I'll get going now. I'm meeting someone.

501
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,790
The Chief hasn't even left yet.

502
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,820
Gosh, our superstar can leave now.

503
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,160
Get going.

504
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,350
I'll go, then. See you tomorrow.

505
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,160
Bye.

506
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,780
Ye Jin, do you know what time it is in India now?

507
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,790
India? Just one second.

508
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,660
A travel agent should know that right away.

509
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,700
Nesia.*
(Means "It's four.")

510
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,120
Indonesia.

511
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,810
Sorry. Sorry. See you tomorrow.

512
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,840
[24-Hour Health Club]

513
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,100
Have a good workout.

514
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,570
Unni, this is like a different world.

515
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,670
You'll get used to it soon, too.

516
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,610
Okay. The gym consists of...

517
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,980
the cardio zone, equipment zone,
and free weight zone.

518
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,260
Start with the cardio zone.

519
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,580
It's for newbies like you.

520
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,690
Right. When I signed up for a gym,

521
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,780
I only did that for two days and quit.

522
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,560
It's because of your fear of muscle training.

523
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,710
You need to get over that fear

524
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,960
to enter the equipment zone over there.

525
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,440
Equipment zone?

526
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,310
It's for intermediate members.

527
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,110
If you know how to use more than three kinds here,

528
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,260
you're given the right to post with

529
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,400
#WorkedOutToday.

530
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,780
It's considered a success
if you get to that point.

531
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,060
Did you advance to that zone, too?

532
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,810
I'm over there.

533
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,210
I work out there.

534
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,200
Only the advanced members gather there.

535
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,740
It's the free weight zone.

536
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,850
It's all about you and the weights.

537
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,840
It's a sacred space.

538
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,150
Daebak.

539
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,990
Unni, you're so cool.

540
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,610
Huh? Director.

541
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,520
Muscular evening.

542
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,800
I'm not having a muscular evening.

543
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,370
- Why?
- Thanks to your genius proposal,

544
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,540
I have no time to rest at all.

545
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,220
That's a good thing, right?

546
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,760
This is my little sister.

547
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,060
I thought she should work out, so I brought her.

548
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,780
What the...

549
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,210
By the way...

550
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,140
Your shoulders are so broad.

551
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,400
W-What's wrong with your face?

552
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,610
I just look like this.

553
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,300
I have a smiley face.

554
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,590
Mi Ran, what will you do today?

555
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,940
Today?

556
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,680
I'll start with quadriceps and

557
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,310
finish the lower body
with biceps femoris and triceps surae.

558
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,010
I'll do the dorsi, pectoral muscles, and

559
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,280
finish the upper half with biceps and triceps.

560
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,230
What was that, a space language?

561
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,090
Get muscular, then.

562
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,610
Thank you.

563
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,020
Director Do!

564
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,810
Should I help your sister if it's her first time?

565
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,050
It's okay.

566
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,780
She'll just have a casual orientation today.

567
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,700
Where's the Director Do?

568
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,050
Over there.

569
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,930
Please. Let me help her.

570
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,530
It's okay.

571
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,480
People like us can handle it ourselves.

572
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,520
What the us?

573
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,180
Director Do.

574
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,490
- Hello.
- Hi, Ms. Lee.

575
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,900
I'm doing PT.

576
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,910
Congrats.

577
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,940
Come here, Director Do.

578
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,100
I want to do that.

579
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,830
What? Why are you so fast?

580
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,340
This is nothing.

581
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,460
I ride much faster normally,

582
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,800
but I'm riding slowly

583
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,090
to stay with you. Slowly.

584
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:02,710
Gosh, Daebak. You're amazing, Unni.

585
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,030
Daebak.

586
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,630
You've warmed up, right?

587
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,010
If you're warmed up with cardio,

588
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,620
we'll start lifting.

589
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,340
Follow me.

590
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,510
You said only advanced members come here.

591
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,150
I thought I wasn't allowed here.

592
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,590
It's okay. You have me.

593
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,070
Oh, right.

594
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,930
It's kind of like how I let you

595
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:39,650
into the club, right?

596
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,990
What?

597
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,050
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

598
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:48,210
We'll start the shoulder workout. Watch carefully.

599
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,400
Unni, aren't those heavy?

600
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,130
This is nothing.

601
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,160
This workout is called...

602
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,950
side lateral raise,

603
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,440
so-called, SLR.

604
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,840
It's for the shoulders.

605
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,990
- Watch carefully and follow me.
- Okay.

606
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,820
Unni, that was amazing!

607
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,450
You were like an eagle.

608
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,980
You can do it if you practice, too.

609
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,920
Look.

610
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,490
Isn't that 10 kg?

611
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,340
I think she's overdoing it.

612
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,200
- I think this will be too hard for you.
- Huh?

613
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,520
Let's try the equipment. Equipment.

614
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,100
I-I'm dizzy.

615
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,500
This is...

616
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,630
for an arm workout.

617
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,050
Arm.

618
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,780
Yes.

619
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,760
This is...

620
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,730
- Let me show you.
- Okay.

621
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,890
- Ms. Lee, it's dangerous-
- Don't.

622
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,790
What? That's for chest, not the arms.

623
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,180
- Don't.
- I...

624
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,380
I get it now. It's...

625
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,670
not the weight I'm used to. Hold on.

626
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,060
Right now, cockiness is overtaking her.

627
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,430
She's basically high.

628
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,400
If her sister blows her cover,

629
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,830
she might get injured.

630
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,430
Leave her.

631
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,470
Gosh, Unni, you're so cool.

632
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,070
- Daebak.
- You shouldn't do too many for a demo.

633
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,900
Okay.

634
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,700
All right.

635
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,030
Okay. Arms at 90 degrees.

636
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,170
90 degrees. 90 degrees.

637
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:47,310
I'll do it like you...

638
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,170
Hold on.

639
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,920
Hold on.

640
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,970
Beginners can't do what Ms. Lee does.

641
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,980
Okay. Let's start at an easy level.

642
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,130
Okay.

643
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,690
- Keep your torso straight.
- Okay.

644
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,110
Push out your chest.

645
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,710
Try it.

646
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,220
Nice.

647
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,160
What the...

648
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,730
Gosh.

649
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,070
My...

650
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,980
My Mr. David trophy...

651
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,290
Is it important?

652
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,700
I mean,

653
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,430
as a member who gets PT,

654
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,690
I couldn't stand the gym

655
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:54,510
getting so dusty.

656
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,640
You breathe hard when you work out.

657
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,190
You inhale all the dust.

658
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,890
I had to...

659
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:04,060
Gosh, my trophy.

660
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,400
If you cleaned on your own,

661
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,970
I wouldn't have done anything.

662
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,830
Since I pay a lot for the gym,

663
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,670
I started noticing things I didn't notice

664
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,990
when I just did Zumba.

665
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,210
I see.

666
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,890
Let's talk outside.

667
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,070
Shall we? Gosh...

668
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,620
I wish you had cleaned a bit...

669
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,890
<i>My pectoral muscle is gone.</i>

670
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,820
It makes the air nice and clear.

671
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,470
Yes, yes. You're okay, right?

672
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,900
<i>But what's gone is...</i>

673
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,950
<i>not just the trophy's pectoral muscle.</i>

674
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,290
What's going on, Director?

675
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,890
It's gone. It's gone!

676
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,990
It's gone? What's gone?

677
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,290
Was it robbery?

678
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,540
Have we been robbed?

679
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,830
My deltoids.

680
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,500
Your deltoids are gone?

681
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,190
My once-tight shirt is loose now.

682
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,470
I think they're still there.

683
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,340
Of course.

684
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,190
From dawn to late night, she keeps...

685
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,330
<i>Director Do!</i>

686
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,250
<i>Director Do! Director Do! Director Do!</i>

687
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,550
She doesn't give me a moment to work out.

688
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:22,200
Even the two-year-old Ji Ho
didn't tie me down so much.

689
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,430
N-No!

690
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,150
The director losing his muscles

691
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,230
is worse than losing profit.

692
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,920
I can't let things go on like this.

693
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,410
[Client Im Seong Im]

694
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,060
Yes, Ms. Im.

695
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,250
I was just about to call you.

696
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,610
Yes, I'll see you there tomorrow.

697
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,010
Is it because I got so thin?

698
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,130
What? Are you embarrassed
to be here with an ahjumma?

699
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,540
No.

700
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,480
I'm embarrassed my arms got thin.

701
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,700
Gosh, you look great.

702
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,780
What the skinny?

703
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,330
You know, I felt bad and...

704
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:41,170
I wanted to treat my teacher to a delicious meal.

705
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,740
You said you had something to tell me, too.

706
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,520
Well, the thing is...

707
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,390
Would you like to order?

708
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:55,040
We'll have two of the most expensive course meal.

709
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,620
I'll get you two ribeye steaks.

710
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,850
Hold on.

711
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,030
- Which cut is the ribeye?
- It's ggotdeungshim, ggotdeungshim.

712
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,950
It has plenty of fat and has nice marbling-

713
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,590
Two tenderloin steaks, please.

714
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,880
Why?

715
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,720
If you want beef, have tenderloin.

716
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,240
It has no fat and has plenty of protein and iron.

717
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,520
It's high-quality protein.

718
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,400
You don't have to worry.

719
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,780
We'll have two tenderloin steaks, then.

720
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,990
- Okay, I'll get it ready.
- Okay.

721
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,310
What did you want to tell me, Director Do?

722
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:33,370
I'll tell you after we consume
high-quality protein.

723
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,540
I get to come to a place like this with a friend.

724
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:48,370
- Pardon?
- My best friend these days is you.

725
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,600
We do see each other all day, every day.

726
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,510
Eat a lot, Director Do.

727
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,270
Thank you for the meal.

728
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,610
Waiter!

729
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,220
Water!

730
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,150
W-What's wrong?

731
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,690
Be quiet.

732
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,670
What's wrong?

733
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,190
Let's go now, Director.

734
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,740
R-Right now? We only had a bite.

735
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,470
- This place is amazing.
- What's wrong?

736
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,190
Is someone here?

737
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,120
That's...

738
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,270
my husband.

739
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,780
Husband-

740
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,750
Don't look.

741
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,610
Why? Why are you hiding?

742
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,200
It's adultery.

743
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,640
A...

744
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,100
Adultery?

745
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,360
Are you mistaking our relationship?

746
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,930
We're nothing but a trainer and a client.

747
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,700
No, I mean, those two.

748
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,340
What the adultery?

749
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,050
I can't run into them.

750
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,100
- They're coming this way.
- Gosh, gosh...

751
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,820
No, no! Director Do, do something!

752
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,880
L-Like what?

753
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,010
H-Hide me. Hide me.

754
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,130
H-Hide you?

755
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,300
Forgive me.

756
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,550
Do people fight like that these days?

757
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,150
How funny.

758
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,370
The man won.

759
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,890
Are you okay?

760
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,820
Is that bastard gone?

761
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,040
I put on makeup for once, but it was ruined.

762
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,180
What a shame.

763
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,630
I'm sorry.

764
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,180
I was flustered earlier.

765
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,910
It's okay.

766
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,350
Thanks to that, I didn't get caught.

767
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,360
Why did you hide?

768
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,400
Shouldn't you have asked what he was doing?

769
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,900
- I can't.
- Why not?

770
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,190
If I find out he's cheating,

771
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,400
we need to get divorced.

772
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,150
If I put up with it,

773
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,600
nothing would happen.

774
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,810
Pardon?

775
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,710
I can't get divorced yet.

776
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,450
My daughter needs to get married and-

777
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,000
- But still-
- Director Do,

778
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,360
it must've been tough for you,
since I was at the gym all the time.

779
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,920
But...

780
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,500
I hate being at home.

781
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,190
When I see my husband,

782
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,490
I get so angry.

783
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,610
I want to flip out on him,

784
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,710
but I'm actually afraid to let him go.

785
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,980
I find it unfair.

786
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,270
Fill up the bathtub.

787
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,040
<i>He lives in the house I clean and...</i>

788
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,570
Can't you hurry? I'm late.

789
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,180
Sorry.

790
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,120
<i>he wears the clothes I give him.</i>

791
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,900
Geez.

792
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,050
Seaweed soup?

793
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:46,350
I have an important meeting. Don't ruin my luck.

794
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,830
Put it away.

795
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,420
<i>The asshole who never remembered
my birthday for 30 years.</i>

796
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,080
<i>I hate being at home
because I can't stand him,</i>

797
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,170
<i>but I had nowhere to go at my age.</i>

798
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,390
You came early today.

799
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,720
Yes. I ran for 30 minutes.

800
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,300
Nice. Don't overdo it. Fighting.

801
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,000
<i>Even though you see me every day,</i>

802
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,120
How are you feeling?

803
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,960
<i>you ask me what I ate, what exercise I did,</i>

804
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,560
<i>and if I slept well.</i>

805
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,390
Have you eaten today?

806
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,840
I haven't been asked those trivial questions

807
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,210
in 20 years, maybe?

808
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,800
I liked that so much.

809
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,760
I'm sorry. I've been bothering you too much.

810
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,400
Not at all.

811
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,110
Ms. Im,

812
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,670
- you can't put up with it-
- Gosh.

813
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,090
I'm so silly. Why did I say all that?

814
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,720
Let's stop talking about this now, Director.

815
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,730
But still-

816
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,540
I'll get going now.

817
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,730
I don't think I could go to the gym today.

818
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,980
Wait... Ms. Im...

819
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,870
<i>A trainer faces the clients' pain
more than expected.</i>

820
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:26,560
<i>Whenever I did, I've always
told them to work out.</i>

821
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,850
<i>Because I believed a strong body
makes a strong mind.</i>

822
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,520
<i>But there's no exercise in the world</i>

823
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,450
<i>that can make Ms. Im strong.</i>

824
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,440
Gosh, I overdid it to show off.

825
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm dying, seriously.

826
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,200
Unni! Unni!

827
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,840
Unni! Unni! Unni! Unni! Unni! Unni!

828
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,500
Unni, this is incredible.

829
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,770
- What is?
- I didn't think of Dan at all for a moment.

830
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,030
I used to think of him every minute.

831
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,420
But for 10 minutes,

832
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,320
I didn't think of him. Not once.

833
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,330
Because I was distracted by my sore thighs.

834
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,200
Working out must really work, Unni.

835
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,870
I think you were right!

836
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,970
Yes, I'm telling you.

837
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,040
You'd think of him every 10 minutes,

838
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,060
once a day, once a week,

839
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:34,230
and you'd totally forget him.

840
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,100
Nowadays, I only have one thought.

841
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,630
- What is it?
- Is today an upper body day

842
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,650
or a lower body day?

843
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,340
- That's so daebak.
- Pow!

844
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,010
Unni, you really are a fitness buff.

845
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,090
How about a late-night snack to celebrate?

846
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:49,650
Late-night snack?

847
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,220
Here.

848
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,170
Tonight's late-night snack is tteokbokki...

849
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,710
flavored chicken breast.

850
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:04,410
It's the best late-night snack for people like us.

851
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,640
A chicken breast that tastes like tteokbokki?

852
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,800
Yeah.

853
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,310
Try it.

854
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,560
Wow, this is crazy.

855
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,170
It tastes just like tteokbokki.

856
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,580
Right? The juice and sauce are amazing, right?

857
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:28,260
Wow, I don't think I'd miss tteokbokki at all.

858
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,660
I don't work out eating bad food anymore.

859
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,830
Eat, eat.

860
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,430
Protein is the best late-night snack.

861
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,230
Another tteokbokki, please.

862
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,850
Okay.

863
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,290
So good. So good.

864
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,150
[24-Hour Health Club]

865
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,700
Good morning.

866
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,210
Good morning.

867
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,870
- Should we get started?
- Yes.

868
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,960
Warm up while I'm working out.

869
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,090
You know what I taught you? Do that.

870
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:06,120
- Go.
- Okay.

871
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:13,560
Your sister is working hard.

872
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,020
She just broke up with her boyfriend.

873
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,380
That's why I told her to work out.

874
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,140
That's how I moved on, too.

875
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,620
By working out with you.

876
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,900
- Did working out really help?
- Huh?

877
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,250
Of course. Working out made me

878
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:35,240
feel like I was doing something for my body.

879
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,450
It made me feel like I was overcoming.

880
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,530
My bent neck and slouchy back from working

881
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,770
started getting straightened.

882
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:45,990
It felt like my spirit was
getting straightened, too.

883
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,190
As you said,

884
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,360
my body is the only thing I can change now.

885
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,520
Do the final stretching.

<i>I found this wallet nearby.</i>

887
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,910
<i>Find its owner.</i>

888
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,270
Ms. Im?

889
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,800
Let's work out.

890
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,900
I did just now.

891
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,100
- It's a supplementary lesson.
- No.

892
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:20,170
Okay.

893
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:23,440
It's a workout that helps your stiff shoulders.

894
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,090
People usually only focus on the

895
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,010
contraction part that requires strength,

896
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:32,010
but in fitness, the relaxing part, in this case,

897
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,200
the letting go part is more important.

898
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,320
The letting go part?

899
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,710
If you contract by applying strength like this

900
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,880
and when you relax,

901
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,660
you let go all at once like this,

902
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,750
our muscles would never grow.

903
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,430
Like this.

904
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,590
You have to let go slowly like this.

905
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:57,730
Let go slowly.

906
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:05,570
Are you telling me to let go of my husband?

907
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:10,130
No, I'm talking about fitness right now.

908
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,290
Hold the band.

909
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:19,310
Like this.

910
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:29,350
Gosh, this is hard.

911
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,570
It is.

912
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,890
Relaxing is harder than contracting.

913
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,620
It's not only hard for you. It's hard for me

914
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,880
and everyone else, too.

915
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,340
Don't worry.

916
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,090
Until you relax properly,

917
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,380
I'll be here to help you.

918
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,590
Director Do, aren't I pathetic?

919
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:54,090
- Pardon?
- I mean...

920
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,500
I can't even confront my cheating husband

921
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,480
and I'm holding onto him.

922
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,770
It must look pathetic.

923
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:04,500
Gosh, Ms. Im, it's not that-

924
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,050
But Director Do,

925
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,720
your family is...

926
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,200
not so easy to let go.

927
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:19,490
To me, my husband is a cheating bastard,

928
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,560
but to my children, he's a dad

929
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,820
and he's a family I've been living with

930
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,970
for 30 years.

931
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:36,320
It's just not easy...

932
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,410
to let go.

933
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,990
You can't let go of Director Dong for

934
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:48,320
the same reason, no?

935
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,290
I'm sorry.

936
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,970
Gosh, Unni!

937
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,830
Stop working out. Let's go get braised fish.

938
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:02,970
I'm hungry.

939
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,750
Let's take a shower and go, Unni.

940
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:08,170
Yes, yes. I need to eat braised fish.

941
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:09,460
Let's go. Let's go.

942
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,950
- We've been waiting for you.
- Yes, yes.

943
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:21,030
Gosh, isn't that Seong Im's husband?

944
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,720
It's him. It's him.

945
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,660
- Brother-in-law!
- Brother-in-law!

946
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,450
- Hello.
- Hello.

947
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:32,190
Yes, long time no see.

948
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:34,350
By the way, what brings you here?

949
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:36,370
Are you here to see Unni?

950
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,340
Let's go...

951
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:47,400
H-Honey, what are you doing here?

952
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,100
I was working off-site and wanted to grab a bite.

953
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,510
This is my co-worker, Jeong Mi.

954
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:55,660
You know her, right?

955
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,290
Hello, ma'am.

956
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:58,700
Yes.

957
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,330
The pumpkin shikhye and yakshik
you sent were so tasty.

958
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,010
Yes, okay.

959
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,940
Did you like them, Jeong Mi?

960
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,590
You should've told me sooner.

961
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,130
She makes that stuff all the time.

962
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,720
I'll tell her to make more.

963
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,240
It'll be too tiring for her.

964
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,510
That can't be hard at all.

965
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,690
You can make them by tomorrow, right?

966
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,370
Hold my purse for a moment.

967
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:28,350
Okay. U-Unni, what are you doing?

968
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,620
What are you doing, Unni?

969
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,440
Unni, what are you doing?

970
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,700
What's wrong, Unni?

971
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,320
I don't think I could have braised fish today.

972
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,730
I need to do a finishing workout.

973
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,770
I didn't think...

974
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:52,780
of you as a man, but as a family, at least.

975
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,600
But to you, I was just a restaurant ahjumma.

976
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,080
What?

977
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:05,420
What are you doing all of a sudden?

978
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,130
- What are you doing?
- You know what, Honey?

979
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:11,210
When you work out,

980
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:14,390
letting go slowly is

981
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,640
much harder to do

982
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,250
than lifting using force.

983
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,860
What are you suddenly talking about?

984
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,890
It means I'll let you go today!

985
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:30,980
What?

986
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,950
Is this woman out of her mind?

987
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,440
Ms. Im.

988
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,310
You forgot your band.

989
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,970
Let go.

990
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,060
What's this?

991
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,490
What's he talking about?

992
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,840
Let go of what? Let go of what?

993
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,160
He's talking about this, you bastard!

994
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,960
What's with you? Are you crazy?

995
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,320
You're the crazy one!

996
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,800
A cheater can't be in his right mind.

997
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,260
How dare you bring this woman
to our neighborhood?

998
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,030
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

999
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,420
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1000
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,410
You have me...

1001
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,570
and your daughter, too!

1002
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,740
Jeong Mi. Jeong Mi...

1003
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,300
No, no, no!

1004
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,920
Unni, work out.

1005
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,190
The finish is important.

1006
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,910
Yes, thank you.

1007
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,920
Don't, don't!

1008
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,470
You eat the food I cooked

1009
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:35,970
and wear the clothes I got you.

1010
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:38,240
How dare you come here...

1011
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,660
Ms. Im?

1012
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,310
If you layer up the band,

1013
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:43,790
it'd create more tension and more force.

1014
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:45,260
Who the hell are you?

1015
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,420
Very nice to meet you.

1016
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,380
I'm Ms. Im's gym director.

1017
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,130
It's so tense. I like it.

1018
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,660
Lower the chest.

1019
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,460
Try doing this again.

1020
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,820
Aigoo, shit.

1021
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,520
Who the hell are you now?

1022
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,840
I'm a member at the same gym!

1023
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,320
- Are you crazy?
- No!

1024
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,160
You're the crazy one!

1025
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,030
Are you serious right now?

1026
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:29,290
Do you have a business with my clients?

1027
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,230
- No!
- Get home safely, then.

1028
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:33,780
Okay!

1029
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:51,120
<i>Cheers!</i>

1030
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,170
What? Why won't you drink it?

1031
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:58,760
- Just drink it.
- Yes.

1032
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,790
- It's okay.
- Drink it.

1033
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,440
Drink it. Drink it.

1034
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,740
Should I just drink it?

1035
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,700
Should I just do it?

1036
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,800
If you drink this,

1037
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,830
you'll do 100 squats with me.

1038
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,580
What if I don't?

1039
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,690
You'll lose weight.

1040
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,960
Tastes great!

1041
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,800
What are you doing? Where did my chair go?

1042
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,340
Do 100 squats right now. One.

1043
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,990
Gosh, what's with you?

1044
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,400
We were having fun. Right?

1045
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,640
- I know.
- Just do it.

1046
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,230
One.

1047
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,520
He's so intense. One.

1048
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,110
Two.

1049
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,280
Cheers!

1050
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,620
Don't drink. You'd better not.

1051
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,160
Eat!

1052
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:20,230
The people from the gym seem so nice.

1053
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:21,480
Right?

1054
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,310
If I work out very hard

1055
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:26,450
every day like those ladies,

1056
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:29,640
I'll be able to let go of Dan completely

1057
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,960
like you and Seong Im, right?

1058
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,560
Of course.

1059
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,090
Look at this.

1060
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:38,150
Unni. Unni!

1061
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,920
Let go.

1062
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,760
Hey, let's go.

1063
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,300
What's the point of being strong?

1064
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,190
What's with her, anyway?

1065
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:50,840
I'm starting to respect her. How annoying.

1066
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,670
Sir, let me help you.

1067
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:55,010
Gosh, thank you so much.

1068
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:56,180
It's nothing.

1069
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,580
Of course, we should help.

1070
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,610
What's going on?

1071
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:07,730
What are you doing, Unni?

1072
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,270
Hold on.

1073
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:13,900
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1074
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,200
What are you doing?

1075
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,710
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

1076
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,360
She fell.

1077
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,530
Come out of there!

1078
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,780
What are you doing?

1079
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,190
What's with these young people?

1080
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,260
Come out! Come out!

1081
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,090
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1082
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,340
Sorry.

1083
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,630
- You can't prank me like that.
- I'm sorry.

1084
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,570
Geez.

1085
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,890
- Is he gone?
- Who?

1086
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:43,750
Is Joon Seok gone? He was there just now.

1087
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,490
Is that why you ran away?

1088
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:48,570
Go check. Go check.

1089
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,930
Hey, if he's still there, ask him for me.

1090
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:55,280
Ask him what he texted me and why he deleted it.

1091
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,700
Ask him just once.

1092
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,300
Hey, you said you forgot about him.

1093
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,450
How can you say that?

1094
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:04,780
That wasn't Joon Seok.

1095
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,900
Geez, calluses, my foot.

1096
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,840
I should've never believed you.

1097
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:16,380
Babe, I can't break up with you.

1098
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,650
Let's meet up right now.

1099
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,420
It wasn't Joon Seok?

1100
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,200
What's the deal?

1101
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,000
Why would the callus fall off so easily?

1102
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,700
Why does it fall off so easily?

1103
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:56,130
<i>I pretended I completely let go,</i>

1104
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:00,430
<i>but I've never let go of him properly.</i>

1105
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,510
<i>He said he didn't love me.</i>

1106
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:08,970
<i>Is his kindness just pity?</i>

1107
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,310
<i>Is it out of lingering feelings?</i>

1108
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:14,590
<i>Or is it just my delusion?</i>

1109
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:18,300
<i>I have many questions, but I can't ask him.</i>

1110
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,190
<i>Because I don't want to get hurt again.</i>

1111
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,230
Yes, I want to buy a new treadmill.

1112
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:29,920
[Out of order]

1113
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:34,480
I'll let go of the old treadmill now.

1114
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,560
Yes.

1115
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,710
Director.

1116
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,760
What brings you here at this hour?

1117
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,120
What do I do?

1118
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:02,590
My callus fell off.

1119
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:05,320
I'm screwed.

1120
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:12,520
<i>Relaxing muscles is harder than contracting</i>

1121
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,240
<i>because when you fail to do it properly,</i>

1122
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,580
<i>we get injured.</i>

1123
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:22,160
<i>We failed to let go.</i>

1124
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:32,440

1125
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,080
You pervert!

1126
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,600
What's with you?

1127
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,190
Why are you peeping at a woman?

1128
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,650
I wasn't peeping.

1129
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,380
What were you doing, then...

1130
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,560
Oh, d-do you know her?

1131
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,080
Well, no, no.

1132
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,360
You're a pervert, then!

1133
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,800
Gosh, I said I'm not.

1134
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,010
What the pervert?
