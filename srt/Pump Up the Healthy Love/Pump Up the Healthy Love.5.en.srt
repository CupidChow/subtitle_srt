183
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,450
Why are you so shocked?

184
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,510
She's been in charge of Hawaii all this time.

185
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,540
But still, there's you.

186
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,140
I know. There's me, the chief,

187
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:53,250
but the PR team insists on Mi Ran
on the show and selling it.

188
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,920
Someone apparently told them
you're the Hawaii expert.

189
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,120
- Me? Who did?
- I don't know.

190
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,350
By the way, you've never been to Hawaii, right?

191
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,450
Yes, Ye Jin might have
a better sense of the place.

192
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,790
- She just got back from there.
- Yes.

193
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,560
That could be, but...

194
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,830
the company decided it.

195
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,710
As long as you're okay,

196
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,330
you'll be in charge of it.

197
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,940
Okay. Got it.

198
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,510
There's a meeting with the
show host soon. Get ready.

199
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,780
Okay, I'll work hard on it.

200
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,130
- Okay!
- Yes!

201
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,690
Thank you.

202
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,780
- Okay.
- Thank you.

203
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,470
- See you later.
- Thank you!

204
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,050
I know you're good at planning, Mi Ran.

205
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,760
By the way, you must be so worried.

206
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,040
Being on TV, I mean.

207
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,500
TV makes you twice as large, you know.

208
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,110
- Twice?
- I suppose.

209
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,770
Celebrities' faces look big on TV,

210
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,880
but they're tiny in real life.

211
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,410
It's because the camera makes you look big.

212
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,540
But you...

213
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,550
No, don't worry.

214
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,320
No one would watch it, I'm sure.

215
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,880
There's no way your friends, relatives,

216
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,140
and ex-boyfriends would watch it.

217
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,560
Friends, relatives, and...

218
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,900
ex-boyfriends?

219
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,500
What? You'll quit taking a drug?

220
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,680
I said I'll quit eating flour-based food.

221
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
Stop.

222
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,670
Yes, flour.

223
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,900
Flour is like a drug to people who work out.

224
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,620
One of the three white drugs
alongside sugar and white rice.

225
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,960
- Pardon?
- Here.

226
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,150
These are the photos of the meals you sent me.

227
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,430
As I understand, flour is like...

228
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,070
joy and driving force in life

229
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,290
and the best friend to you.

230
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,480
If you forcibly restrict your diet,

231
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,270
not only will your ability to exercise decrease,

232
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,560
your daily life could be impossible
due to the flour withdrawal.

233
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,820
Geez, hold on.

234
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,990
So, you're saying...

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,840
I'm a pig with no willpower
very politely right now.

236
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,200
Yes.

237
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,670
But I need to be on TV.

238
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,100
I'll be introducing the tour package I designed.

239
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,540
But I heard your face looks twice as big on TV.

240
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,280
If my face looks twice as large,

241
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,700
it means it'd look this big.

242
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,210
What the this big?

243
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,540
But still, you can't.

244
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,280
I'm quitting flour, not even rice.

245
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,630
I can do it. I can quit. I'll try.

246
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,600
But still, you can't.

247
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,430
Do you want to bet?

248
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,880
If I can't quit flour like you said,

249
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,200
I'll dance on the Live Market.

250
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,720
Dance?

251
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,220
Dance...

252
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,570
What would you do if I succeed?

253
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,910
If you succeed, I'll give you three free sessions.

254
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,690
Eat tteokbokki with me.

255
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,380
Ttteokbokki, the useless food
you said has zero nutrition.

256
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,450
I won't put trash like that in my mouth-

257
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,020
You can talk shit about me but not tteokbokki.

258
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,180
Your grip strength improved a lot.

259
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,400
Do as you wish.

260
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,430
There's no way I'd be eating that trash.

261
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,440
You'll be eating tteokbokki this time.

262
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,400
Welcome to the tteokbokki world.

263
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,810
Tteokbokki is terrible.

264
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,020
Hello, ma'am.

265
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,230
- Hello, Director.
- Ji Ho.

266
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,520
Hello.

267
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,440
Hello.

268
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,280
I decided to be shameless and come.

269
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,940
I feel so bad.

270
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,050
Ji Ho has endless energy

271
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,000
and he'd look for me if I'm not around.

272
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,510
Ji Ho will stay where he can see you.

273
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,320
Like this.

274
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,250
There.

275
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,730
He'd tire you out too much.

276
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,190
Ma'am,

277
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,490
I was born at 1.5 kg,

278
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,100
but with the muscles I created,

279
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,510
I ended up lifting 500 kg total
in squat, bench pressing,

280
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,220
and deadlifting.

281
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,250
Adding 15 kg is like...

282
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,550
wearing a weighted jacket.

283
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,390
But still. I feel so bad.

284
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,110
I'll prove that you shouldn't feel bad

285
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,060
with my own body.

286
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,090
Okay. Shall we get started?

287
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,630
Shall we get started?

288
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,030
Mommy!

289
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,750
Mommy, I can't.

290
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,150
Let's start warming up first, then.

291
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,110
- Okay.
- I want to go to Mommy.

292
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,510
Okay. In lunging,

293
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,170
you put one foot forward,

294
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,070
touch the floor with the knee,

295
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,010
and come up. That's one rep.

296
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,570
L-Like this?

297
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,380
Let's do it together.

298
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,500
Okay.

299
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,950
Lower the knee like this,

300
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,930
come back up, feel the strain, and that's two.

301
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,190
Ji Ho, having fun?

302
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,990
Okay. We'll do three sets of 10 reps like that.

303
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,180
Okay.

304
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,340
You don't have to hold me...

305
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,780
Mommy, Mommy.

306
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,370
Six.

307
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,240
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

308
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,610
- I think I should-
- Don't stop. Seven.

309
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,470
Mommy.

310
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,770
Gosh, but still-

311
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,050
Let's do it together.

312
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,260
- Okay, nine.
- Nine.

313
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,530
You can do it.

314
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,810
The last one. Ten.

315
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,510
Ten.

316
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,010
Ten.

317
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,140
Ji Ho, you're having fun.

318
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,070
I'll learn and do this with you a lot.

319
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,200
Okay...

320
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,910
Sir!

321
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,960
I finished the last running session, too.

322
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,000
- Well done.
- Gosh.

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,750
It was too much, wasn't it? Ji Ho.

324
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,250
Not at all.

325
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,530
Thanks to Ji Ho, I trained my

326
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,900
vastus and glutes, too.

327
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,390
I caught two birds with one stone.

328
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,750
I'll see you at the next session, then.

329
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,950
- Well...
- Yes?

330
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,200
Can I really come back next time?

331
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,290
What do you mean by that?

332
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:44,000
I just feel too guilty.

333
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,680
Gosh, why would you feel guilty?

334
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,160
Director Do gets to make money.

335
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,650
Come and work out.

336
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,370
Come tomorrow, and the day after.

337
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,150
Come every day.

338
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,860
Yes, Director Do is so fit.

339
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,940
I'm sure you can come twice a day.

340
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,430
Right?

341
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,820
Of course.

342
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,450
Letting you work out in the best condition

343
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,600
is my duty and happiness.

344
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,960
If you don't believe me, want to go again now?

345
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,060
I'm totally fine.

346
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,720
No. I'll see you next time, then.

347
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,620
Yes, yes.

348
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,280
Thank you.

349
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,410
- Ji Ho.
<i>- Bye.</i>

350
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,820
He's so sweet.

351
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,850
Director Do, seriously.

352
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,230
What the tiredness?

Either you're not fit enough,

544
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,210
or you feel guilty because you're human, too.

545
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,890
- Director?
- You!

546
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,340
Baby!

547
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,710
I beat Do Hyeon Joong this time.

548
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,720
You saw, right? Baby, look at this.

549
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,190
Come to my gym anytime.

550
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,270
You get the free locker
and uniform for three months.

551
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,720
A box of red ginseng paste, okay?

552
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,210
Did something happen?

553
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,610
No.

554
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,630
Hold on.

555
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,490
Don't you smell something nutty?

556
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,490
Something nutty?

557
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,180
It smells like someone's baking bread.

558
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,200
What the smell?

559
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,200
[Liberation Day 3]

560
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,890
<i>Liberation from flour day 3.</i>

561
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,030
<i>After becoming free from flour,</i>

562
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,650
<i>I want to have clear skin,</i>

563
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,800
<i>a healthy gut, and a slender jawline.</i>

564
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,310
- Ms. Lee.
- Yes.

565
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,260
Are you okay?

566
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,680
Me?

567
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,090
Y-You're okay, right?

568
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,100
What does it mean to be okay?

569
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,890
What am I? What are humans? What is life?

570
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,570
In this vast universe,

571
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,310
I'm a tiny being like a speck of flour.

572
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,200
How did I end up here?

573
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,800
Do you know the answer?

574
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,980
Could you tell me?

575
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,150
Well, okay...

576
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,630
What's that? Isn't it pancakes?

577
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,100
Why pancakes in a changing room?
It makes no sense.

578
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,990
What's the deal?

579
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,440
It's still warm.

580
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,380
Korean pancakes.

581
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,050
Flour and oil.

582
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,420
A combination of two tasty things.

583
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,200
It's impossible to not taste good.

584
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,500
<i>Eat it now.</i>

585
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,440
I almost ate it.

586
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,810
It could've been a disaster.

587
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,140
What do you mean, a disaster?

588
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,120
You've always eaten it. Eating it once more

589
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,460
won't be a disaster.

590
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,930
Mi Ran, you've been doing well.

591
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,810
Your skin is amazing. Your face is tiny, too.

592
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,970
You need to look pretty on TV.

593
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,780
If you ate, your blood sugar would spike

594
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,530
and make a mistake on TV.

595
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,110
It's golden brown and so warm.

596
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,830
Look at this pancake.

597
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,700
Not eating it...

598
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,930
would be a greater disaster.

599
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,860
Mi Ran, you had a good
bowel movement this morning.

600
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,090
It's because you quit flour.

601
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,250
You've always had a good bowel movement.

602
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,220
Mi Ran, you're almost there.

603
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,730
You're about to be liberated from flour.

604
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,310
You're right.

605
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,230
Thinking...

606
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,570
only cools down the pancakes.

607
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,630
- You're right.
- Come.

608
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:51,290
Mi Ran, you have the right to eat it. Eat it.

609
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,870
- Don't eat it.
- Eat it.

610
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,600
- Don't eat it.
- What's she doing?

611
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,020
Unni, I'm scared of her.

612
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,150
Hold on.

613
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,360
Dear.

614
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,180
- Yes?
- What are you doing?

615
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,020
You're talking to yourself.

616
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,940
Is it because you want the pancakes?

617
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,440
Why don't we just eat together?

618
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,050
It's not like that.

619
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,490
But how could you eat this
in the gym changing room?

620
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,100
Does the director know about this?

621
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,520
We're in the women's changing room.

622
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,420
How could he know about it?

623
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,450
Flour is the devil's powder
for those who work out.

624
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,830
It's one of the three worst drugs.

625
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,460
If he finds out you take the devil's powder,

626
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,910
I'm sure he won't let it slide.

627
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,580
You must be hungry since you're irritable.

628
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,860
Take a bite of this.

629
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,420
People get irritated

630
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,340
when their stomachs are empty.

631
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,590
- I won't eat it.
- No, try some.

632
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,160
I can't eat that.

633
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,840
- Why? Eat it.
- I said I won't.

634
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,110
Just eat some.

635
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,990
I won't eat it!

636
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,270
What are you...

637
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,640
doing right now?

638
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,070
I said I didn't want it.

639
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,550
I don't want it!

640
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,710
And I'll tell the director about this.

641
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,570
That you ladies are worshiping the devil

642
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,200
in the women's changing room!

643
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,970
No, no...

644
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,400
- Honey!
- Dear!

645
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,260
Director!

646
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,790
Director,

647
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,050
can't you manage the gym better?

648
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,180
What do you mean by that?

649
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,280
These members ate the flour-covered

650
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,490
pancakes in this sacred gym.

651
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,430
How could something like this happen?

652
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,680
D-Director Do, the thing is...

653
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,970
I did it.

654
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,000
I suggested eating it.

655
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,430
No!

656
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,060
They did nothing wrong.

657
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,840
I did it. It was me.

658
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,970
Be careful from now on.

659
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,220
You can't just let it slide like that.

660
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,900
It says right here, too.

661
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,890
"Take in nothing but muscles at the gym."

662
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,660
You should only take muscles from here.

663
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,320
Why would they eat pancakes?

664
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,320
- One, two...
- Three.

665
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,790
They said they won't eat.

666
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,450
It's just a pancake.

667
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,770
Just a pancake?

668
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,210
You're very irritable right now.

669
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,090
Why don't you just consume flour instead?

670
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,330
You're telling me to cancel the liberation?

671
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,170
I think you lack judgment because you're

672
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,170
tired from caring for a baby.

673
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,650
You're the one who told me that

674
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,960
flour is the devil's powder. It's a drug!

675
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,240
Did you say I'm tired from caring for a baby?

676
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,110
I was born at 1.5 kg

677
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,300
and now I lift 500 kg in three ways.

678
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,530
I can't get tired because of

679
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,470
lifting only 15 kg.

680
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,440
So, what? You didn't know your members
were being seduced by evil.

681
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,690
Because of that baby.

682
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,010
Did you speak ill of Ji Ho just now?

683
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,340
Apologize.

684
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,650
I didn't say it was his fault.

685
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,040
It's flour's fault.

686
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,700
Apologize to Ji Ho now!

687
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,570
I don't want to! Stop!

688
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,810
Just tell them not to consume flour.

689
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,130
Is that so hard to do?

690
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,610
Who consumes flour at a gym?

691
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,730
Stop talking to me.

692
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,700
Are they fighting?

693
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,440
- Don't hold it.
- I think they're working out.

694
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,860
- You can't if I don't.
- Hm...

695
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,520
It looks like they're fighting,

696
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,680
but they seem close, too. It's weird.

697
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,930
Yes, yes.

698
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,490
I care about my body. And so do you-

699
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,960
- Stop talking to me!
- Gosh, gosh!

700
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,970
You'll hurt yourself this way.

701
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,690
Stop talking to me when I'm working out.

702
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,370
Why do you talk while working out, then?

703
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,560
Did you quit behaving while quitting flour?

704
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,950
Did you lose your mind while babysitting?

705
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,790
Stop talking back like that.

706
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,560
Lift one more time using that energy.

707
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,730
I don't want to! I'll get thin
from quitting flour, okay?

708
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,580
I know you're tired, but don't fight your client.

709
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,460
Who says I'm tired? Huh?

710
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,750
I'm not tired! I'm not tired!

711
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,590
What? What?

712
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,220
You monster!

713
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,060
Ms. Lee!

714
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,130
Whoa, Ms. Lee.

715
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,480
Your face got half as small.

716
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,130
Only half?

717
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,920
I even quit flour.

718
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,610
By the way, can we eat jjajangmyeon?

719
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,150
Mi Ran banned flour in the house.

720
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,570
I don't know.

721
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,410
Since she told me not to eat flour-based food,

722
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,590
I've been craving nothing but.

723
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,620
