9
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,110
No.

10
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,460
No.

11
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,960
W-What are you doing?

12
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,600
We'll do the interval training starting today.

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,150
W-What's that?

14
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,290
Delusion.

15
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,510
Delusion?

16
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,260
You take a small break during intense exercise.

17
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,440
Even if you take a break briefly,

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,110
our bodies get delusional and think
they're still working out.

19
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,270
What?

20
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,250
It's working very well.

21
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,490
This is what interval training is all about.

22
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,910
Row for 60 seconds and rest for 60 seconds.

23
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,650
So your body thinks
it's still exercising intensely.

24
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,330
Well, then. I have an important meeting.

25
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,390
- Gain muscles.
- Okay.

26
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,460
Didn't you say you have an important meeting?

27
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,500
Yes, this is the most important meeting.

28
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,060
It's a meeting with my chest.

29
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,250
I love it.

30
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,800
It's so tasty.

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,740
I'm delusional. Yes.

32
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,960
- Seriously.
- My nose is running.

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,620
I'm delusional.

34
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,410
Six. Seven.

35
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,110
- Eight. Nine.
- Gosh, gosh.

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,380
Mi Ran!

37
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,460
Hello.

38
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,870
So, did you... Whatchamacallit...

39
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,730
Did you overcome the fitness rut?

40
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,460
Oh, yes.

41
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,850
That's great. That's great.

42
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,680
Director Do was sad while you were gone.

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,700
It was as if he had broken up with his girlfriend.

44
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,170
Are you guys dating, by chance?

45
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,710
Gosh, it's not like that.

46
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,690
Why would he say that if you weren't?

47
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,920
"Does your body not remember
those fulfilling moments at all?"

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,120
I thought I was watching a drama.

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,740
It's not like that.

50
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,600
There's no way he likes
someone else's body but his own.

51
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,250
I love my chest.

52
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,450
I suppose.

53
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,120
He was talking to his chest in the mirror earlier.

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,560
- What did he say?
- He said, "You're the best I have."

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,410
Geez. What a waste of good looks.

56
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,600
I feel bad for him.

57
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,110
Whoa, who's that? I've never seen her before.

58
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,110
Goodness. Look how small her face is.

59
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,550
She looks like a doll.

60
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,940
Unni, her waist is this big.

61
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,570
She must've removed organs.

62
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,950
My gosh. My gosh.

63
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,250
Doesn't she look familiar?

64
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,100
Have I seen her on TV?

65
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,260
I wonder.

66
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,840
I feel like I've seen her somewhere.

67
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,130
What's the deal?

68
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,200
What could it be?

69
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,250
- What do you mean?
- I mean, Ms. Kang Sol.

70
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,250
She's an influencer with over a million followers.

71
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,080
Why did she come all the way here?

72
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,260
Aren't you curious?

73
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,430
No, I'm not.

74
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,580
Why?

75
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,680
I sent her a DM.

76
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,610
Aren't you proud of me?

77
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,680
I'm impressed.

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,820
I know, right?

79
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,580
Because you sent her a DM,

80
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,970
Kang Sol came here? It makes no sense.

81
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,480
Why is it so weird that she came to our gym?

82
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,350
You don't know who she is, do you?

83
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,870
She's a mega influencer

84
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,190
with over a million followers.

85
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,000

Slowly. Slowly.

96
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,000
What's with those people?

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,650
What are you doing over there?

98
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,730
Hey, who are you?

99
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,310
What are you doing here? Get out!

100
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,780
Geez, seriously.

Director Do.

102
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,940
They're paparazzi. Paparazzi.

103
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,400
You saw that, right? An influencer like her

104
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,030
could've gotten sponsored by a luxury hotel gym.

105
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,540
But why did she come to our gym?

106
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,030
Director Do, how long will you make me do this?

107
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,390
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,270
Gosh, it's all torn up here.

109
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,090
Gosh, I'm taking a break. Gosh...

110
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,690
I don't know why and how she came,

111
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,240
but we need to hold onto her.

112
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,680
This is an amazing opportunity from heaven.

113
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,660
We won't be able to.

114
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,850
- Why not?
- Because I'll make her leave.

115
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,940
What do you mean by that?

116
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,460
No one can focus on their workouts
because they all stare at her.

117
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,480
We can't let those who interrupt others stay.

118
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,740
You should leave instead, then.

119
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,310
Because you interrupt the most.

120
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,000
Ms. Kang.

124
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,860
Attention!

125
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,410
Attention, everyone.

126
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,740
Geez, seriously.

127
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,800
Yes, I'm paying attention. What?

128
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,920
Let me tell you the new rules

129
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,680
you need to follow at 24-Hour Health Club.

130
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,850
Rules?

131
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,750
Are you telling us not to eat again?

132
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,100
First of all, you aren't allowed
to distract others.

133
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,750
A flashy top, bottoms, and makeup
has nothing to do with working out.

134
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,510
This is a sacred gym, not a fashion show venue.

135
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,610
If you don't like that, leave immediately.

136
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,440
This isn't a high school in the '70s.

137
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,610
Why would you regulate the way we dress?

138
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,490
Bright colors look good on me.

139
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,020
Summer is all about cool hues.

140
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,440
I heard you only cared about bodies and muscles.

141
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,360
I guess you worry more about other things.

142
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,930
No one here looks interested
in other people's fashion.

143
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,820
Yes, she's right.

144
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,940
It doesn't matter what we wear when we work out.

145
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,080
It's okay to dress up a little.

146
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,400
Give me a freaking break.

147
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,130
Next!

148
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,490
Other than fitness or needing my help,

149
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,120
no personal feelings are allowed at the gym.

150
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,800
Who's he talking about?

151
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,010
It's not me.

152
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,930
It's not me, either. Not me.

153
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,900
If so...

154
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,500
Not me, either.

155
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,980
Aigoo... If so,

156
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,000
who's he talking about?

157
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,690
Me, by chance?

158
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,170
Come on. Maybe you're the one

159
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,600
with personal feelings, Director.

160
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,940
Geez, that's ridiculous.

161
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,320
That fitness fanatic has no feelings.

162
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,960
He only cares about fitness.

163
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,440
We'll go, Director Do.

164
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,700
It's fine. It's fine. Get back to it.

165
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,530
What's he saying? Seriously.

166
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,800
Aigoo...

167
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,020
I know what you're trying to say,

168
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,620
but I won't leave, Oppa.

169
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,510
It's PT time.

170
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,940
Should we work out,

171
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,230
Director Do Hyeon Joong?

172
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,710
We'll try deadlifting first.

173
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,050
Deadlifting?

174
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,660
It means you lift the dead.

175
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,820
How romantic.

176
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,510
Deadlifting with me won't be romantic.

177
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Let's start.

178
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,480
One!

179
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,260
Two.

180
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,990
Three.

181
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,250
Fix your posture.

182
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,700
Start over. One!

183
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,820
<i>Kang Sol, I don't know why you came here,</i>

184
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,440
<i>but you won't be able to return to my gym.</i>

185
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,640
<i>I'll make you hurt a lot.</i>

186
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,050
<i>Just as much as you hurt me.</i>

187
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,260
<i>Let's break up.</i>

188
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,620
Again. One!

189
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,690
Take your unnecessarily broad chest

190
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,390
and live alone for the rest of your life.

191
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,200
Two!

192
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,620
Side chest view.

193
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,910
Three!

194
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,920
- Four.
<i>- Silver medal.</i>

195
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,680
<i>Do Hyeon Joong!</i>

196
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,000
<i>You can't control your body because of a woman?</i>

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,080
<i>How pathetic!</i>

198
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,900
Five!

199
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,640
If you're struggling to keep up,

200
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,740
you'd better give up now.

201
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,520
Because this is just the beginning.

202
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,060
No, I love it.

203
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,390
It's actually better than I expected.

204
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,240
It was a good idea to come here.

205
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,040
<i>She endured that?</i>

206
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,390
<i>What's she thinking, exactly?</i>

207
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,740
Having a handsome man and woman at the gym

208
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,990
is so nice to see.

209
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,460
I know.

210
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,810
They really make a nice couple.

211
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,860
Nice couple, my foot.

212
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,730
What's wrong? Did something happen?

213
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,020
I asked for a sauce that goes well with it,

214
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,770
but it doesn't go with it at all.

215
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,320
I'm screwed. Seriously.

216
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,700
I want tteokbokki.

217
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,880
All of a sudden?

218
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,200
All the time, without exception, and always.

219
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,750
I'm back.

220
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,640
You come in so confidently as if you live here.

221
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,030
- Babe!
- Hey!

222
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:47,010
I got you Grandma Tteokbokki, your favorite.

223
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,550
Welcome, brother-in-law. I was waiting for you.

224
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,700
- How are you, sister-in-law?
- I'm well, thanks to you.

225
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,830
That's good to hear.

226
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,000
What are you doing right now?

227
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,040
Interval.

228
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,350
What's that?

229
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,200
I'm confusing my body.

230
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,690
I'm eating tteokbokki now,

231
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,220
but I'm making my body think I'm eating a salad.

232
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,570
What are you saying?

233
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,230
I rowed today using the interval method.

234
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,480
I didn't even pull the handle,

235
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,630
but my heart rate was extremely high.

236
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,480
It worked pretty well. So,

237
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,920
I'm trying it for my diet, too.

238
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,350
- Babe.
- Yes?

239
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,310
She's not stupid.

240
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,550
I think she's just a piggy.

241
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,790
- Hey!
- Geez.

242
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,810
Do you want to get killed by a piggy?

243
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,420
Sorry.

244
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,710
Geez, I'm so puffy.

245
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,990
I guess the interval method
doesn't work with food.

246
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,640
Geez, what are they doing so early in the morning?

247
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,210
Director?

248
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,220
It wasn't him.

249
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,170
Of course.

250
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,660
Who'd like that fitness fanatic?

251
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,840
You make a nice couple!

252
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,510
Geez.

253
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,960
Hold on. The dust is still there. Hold on.

254
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,360
I'm okay. I'm okay now.

255
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,630
Because you work out in the dusty semi-basement,
you keep getting dust in your eyes.

256
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,110
I haven't even gone in there. Don't be silly.

257
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,120
Why that gym, not ours?

258
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,910
You know 24-Hour doesn't suit you.

259
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,570
Listen to me, please.

260
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,840
- Bong Won.
- Roy.

261
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,190
My name is Roy.

262
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,400
Bong Won,

263
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,090
it's you and the name Roy
that don't suit each other.

264
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,400
Okay?

265
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,980
I'm going to work out now.

266
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,650
Bye.

267
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,410
You've got to be kidding me. Seriously.

268
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,080
I might just sign up with them.

269
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,180
- Good morning, Ms. Lee.
- Yes.

270
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,390
Do 50 reps of squats as a warm-up today.

271
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,800
Who does 50 reps as a warm-up?

272
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,410
What's with the tteokbokki you had
before having a salad?

273
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,820
Pardon?

274
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,070
How did you...

275
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,610
Hold on.

276
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,800
<i>Lee Ji Ran on the left. Kang Dan on the right.</i>

277
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,620
Kang Dan, that bastard.

278
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,400
You told me you only had a salad!

279
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,750
I-It was just a test.

280
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,350
I was checking if the interval method
works on diet, too.

281
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,290
- It's true.
- Start the squats.

282
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,230
- Start.
- 50 reps.

283
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,630
Don't try to skip a few.

284
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,540
Kang Dan, that bastard.

285
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,320
Two.

286
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,710
Three.

287
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,790
Four, five, six...

288
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,720
Do it properly! I can see you!

289
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,230
- Good eyesight.
- It's 20-20.

290
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,720
Lower!

291
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,130
Go down lower!

292
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,380
What are you doing, Director? Is my posture bad?

293
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,940
Gosh, gosh.

294
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,350
Your leggings popped open.

295
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,740
- Let's go to the changing room.
- Okay.

296
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,200
Oh, my, my.

297
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,640
<i>Kang Sol, what's with you?</i>

298
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,770
<i>You want all my clients to be on your side?</i>

299
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,630
Geez, why did it have to break

300
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,200
right in the butt area?

301
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,400
It's okay.

302
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,160
I didn't see anything. I swear.

303
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,500
- Really?
- Of course.

304
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,090
What a relief.

305
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,070
By the way,

306
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,110
you love cats, don't you?

307
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,070
Geez, you saw it.

308
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,710
Don't worry. Only I saw it. I swear.

309
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,640
It's a relief, still.

310
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,200
- Pardon?
- I wore cute panties today.

311
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,650
I have these favorite ones that are so comfy.

312
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,420
What if I were wearing those holey panties today?

313
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,860
Seriously. I'm so relieved.

314
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,940
Was it TMI?

315
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,230
No, I think it's so cool.

316
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,860
You have an extremely positive mindset.

317
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,990
Not everyone has that, you know.

318
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,630
It already happened. What else can I do?

319
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,940
I can't go back in time.

320
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,760
I can't go back in time,
but I'll return these leggings.

321
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,290
Thank you so much.

322
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,190
It's okay. They're my gift for you.

323
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,460
It's okay. They look expensive.

324
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,720
I should return them to you.

325
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,010
If you don't want to just accept them,

326
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,460
we can start being friends.

327
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,510

- Yes.

Let's be friends starting today.

Yes, just to browse.

Why does she have so many followers?

333
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,050
She was super famous.

334
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,000
Right!
[Never a Sad Ending]

335
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,820
I knew she looked familiar. This was it.

Geez, do you like Kang Sol, too?

337
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,800
Is she very famous?

Of course. She's the hottest celebrity now.

Why would the hip girl, Kang Sol, follow you?

I'm sorry.

366
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,290
You went to the police station because of me.

367
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,470
It's okay. I wasn't even handcuffed today.

368
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,140
It's okay.

369

You were so good at fighting.

371
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,670
What was with the shoulder throw?

372

Gosh, that's good.

just with this?

382

How about a glass?

I'll make you look pretty.

544
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,550
No, I don't want you to do makeup.

545
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,900
Go on blind dates
while people are setting you up.

546
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,390
It's okay.

547
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,520
You can't take a break with love.

548
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,290
If you do, all of your romance cells will die.

549
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,440
- Were they ever alive?
- You never know.

550
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,730
Someone really handsome, well-built,

551
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,680
and nice, your ideal type might come.

552
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,720
Why would someone like that
go on a blind date with me?

553
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,140
Someone like that won't go on a blind date-

554
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,370
Hold on. I'm all done now.

555
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,660
Just finish it up.

556
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,120
Done.

557
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,520
Ta-da!

558
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,430
What do you think? So pretty, right?

559
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,860
What's this?

560
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,680
You're like a flirty cat.

561
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,250
More like a scary tiger.

562
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,920
Meow! Be like this.

563
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,140
Gosh, I made eye contact.

564
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,660
I'm scared. I'm sorry.

565
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,720
This is how you captivate him, Unni.

566
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,240
Hold him captive, more like.

567
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,300
I was almost late because of Lee Ji Ran.

568
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:41,610
The one who'd be a good match for me is...

569
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,640
Hello.

570
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,770
You're the one, right?

571
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,530
Oh, yes.

572
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,560
You came early. Am I late?

573
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,780
You aren't late,

574
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,590
- but you aren't early, either.
- Pardon?

575
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:03,100
You're supposed to be 10 minutes early for dates.

576
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,750
Oh, yes.

577
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,750
I'm sorry. The traffic was really bad.

578
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,940
Huh?

579
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,540
There should be no traffic now.

580
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,110
People are neither going to work
nor getting off work.

581
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,750
It's not the lunch hour, either.
It's 4 p.m. on Saturday.

582
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,390
4 p.m. Yes, yes...

583
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,570
There was less traffic.

584
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,520
You must love coffee.

585
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,060
I only like hand-drip coffee.

586
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,690
I see.

587
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:42,330
I think I prefer Saturday at 4 p.m.
for blind dates.

588
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,290
- Why?
- There's no traffic,

589
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:47,630
and I can think while drinking coffee.

590
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,830
Whether I'll learn more
about the date over dinner,

591
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:54,000
or after coffee,

592
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,700
if we'll just part ways.

593
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,920
I see...

594
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,760
Sounds like...

595
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,530
you're very rational.

596
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,850
Reasonable.

597
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,100
That's the word.

598
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,370
You must've majored in English.

599
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,590
I hear that often.

600
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,740
You hear that often.

601
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,660
Aren't you going to order a drink?

602
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,000
- Pardon?
- It says one drink per person.

603
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,160
One drink per...

604
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,140
[One drink per person, please]

605
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,040
It's a basic manner. I already got one.

606
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,570
Basic manner?

607
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,220
Oh, well...

608
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,950
O-Okay...

609
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,000
Hello?

610
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,540
<i>This is Sol's friend, Park Jeong Han.</i>

611
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,760
<i>I was supposed to meet you today.</i>

612
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:46,895
Pardon? You're my blind date?

613
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,370
Daebak.

614
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,580
Daebak.

615
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,460
Sorry, I'm late.

616
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,670
Who are you?

617
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,520
I'm sorry. I think there was a misunderstanding.

618
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,500
I'm glad I haven't ordered a drink yet.

619
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,330
They require one drink per person here.

620
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,370
Oh, really? Let me buy you one.

621
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,290
It's okay.
Let's go over there.

622
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,800
Take care.

623
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,330
Fighting.

624
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,840
Let's go.

625
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,930
I'm sorry I'm late today.

626
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,200
I got lost since I've never been here.

627
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,960
It's okay. It happens. Don't worry.

628
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,090
<i>What's this?</i>

629
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,380
<i>Why would someone like him go on a blind date?</i>

630
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,200
I heard their cakes are famous.

631
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,250
Try some.

632
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,440
Oh, okay.

633
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,960
<i>If I knew he'd order a chocolate cake,</i>

634
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,270
<i>I would've gotten an iced Americano, not a latte.</i>

635
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,750
Americano goes better with a chocolate cake.

636
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,870
Pardon?

637
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,270
Do you want to switch with mine?

638
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,030
No, no, no. It's okay.

639
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,820
I like latte.

640
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,370
It'll taste better.

641
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,700
Okay.

642
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,170
<i>What? He's sensible on top of it.</i>

643
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,820
He knows what's up.

644
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,840
Go.

645
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,690
Is something bothering you?

646
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,730
My gums must be sensitive these days.

647
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:40,780
It stings a bit whenever I eat something sweet.

648
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,330
You should see a dentist soon.

649
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,580
Do you have dental insurance?

650
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,320
<i>Yes, right.</i>

651
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,310
<i>Of course.</i>

652
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,110
<i>Is he selling dental insurance this time?</i>

653
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:55,314
When you're an adult, you aren't afraid of
the dental treatment, but the treatment fee.

654
00:34:55,314 --> 00:34:57,500
- So, I-
- Jeong Han,

655
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,860
I have dental insurance.

656
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,940
Pardon?

657
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,260
Dental, cancer, and life.

658
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,620
I signed up for all sorts.

659
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,400
Whoa, you already got all the insurance.

660
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,550
You're so diligent.

661
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,880
Recommend a good plan for me if you know one.

662
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,610
I was looking to sign up for one.

663
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,360
I wanted a recommendation.

664
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,900
This is great.

665
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,250
Huh?

666
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,390
Should we get up, then?

667
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,080
I made a reservation at a restaurant nearby.

668
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,350
A restaurant?

669
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,050
We'd open up by sharing a delicious meal.

670
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,700
Let's get going.

671
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,380
I'll grab these.

672
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,820
The weather is...

673
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,920
<i>Don't come home. Don't come home.</i>

674
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,400
- You're crazy.
- Don't come home.

675
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,800
Geez!

676
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,200
It must've gone well. Don't be nervous, babe.

677
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,210
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

678
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,970
Babe, it's Mi Ran! It's Mi Ran!

679
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,420
Really?

680
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,890
One, two!

681
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,060
Geez, you scared me.

682
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,630
How was it? How was it? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.

683
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,490
- I'm so curious. Hurry, hurry.
- Thanks.

684
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,210
Hey, why did you have to be there anyway?

685
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,960
I was getting anxious.

686
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,990
So, did you eat something tasty?
What did you eat?

687
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,300
Are you going out starting today?

688
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,760
I have a brother-in-law now, right?

689
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,090
Gosh! What brother-in-law?

690
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,090
We had gopchang.

691
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,930
You share the taste in food, too. And? And?

692
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,420
We said we'd meet again, but...

693
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,700
But?

694
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,220
He's...

695
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,890
I'm not sure. He's a bit strange.

696
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,930
- Why? Why? Why?
- What do you mean?

697
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,620
You know...

698
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,050
we sat down for dinner and...

699
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,350
It's all done. Enjoy.

700
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,250
Enjoy.

701
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,980
That one looked delicious.

702
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,680
Go ahead. Go ahead.

703
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,680
I won't be able to eat today.

704
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,050
Let me pick it up.

705
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,450
I dropped a spoon while eating.

706
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,640
So, I looked under the table.

707
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,260
That's...

708
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,190
<i>He was wearing something like an ankle monitor.</i>

709
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,880
He looked normal.

710
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,680
Was he a criminal?

711
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,370
Are you okay?

712
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,620
Jeong Han, what...

713
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,760
W-What's that on your ankle?

714
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,370
Geez! W-What's this doing here?

715
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,950
This is... Gosh...

716
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,090
I'm sorry. This is...

717
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,250
It's a locker key for a pool.

718
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,440
What kind of pool locker key looks like that?

719
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,040
I was nervous about the blind date.

720
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,380
So, I went swimming to relax and forgot.

721
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,070
I would've kept it on if you didn't tell me.

722
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,850
I'm glad you explained that to me.

723
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,300
He's learning how to swim, apparently.

724
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,110
He can swim with swim fins now.

725
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,820
You said he was strange.

726
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,840
Isn't he kind of spacy?

727
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,040
You collected 10 keys for the gym.

728
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,860
So, you were the culprit.

729
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,720
- It's a secret.
- Okay.

730
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,260
You don't know how to swim.

731
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,660
- Ask him to teach you. Right?
- That's a good idea.

732
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,640
But what's even stranger is...

733
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,560
he said something urgent came up

734
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,150
and he asked me to come to his studio briefly.

735
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,220
What? He took you to his studio already?

736
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,700
He sounds like a player.

737
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,550
So? Did you go?

738
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,570
Yes, I did.

<i>It was dark.</i>

741

What was that? Scared me.

743
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,520
<i>no one would've heard me.</i>

Gosh! Geez Louise.

745
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,160
Did I scare you?

746
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,500
Yes. I mean, no.

751
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,240
Hold on. What's inside... W-What are you holding?

752
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,690
<i>It was long and shiny.</i>

753

It doesn't hurt. What was it?

755
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,760
It's a chicken skewer.

757
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,780
I got one just now.

I like the gochujang flavor.

- Tteokbokki.
- Bingo.

763
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,610
S-So, what's strange, exactly?

764
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,860
How should I say? He seems like a good guy,

765
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,820
but he doesn't seem compatible with me somehow.

766
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,240
There's no spark.

767
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,380
There's no attraction or butterflies.

768
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,130
Wow, I can't stand this anymore.

772
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,680
Geez, are you crazy? It's not like that.

773
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,520
What is it, then? Do you like someone else?

774
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,390
I don't like anyone.

775
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,970
What is it, then?

776
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,400

Let me guess.

The Director is having a muscle ache.

790
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:20,910
No, he was shocked by cold water.

791

I see. That's how he sounds with muscle aches.

792
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,930
No, that's also from a cold water shock.

- Director, are you cold?
- No.

Aigoo. The boiler burst because it was too old.

798

There are no parts because it's old.
