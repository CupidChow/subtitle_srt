00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,790
this insurance takes care of you all your life.

185
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,730
You'll sign up, right?

186
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,730
Why do men want to provide me with

187
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,130
insurance more than love?

188
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,630
Is it a guarantee type or a survivor benefit type?

189
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,740
It's a guarantee type. Read the terms here.

190
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,260
Is being loved...

191
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,970
this hard for others, too?

192
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,230
Just give it to me.
I'll finish it and give it to you.

193
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,940
I feel like I was cursed to never be loved.

194
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,120
[2025 - Today]

195
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,260
Why is the door...

196
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,980
Hey, can't you close the door-

197
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,200
What?

198
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,340
What?

199
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,310
Ran, you must've been angry earlier.

200
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,640
Yes.

201
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,370
That was me preheating you for our hot night.

202
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,830
What? Was it all planned?

203
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,130
I had no idea. What a fool.

204
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,580
It's a surprise party for you.

205
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,280
You're the only one for me.

206
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,290
Likewise.

207
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,970
Come to the room.

208
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,910
I prepared a gift just for you.

209
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,450
So pretty.

210
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,280
You're my love slave.

211
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,060
What? Slave?

212
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,070
Babe.

213
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,510
Babe.

214
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,030
Why are you so skinny...

215
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,460
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?

216
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,900
What...

217
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,000
What are you looking at? What are you looking at?

218
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,580
Gosh, don't touch me!

219
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,660
Hey, hey, hey!

220
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,970
Hey, hey!

221
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,900
Hey! You...

222
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,340
You're mistaken! You're mistaken!

223
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,430
What? Mistaken? Mistaken?

224
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,070
Hey. Hey...

225
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,130
You!

226
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,550
Pervert!

227
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,920
What were you doing? How dare you dodge?

228
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,800
Hey. Come here. What were you doing?

229
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,780
What, what? Come here. Come here.

230
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,880
You...

231
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,900
What did you try to do at my house? What, what?

232
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,610
What were you trying to do?
Why are you dressed like this? Why?

233
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,000
Come here. Come here. You'd better come with me.

234
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,670
I'm sorry...

235
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,840
You're dead now. Seriously.

236
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,440
You will die.

237
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,090
Over here. Over here. Over here.

238
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,820
Freeze.

239
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,770
You'd better not move.

240
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,950
Gosh. No, no, no! He's the culprit.

241
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,330
Hey, hey! Are you laughing? Are you? Are you?

242
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,160
You were holding a weapon, too.

243
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,740
We couldn't help but be mistaken.

244
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,380
Are your wrists okay?

245
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,100
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,800
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,680
- Babe!
- Babe!

248
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,530
Babe, are you okay? Gosh.

249
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,320
I'm not okay. I got injured here.

250
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,760
- My gosh.
- I got injured here, too.

251
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,510
My sweetie got injured everywhere.

252
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,410
Hey, why would you hit someone? What are you, a thug?

253
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,840
A stranger was in his underwear in my house.

254
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,960
Was I supposed to leave him alone, then?

255
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,690
She's mistaken. I was wearing a robe, too.

256
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,720
But it fell because she scared me.

257
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,790
You said you weren't coming home tonight.

258
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,420
Why did you have to come home and do this?

259
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,390
You think I wanted to come home tonight?

260
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,500
And why do you care if I come home or not?

261
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,700
It's my house, and you live off me, okay?

262
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,240
Please arrest them for trespassing, sir!

263
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,420
Arrest her first for assault, sir!

264
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,640
- What did you say?
- What?

265
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,890
Babe, she had a weapon

266
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,790
and I got injured, too. It's aggravated assault.

267
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,650
- Right, sir?
- Yes.

268
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,620
Anyway, you're always so smart, Babe.

269
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,790
I'm a law school dropout, you know.

270
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,720
- You're so sexy. Seriously.
- You, too.

271
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,410
She must be out of her mind. Seriously.

272
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,380
- What are you looking at?
- What?

273
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,320
- Do you want to die?
- Please, calm down.

274
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,610
Sisters, please make up and go home now.

275
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,610
I don't want her to be imprisoned.

276
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,190
I want him to be imprisoned.

277
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,610
So, start the process, please?

278
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,340
What did my baby do wrong?

279
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,360
- What?
- What?

280
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,370
If you keep fighting here like this,

281
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,100
I need to call your mom.

282
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,150
Give me your mom's phone number.

283
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,870
No, ahjussi. Please.

284
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,910
We'll die if she finds out.

285
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,840
We'll actually die.

286
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,150
I'll die if Ji Ran dies.

287
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,660
That's great. Give them capital punishment, please.

288
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,670
Capital punishment? For your sister?

289
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,800
You're a total psychopath!

290
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,220
What? What did you say to your older sister?

291
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,030
Do you want to get killed by a psychopath today?

292
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,150
- Yes, do it!
- No, no!

293
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,770
Do it! Do it!

294
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,840
Let go! Let go!

295
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,420
- Let go!
- Stop!

296
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,920
Gosh, Unni. Seriously.

297
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,500
These two obviously don't have money.

298
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,890
You need to be more understanding.

299
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,190
That's how love is.

300
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,090
They're reckless and careless.

301
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,400
They just always want to be attached together.

302
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,650
You should know that by now.

303
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,490
Excuse me, ahjussi.

304
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,290
- Are you mocking my sister right now?
- Pardon?

305
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,210
How would she understand reckless love?

306
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,750
You can tell by just looking at her.

307
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,520
She has no man who wants her recklessly.

308
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,270
No matter how hard she tries to get attention,

309
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,890
no one would flock around her.

310
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,480
Unni,

311
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,210
it's okay. Don't get discouraged.

312
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,790
Everyone lives a unique life.

313
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,210
- Ji Ran.
- Unni.

314
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,890
I'll kill you. I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

315
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,280
- No, no! Stop!
- Fight outside. Outside.

316
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,970
What did you say? What did you say?

317
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,950
What's the deal? Did you break up again?

318
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,830
You should've made it work this time.

319
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,340
I thought you were finally sleeping outside often.

320
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,430
You'd better go home now and clean everything up.

321
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,150
If it's the same when I get home in two hours,

322
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,150
you'd better move out!

323
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,680
Why do you blame me for getting dumped?

324
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,790
Let's go, Babe.

325
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,910
Hold on, Babe.

326
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,040
- I hate stuff like this.
- Huh?

327
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,280
I should be polite, at least.

328
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,440
Get home safely, Sister-in-law.

329
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,740
Gosh, seriously.

330
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,160
Sister-in-law? Huh? Huh?

331
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,590
Seriously. You always act so proper.

332
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,020
You drive me crazy.

333
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,750
- Let's go, babe.
- Okay.

334
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:40,020
Unni, come back after two hours this time. Okay?

335
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,880
You've got to be kidding me.

336
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,530
By the way, babe, your sister

337
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,540
packs a punch more than I thought.

338
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,690
Right? She's a monster.

339
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,770
She's so scary.

340
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,960
- You must've been scared.
- Yes, totally.

341
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,760
I was going to surprise you after a fake fight.

342
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,580
But she showed up suddenly

343
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,360
- and started slapping my back.
- Really?

344
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,340
Those dogs. Why are you lovey-dovey in front of me?

345
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,700
Hey, go away.

346
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,530
Get out of my sight! Go.

347
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,510
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,140
They were so lovey-dovey. I'm sorry.

349
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,260
Gosh, everyone else is making love.

350
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,550
But why... Why am I...

351
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,620
left alone again?

352
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:46,130
I got my hair removed

353
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,140
and scrubbed my elbow and heels, too.

354
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,840
I'm wearing matching underwear, too.

355
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,840
Why? Why am I alone again?

356
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,500
Gosh, damn it.

357
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,620
[Never a sad ending]

358
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,560
Seriously.

359
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,930
Never a sad ending?

360
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:17,190
There's a sad ending right here. Shit...

361
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,430
But this isn't where your story ends.

362
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,850

527
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,000

528

00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,630
How would I rinse these suds? Huh?

546
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,170
I didn't even get to use soap!

547
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,550
Hot water stopped working?

548
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,330
I'll look into it.

549
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,490
The boiler must've stopped working.

550
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,500
We missed the gas payment.

551
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,820
This is for the better.

552
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,840
What?

553
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,870
Chris Bumstead takes a cold shower every morning.

554
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,960
A cold shower after a workout
strengthens the immune system,

555
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,540
improves circulation and metabolism.

556
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,680
Most importantly, it recovers tired muscles quickly.

557
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,410
What are you saying? I almost had a heart attack.

558
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,720
But they have no muscles.

559
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,900
That's actually a good thing, too.

560
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,920
- What?
- You just need to gain muscles now.

561
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,460
Cut the nonsense.

562
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,090
Turn the hot water on now.

563
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,960
Cold water doesn't feel cold after a proper workout.

564
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,750
If the water feels cold, warm up your body more.

565
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,230
Director Do!

566
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,200
Do you think I'm joking right now?

567
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,850
You didn't forget who I am, did you?

568
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,210
I've been a member here for 10 years.

569
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,180
I'm Im Seong Im.

570
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,760
I'll fix it immediately, Ms. Im.

571
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,960
The cold water must've startled you.

572
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,620
Gosh.

573
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,720
Is it because of the cold water?

574
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,090
Your skin looks even tighter.

575
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,600
Really?

576
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,230
People might think you're a millennial.

577
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,270
Director Do,

578
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,660
I'm still here because of Director Dong.

579
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,640
If I quit, a lot of people here would, too.

580
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,090
You'd better get your act together.

581
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,480
The cold water makes me feel cold.

582
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,210
I need to eat something hot.

583
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,250
I'll buy you all braised monkfish.

584
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,260
I'd love that broth.

585
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,930
Monkfish sounds amazing right now.

586
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,060
I love it.

587
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:28,930
My gosh, my face does look tighter.

588
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,160
Did you hear, guys?

589
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Director Dong fainted...

590
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,620
because of Director Do, apparently.

591
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,290
He wants to take over the gym.

592
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,020
Really?

593
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,640
I thought Director Dong trained Director Do

594
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,110
when he was abandoned at an orphanage.

595
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,930
This is why they say, "No good deed goes unpunished."

596
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,330
He worked so hard on raising him.

597
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,600
But he left for the US, came back,

598
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,700
and he created this mess. Geez.

599
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,890
Gosh. Why would he want this half-basement gym?

600
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:14,460
Seriously. You're so clueless.

601
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,670
It's still in the heart of Seoul.

602
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,200
If they charge a premium,

603
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,930
I'm sure they can get some out of it.

604
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,110
I suppose. It was kind of strange.

605
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,570
He brags about being successful in the US,

606
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,230
but the gym is deteriorating day by day.

607
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,370
We lost hot water, too.

608
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,000
It was on purpose.

609
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,150
He's trying to kick us out.

610
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,640
He wants all of us gone.

611
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,300
Gosh, be quiet now.

612
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,760
Let's get ready now.

613
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,810
Aren't we going to get braised monkfish?

614
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,310
We'd better!

615
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:48,480
Unni, I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.

616
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,550
I'm so beat.

617
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,710
Thank you for today.

618
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,300
You, too.

619
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,230
To be honest, I can't understand our clients.

620
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,660
I'd be thankful to have Director Do.

621
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,790
Why do they all hate him?

622
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,920
Should they be thankful, then?

623
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,760
He was a top bodybuilder in the US.

624
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,740
But he's working hard to revive the half-basement gym.

625
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,920
If so, why would he treat them like that?

626
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,340
I'm sure he's lifting as if nothing happened right now.

627
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,810
He acts cool in front of us,

628
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,660
but I'm sure he worries a lot.

629
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,590
You know how he stays at the gym 24-7.

630
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,910
He's worried, too.

631
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,720
I'm worried about you.

632
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,130
Pardon?

633
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,320
I don't know.

634
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,560
I really don't know.

635
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,090
Why is the back workout so enjoyable?

636
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,490
I really don't know.

637
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,640
You can't get strong that way!

638
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,440
One more! Do one more!

639
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,900
Hold tighter. Hold tighter!

640
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,900
Raise it higher! Do more!

641
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,720
Hey, hey! Hold tight! Hold tight!

642
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,070
One more! That's right!

643
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,430
Raise it higher! Higher!

644
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,750
Again. One more.

645
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,830
I can't do it.

646
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,700
What do you mean? Do more! Do more!

647
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,670
More! Don't rest. Raise it! Raise it!

648
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,080
Higher! Higher!

649
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Why did you do that to me?

650
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,170
Why did you?

651
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,110
Because you humiliated me.

652
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,040
[Sexy, hot, and intense]

653
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,510
That's him.

654
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,850
How dare you spread flyers like this in our area?

655
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,990
Hyungnim, this isn't a club.

656
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,870
It's a gym.

657
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,480
Have you been to a gym?

658
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,860
No.

659
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,640
Why would a gym open at this hour...

660
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,790
But it is.

661
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,950
Yes, it is.

662
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,460
But you came...

663
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,870
at this hour.

664
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:28,690
What's this bastard saying? You...

665
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,170
The upper and lower body aren't balanced.

666
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,420
And you can't talk to me casually.

667
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,110
Hyungnim!

668
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,410
I'm going easy on you.

669
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:45,000
Wait. It's not your turn yet.

670
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,060
One, two. One, two.

671
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,050
Why are you whining already? One, two.

672
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,110
You lack in reflexes and everything else.

673
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:06,870
Anyway, I'm glad you came, members.

674
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,110
You don't use force on others.

675
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,650
You use it to make yourself stronger.

676
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,440
Here we go. One.

677
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,870
One...

678
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,270
Stand straight and go far down. Two!

679
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,440
Two!

680
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,720
I don't know about you guys,

681
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,800
but I don't allow giving up.

682
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,150
You can lift it.

683
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,590
Everyone, start over!

684
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,380
- What?
- Hey!

685
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,190
Stop being interested in others.

686
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,590
We'll only be interested in our bodies, okay?

687
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,960
Okay!

688
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,260
I can't hear you. Understand?

689
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,740
Yes!

690
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,130
Why won't you sleep with me?

691
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,770
Why won't you sleep with me?

692
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,370
Gosh. Stop, I said.

693
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,360
Gosh, I'm so tired.

694
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,990
Are you putting cream cheese on the bagel

695
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:32,190
or do you need a plate for the cream cheese?

696
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,440
It's tastier this way.

697
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,770
What? What is it? What is it now?

698
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,010
When you have a fight with your significant other,

699
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,990
if they say, "let's quit" during the fight,

700
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,890
do they mean the relationship or the fight?

701
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,810
Probably the fight, right?

702
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,130
Why? Did Joon Seok suggest quitting?

703
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,440
No, I'm talking about a friend.

704
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,830
They're normally suggesting
quitting the relationship.

705
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,240
Why? How come?

706
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,510
If they want to quit fighting,

707
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,170
you'd say, "Let's talk later," or...

708
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,750
Or?

709
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,360
You kiss, right?

710
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,690
Hey!

711
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,410
Why bring up kissing while I'm eating a bagel?

712
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,180
Why? Why did Joon Seok suggest quitting?

713
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,860
I'm talking about my friend, not me.

714
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,140
Go and tell your friend, then.

715
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,700
Tell her to stop torturing herself and just ask.

716
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,910
What if they actually break up with her?

717
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,940
Unni, go ask Joon Seok.

718
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,250
Don't ask and answer on your own.

719
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,460
If you can't, just try kissing instead.

720
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,410
He's not here.

721
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,850
- Hello.
- Hello.

722
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,180
I'll send it right now.

723
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,650
What took you so long? I've been looking for you.

724
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,080
Why? Is something going on?

725
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,960
Mi Ran, you need to take a train.

726
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,470
A train office workers hate the most.

727
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,050
Pardon?

728
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,080
A train to work.

729
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,720
There's something actually urgent. Really.

730
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,340
What will we have for lunch today?

731
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,390
Oh, lunch today?

732
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,590
Well, for today...

733
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:18,610
How about gamjatang with in-season potatoes?

734
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:21,920
Gamjatang! I love it.

735
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,200
I've been worried about what
to eat since this morning.

736
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,000
I knew you'd know the answer, Mi Ran.

737
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,360
I made a plan since the weekend.

738
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,280
I always learn from you.

739
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,760
Don't mention it.

740
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,980
Gamjatang, tang!

741
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,640
Gamjatang! Gamjatang!

742
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,290
Let's all go get gamjatang. It's my treat.

743
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,050
- Why?
- Well, I'm...

744
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:52,120
joining the task force for South America.

745
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,540
I'll have to be gone for a bit.

746
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,870
I was going to tell them about it.

747
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,940
When do they want you to start?

748
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,920
Starting today.

749
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,940
Today?

750
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,500
- Today?
- All of a sudden?

751
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,080
You didn't know, Mi Ran?

752
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,120
Well...

753
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,570
No, I didn't know.

754
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,690
The marketing team suddenly said they needed help.

755
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:25,140
So, they asked me to come urgently.

756
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,940
Well, hold on.

757
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,960
How could his girlfriend not know about it?

758
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,350
It's a bit strange, right?

759
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,800
What do we do? Look at Mi Ran's face.

760
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,810
Looks like she had no idea.

761
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,160
Isn't he leaving to break up?

762
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,430
Gosh, even I feel so sad.

763
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:56,550
Imagine how Mi Ran must feel.

764
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,800
Well, I'm okay. Yes.

765
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,220
Joon Seok, this is so sad.

766
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,270
I know.

767
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,560
But we'll see each other often, right?

768
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,310
- Right.
- If so...

769
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:09,710
I'll make a reservation even though I'm sad.

770
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,700
Joon Seok, can we talk for a second?

771
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,490
It'd only take a second.

772
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:31,220
We haven't been here for so long, right?

773
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,460
We used to come here often to avoid our coworkers.

774
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,430
Although they found out quickly because of me.

775
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,000
Right.

776
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,310
When did you decide to join the TF team?

777
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:50,120
Not long ago.

778
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,380
You should've told me sooner.

779
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,250
I would've been less shocked, then.

780
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:01,020
- Mi Ran, to be honest-
- Right now, we're...

781
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,150
fighting, right?

782
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,550
We didn't break up, right?

783
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:08,080
Mi Ran,

784
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,380
I love you.

785
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,770
Thank you.

786
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:24,550
No one cares for other people

787
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,930
and makes them happy as much as you.

788
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,140
You always consider what others like,

789
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,050
and what they need.

790
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:34,270
You always think about that and try to help.

791
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,380
That's why the customers love
your tour package, too.

792
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,440
Because that's how you created it, right?

793
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,790
Thank you.

794
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:48,120
So,

795
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,910
you'll find someone better than me.

796
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,980
What?

797
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,700
I think you're...

798
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,080
too good for me.

799
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,920
What are you talking about right now?

800
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,530
I think we should stop now.

801
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:07,040
For you and for me, too.

802
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,170
I'll go now.

803
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,310
Joon Seok, hold on.

804
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,220
Hold on.

805
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,270
Give me the answer, still.

806
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,550
Why didn't we sleep together last night?

807
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:28,890
Mi Ran, please.

808
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:31,740
Don't make an excuse and tell me.

809
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,460
If you just leave,

810
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:40,270
I have to wonder my whole life.

811
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:44,430
I have to revisit our every moment together

812
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,320
and repent without even knowing

813
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,800
what I did wrong.

814
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,680
So, tell me.

815
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,460
Why did we stop last night?

816
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,590
Huh?

817
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:58,900
Why did we stop?

818
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,580
Why does that matter now?

819
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,080
It matters to me.

820
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,790
So, tell me.

821
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,390
It's because...

822
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:35,250
Is that why we're breaking up?

823
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,430
My chest...

824
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:40,430
My chest...

825
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:42,360
is about to break.

826
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,410
It feels like it, but it isn't.

827
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:47,190
I can't...

828
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,110
I can't anymore.

829
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,360
I always told you. The chest exercise is...

830
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,430
The chest exercise has to be more painful

831
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:05,700
than when your heart was broken.

832
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,100
Bingo.

833
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,530
It's nothing but pain.

834
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:11,400
It's not hard.

835
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,950
Lie down again.

836
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,300
Huh?

837
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,670
Director Do!

838
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,190
Director Do!

839
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:25,030
You're late again. You're late again.

840
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,610
Why did you pay the rent three days late?

841
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:31,130
Sir, we'll make sure we aren't late next month.

842
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,210
How am I supposed to believe you?

843
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,480
Director Dong tortured me with this, too.

844
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,840
Now you're doing this.

845
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,360
Whatever! Whatever! Whatever!

846
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,090
Don't worry. I'm not like Director Dong.

847
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,930
Since I knew Director Dong well,

848
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,680
I gave you a chance without raising the rent.

849
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,060
But I can't take it anymore.

850
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,280
Move out immediately!

851
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,430
Please have faith in me.

852
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:50,320
How am I supposed to?

853
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,940
This crumbling gym?

854
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,680
I know what'd happen.

855
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,070
Are you saying you can't trust me?

856
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:59,190
Yes. I can't trust you. I can't.

857
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,690
I can't. I can't. So, what?

858
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,870
What? What? I said I can't.

859
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:05,850
You can't trust me?

860
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,490
What are you doing right now? Huh?

861
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:22,870
Why won't the shirt come off?

862
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,880
Keep the shirt down.

863
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,460
Sir,

864
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:32,550
do you know what kind of chest this is?

865
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,010
It allowed me to win the Mr. Seoul Grand Prize.

866
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,100
With these shoulders and biceps,

867
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,700
I won a gold medal at the Asian Games.

868
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,630
And this is...

869
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,430
the best torso that let me win

870
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,470
the David Grand Prize trophy.

871
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,030
So?

872
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,080
That means the world approved my body.

873
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,320
This body can pay three times
more than the current rent.

874
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,800
If you have no faith in the gym,
have faith in my body.

875
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,190
This body right here.

876
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,320
Okay. Okay, so...

877
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,240
I'll watch you for a few more months.

878
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,760
I can't give you more time than that.

879
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,590
The Grand Prize? Pay rent on time.

880
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:23,430
- Take care!
- I can't keep letting it slide.

881
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,660
Director Do.

882
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,980
- Lie down.
- Lying down.

883
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,550
- Get in position.
- Getting in position.

884
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,260
One, two.

885
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,560
- What's this?
- I quit.

886
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,300
Pardon?

887
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,970
I can't stand to watch...

888
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,970
this place keep failing.

889
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,450
Rosa.

890
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,840
Supercompensation.

891
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,640
To improve, not just to recover,

892
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,360
you have to overload the system.

893
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,320
Our gym isn't crumbling right now.

894
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,960
It's supercompensating.

895
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,620
Don't worry, and trust me on this.

896
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,960
Lie down.

897
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,740
No.

898
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,690
I can't trust you.

899
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,620
Do you...

900
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,880
really not trust me?

901
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,090
Taking it off won't work with me.

902
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,380
Rosa.

903
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,890
I won the David Grand Prize in the US.

904
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,980
He's begging you not to leave.

905
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,100
They call me the David of Asia.

906
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,490
He's asking you to stay and help him.

907
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,620
I'll sign up for the Total Life Care.

908
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,610
Here's five million.

909
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,520
You were right, Director.

910
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,730
My body is the problem.

911
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:29,490
So, tell me.

912
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,300
Why did we stop last night?

913
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,020
Why does that matter now?

914
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,490
It matters to me.

915
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:37,210
So, tell me.

916
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,610
It's because I can't do it with you.

917
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,400
What?

918
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,110
I can't do it with you, I said.

919
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,600
No matter how much I try,

920
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,240
my body won't respond.

921
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,650
I just can't do it with you, okay?

922
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:14,010
At that moment,

923
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:17,330
I faced the answer to the mystery

924
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:20,220
I've wanted to find out

925
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,850
but I've actually known deep down.

926
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,680
Me...

927
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,950
My body.

928
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:54,800
Can I really change with Total Life Care?

929
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,520
Of course.

930
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,100
I swear I'll have the perfect body.

931
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,530
I swear I'll let you have it.

932
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,600
I'll make him regret it.

933
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,870
I'll change.

934
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:11,200
You won't care if people regret it or not.

935
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,890
You'll change perfectly.

936
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:14,770
Your life will.

937
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,870
What?

938
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:37,980
Crying makes you lose muscles.

939
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,430
Okay.

940
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,830
I'm not crying.

941
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:49,530
Although you don't have much to lose.

942
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,430
Okay.

943
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,130
Start working out today.

944
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:57,040
No, I'll start tomorrow.

945
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,100
I don't feel so good today.

946
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,020

952

What the fat?

953
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,280
I said I know!

Good morning. What did you have for breakfast?

00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,390
Did you find another man?

980
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:27,710
I was worried my wedding would

00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,170
make you feel uncomfortable.

00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,660
Right, the wedding.

Cancel it right now. You lose the fat, not the shot.
