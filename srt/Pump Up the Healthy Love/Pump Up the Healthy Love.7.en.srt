When did I say you could eat one
drenched in sauce?

60
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,370
Chicken breast should be simply boiled or roasted

No, no. It's not like that.

91
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,190
It's a rut in fitness.
That's why it's a fitness rut.

92
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,030

and gets tired of it.

94
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,600
I think I'm in a fitness rut.

95
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,470
Look. I work out so much,

96
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,980

105
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,940
It's sad. I grew very attached to her.

106
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,360

I, Do Hyeon Joong, knew you'd return.

114
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,260
You want to quit while you're working out,

115
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,780
but you keep thinking about it
when you're not doing it.

116

how about we start with the lower body?

She could've reported you for this.

146

Why did you ignore my texts, then?

147

Don't you know that's the most petty move?

[Do not touch!]

153
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,890
I thought you might take
your stuff while I was gone.

154
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,890
That's why I did that.

155
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,210
I can just remove it.

156
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,230
Ms. Lee, everyone falls into a rut in life.

157
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,170
But this is a fitness rut that can be overcome.

158
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,570
- Move.
- Did you forget already?

159
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,980
We built your biceps, triceps, and dorsi muscles.

160
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,440
Do they mean nothing to you?

161
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,560
Gosh, how romantic.

162
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,870
Your quadriceps and glutes are so strong.

163
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,430
Will you waste them away like this?

164
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,460
Don't waste them away.

165
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,300
Your body is filled with our memories of training.

166
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,240
Don't worry. They will be gone soon.

167
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,690
A lot of them are already gone.

168
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,130
Gosh, move.

169
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,640
Geez.

170
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,360
Just one day.

171
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,590
Give me just one day.

172
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,740
If you don't want to work out
after spending a day with me,

173
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,420
I'll no longer text or call you.

174
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,960
I won't say working out fixes everything, either.

175
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,550
Do you promise?

176
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,960
I promise!

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,780
He's so masculine. Seriously.

182
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,110
I know.

183
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,330
Hold on.

184
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,500
Director Do just left.

185
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,860
You don't have a PT session today, then.

186
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,450
You're right!

187
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,680
Unni, should we go get some chicken soup, then?

188
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,940
Let's go.

189
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,010
You can't.

190
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,060
Ms. Im, Director asked me to train you today.

191
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,480
My goodness. When did he make that plan, anyway?

192
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,250
Because no one can stop you from working out.

193
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,130
Ms. Im, come this way.

194
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,580
No, no, no. Guys, guys.

195
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,040
Let's go get chicken soup.

196
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,870
- Ms. Im! Ms. Im!
- Gosh!

197
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,870
Gosh, gosh...

198
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,840
Should we start with burpees?

199
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,910
Burpees?

200
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,490
Burpees.

201
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,310
I'm not in the mood for that today.

202
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,920
If so, should we start with squats?

203
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,410
- Should we?
- Yes.

204
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,740
Okay.

205
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,920
One.

206
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,320
One.

207
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,600
Come up.

208
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,890
Two.

209
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,260
Two.

210
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,510
My goodness.

211
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,460
Alex, why are your feet so big?

212
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,410
Have they been this big since you were young?

213
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,720
I'm not sure.

214
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,090
They say big feet mean you'd get tall.

215
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,520
My feet weren't so big when I was a kid.

216
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,200
- I think I grew a lot during puberty.
- Wow!

217
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,100
- Want to see my childhood photo?
- Yes, yes.

218
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,880
Ms. Im, working out is all about the flow.

219
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,610
You can't rest. Start over.

220
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,690
Yes, I need to work out.

221
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,690
Did I eat too salty for breakfast?

222
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,170
I'll go drink some water.

223
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,480
You only did two squats just now.

224
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,040
Did you get a reservation at the restaurant?

225
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,090
I did. I did. Let's get two servings each.

226
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,360
Good, good.

227
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,480
Did you know?

228
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,230
She totally played you just now.

229
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,820
A PT client always has two attitudes.

230
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,060
What are those?

231
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,190
One.

232
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,700
Because the workout is too hard,

233
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,000
they want to do as little as possible.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,490
To do as little as possible,

235
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,300
they do everything they can.

236
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,700
They drink water slowly, pretend they got a call,

237
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,600
change the subject and distract
the trainer completely.

238
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,970
I love it!

239
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,110
The session is almost over,

240
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,050
but what if they didn't work out as much?

241
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,380
Gosh, gosh.

242
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,930
Look at the time already.

243
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,590
I had an hour-long session,

244
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,370
but I'm not sweating.

245
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,640
How will I lose weight this way?

246
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,040
I'm leaving.

247
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,190
Guys, let's go!

248
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,860
Let's go!

249
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,260
That's the other attitude.

250
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,400
They paid money to work out,

251
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,460
but they don't think they did enough.

252
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,740
They think they wasted money

253
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,370
and they think everything is the trainer's fault.

254
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,970
Rosa, Ms. Im started-

255
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,070
A trainer also needs to keep
the clients motivated.

256
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,990
From now on, don't let the client take control.

257
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,690
You're the one who's taking control.

258
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,950
Okay?

259
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,120
- Okay.
- Fighting.

260
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,290
What are we doing? You said
you'd get me out of a rut.

261
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,270
Even meat gets old if you eat it every day.

262
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,130
Moving the same way every day gets old, too.

263
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,660
At times like that, you switch the menu

264
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,450
and eat a special meal, too.

265
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,780
Don't pretend that meat and exercise are similar.

266
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,510
Ms. Lee, I sometimes have

267
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,520
trouble getting over something.

268
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,930
At times like that, you...

269
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,780
make those feelings disappear with a gun.

270
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,210
Look.

271
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,410
I got five out of 10 shots.

272
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,030
It's very hard to do.

273
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,510
You should give it a try, too.

274
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,600
You'll be able to forget what troubles you.

275
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,440
Don't forget you promised to let me go.

276
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,060
I'll go get my stuff.

277
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,120
How did you...

278
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,000
M-Ms. Lee! Ms. Lee!

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,800
Ms. Lee, you have a lot on your mind.

280
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,600
And choosing to go shooting, a mental sport,
was a mishap on my part.

281
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,350
I'm sorry to hear that. I'll go get my stuff now.

282
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,180
Wait, Ms. Lee.

283
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,450
Are you hungry, by chance?

284
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,250
I know good restaurants around here.

285
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,710
There's a place that's perfect for this weather.

286
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,260
Eating outside in this weather would be amazing.

287
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,120
You're lying again, aren't you?

288
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,710
Never. Trust me.

289
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,410
Follow me.

290
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,010
Is it meat?

291
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,460
You said we were eating outside.

292
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,920
We're treating our thighs outside.

293
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,730
Geez.

294
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,830
Ms. Lee, when you can't control your mind,

295
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,830
try to control a ball instead.

296
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,410
Pretend this is your mind.

297
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,210
When you shoot toward the basket,

298
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,660
you shoot your worries away, too.

299
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,300
Want to try taking the ball from me?

300
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,200
If I take that ball, will you let me go?

301
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,110
It won't be so easy.

302
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,650
What the...

303
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,260
The left hand only helps out.

304
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,200
I can go get my stuff now, right?

305
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,790
What are you, Ms. Lee?

306
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,010
M-Ms. Lee!

307
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,870
Drink this.

308
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,580
Consuming protein after a workout is a must.

309
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,470
Drink, drink, drink, drink.

310
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,520
Here comes protein.

311
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,200
Drink, drink, drink, drink.

312
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,980
Look at my shoulders.

313
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,440
I bulked up.

314
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,250
Stop acting so silly.

315
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,330
Today is over already.

316
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,070
What are you talking about?

317
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,670
The day is over?

318
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,630
There are so many sports
besides shooting and basketball.

319
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,280
A sport that balances your life,

320
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,740
not just your body. Skating.

321
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,230
Or climbing, which overcomes the gravity of life.

322
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,870
Everything is about exercise to you, Director.

323
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,070
I told you.

324
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,810
Once your body changes,

325
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,270
your life changes.

326
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,180
I suppose.

327
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,580
Working out did change my life.

328
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,000
It made me miserable every time.

329
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,990
Do you know why I'm good
at shooting and basketball?

330
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,420
Because I wanted to be loved.

331
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,520
What do you want? Fried chicken?

332
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,560
<i>I had a crush on my senior
when I was a freshman.</i>

333
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,550
Sounds good? Yeah?

334
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,110
Hey, I love that shooter.

335
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,760
A woman who knows how to shoot is cool.

336
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,910
She's so popular.

337
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,460
She's popular these days.

338
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,590
Right. She's hot now.

339
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,320
<i>I shot 20,000 times a week.</i>

340
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,420
<i>Because I wanted to
be a good shooter for him.</i>

341
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,100
- Sunbae, what are you doing?
- Hey.

342
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,640
Do you want to go to a shooting range with me?

343
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,900
- A shooting range?
- I'm a good shooter.

344
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,360
I got this for shooting 10,000 shots.

345
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,790
I see.

346
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,900
You can have this.

347
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,950
Me? No, no.

348
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,530
I quit smoking.

349
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,870
You're smoking right now, though.

350
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,320
Starting now. Right this moment.

351
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,480
<i>His type isn't a woman
who knows how to shoot.</i>

352
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,340
<i>He just liked the woman in the poster.</i>

353
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,100
<i>But I didn't know.</i>

354
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,370
Hey, hey! Over here!

355
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,440
<i>And as for basketball...</i>

356
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,690
<i>I studied with this senior for a job search.</i>

357
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,410
Gosh, amazing.

358
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,510
<i>I wanted to get to know him.</i>

359
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,470
Sunbaenim,

360
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,840
can I try playing basketball, too?

361
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,390

Firstly, we'll check your flexibility.

- Okay.
- Extend your arms.

No, it's okay. It's okay.

That feels good.

514
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,570

Unni, by the way, why is Director Dong so angry?

522
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:14,330
We criticized Director Do
because he's different from us,

523
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,910
but the gym would've closed if it wasn't for him.

524
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:24,110
You know, he's been paying
Director Dong's hospital bills, too.

525
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:29,160
Why does Director Dong hate him, then?

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,140
until the end without giving up.

545
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,240
Giving up means abandoning.

546
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,040
You never abandon anyone.

547
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,830
Never.

548
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,190
Yes.

549
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,290
A trainer never abandons their client.

550
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,890
A trainer never gives up on their client!

551
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,850
What should we eat today

552
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:09,050
so everyone would talk about it?

553
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,950
How about we eat burgers for a change?

554
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,890
A good one just opened, apparently.

555
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,150
The handmade burger shop? I hear they're amazing.

556
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,460
- I've been meaning to go there.
- Really?

557
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,520
Hold on. Would you be okay, Mi Ran?
You're on a diet.

558
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,410
Gosh, I'd love a burger.

559
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,380
I'll eat everything without worrying now.

560
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,140
Tteokbokki, pizza, cakes,

561
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,040
and malatang. I can eat all that.

562
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,450
Gosh, Mi Ran is back.

563
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,950
I'm here, everyone.

564
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,730
<i>Welcome.</i>

565
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,020
Nice, nice.

566
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,250
By the way, do you know what color a burger is?

567
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,960
Hold on. Hold on...

568
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,090
- I've heard this. It's...
- This is old.

569
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,410
Burgundy.

570
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,100
This is burgundy.

571
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,720
I think he's lost it.

572
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,400
Chief!

573
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:04,180
Who says you don't have to care?

574
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,360
Director.

575
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,560
I can't give up on you, Mi Ran.

576
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,880
You can call me a stalker

577
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,020
and criticize me for not keeping a promise.

578
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,930
Think of me as a loser who doesn't keep promises.

579
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:20,560
I'll never give up
and hold onto you until the end.

580
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,490
Get lunch without me today.

581
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,180
- O-Okay, okay.
- Enjoy.

582
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,810
Follow me.

583
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,750
You're so heavy!

584
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,990
What? Is he in unrequited love, then?

585
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,260
Gosh, no way...

586
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,770
You promised to let me go. Did you forget?

587
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,370
No, I didn't forget.

588
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,750
But I can't bring myself to give up.

589
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,320
Is your body full of nothing but sad memories?

590
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,700
We've been setting a goal and running together.

591
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,500
We ran together and ran out of breath together.

592
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,940
Does your body not remember
those fulfilling moments at all?

593
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,590
Could you not talk about working out that way?

594
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,320
Just one more time.

595
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,440
Give me a chance.

596
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,600
Just once more for the last time.

597
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,590
Say, yes!

598
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,530
<i>Say, yes!</i>

599
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,330
<i>Say, yes!</i>

600
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,750
No, no. It's not like that.

601
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,690
<i>Say, yes!</i>

602
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,380
<i>Say, yes!</i>

603
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,320
<i>Say, yes!</i>

604
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,470
Okay, okay.

605
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,350
Okay, okay, I said.

606
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,620
You said, okay.

607
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,730
- Okay, I said.
- You promised me.

608
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,150
I promise you.

609
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,820
Enjoy your lunch, everyone.

610
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,840
I muscle go now.

611
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,380
You're so beautiful.

612
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,920
Gosh, what's he trying to do now?

613
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,510
I can't believe I'm hiking!

614
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,640
You aren't supposed to climb mountains.

615
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,230
You're supposed to look at them.

616
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,610
I'll never hike. Never.

617
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,060
According to my research, none of the men

618
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,500
you liked enjoyed hiking.

619
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,060
Thank you so much. Well, then.

620
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,170
Don't think of it as an exercise today.

621
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,340
We're just here to enjoy nature.

622
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,480
Shall we go up, then?

623
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,890
No.

624
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,130
I don't want to. I won't go up.

625
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,380
Can we just eat tofu and makgeolli?

626
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,600
How did you feel after the last session, Mr. Kang?

627
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,390
I had an extreme body ache.

628
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,450
I barely managed to come here today.

629
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:47,120
So, I'd like to take it easy.

630
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,200
<i>Giving up means abandoning.</i>

631
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,190
<i>You never abandon anyone.</i>

632
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,100
<i>Right. I won't give up on my client.</i>

633
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,230
<i>Because I'm a trainer.</i>

634
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,060
Starting today, no matter what excuse you make,

635
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,410
I'll trust your body and not give up.

636
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:08,000
So, you should trust me and give up.

637
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,900
- Pardon?
- Give up on giving up exercising.

638
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,200
Enjoying nature like this

639
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,630
clears your mind and mood.

640
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:20,070
You'll end up getting out of the rut, too.

641
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,700
Why go up if you'll go down, anyway?

642
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,580
Ms. Lee, hiking isn't about climbing to the top.

643
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,120
It's about the process.

644
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,470
The process of climbing.

645
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,750
Oh! Look at that.

646
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,250
Isn't that a stone tower for making a wish?

647
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,270
We should try it, too.

648
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,590
This is a part of the fun process of hiking.

649
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,430
Let me start.

650
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,850
I prayed for you to overcome the rut.

651
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,750
You try it, too.

652
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,890
No, no, no. Gosh, no...

653
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,450
I guess I won't overcome the rut.

654
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,170
No one believes in this stuff.

655
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,700
Okay, then.

656
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,290
One.

657
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,950
- Two.
- Two.

658
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,090
- Three.
- Sir, I-I'm a bit dizzy.

659
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,810
<i>He can't control me.</i>

660
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,650
- Three.
- T-Three.

661
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,130
Three.

662
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,250
I think I'll throw up.

663
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,460
<i>Take control. Trust the client's body.</i>

664
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,440
- Five.
- Five.

665
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,940
Five.

666
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,240
- Babe!
- Mr. Kang!

667
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,190
Mr. Kang!

668
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,580
What's this?

669
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,440
It's a lunchbox.

670
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,470
The key point of your training is the diet.

671
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,500
But still. You brought lunch?

672
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,340
I made it myself.

673
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:23,150
It's that protein shake that tastes awful, right?

674
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,850
No. I've changed a lot
since I trained with you, too.

675
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,330
I know how to enjoy tasty food sometimes now.

676
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,160
Thanks to you.

677
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,570
Here. Try it.

678
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,670
It's sweet-salty-sweet-salty.

679
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,020
You got me something sweet-salty?

680
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,860
Ta-da. Protein, ta-da. Protein, ta-da.

681
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,290
Chicken breast kimbap, ta-da. Tofu, ta-da.

682
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,790
Ta-da.

683
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,340
You've got to be kidding me.

684
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,040
Try some.

685
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,810
W-What's wrong?

686
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,650
What's the matter?

687
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,890
H-Hold on.

688
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,490
M-Ms...

689
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,220
M-Ms. Lee!

690
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,540
Her sister said none of the men
she liked were into hiking.

691
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,840
Did the lunchbox trigger a memory?

692
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,290
Babe, babe, are you okay?

693
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,660
- Babe.
- Hey!

694
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,170
Babe.

695
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,340
Babe.

696
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,140
Babe!

697
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,380
I thought I'd never see you again.

698
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,880
No way. Why would I not see you again?

699
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,500
He said he can't.

700
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,760
Why would you force someone who can't?

701
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,200
If I trust his body and...

702
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,580
- keep trying without giving up, in the end-
- In the end, what?

703
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,430
He'll give up on giving up-

704
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,970
- What's wrong with giving up?
- Pardon?

705
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,420
If you give up today, you try again tomorrow.

706
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,220
If you can't tomorrow,
you can give up and try again.

707
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,210
Why did you make him pass out? Why?

708
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,580
I'm sorry.

709
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,110
I-I'm okay. I'm okay.

710
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,680
Babe, hop on my back.

711
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,740
Come on.

712
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,280
Okay, okay.

713
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,890
Gosh, what's wrong? Mr. Kang.

714
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,270
What...

715
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,380
It's already been 10 minutes. Where did she go?

716
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,920
Ms. Lee!

717
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,900
Ms. Lee!

718
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,990
Excuse me. Let me ask you something.

719
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,140
Did you see a woman up there, by chance?

720
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,470
Her shoulders and glutes are very developed.

721
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,380
Her mouth gets huge when she smiles.

722
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,710
It's satisfying to see.

723
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,080
I'm not sure. I don't know about the smile.

724
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,720
I saw an upset-looking woman

725
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,430
going up toward the cliff there.

726
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,140
Yes, she looked very upset.

727
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,780
- Right?
- Yes, yes.

728
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,490
Thank you.

729
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,490
The cliff...

730
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,660
Ms. Lee!

731
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,460
Ms. Lee!

732
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,480
Ms. Lee!

733
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,470
- Don't come near me.
- What are you doing right now?

734
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,890
Don't come near me, I said!

735
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,180
Stop it right now.

736
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,470
I'm already done for.

737
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,200
So, don't come near me, I said.

738
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,930
- You'd be helping me that way.
- No.

739
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,890
W-Why not?

740
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,890
I won't...

741
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,690
let you be alone like me.

742
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,650
I won't let you give up on yourself.

743
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,130
Go, I said!

744
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,760
I can help you, Ms. Lee.

745
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,330
How? What can you help me with?

746
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,620
Everything!

747
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,280
I'll do everything for you. Please-

748
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,460
Please? Please what?

749
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,170
I just... I just...

750
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,850
I...

751
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,170
got an upset stomach.

752
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,860
- Pardon?
- So, please...

753
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,910
go away! Get over there!

754
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,400
So...

755
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,080
- you just-
- Go!

756
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,960
Pinch your nose and turn around now.

757
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,740
What did you eat, Ms. Lee?

758
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,580
I told you so.

759
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:08,340
I looked everywhere and found this herb.

760
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,180
It stops diarrhea and warms your body.

761
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,900
Eat it. It'll help.

762
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,310
Are you an herbal doctor or something?

763
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,150
I was born at 1.5 kg

764
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,810
and my body was very weak.

765
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:31,340
I tried hard so I could live longer.

766
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,030
I always have, even before I started working out.

767
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,120
You're kind of strange. You know that?

768
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,890
Why are you overreacting so much?

769
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,630
I just said I'll quit working out.

770
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,120
You're acting as if my life would be ruined.

771
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,680
You followed me here, too.

772
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,000
It's a bit strange.

773
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,420
To be honest, you were strange before, too.

774
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:03,760
With Cheol Nam and Hye Bin, too.

775
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,330
Because it's too sad when someone

776
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,430
gives up on you.

777
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,360
<i>1.5 kg.</i>

778
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,380
<i>I was born smaller and weaker
than a dumbbell.</i>

779
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,990
<i>Everyone gave up on me.</i>

780
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,540
<i>Even the doctor and my parents.</i>

781
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,450
- Ahjussi!
- Hey, yes!

782
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:29,310
<i>That's probably when I learned</i>

783
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,180
<i>- that being weak...</i>
- Really?

784
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,630
<i>means you're being given up.</i>

785
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:42,140
<i>I wanted to become strong.</i>

786
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,540
<i>So I don't get abandoned.</i>

787
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,290
How do I become like you, ahjussi?

788
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,230
21.

789
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,000
22.

790
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,640
- More.
<i>- That's why I really...</i>

791
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,750
23. 24.

792
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,780
<i>I really worked hard and did my best.</i>

793
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,230
More!

794
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,190
60. 61.

795
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,790
More, more, more, more!

796
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,610
<i>But...</i>

797
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,960
<i>Take your unnecessarily broad chest</i>

798
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,410
<i>and live alone for the rest of your life.</i>

799
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,360
<i>The moment I thought I was the strongest,</i>

800
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:20,130
<i>I was abandoned again.</i>

801
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,510
<i>- Director!
- Leave now!</i>

802
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,310
<i>Director!</i>

803
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,230
<i>Director!</i>

804
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:33,160
<i>That's why...</i>

805
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,460
<i>I decided to become stronger.</i>

806
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,340
<i>To prove that...</i>

807
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,480
<i>I can endure on my own,
even if everyone abandons me.</i>

808
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,370
It must've been very hard.

809
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,920
No.

810
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,150
I got stronger with progressive overload.

811
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:59,050
- Pardon?
- Progressive overload.

812
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:01,050
It's a method for muscle growth.

813
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,710
A damaged muscle cell

814
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:05,090
produces even more muscle cells

815
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:07,980
than before to prepare for bigger damage.

816
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,510
So, to put it simply,

817
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,160
if you get injured and recover,

818
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,750
you can have bigger muscles.

819
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,350
Director,

820
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,110
did you really get stronger?

821
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,160
Of course, I did.

822
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,030
I mean,

823
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:24,850
did you really overcome everything?

824
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:27,020
To me, it seems...

825
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:31,340
your muscles got big,
but you're still hurting inside.

826
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,990
You haven't given up on the people

827
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:38,770
who gave up on you, right?

828
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,050
Director,

829
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,430
prove it to me first.

830
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:52,060
That you can overcome if you don't give up.

831
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,570
Then, I'll start having faith, too.

832
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,010
That I can overcome, too.

833
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,240
The person who abandoned you...

834
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,390
Face them.

835
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,680
Face them and ask why they abandoned you.

836
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,760
Whether you get an apology, make up,

837
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,090
or get back together, do something.

838
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,780
Ms. Lee...

839
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,430
You can't keep holding the poop in.

840
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,250
You need to poop to end it.

841
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,020
Ms. Lee.

842
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,970
Gosh, is the herb really medicinal?

843
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,030
I think it made it worse...

844
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,120
- Yes, yes.
- Toilet paper!

845
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,950
I'll be back.

846
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,360
[Alex]

847
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,670
What's this?

848
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,610
I'll quit my job as a trainer.

849
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,900
What?

850
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,810
I don't think I'm qualified to be a trainer.

851
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:52,980
I can't even control clients like you

852
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,250
and I got one injured.

853
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,780
Just because you failed training one person,
you're quitting your job?

854
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,190
- Rosa-
- If this job meant so little to you,

855
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,970
I don't have much to say.

856
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:10,540
But I'm disappointed.

857
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,470
I'm sorry.

858
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,420
It's like expecting a six-pack
after a few sit-ups.

859
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,630
I don't see the difference.

860
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,640
Even the Director is chasing around a client

861
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,660
who wants to quit because of the fitness rut.

862
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,170
But you give up so easily.

863
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,300
Pose No. 1.

864
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,740
Pose No. 3.

865
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,220
Free pose.

866
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,480
Why are you here with a body like that?

867
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,030
Director...

868
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,680
I won the Grand Prize.

869
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,170
I'm...

870
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,520
no longer weak.

871
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:54,210
My body was acknowledged as the strongest
and most beautiful in the world.

872
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,900
Do you have anything to say to me?

873
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:03,650
I knew you could do it...

874
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:07,230
as long as I let you go.

875
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:09,740
Two. Three.

876
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,450
Four. Five.

877
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,600
Hey, are you that athlete's trainer?

878
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,780
He's got grit.

879
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,080
Unbelievable, really.

880
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,900
We can make him the best in the world.

881
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:29,540
Think carefully.

882
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,710
Opportunities like this don't come often.

883
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,280
You send him to us,

884
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,620
and we can realize his true potential.

885
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,440
You...

886
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,550
You don't have the ability to handle him.

887
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,560
<i>I already knew...</i>

888
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,790
<i>that you'd surpass me.</i>

889
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,350
<i>Director!</i>

890
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,080
<i>Director!</i>

891
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,940
<i>Director!</i>

892
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,980
This isn't the place for you anymore!

893
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,330
<i>Give me just one more chance, Director.</i>

894
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,430
<i>Just one more.</i>

895
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,690
Leave right now!

896
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,470
<i>Director!</i>

897
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,660
The Mr. David champion. To our winner...

898
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,010
Do Hyeon Joong!

899
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,790
<i>He swiftly took the trophy and fled.</i>

900
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,390
<i>Since he was the rightful winner,</i>

901
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:37,480
<i>the organizers decided not to take
any further action.</i>

902
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,890
Director.

903
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,120
Director!

904
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,210
Wake up, Director!

905
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:03,290
<i>I don't regret it, even if you think
you were abandoned.</i>

906
