<i>♫ My love ♫</i>

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,250
So beautiful. Seriously.

13
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,560
What good karma did I build in my previous life

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,400
that I met a man like you?

15
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,720
I'm not sure.

16
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,160
You must've saved your country, at least.

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,500
I saved the universe.

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,530
Guys, let's eat fried chicken!

19
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,090
Perfect timing. Seriously.

20
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,890
You always choose the perfect moment-

21
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,230
- Are you happy?
- Yes, I am.

22
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,190
Eat slowly. You'd get indigestion.

23
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,310
Here, here, here.

24
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,370
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

25
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,870
Yes, Brother-in-law. Hey, take bigger bites.

26
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,810
Why are you psyching yourself up?

27
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,920
What? What do you mean?

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,750
The distance and angle of your eyebrows.

29
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,570
The lost-looking eyes.

30
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,650
You make that face when
you're psyching yourself up.

31
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,390
And here's conclusive evidence.

32
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,630
The fried chicken is in front of you,

33
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,650
but the corners of your mouth are drooping.

34
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,090
Even the words 'fried chicken'
should make you smile.

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,620
But what's with that mouth?

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,150
Are you still denying it?

37
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,460
Babe, you were like a pro pilot just now.

38
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,640
Profiler, not a pro pilot.

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,300
And I'm treating you because
I wanted to celebrate today.

40
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,990
- Don't pick a fight.
- Celebrate?

41
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,140
I succeeded today for once in my life.

42
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,820
- I saved my face.
- What?

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,580
You know how many times
I've been humiliated, right?

44
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,810
I know. Geez.

45
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,200
I would've left the country already if I were you.

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,100
I avoided that today. So dramatically.

47
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,130
What are you saying?

48
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,260
I almost confessed my love today.

49
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,450
Confess... Who?

50
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,240
You mean, the blind date?

51
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,750
- Wrong!
- The gym director?

52
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,580
Bingo!

53
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,890
The gym...

54
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,100
How did you know?

55
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,360
I saw it when you were working out at the gym.

56
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,450
<i>Your smitten face resembled mine.</i>

57
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,740
It was like how I look at Ji Ran.

58
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,540
Babe.

59
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,410
Yes.

60
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,240
I thought I was mistaken at first, but

61
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,200
it turns out I do like him.

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,300
Once I admitted that I liked him,
I thought I was screwed.

63
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,810
But do you know what I saw in that moment?

64
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,400
Kang Sol and the Director leaving a hotel.

65
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,780
Isn't that such a relief?

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,390
The man you like

67
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,020
left a hotel with another woman. That's a relief?

68
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,480
It's a total relief.

69
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,410
What if I saw that after I confessed my love?

70
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,550
That would've been humiliating.

71
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,750
If I'm humiliated, I can't go to the gym.

72
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,580
But I won't work out anywhere else anymore.

73
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,330
Why? Because I'm addicted
to the fitness fanatic's method.

74
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,400
I would've gotten so weak

75
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,800
and suffered from a bent neck and
slouchy back. I basically struck gold.

76
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,170
A man and a woman leaving a hotel

77
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,190
doesn't necessarily mean they're dating.

78
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,110
- Right, right.
- It doesn't matter.

79
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,920
W-Why does it not matter?

80
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,400
I gave it a lot of thought on the way back.

81
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,830
Let's say I confessed my love, and we're dating.

82
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,010
What comes next is a bigger issue.

83
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:17,710
Would dating that fitness fanatic make me happy?

84
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,330
W-W-What's wrong?

85
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,720
<i>♫ Every time I think of you
all day and night ♫</i>

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,210
What the balance?

87
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,240
Balance?

88
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
Your neck is completely out of balance.

89
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,890
Gosh, what are you doing? What's this now?

90
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,670
- What-
- Stretch.

91
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,560
Look up. Look up.

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,780
<i>He'd worry about losing muscles
and balance the whole time.</i>

93
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,510
Let's say I put up with it and
got married with the power of love.

94
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,130
<i>If then, I'm sure he'd...</i>

96
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,140
I love you!

102
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,800
I love you!

103
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,870

I love you!

105
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,500
How impressive.

106
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,310
The wedding would be a mess
because he'd worry about his muscles.

107
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,060
Let's say we got married and stayed together.

108
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,820
The baby is coming out soon! One!

109
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,330
One!

110
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,740
Two!

111
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,030
Two!

112
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,010
Three!

113
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,710
Three!

114
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,060
Four!

115
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,120
Gosh, shut up!

116
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,480
What kind of life would that be?

117
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,210
Doesn't it sound so awful?

118
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,370
But I don't have to go
through it if I didn't start.

119
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,740
That's so Honolulu.

120
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,920
So Honolulu? What does that mean?

121
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,060
It means I'm so lucky.

122
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,060
She even considered marrying him.

123
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,140
Gosh, just cry instead.

124
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,190
You aren't even dating him.

125
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,580
Why imagine having a baby with him?

126
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,050
Imagine being together forever

127
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,770
and being by his deathbed, too?

128
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,110
I'm sure he won't shed a tear
even in his deathbed.

129
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,740
Why? Because he'd lose his muscles.

130
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,910
You already imagined that scenario.

131
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,140
Unni, please wake up. Unni.

132
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,640
Be quiet. Geez.

133
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't worry. I'm fine.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,630
It's not my first time being
mistaken or getting dumped.

135
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,970
But this time, even before it started,

136
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,320
I can just give up on my own.

137
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,730
Isn't that such a relief?

138
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,210
Anyway, your sister is no longer a fool

139
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,270
who cries because I couldn't be with a man.

140
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,920
Got it?

141
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,060
I'm going inside.

142
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,310
She must be suffering a lot.

143
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,370
She keeps humming, too.

144
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,330
Is she crying under the cover or something?

145
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,790
Seriously. What do I do?

146
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,040
What do we do?

<i>human bodies always supercompensate.</i>

Supercompensate!

151
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,690
When muscles recover from an injury,

152
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,110
they become stronger.

153
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,650
Your body is getting stronger at this moment.

- Ms. Lee.
- Hello.

159
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,710
Looks like you're feeling great today.

160
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,300
Yes, I think I got more fit after working out.

161
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,660
Cheer up today, too.

162
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,870
Gosh, I feel great.

163
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:48,220
<i>But no feelings get supercompensated.</i>

164
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,300
Nice.

165
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,870
Gosh. Our gym has such a handsome couple.

166
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,100
It's lifting up my mood.

167
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,480
Did they really not know each other before?

168
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,510
They make too nice of a couple

169
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,170
for people who didn't know each other.

170
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:14,280
I know. They're like sweet potatoes and dongchimi.

171
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,960
Radish kimchi goes better with sweet potatoes.

172
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,980
Let's eat sweet potatoes. Let's.

173
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,050
Did you sleep well that night?

174
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,420
You know I couldn't sleep even a wink.

175
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,440
You didn't let me sleep.

176
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,860
Seriously. You're so naughty.

177
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,470
Brace yourself.

178
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,340
I won't leave an inch
of your body alone tonight, too.

I'm a member here, baby.

184
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,420
Betraying baby.

185
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,030
I didn't betray. I always came here.

186
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Where are those two going?

187
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,980
Where are they going, baby?

188
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,550
They must be doing a different workout.

189
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,930
By the way, I thought you were dating Sol.

190
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,720
I am. Don't we make a nice couple?

191
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,380
- Y-Yes.
- Of course, we do.

192
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,620
I'm the one who's a good match for her.

193
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,130
- Bong Won.
- Yes?

194
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,320
Let's talk.

195
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,330
Bong Won?

196
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,080
Yes, yes.

197
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,820
It's a nickname.

198
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,780
It's a secret nickname just between us.

199
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,840
Okay, baby? See you.

200
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,140
So, are they dating or not?

201
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,610
Why are you here?

202
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,860
You're the director of the gym across the street.

203
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,570
You're here instead of your gym.

204
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,570
It's too weird, Bong Won.

205
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,300
It's because you're here.

206
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,300
D-Did you forget everything?

207
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,000
Do Hyeon Joong only cares about himself.

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,760
His body is the only thing that matters to him.

209
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,260
Think about who cares about you, please.

210
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,890
Bong Won, let's be honest.

211
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,800
You say you like me,

212
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,780
but you're here to defeat Hyeon Joong.

213
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,390
- Hey, you-
- And he's all you think about.

214
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,530
That means you like him.

215
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,350
Mr. Lee, did you come to work out?

216
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,650
The Zumba class starts soon.

217
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,960
Make sure to come.

218
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,710
Okay, okay.

219
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,820
Roy!

220
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,180
Roy! Roy!

221
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,930
Shit!

222
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,050
<i>You know I couldn't sleep even a wink.</i>

223
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,130
<i>You didn't let me sleep.</i>

224
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,270
- That's a big sigh.
- Geez Louise.

225
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,430
What are you thinking so intently about?

226
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,000
Are you busy after this?

227
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,300
Want to have dinner with me?
I know a good place nearby.

228
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,840
Dinner?

229
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,820
I'm sorry. I already had dinner.

230
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,880
<i>What? You didn't eat, Lee Mi Ran.</i>

231
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,820
<i>What are you so scared of?</i>

232
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,440
Really? It's only four.

233
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,720
You eat early.

234
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,070
How about coffee, then?

235
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,250
I don't respond too well to caffeine.

236
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,940
I don't drink coffee in the afternoon.

237
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,700
<i>That's enough, Lee Mi Ran.</i>

238
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,970
How about tea, then?

239
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,190
Don't teas have caffeine, too?

240
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,530
- How about ice cream?
- I'm on a diet.

241
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,220
<i>What are so scared of, exactly?</i>

242
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,490
<i>Are you running away because you might hear</i>

243
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,880
<i>she's dating Director Do?</i>

244
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,700
How about tomorrow, then?

245
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,340
Tomorrow...

246
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,720
<i>Would avoiding change anything?</i>

247
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,460
Okay, fine. Let's just drink coffee now.

248
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,300
Ice cream is fine, too. Yes.

249
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,910
Mi Ran,

250
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,260
did Jeong Han do something by chance?

251
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,020
Is that why you're avoiding me, too?

252
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,000
N-No, it's not like that.

253
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,560
He asked me to buy him a drink.

254
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,450
He thinks he got dumped while cutting a steak.

255
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,390
Mi Ran, by chance, do you like someone else?

256
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,080
Yes.

257
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,600
No.

258
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,170
What was that?

259
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,400
How about you? Do you like someone?

260
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,210
Yes. I do.

261
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,220
<i>I do.</i>

262
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,110
Sol, I have a question.

263
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,260
What is it?

264
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,430
You said you don't like men who work out.

265
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,600
Seriously. I hate them.

266
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,720
But I saw you and Director Do...

267
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,040
at a hotel.

268
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,220
- That?
- So, the Director and you...

269
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,180
<i>Why are you hesitating, Lee Mi Ran?</i>

270
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,100
<i>You came here to ask her that.</i>

271
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:40,120
I'm curious. I didn't know that you
and the Director were so close.

272
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,160
To be honest, I filmed something at the hotel

273
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,170
with the Director.

274
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,280
Y-You...

275
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,960
filmed something at the hotel?

276
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,530
Do you want to see it?

277
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,180
No, no, no. Why would I see that? No.

278
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,860
Why not? I could use your feedback.

279
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,010
No, I don't want to. I can't watch it.

280
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,000
Gosh, no!

281
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,210
<i>I don't think I can.</i>

282
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,500
<i>A little more. A little more.</i>

283
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,650
<i>- It hurts so much.</i>
- Wow.

284
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,300
<i>Can we take a break?</i>

285
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,260
I didn't know they had a relationship like this.

286
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,030
Wow, this is so intense.

287
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,100
Look at the view count.

288
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,180
It's about to become viral.

289
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,570
You made it, Oppa.

290
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,090
Come in.

291
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,680
You're wearing what I told you to wear, right?

292
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,870
Take off your jacket.

293
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,660
I can't give you...

294
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,400
- Huh?
- my body.

295
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,140
I don't take my body where my heart isn't.

296
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,830
There's no time. You'd better take it off now.

297
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,690
How far do you want to fall, really?

298
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,700
What?

299
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,050
Is this really what you want?

300
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,360
Will this make you feel satisfied?

301
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,000
Here.

302
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,330
Look. Are you happy now?

303
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,130
But all you can get is this much.

304
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,480
I can't let you have any more.

305
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,370
The camera and lights are ready.

306
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,250
You're the guest, right?

307
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,600
Excuse me?

308
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,050
What were you thinking?

309
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,520
We're creating fitness content today.

310
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,660
Let's get started.

311
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,180
What the...

312
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,800
- See you.
- Thank you.

313
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,650
Take care.

314
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,080
You should've told me we were shooting.

315
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,700
I wanted to tell you at first,

316
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,620
but seeing your confused face

317
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,000
made me want to tease you a bit.

318
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,910
To be honest, I was a little curious

319
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,030
if you'd come here or not.

320
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,890
- Well, I came here because-
- I know.

321
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,000
You have no feelings for me.

322
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,670
I don't misunderstand anymore, thanks to you.

323
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,690
Okay.

324
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,720
I really came to work out with you.

325
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,890
I'm a bit sick.

326
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,400
What?

327
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,760
When I said I was sick,
the other trainers all said no.

328
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,610
But you're different.

329
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,630
You were the worst boyfriend,

330
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,870
but you're the best trainer.

331
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,590
I'm the best, but-

332
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,960
You haven't changed. Really.

333
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,940
Oppa...

334
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,610
I have always done my best.

335
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,680
Whether it's work or love.

336
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,310
Because I did my best to love you
when I was with you,

337
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,590
I had no lingering feelings or regrets.

338
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,660
It will be the same this time, too.

339
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,710
The illness isn't a big deal.

340
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,700
I'll do my best to overcome it.

341
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,440
I can do it.

342
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,750
But to do that,

343
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,850
I need you.

344
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,630
Help me.

345
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,000
I won't go easy on you just because you're sick.

346
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,220
Protein one. Protein two. Protein three.

347
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,550
Okay, protein is ready to go.

348
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,300
Unni, I thought you were going to the gym.

349
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,190
I am. Why?

350
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,750
But you're wearing mascara.

351
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,420
Yes, I thought I shouldn't let it go dry.

352
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,060
Are you wearing eye shadow, too?

353
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,820
I just put it on because I had it.

354
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,230
- You-
- What? What?

355
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,690
It'd be a waste if I didn't use it.

356
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,360
That's why I put it on. So what? What?

357
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,010
Didn't you say you gave up on the Director?

358
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,270
You said you found out he had a woman beforehand.

359
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,010
You said you were so Honolulu.

360
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,980
You even imagined his death
and tried to be positive.

361
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,850
Did that person die yesterday?

362
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,930
No, it turns out I was mistaken.

368
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,660
The back, glutes, the back of the thighs,

369
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,580
and paraspinal muscles benefit from this.

370
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,880

than winning your heart.

That fitness fanatic?

374
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,930

from crying when he dies.

- What?

377

Use a different lipstick.

378
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,490
That doesn't suit you because you're warm tone.

- Done. Go.

Go and destroy his pectoral muscles.

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,020
Can I defeat the pectoral muscles?

384
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,890
Of course.

385
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,500
Wait for me, the pectoral muscles.

386
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,040
Go.

Wow, do I worry about a freeloader now?

We can't use the equipment, either.

It could've been dangerous for Sol, too.

00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,620
She was near the mirror.

465
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,750

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,050
Jjamppong sounds good.

474
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,680
Should we invite the Director and influenza, too?

480
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,350

You should start working out, too.

510

It made me more fit

511
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,660
and I have more energy. It's wonderful.

512
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,610

00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,730
No!

905
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:30,930
Pardon?

906
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:33,260
Those pills. You can't take them.

907
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,780
Why not?

908
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,580
Because...

909
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,000
They're mine.

910
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,700
They're yours, but can't you
share your digestive pills?

911
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,370
No, I can't. Never.

912
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,240
- Give them to me.
- Well, can't you share them?

913
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,590
I can't do that.

914
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,500
Give them to me right now.

915
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,730
You should share these with me.

916
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,270
No!

What's going on?

918
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,010
Mi Ran, that's a narcotic pain med.

919
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,830
Narcotic pain med?

920
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,140

Yes.

928
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,940
<i>Mi Ran doesn't have to go to the hospital.</i>

929
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,450
What do you mean by that?

930
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,430
<i>The pills she took weren't mine.</i>

931
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,340
- What?
<i>- They were actually digestive pills.</i>

932
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,170
<i>The bottles were the same.</i>

933
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,930
Okay.

934
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,990
Ms. Lee, come down.

935
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,930
I know you're awake.

936
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:28,700
Why did you pass out after taking digestive pills?

937
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,870
Well, I guess...

938
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:35,850
because Sol told me it was a narcotic pain med,

939
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:39,980
I suddenly felt dizzy. I can't remember well.

940
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:46,540
Why does Sol take a narcotic pain med, by the way?

941
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,200
As for that,

942
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,920
I'll explain it to you later.

943
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,180
Director Do, your feet...

944
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,370
It's okay.

945
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:01,550
What do you mean it's okay?

946
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,380
My gosh!

947
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,640
Hop on my back.

948
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,110
- Pardon?
- Hop on.

949
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,460
You can't walk down the hill barefoot like that.

950
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,720
Hop on right now.

951
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,670
This is why I work out all this time.

952
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,400
You know how much I weigh. I'm super strong.

953
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,100
- I know you weigh 60 kg, but-
- I weigh 1 kg less. Hop on.

954
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,250
I'm ready.

955
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,950
I can do it.

956
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,720
Are you okay?

957
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,530
I'm okay.

958
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,600
Unni!

959
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:44,760
Aigoo!

960
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:51,470
I thought something serious happened.

961
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:55,130
Why did the digestive pills make you faint?

962
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:58,260
Is it because you ate too much?

963
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,470
No, she didn't eat that much.

964
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:05,760
I'm sorry for making you worry.

965
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,770
But I'm really okay now.

966
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:10,350
Gosh, what a relief.

967
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,860
I've never seen anyone pass out
after taking digestive pills.

968
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,460
You should rest. Sorry for making you worry.

969
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,940
Why did you take so many pills?

970
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,260
- Should I get her some water?
- Sure.

971
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:27,860
Sol, can we talk for a moment?

972
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,020
Sure.

00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,410
can I ask you...

975
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:41,060
why you take narcotic pain meds?

976
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,420
I'm a little sick.

977
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,190
Pardon?

978
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,090
I surprised you, didn't I?

979

Yes, I'm okay.

986
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:12,430

But...

992
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,600
you present yourself as you are.

993
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,340
I was a bit jealous of that.

994
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,480
You're jealous of me?

995
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,730
You asked me if I liked someone.

Yes.

997

Pardon?

999
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:48,950
Whenever I saw you, I thought,

1000
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:54,540
"I want to be honest like her just once."

1001
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,760
