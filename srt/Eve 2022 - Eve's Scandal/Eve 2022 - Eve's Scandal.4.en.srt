Kang Yoon Kyeom is the second son, but he has excluded the eldest son to become CEO.

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,530
However, analysts say that the succession structure can be changed at any time, depending on whether honorary Chairman Kang Bon Keun bequeaths the stake.

CEO Han So Ra chose grand, remarkable, and fancy as the concept for this year's event.

24
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,760
The main focuses are the vocational special lectures and CMN documentaries,

25
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,950
hosting the world's K-education study recital twice,

26
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,990
and attracting global speech contests to Korea.

27
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,210
The vocational special lecture lineup is as follows.

28
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,570
Only the top class of each profession.

29
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,600
CEO Han So Ra's idea is to recommend it not only in Korea but all over the world.

30
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,640
Many celebrities have already been confirmed.

31
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,200
We will manage recruited celebrities as external alumni.

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,130

is there a reason why you leave the National Assembly member empty in your special job class?

36

There's former Prime Minister Han Pan Ro.

37
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,240
If it’s obvious, it’s not any fun. I want someone that’s difficult to invite.

Like the next presidential candidate of the current party, Seo Eun Pyeong.

39
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,740
My dad and husband both want to contact him but…

40
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,840
I heard he's the type to completely block out wealthy people,

41
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,230
so it hasn't been easy.

42

If I succeed, my father might give me a gift.

Hasn't he already given you everything already? Is there something more you want?

Trust. I’ve begged for a department store for years but he won’t give in.

Yoon Kyeom, are you sure you're helping out your brother?

71

Due to the death of a construction worker, media regarding the mall is still sensitive.

72

When it comes to shopping malls, image matters most.

Speak with Yoon Kyeom about this matter.

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,060
And you must do your best to help your brother.

- Yes.

How is it still that you aren't able to honor your late grandfather?

What about you?

84
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,790
International age makes things confusing. Keep things in Korean age.

It’s so funny.

91

He never listens to me.

92
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,530
Which explains so much. Seriously.

93
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,870
Oh my gosh! What to do?

94
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,840
- So Ra!
- I'm so sorry.

95
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,010
I have no strength in my fingers because I don't typically do housework.

96
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,690
You did it on purpose!

97
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,560
How could you say that?

98
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,600
Why would I do that on purpose?

99
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,350
Then, how did a bowl fall off all by itself?

100
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,760
You’re being unreasonable. How can you accuse me of doing something terrible?

101
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,990
Do you dislike me?

102
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,840
Honey!

103
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,030
Come out!

104
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,480
You should just keep to yourself, so why are causing trouble?

105
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,490
Do you even know how stressful a memorial service gets?

106
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,620
I need to take medicine for depression and stomachaches.

107
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,030
Why do you look like you're not stressed?

108
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,190
You're the one that needs a son. Why am I the only one stressed out about it?

109
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,670
- We did everything we could!
- Do more!

110
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,800
What else could I do? Think about your age!

111
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,870
Is this all because of me?

112
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,700
If your brother has a son first, you'll blame me for having the company taken away from you, won't you?

113
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,900
Why don't you say anything when he keeps bringing up you not having a son?

114
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,090
Why are they asking you for a son now, when they handed the company to you because you were smarter?

115
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,470
This isn't the first time!

116
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,570
That's enough. Forget about it.

117
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,240
I feel so victimized and angered by this. How are you so calm?

118
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,030
What if your brother's shares do increase?

119
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,950
At times, I'm really curious about what goes on in your head.

120
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,970
Since when were you so interested in the company's shares?

121
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,720
Five years ago? Before we got married?

122
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,950
Or was it after we got married?

123
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,470
- Honey.
- Get ready to go home.

124
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,420
<i>Seon Bin, I'm about to explode! They're driving me crazy.</i>

125
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,950
What's wrong?

126
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,950
I'm going to throw up because of the ancestral rites!

127
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,200
My in-laws drive me crazy.

128
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,760
<i> Why do I have to cook for ghosts that are already dead? Also, on top of that, it's the middle of the night! </i>

129
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,400
This unstylish hanbok, and having to wash dishes.

130
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,240
And they won't stop asking about a son.

131
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,660
Even in this era, their son is the only precious one!

132
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,530
Just doing the ancestral rites is hard enough. I'm sorry to hear that.

133
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,840
You must be disappointed.

134
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,050
Do you know what makes me even madder?

135
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,220
Whenever we come to his parents, my husband is never on my side.

136
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,260
That drives me crazy the most!

137
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,660
Chairman Kang is only acting like that in front of the elders. He's most definitely on your side.

138
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,280
Let's go shopping tomorrow.

139
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,890
<i>That sounds great, Sis.</i>

140
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,060
Let's take our kids and treat ourselves.

141
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,680
<i>What did you say?</i>

142
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,250
The group's successor might change?

143
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,830
My father-in-law started threatening us about it recently.

144
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:44,160
He says he'll transfer shares if I don't give birth to a son.

145
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,580
If he sides with my brother-in-law, then our family will be pushed to second.

146
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,630
The tension between our families was high, to begin with.

147
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,830
It's been nerve-wracking lately because he continues to threaten me like that.

148
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,960
You can have a son first.

149
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,560
You don't think I tried?

150
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,670
He's not the type to stand back and just take things like this.

151
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,580
It's so stressful whenever I have to do the ancestral rites.

152
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,570
You have to reach for the stars to have a chance at anything. I can't have a son alone.

153
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,970
He hasn't even laid hands on me in a while.

154
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,080
I am hopeful though, because our relationship has been better lately.

155
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,450
I made an appointment at the OB/GYN.

156
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,080
That surgery is really painful, isn't it?

157
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,410
I need to put in the effort. It's not just about the shares.

158
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,590
If I'm to hold onto him, I need to have a son.

159
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,130
So Ra,

160
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,980
there's something that's even more effective than getting surgery.

161
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,690
What is it?

162
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,030
I'll tell you when it's just the two of us.

163
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,900
Should we go to my place?

164
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,240
I heard there are some new items from that Italian brand.

165
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,060
<i>Yes, I'll have it ready.</i>

166
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,160
I'll come by next week.

167
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,090
<i>Thank you.</i>

168
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,180
<i>I'm finally going over to Chairman Kang's house.</i>

169
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,740
<i>I'm on my way now.</i>

170
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,900
Set up some appetizers and then you can go home.

171
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,030
Yes, Ma'am.

172
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,540
Does your core really get stronger from dancing tango?

173
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,700
It builds the inner muscles and makes your body very fit.

174
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,940
Also, Tango is a dance with the most physical contact between men and women, so it gives vitality.

175
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,210
There's even someone who got diagnosed with infertility but got pregnant.

176
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,390
You know that an exaggerated advertisement could get you punished.

177
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,410
An exaggeration is just an exaggeration. It doesn't mean that it's entirely false.

178
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,060
Continue.

179
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,960
And the dresses are so beautiful.

180
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,260
If you wear a tango dress,

181
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,240
Chairman Kang will see you in a new light.

182
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,950
But I am someone of social status. What will others think when they hear I'm out dancing?

183
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,800
What do you think about the mothers performing during the special lecture on professional dancing?

184
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,690
Doesn't that sound great?

185
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,380
Look at her.

186
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,180
If you set your mind to it, you'd even be able to sell me.

187
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,340
When we are shooting for the commercial, let's perform just you and me.

188
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,070
And when we do group performance, I won't participate and you take the main.

189
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,150
Eun Dam Ri and Yeo Ji Hee are sidekicks, and I'll make you the queen.

190
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:49,280
You can have it all, your husband's love and a son.

191
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,000
Is there anything you want? Your husband's promotion?

192
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,280
What do you want? I'll give you anything you want.

193
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,990
Thank you.

194
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,140
Where did everyone go?

195
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,950
Honey!

196
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,270
We were having a meeting for the PTA.

197
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,110
I didn't realize the time. I'll get going.

198
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,940
Your husband said he'll pick you up. You can stay a little while longer.

199
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,770
Wouldn't I be in the way of Chairman Kang getting his rest?

200
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,940
What should we do?

201
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,690
It's fine with me.

202
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,470
I must be drunk. My face is on fire.

203
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,590
I'm going to fix my makeup. Can you set up the wine?

204
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,810
I'll be right back.

205
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,040
I'll get the wine glasses ready.

This is crazy. We're at my house.

221
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,940
How can you act in such a bold manner?

222
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,300
What are you after?

223
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,710
I have no ulterior motives.

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,510
I just...

225
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,160
You make me forget...

226
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,400
about where I am and who I am.

227
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,900
You're saying it's only a desire.

228
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,010
Anyone who's ever lingered around me had an ulterior motive.

229
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,780
You're no exception.

230
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,130
I'll figure it out on my own.

231
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,780
Yes, Chairman. It's Jang Jin Wook.

232
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,330
<i> Welcome, Director Jang. </i>

233
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,450
It was to the point where my nickname in college was the May Queen.

234
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:51,610
Since my husband doesn't praise me at all, I'm bragging about myself.

235
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,290
You are definitely a queen from your birth.

236
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:00,070
You are very elegant. I can't even pretend to be like you.

237
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:08,900
Chairman, your wife is every woman's wannabe. Why don't you brag about her for us?

238
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:16,210
Why don't you talk about your wife first? How did you two meet?

239
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,870
On the bus on the way back home from one of my business trips,

240
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:28,920
a beautiful college student was sitting next to me.

241
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,170
It was love at first sight for me.

242
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,340
It's like a movie.

243
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,820
From the first time we met, I was head over heels about her.

244
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,910
Even so, how can you already be the mother of a kindergartener?

245
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,640
You got married so young.

246
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,550
Did you get her pregnant before marriage?

247
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:53,020
Not at all. My wife's nickname is Confucian Girl.

248
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:58,320
I didn't do anything with her until we got married. We had our kid right after our wedding.

249
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:07,330
I had a biased idea because of your dance, but I also agree that Bo Ram's mom is naive.

250
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,970
Since you know Tango well, it makes me curious.

251
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:18,310
Do you know the legend of Piazzolla's bandoneon?

252
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,010
No. What is it?

253
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,760
If you play with Piazzolla's bandoneon,

254
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,670
you can save the dead souls who died unfairly.

255
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,750
You know such weird things!

256
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,710
That's a beautiful story.

257
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:13,590
Do you have a soul you want to console with Piazzolla's bandoneon?

258
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,250
No.

259
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,910
I'm pretty far away from having tragic stories.

260
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,990
What about you, Chairman?

261
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,490
Do you have someone you want to console?

262
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,840
No.

263
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,730
She just dances, but she doesn't care about any other things around her.

264
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,100
Do you still dance?

265
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,750
I go to the Tango club sometimes.

266
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,920
And do some stage performances to make Bo Ram's education money.

267
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,770
Are you not wary about your wife dancing?

268
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,490
Family is most important to my wife.

269
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,850
And I know that the best.

270
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,960
I'm sorry to stay until this late hour, Chairman.

271
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,520
I'll bring the car, so wait for a bit.

272
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,450
It felt like you were investigating me.

273
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,370
Do you know about La Boca as well?

274
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:47,230
It's the place where Tango started, the port of Buenos Aires.

275
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,020
I don't know about that.

276
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:57,610
Right. It's a working-class area, so you wouldn't know.

277
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,280
The place where I perform is also named La Boca.

278
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,130
Would you like to come this Saturday?

279
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,630
I'll invite you to the performance.

280
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:28,250
If you come, it can be just the two of us.

281
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,250
- I'll see you again next time, Chairman.
- Okay.

282
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,020
<i> [Kim Seon Bin Studio] </i>

283

Raise the center of your body as if you raise your chest from the pit of your stomach.

284
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,630
Place your center of gravity on your front foot.

285
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,950
Align your chest to your shoulder and open wider.

286
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,340
Oh, my, Sis. Did you do ballet before?

287
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,680
You look beautiful!

Hello, Da Bi's mom!

<i> You are going to do a Tango performance? </i>

290
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,950
<i> How well can you dance when you just learned? </i>

291
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,190
<i> Ms. Han So Ra agreed to do it. </i>

292
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,410
<i> Why would she? </i>

293
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,190
<i> It's the age when you want to dance. </i>

294
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:50,010
<i> You wanted to put Ms. Han So Ra in trouble. </i>

<i> The lady of LY Group who's fallen for dancing.</i>

296

<i> Isn't that great for the news headline? </i>

297
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,320
We'll practice for a month and do a demo performance.

298
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,590
These are the outfits I'm thinking of. Why don't you pick one?

299
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:11,450
Isn't it too tight to perform after practicing for a month?

300
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:16,580
Exactly. You are in your twenties, but we are in our thirties.

301
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:21,080
There's someone older than me. Don't say such a thing.

302
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,500
I'm sorry, Da Bi's mom.

303
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,360
If you meet a good male partner, you can look like a professional.

304
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,560
They are the partners to perform in the show together.

Thank you so much. I'll schedule a meeting for tomorrow.

310
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,650
Okay.

311
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,900
Seo Eun Pyeong is coming to Liyan?

312
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,230
He'll be a one-day teacher for the vocational lecture.

313
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,740
Does he know you're the head of the Parents' Association and agreed to come?

314
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,270
Assemblyman Seo is a very meticulous person. Of course!

315
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,230
It's amazing, isn't it?

316
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,730
But how did you make this happen?

317
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:40,530
As my dad has you, I have my person, too.

318
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,850
Who is it?

319
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,090
I'll introduce you to her next time.

320
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,110
Can you still not trust me after this?

321
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,270
Of course not!

322
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,450
My daughter is the best!

323

<i> [Liyan Kindergarten] </i>

324
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,580
This is Assemblyman Seo Eun Pyeong.

325
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,000
Hello, I'm Seo Eun Pyeong.

326
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,310
Welcome. I'm Cha Alisa, the Director of Liyan.

327
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,490
It's nice to meet you.

328
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:44,750
I'm the head of the Parents' Association, Han So Ra.

329
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:49,260
Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom is my alumni senior, but I apologize that I haven't kept my connection until now.

330
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,640
I'm glad I could meet you this way, at least.

331
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,050
I believed that we'd meet in a special connection someday.

332
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,660
Thank you for coming today.

333
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,760
I heard great things about Liyan Kindergarten. It's much more impressive than I thought.

334
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,230
With the childhood I had, this is hard to imagine.

335
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,500
Your childhood?

336
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,750
Yes.

337
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,850
I used to be an orphan.

338
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,970
You're pretty well known.

339
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,490
But it's my first time hearing that.

340
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:33,690
I hid it because I didn't think it needed to be known.

341
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,320
I never imagined it because you used to be a lawyer before becoming a politician.

342
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,660
I was able to take the bar exam thanks to my supporter.

343
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:48,870
I was taken care of even when I didn't need a guardian.

344
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:56,080
Oh, that person by the name of Lee Ra El that I've been looking for.

345
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,610
She is his daughter.

346
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,650
He was like a father to me.

347
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:21,380
He may have passed away, but I wanted to at least pay back what I received to his daughter.

348
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,680
You're basically done touring the kindergarten.

349
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,040
Should we head back in?

350
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,790
I have something to tell you regarding Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom.

351
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,300
This is information about him.

352
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,490
Why are you giving this to me?

353
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,330
I have no relation to Chairman Kang.

354
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:51,040
Why don't you take a look first, and then I'll explain later.

355
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,280
Assemblyman Seo Eun Pyeong!

356
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,270
Take it.

357
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,610
Thank you for coming all the way here.

358
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,090
Where have I seen her before?

359
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,310
It's been a while, General Manager.

360
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:31,550
Gosh, General Manager? I'm touched that you remember our past relations, Sir.

361
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,680
How could I forget?

362
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:41,120
I have been watching you very closely, too.

363
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,740
This must be fate, for sure.

364
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,240
I'm also the chairman of the Liyan Foundation.

365
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,450
Let's go then.

366
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,640
Sure.

367
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,440
<i>Assemblyman Seo Eun Pyeong gave it to you?</i>

<i>[Lee Jae Eun]</i>

372
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,300
<i>[Previously worked as a housekeeper at honorary Chairman Kang Bon Keun's home.]</i>

373
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,530
Kang Yoon Kyeom's biological mother is Lee Jae Eun, who was the housekeeper.

374
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:25,290
Kang Bon Keun hid this truth and raised Kang Yoon Kyeom as his wife's son.

375
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,240
Kang Yoon Kyeom was born out of wedlock?

376
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,930
There has never been a case in our country where a major company was succeeded by an illegitimate child.

377
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,220
It's a principle to have your legitimate child succeed.

378
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:58,000
If Kang Yoon Kyeom was really born out of wedlock, it could cause a problem with our plan.

379
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,660
<i>The group's outline of the successor might change?</i>

380
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,290
<i>Father-in-law has been threatening us for a while now.</i>

381
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,530
<i>He said if we can't birth a son, he'll have his brother succeed.</i>

382
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,510
<i>If he goes to my brother-in-law, then we'll be pushed to second.</i>

383
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,840
<i>I've been very nervous from the constant threats he's recently been giving.</i>

384
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,560
Our plan is to disintegrate LY from within by using Kang Yoon Kyeom.

385
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,850
But if the real owner is someone else...

386
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,550
I'm going to go get some air.

387
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,400
<i>Do you know the legend of Piazzolla's bandoneon?</i>

<i>If you play with Piazzolla's bandoneon,</i>

389
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,910
<i>you can save the dead souls who died unfairly.
</i>

390
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:11,310
<i>Do you have a soul you want to console with Piazzolla's bandoneon?</i>

391
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,960
<i>What about you, Chairman?</i>

392
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,040
<i>Do you have someone you want to console?</i>

393
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,210

00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,140
<i>I would like to talk to Ms. Maria.</i>

397
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,080
<i>Yes, of course. I know she is unwell.</i>

398
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,470
<i>But can you tell me the name of the hospital?</i>

399
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,330
<i>I am someone who used to board at her home.</i>

400
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,250
<i>Okay. Yes, okay.</i>

401
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,740
<i>Tell her that I'm Sunny. She'll know me if you tell her my name.</i>

402
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,650
<i>Thank you.</i>

403
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,460
This is hard.

404

<i>[Have you still not gotten a hold of Ms. Maria?]</i>

405

Gosh, how classless of them.

406
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,360
What do you mean, Sis?

407
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,510
They've lost their minds because they want to have fun.

408
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,470
Gosh, how disgusting.

409
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,040
Do you know every dance in the world is unlucky?

410
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:54,330
People who submit to order don't dance.

411
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,330
So?

412
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,810
Don't you want to destroy order?

413
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:17,940
You want to return to your honeymoon phase and get pregnant before your sister-in-law.

414
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:28,570
Practice here. Then destroy the order and take everything.

415
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,300
Would you like to try the Abrazo?

416
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,590
It looks like you have blush on. It's so pretty!

417
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,260
Is it?

418
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,750
It's fun dancing with a partner.

419
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,510
It's quite steamy.

420
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:29,040
Why don't you call Chairman Kang and see when he's getting off of work?

421
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,580
So annoying.

422
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,340
Is he busy?

423
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:53,910
Professor, I would like a session with you today.

424
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,520
I'll head over now.

425
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:01,660
Gong Ja. Soon Ja.

426
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,990
Why are you so startled? Who was it?

427
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,120
It was my mother from the countryside.

428
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,880
Your mother has cancer, right?

429
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,140
Why? Is her health worsening?

430
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,730
No.

431
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,050
She just called to say hi.

432
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:23,300
Gong Ja.

433
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,660
Gong Ja.

434
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,570
Here.

435
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:33,600
Can you pick up Da Bi and take her home? I have to go to a consultation.

436
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,280
Sure.

437
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,500
Welcome home.

438
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,510
By the way, Da Bi, I have to make some changes to my lesson.

439
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,730
Can I use your computer?

440
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,190
It could be a laptop, too.

441
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:25,460
It's in the study.

442
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,790
If I go to the study when my dad isn't there, I'd get into big trouble.

443
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,960
Even though I go all the time.

444
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,210
Is that right, Da Bi? That's amazing.

445
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,110
Your dad's study is really grand.

446
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:58,100
By the way, Da Bi, won't you bring me your pointe shoes?

447
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,420
I'll take a look to see if they are balanced before I go home.

499
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:08,400
Did you tattoo over the scar from back then?

500
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,350
Ra El.

501
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,710
Why did you hurt the scar...

502
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:33,640
that wouldn't heal in a lifetime all the more? Why do you torture yourself?

503
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:52,040
Some scars will only be healed with even more pain.

504
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:00,710
Not true.

505
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:05,180
It's not true. There are other methods, Ra El.

506
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:11,170
Ra El, the path you're on is more dangerous.

507
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:21,920
If I were afraid, I wouldn't have started on this path.

508
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,110
I beg you, Ra El!

509

I won't hinder you.

Just like I wanted you to remember, please remember only one thing.

517
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:02,850
I sent you far away because I wasn't able to protect you then,

518

things are different now.

522
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,260
I want to help, Ra El.

523
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,960
Do you know what the tallest wall in the world is?

524
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,150
Tell me. What do you think it is?

525
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:20,480
I think it's the Great Wall of China.

526

It's the back of your husband who turned away from you.
