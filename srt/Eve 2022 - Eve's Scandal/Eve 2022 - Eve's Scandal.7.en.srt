<i>Hello,</i>

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,620
this is Seo Eun Pyeong.

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,250
<i>Oh, Assemblyman.</i>

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,010
I'm Kim Jeong Cheol.

15
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,780
I'll hand the phone to the prime minister.

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,060
It's Assemblyman Seo Eun Pyeong.

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,700
Yes, it's me.

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,420
Thank you for your gift.

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,570
A 400-year-old book was put on the market,

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,800
<i>so it made me think of you, Assemblyman Seo.</i>

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,320
<i>I heard you like books.</i>

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,340
Thank you for being so involved with my granddaughter's kindergarten, Assemblyman Seo.

23
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,890
Since you're taking such good care of me like this,

24
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,980
I would like to give you my greetings in person.

25
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,740
My goodness, of course.

26
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,660
Shall we?

27
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,920
Yes, I'll see you at my house.

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,380
Okay.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,800
<i>No matter what,</i>

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,550
promise me that you'll be by my side.

31
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,650
I will.

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,360
I will remain by your side, Chairman.

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,980
I will walk alongside you.

34
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,820
No matter what happens.

35
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,490
We agreed to keep our distance from Chairman Kang.

36
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,620
What will you do if your identity is revealed during the lawsuit?

37
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,350
What are you doing, in public, of all places?

38
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,070
Don't interfere with this.

39
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,540
My husband has another woman?

40
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,260
Based on what evidence are you saying that?

41
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,220
He came to your performance but didn't bring any gifts or flowers.

42
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,580
I've been watching, but he hasn't glanced in your direction once.

43
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,540
Did you confirm where he was the day he stayed out?

44
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,560
Follow me.

45
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,890
Secretary Cha.

46
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,480
We've tightened our security measures.

47
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,780
We will protect you so that no one comes near you.

48
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:02,210
Can I trust you when you say you've become my person?

49
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,590
I will carry out orders only for you, Chairman.

50
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,490
Why would Han Pan Ro do that? What did he send?

51
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,660
<i>There should be two boxes in my car.</i>

52
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,920
<i>The contents are the same.</i>

53
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,230
<i>Send one to my father, saying it's from the in laws.</i>

54
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,040
<i>Send the other box to my father-in-law, anonymously.</i>

55
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,980
Goodness.

56
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,010
Wipe it off, Sis.

57
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,760
You'll get burned like that. Isn't it hot?

58
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,670
You.

59
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,560
You think my attention and compliments towards you

60
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,050
make you something?

61
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,010
Did you forget who I am?

62
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,210
Of course not, Sis. How could I?

63
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,800
You say you know, but why do you talk to me like that?

64
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,580
I apologize, Madam.

65
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,620
You suspected my husband.

66
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,290
If that...

67
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,310
is a delusion, you'd better be prepared.

68
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,880
Bring me evidence.

69
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,440
If you say you don't have any or you were mistaken, you're dead.

70
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,540
Got it?

71
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,880
I understand, Madam.

72
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,990
<i>[Father]</i>

73
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,280
Honey.

74
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,590
It's okay.

75
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,150
Honey, how was the concert?

76
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,180
<i>I'll be waiting in the rose house.</i>

77
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,930
Bo Ram's mother, let's go.

78
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,470
Go on.

79
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,650
Honey. Mom. Go home first.

80
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,150
Bo Ram, Mommy's friend has a concern,

81
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,140
so I need to be with her. I'm sorry.

82
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,530
No.

83
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,650
What are you trying to... Let's talk at home.

84
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,680
- Let's go.
- We'll talk when I come back.

85
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,560
Are you seriously going to be like this?

86
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,640
Grandma.

87
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,750
Mother-in-law, I'm sure she has a reason. Let's go first.

88
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,800
- That's okay, right, Bo Ram?
- Yes.

89
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,640
- Thank you, Bo Ram.
- See you later, Mom.

90
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,640
I'm sorry, Mom.

91
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,490
Honey, I think I was really nervous because of the concert.

92
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,090
Let's go home. I want you to take care of me.

93
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,910
I have something important.

94
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,640
- What is it?
- It's work related.

95
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,280
Do you have to know?

96
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,210
- Didn't you come here to make up with me?
- Let's talk later.

97
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,780
Honey.

98
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,400
Follow the chairman.

99
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,540
Report to me who he's meeting and where he's going.

100
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,610
If you want to secure shares, how about using this method?

101
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,850
It's a risk, but it seems like a viable option.

102
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,390
How did you think of this?

103
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,700
A European designer brand experienced a management conflict before.

104
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,620
I learned something through their conflicts.

105
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,820
I looked into your affiliates as well.

106
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,200
You must've been so lonely.

107
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,040
How did you endure it?

108
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,590
Why do you think I'm lonely?

109
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,230
You had no one you could trust.

110
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,800
Ever since you were young.

111
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,680
Twin flames.

112
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,750
I don't believe in things like that.

113
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,160
But I'm really curious...

114
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,810
about how you know so much about me?

115
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,990
I won't ask you anything that makes you uncomfortable, just stay by my side.

Are you sure he's not in his office?

134
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,310
He said he had work. If he's not working, where did he go?

135
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,890
The chairman's secretary's office says he won't be coming home tonight.

136
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,930
He said the company had something urgent come up.

137
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,190
<i>I think he may have another woman.</i>

138
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,440
<i>He hasn't glanced in your direction once.</i>

139
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,410
Madam.

140
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,420
Madam, are you okay?

141
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,950
It's cold.

142
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,840
The indoor temperature is a mess.

143
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,320
I said it's cold!

144
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,440
Raise the temperature and bring a heater.

145
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,120
You can't come home?

146
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,020
I'll pick you up at dawn. I don't want you to stay out the whole night.

147
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,540
Staying out is not allowed, Son-in-law Jang. Give the phone to me.

148
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,970
Come home right this instant.

149
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,750
I said it's cold!

150
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,630
Bring me more heaters.

151
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,250
You can't come home tonight either?

152
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,290
This is too much, Honey.

153
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,480
<i>Who is your friend?</i>

154

156
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,000
Get up.

157
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,710
Turn off the heater.

158
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:48,170
Bo Ram, Mommy said she's coming so let's wait a little bit. Okay?

159
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,580
Okay.

160
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,220
It's Mom.

161
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,020
Mom.

162
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,220
Bo Ram.

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,310
I missed you.

164
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,030
Are you on your way to school? I'll give you a ride.

165
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,570
I can go with Dad today.

166
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,570
Go in and rest.

167
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,260
Bo Ram, come to the studio when you're done with school.

168
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,820
- Let's practice ballet in your chiffon dress.
- Wow!

169
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,890
My mom's the best, I love it.

170
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,750
Let's go, Bo Ram.

171
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,510
I trusted you would break it off with Chairman Kang,

172
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,380
and reveal my identity to the law firm.

173
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,760
What will you do if the other side makes a move before I do? How can you be so reckless?

174
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,720
My mother...

175
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,260
died because of Han So Ra.

176
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,920
I heard it from Han So Ra herself.

177
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,410
Han So Ra. This evil woman.

178
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,930
Your mother had already lost everything, why did she have to go so far?

179
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,690
She will pay.

180
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,830
Let's move through the law.

181
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,660
But the law is on their side.

182
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,530
I realized this after watching them closely.

183
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,740
The price for death is death.

184
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:06,330
Ra El, what happened to your determination to not become a monster?

185
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,720
They stole that determination.

186
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,100
I'll make them want to kill themselves.

187
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,710
With...

188
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,060
a cruel method,

189
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,620
I will make her beg to kill her instead.

190
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,530
Han So Ra is here.

191
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,060
Don't come out.

192
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,960
You made such a fuss,

193
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,690
then don't show up at the kindergarten?

194
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,700
I was reflecting on my actions.

195
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,580
I'm sorry for saying something absurd like that, Madam.

196
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,680
My husband...

197
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:28,370
hasn't been coming home. Since the day of the concert.

198
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,150
Something's not right.

199
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,940
Let's look into it together, Madam.

200
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,170
Yes, we should.

201
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,470
But I've been blocked.

202
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,280
I can't track him, and his bodyguards are protecting him so tightly.

203
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,910
How can I find anything out like this?

204
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,260
I have an idea.

205
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,620
<i>There's a proposal document for the shopping mall.</i>

206
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,440
<i>Tell him you suddenly have an idea regarding that and go to him.</i>

207
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,410
<i>You aren't there for personal reasons, you're there for business. What can he do?</i>

208
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,940
Chairman, Madam is here. I think you're going to have to come out.

209
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,150
<i>[Mom]</i>

210
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,460
<i>Ra El, I understand your anger.</i>

211
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,750
<i>But you can't go to LY Chairman's office without any preparations.</i>

212
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,180
You don't even have any plans regarding Han So Ra's suicide.

213
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,950
Han So Ra will be getting a divorce.

214
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,060
What if I tell you I'll be sitting in Han So Ra's spot at LY Group?

215
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,990
How would she feel if the whole country knew her husband abandoned her?

216
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:39,590
She's someone who needs to look perfect to others, wouldn't that make her want to die?

217
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,100
Let's go inside. I will escort you.

218
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,940
<i>It took twenty years to get here.</i>

219
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,470
<i>It'll only take five minutes to ruin it. </i>

220
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,650
Even though it is nothing more than a bit of anger from a small heart,

221
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,860
nothing is impossible when it strikes the bones.

222
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,900
You're here.

223
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,360
Hello, I'm Seo Eun Pyeong.

224
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,200
Welcome, Assemblyman Seo.

225
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,030
It's my first time seeing you up close like this.

226
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,740
You truly are remarkable, Assemblyman Seo.

227
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,640
- Thank you for inviting me.
- Now.

228
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,460
Let's go inside.

229
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,940
So after the initial listing,

230
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,820
in which direction should we proceed? If you could, please clarify?

231
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,770
We must broadly expand

232
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,800
it into a personal asset management system.

233
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,860
Let's have our goal fixed for 100% annual gross in sales.

234
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,560
Well, I agree with Chairman Kang's opinion that

235
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,730
we should go hard, to begin with.

236
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,490
The fact that the greatest conglomerate in Korea

237
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,450
is attempting to list in the New York Stock Exchange.

238
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,190
We will surely get a lot of attention. And even if we may fail,

239
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,790
the next opportunity would be open for us.

240
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,610
Okay.

241
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:32,480
Chairman, Madam is here.

242
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,820
Let's end the meeting here for today and wrap up.

243
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,740
Don't you know who I am?

244
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,410
I'm sorry.

245
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:07,070
Chairman said to meet in the chairman's office.

246
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,350
Honey, I'm sorry for not coming home these few days.

247
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,480
I'm at your company, do you want to meet?

248
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,370
I'm here to see Madam and the chairman.

249
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,550
Then come to the chairman's office.

250
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,960
What was that meeting?

251
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,690
Are they meeting and planning something?

252
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,070
Why is he ignoring my propositions?

253
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,630
I'm sure he's hiding something.

254
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,470
Wait.

255
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:26,550
What if he's just working, and I'm worrying for nothing?

256
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,210
Madam.

257
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,810
Why? What is it?

258
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,050
Will you take a look at Chairman's suit?

259
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,450
Whose is it? Whose makeup is it?

260
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,430
I don't know, Madam.

261
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,100
I just saw it coincidentally.

262
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,020
Tell me whose it is.

263
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,970
Tell me! Whose is it?

264
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,960
I really don't know.

265
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,890
You can't not know. Tell me anyone.

266
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,010
Whose is it?

267
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,030
Dam Ri usually talks about

268
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,710
Chairman Kang a lot.

269
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,050
This crazy little—

270
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,700
Are you thinking before you speak?

271
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,820
That's simply absurd and impossible.

272
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,140
Tell me properly!

273
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,060
What do you think you're doing?

274
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,490
Are you crazy?

275
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,430
What will you do if she gets hurt?

276
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,720
You care about someone else getting hurt,

277
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,830
but don't care about hurting my feelings?

278
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,680
You're the one humiliating me.

279
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,910
What nuisance are you creating coming here without telling me?

280
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:47,020
Tell me about your meeting first.

281
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,570
Why aren't you coming home? What are you doing and where?

282
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:57,150
What was that meeting about? Why do you have so many bodyguards?

283
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,420
You're the one being weird.

284
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,030
I'm the stupid one for not doing anything about it!

285
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,540
Get out. Don't ever come to the office again!

286
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,850
Chairman.

287
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,670
Get lost this instant.

288
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,530
Get lost?

289
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,060
I'm going to stay with my family. I'm going to my dad!

290
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,600
You're the one who made me like this.

291
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,090
So Ra!

292
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,980
Oh geez, Madam. What's the matter?

293
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,980
Chairman!

294
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,310
Madam.

295
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,950
Let's leave for now.

296
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,380
Standby outside.

297
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,550
God, what's the matter? What is it?

298
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,220
Your wife is in the chairman's office.

299
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,500
I'm okay. Are you hurt?

300
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,670
Your wife suspects you.

301
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,170
She thinks you have another woman.

302
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:34,520
Place some distance between my wife. I'll find someone to protect you.

303
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,000
Are you sure you'll be okay?

304
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,430
I can't believe you campaigned without any political funds.

305
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,420
Your ambition is second to none.

306
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,070
I tend to not get scared easily.

307
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,050
To be honest, politics can't be conducted with ambition alone.

308
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,980
It is an opportune moment for you to come find me at this juncture.

309
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,390
I will look after you, Assemblyman Seo.

310
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,690
Your path will be steady and fast.

311
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,490
It's unbelievably comforting to reveal our inner thoughts.

312
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,090
Come, let's drink to it.

313
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:32,550
<i>So Ra, come now. I said I will find out about it.</i>

314
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:36,000
I'm telling you that I personally saw the eyeshadow on his suit.

315
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,720
So Ra, please calm down.

316
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,240
Eyeshadow can't just get on the suit on its own.

317
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,150
- He definitely had intimate contact with someone else!
<i>- Sora, keep it down!</i>

318
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,690
Goodness, who's there?

319
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,280
- We have a guest here.
<i>- Oh, I see.</i>

320
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,270
Come, a toast.

321
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:11,090
If your father finds out when it's not even certain, it'll cause a ruckus for nothing!

322
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,240
Don't you recall the Madam Jeong incident as of late?

323
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,970
I'll look into it, so calm down.

324
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,980
I wasn't planning on returning to my premarital home.

325
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,500
Then all you have to do is go home.

326
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,770
What about my pride, then?

327
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:28,810
All right. I got it. I'll make sure Yoon Kyeom begs on his knees.

328
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:32,570
Since I called Bo Ram's mom, just take your anger out on her.

329
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,580
<i>Why are you maudlin, Vice Chairman Kim? Assemblyman Seo is here.</i>

330
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,680
Ah, right, Prime Minister!

331
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,110
Change your clothes and go on home later. Understand?

332
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,800
Madam, Ms. Kim Seon Bin came, so I told her to come in.

333
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:54,960
Why are you looking at me as if I'm pathetic?

334
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,720
You're mistaken, Madam. That is not the case.

335
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,790
Am I the kind of a person who makes mistakes?!

336
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,270
I apologize, Madam.

337
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,330
You have a problem with attitude and manners.

338
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,760
Did you look into it, that eyeshadow?

339
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,200
Is there any bitch who uses that product? Who is it?

340
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,150
It was so sudden, so I couldn't find out to that degree.

341
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:26,160
I just found out it's made to order.

342
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,230
I also heard Ms. Eun Dam Ri bragging about it.

343
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,060
I tell you for certain, it's not this bitch.

344
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:44,240
Why on earth would my husband go for a bitch inferior to me? Is there no other bitch that fits?

345
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:48,710
<i>Madam! I'm told that Assemblyman is leaving.</i>

346
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,750
Your oratory skill is superb.

347
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,670
<i>Wow, thanks to having a handsome man and woman under my roof brightens our household.</i>

348
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,040
Assemblyman, please come often.

349
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,720
I will do so.

350
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,900
Wait a minute. How come you don't count my looks?

351
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,940
So Ra, bring him a mirror.

352
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,790
- Let's head out.
- Let's.
- All right.

353
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,610
What about supper? Are you heading to a restaurant?

354
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,550
Nah, let's dine after seeing Assemblyman Seo off.

355
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,580
Why did you come here? It's dangerous.

356
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,060
I can say the same about you.

357
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,690
<i>Assemblyman! Your car is waiting.</i>

358
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,610
Why did you visit Han Pan Ro's home?

359
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,040
It's related to me, isn't it?

360
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,360
You're going to lose your breath at that rate. Have a seat.

361
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,170
Here.

362
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,850
You haven't eaten, have you?

363
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,080
Come on. Take it.

364
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,900
They are dangerous people.

365
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,040
And you are not in danger?

366
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,080
I'm only carrying out the tasks I must complete.

367
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,890
It's difficult to carry them out alone.

368
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,320
Then you'll deal with them yourself, Mr. Attorney?

369
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,970
Look at this. This is the very reason.

370
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,310
You just called me Mr. Attorney like the old days.

371
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:45,990
Doesn't that mean there's a change in your heart?

372
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:53,420
Ra El, as you well know, I don't have a family.

373
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:59,350
After your father, whom I relied solely upon passed, I was left alone.

374
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,330
Now, the only person left to me is you.

375
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:09,860
It may appear strange that I consider you and your father, with whom I have no blood ties.

376
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:15,080
Family isn't established to all who are your blood kin.

377
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,510
It is made with love and sharing.

378
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,780
Ra El.

379
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,180
You are still in your 20's. I'm saying you're young.

380
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,890
It is time that can still be taught a lesson and be scolded as well.

381
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:34,170
It is the age that can receive help.

382
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,290
Your heart that dashes towards the unknown...

383
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,310
I'm saying I understand you fully.

384
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,980
The soup is getting cold. Hurry and eat.

385
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,600
And if you really don't have any appetite, how about the delicious sweet and sour chicken?

386
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,970
This is my piece de resistance.

387
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,910
They say the chicken is good for stress.

388
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,420
Who are you?

389
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,830
Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom sent me.

390
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,840
I'm a bodyguard.

391
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,590
I was ordered to protect and serve you like a shadow.

392
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,870
<i>[I will protect you. I'm sorry and I am grateful. Kang Yoon Kyeom]</i>

393
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,850
Do you honestly believe a married couple with two children will divorce just because one of them had an affair?

394
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,880
Wake up!

395
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,090
An affair is only an affair. Especially to a conglomerate.

396
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,100
Do you think so?

397
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,030
Are you guaranteeing Han So Ra's divorce?

398
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,630
That's right.

399
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:37,270
Let me ask you just one thing. Did you fall for a car or some jewelry?

400
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:40,610
Are you acting like this because you were tempted by the chairman's wife's position?

401
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,190
You like Chairman Kang, don't you?

402
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,520
They say there are things you just can't hide, no matter how hard you try.

403
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,960
Poverty, a sneeze, and love.

404
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,360
The way you look at Chairman Kang is unusual.

405
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,540
Supposedly, the body can kindle feelings, do you desire it?

406
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,460
Do you want Chairman Kang to become yours?

407
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:15,610
<i>I'm home, Mother!</i>

408
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:20,300
You are home, too.

409
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:27,750
Is our honey not going to sneak out tonight?

410
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,470
Honey,

411
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:38,800
what were you doing in the chairman's office today?

412
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,930
Ah, Mother-in-law.

413
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:49,460
Mother-in-law, I saw something.

414
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:56,990
Honey, what is it that I saw?

415
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,430
What did you see?

416
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,030
You know what I saw!

417
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:18,830
Mother-in-law, when my wife didn't come home, could you tell me with whom she was with?

418
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:24,950
Where are you going? Your husband is talking to you!

419
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,360
What is your relationship with Chairman Kang?

420
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,620
Son-in-law Jang, what are you doing?!

421
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:03,640
A man who confessed to giving his life for me is acting up on mere jealousy.

422
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:08,770
You saw this with your own eyes. Love is so very trivial like this.

423
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,870
Even if there may be some love within my heart, what do you fear?

424
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:18,180
Love is only this trivial.

425
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,770
What are you talking about?

426
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:28,750
I was with the chairman on the night of my friend's birthday, as well as the past several nights.

427
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:37,590
Son-in-law Jang, she is out of her mind with all the effort she put forth supporting the chairman's wife.

428
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:38,940
There's nothing serious going on.

429
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,560
It's not true. Let's move on.

430
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,350
It is true.

431
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,270
What are you doing?

432
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:00,560
You have a secret you haven't told me about as well, no?

433
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,230
How can we be a couple when we keep things from each other?

434
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,750
I'm going to think about it away from here.

435
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,700
You can't. Don't leave.

436
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,130
You can't leave. I won't let you!

437
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:19,430
I beg you. Don't leave.

438
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,420
I won't make you hurt. I'll never do it again.

439
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:26,200
I... am sorry. So just don't leave.

440
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:31,150
I really am scared.

441
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,340
Why did we become like this? Huh?

442
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:49,690
Are you asking me why we became like this?

443
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,940
Honey.

444
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,270
You can't do this. Where will you go?

445
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:26,100
You know very well. I've no place to go.

446
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,060
And you probably are aware.

447
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:33,980
Instead of stopping me, it'll be better for both of us to survive if you are on my side.
