00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,520
Are you okay? Did you have a nightmare?

11
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,720
What kind of nightmare was it?

12
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,510

- A nightmare is just a nightmare.
- You wrote a will.

It's just in case.

17
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,150
Really, just in case anything happens.

18
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,330
I only thought...

19
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,220
to have it prepared.

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,640
It just happens unknowingly.

23
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,260
Do you remember the music from Piazzolla's movie?

28

<i>It's a song about a boy who forgets who he is.</i>

29
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,990
The story is about the boy who lives, forgetting his true identity.

30
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,860
It's not that he forgot about his true identity,

31
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,040
maybe he erased his memory deliberately.

32
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,520
Because he wanted to live as he wished.

33
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,610
Living as you want to...

34
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,830
Why don't you erase all your bad memories?

35
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,540
Then you could live a better life.

36
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,000
You can be hopeful.

37
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,780
Hopeful that you will be able to fulfill your wishes.

38
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,620
Do you have a wish?

39
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,320
Tell me. What do you wish for?

40
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,830
I don't want to carry any more hatred in my heart.

41
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,970
I want to live peacefully.

42
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,950
What about you?

43
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,590
I want to love who I love...

44
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,610
endlessly.

45
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,300
There's really not much to it.

46
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,730
You and I both couldn't even do that.

47
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,620
We tried to do that bare minimum

48
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,980
and had to pass through such a long tunnel.

49
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,200
You broke my legs?

50
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,630
I'll break your entire body.

51
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,680
If you have a warm cup of tea, you'll be able to sleep better.

52
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,480
I've thought about it differently,

53
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:56,050
if what we desire is so trivial, doesn't that mean it's that much easier to achieve?

54
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,500
You asked whether I was ever truthful with you.

55
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,970
You said everything was intentional.

56
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,360
- It was a lie.
- I know what you mean.

57
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:17,180
If erasing your memories is a choice, you can also choose what you see.

58
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,820
You've shown me the truth multiple times,

59
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,530
but I kept saying that the situation was difficult,

60
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,230
and I failed to understand your heart.

61
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,990
I can see that now.

62
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,870
Let's go to Seoul.

63
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,570
Let's take care of the past,

64
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,090
and wait for what's to come next.

65
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:55,810
We can be greedy about wanting to love and be loved, right?

66
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,960
So Ra, after ruining you and I,

67
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,430
Lee Ra El is with your husband,

68
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,960

<i>If you were to see that, you would've gone crazy.</i>

70
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,200
Listen carefully.

71
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,890
Things will be harder after tonight.

72
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,240
I've called someone to clean up after you, so prepare yourself for even the worst.

73
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,470
<i>You don't have to grill me about it. I can't stand that she's got good legs.</i>

74
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,120
I won't see it anymore.

75
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,730

Da Bi heard you were at the villa and she kept whining to go to you so I came with her.

00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,140
The patient herself has erased her memory completely.

323
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,030
It's dissociative amnesia where the patient blocks out bad memories.

324
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:24,590
It's the early onset of the condition, but if she were to recall her memory, the memory is so traumatic that she may attempt to commit suicide.

325
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,250
If you'll excuse me...

326
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,080
Thank you, Doctor.

327
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:41,090
Though her life has been spared, she abandoned herself, hence you can't really call it a living.

328
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:45,230
My pretty...

329
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,280
Who dares to come in without my permission?

330
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,660
Who are you? An LY employee?

331
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,760
What is it?

332
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:42,780
What's wrong with my face?

333
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:48,180
Who did this?

334
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,970
Who did this!

335
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,760
You did it yourself.

336
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:02,690
Erasing your memory is also a privilege for only those who deserve it.

337
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,450
Kang Yoon Kyeom...

338
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,410
is dead.

339
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,520
He was murdered.

340
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:42,140
With your own hand, you killed your husband, who you loved so much.

341
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:48,990
Don't die now. What you've committed,

342
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:52,120
living in that is the real living hell.

343
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,100
No.

344
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,930
No.

345
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,780
This isn't me.

346
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,550
How could this be?

347
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,410
This can't be right.

348
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:11,660
This makes no sense.

349
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,940
No. This can't be right!

350
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,960
No!

351
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:24,310
This is not my face!

352
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,740
Who are you?

353
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,370
Why are you doing this to me!

354
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:34,960
What did I do that you'd do this to me?

355
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,630
Why are you doing this to me?

356
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,910
Who the heck are you!

357
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,480
Why are you doing this to me!

358
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,070
<i>Who are you!</i>

359
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,930
<i>Why are you doing this to me?!</i>

360
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,320
<i>Who the heck are you!</i>

361
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:06,800
Han Pan Ro. Kim Jeong Cheol.

362
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,340
Han So Ra. They benefited from power corruption through political and economic collusion.

363
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:17,720
Under the name of the Zeus project, they gave rights and interest to the company.
<i> [Witness stand] </i>

364
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,970
And they took property gains.

365
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:28,320
I was in charge of abduction...

366
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,490
and threatening people...

367
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,830
who defied Mr. Han Pan Ro.

368
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:40,330
The former representative of LY Victims' Solidarity,

369
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:44,260
Ms. Jang Moon Hee. I was involved in abandoning her body.

370
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:51,110
I also stabbed and injured...

371
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:54,160
the Chief Secretary of the President, Seo Eun Pyeong.

372
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,760
We found a person here.

373
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,800
Open the door.

374
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:46,190
Lawyer Seo, you said this to me before.

375
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:52,530
Life is filled with pain anyway.

376
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:59,100
But why do you look okay?

377
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:06,300
You also grew up with difficulty in the absence of your parents.

378
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:11,400
But from you, I don't feel any rage.

379
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:17,310
How did you overcome your resentment?

380
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:22,700
I didn't overcome it as well.

381
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,500
If I look fine, it must be because of a different reason.

382
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,150
Life is a tragedy that's filled with pain, indeed.

383
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:42,590
But the beautiful moment when you overcome that does come. Only humans can do it.

384
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:46,950
The moment you overcome is so noble and splendid...

385
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,910
that you can't help but praise life.

386
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,460
That moment will come to you as well.

387
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:59,550
The moment when the beautiful blessing will come down into your heart.

388
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:33,840
<i> While building up the Tower of Babel called LY Group, so many victims arose. </i>

389
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,880
<i> Seeking profit is the purpose of companies. </i>

390
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,110
<i> But the social responsibility of contributing to the community is also important. </i>

391
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:46,410
<i> We compensated the victims with the cost of Gediks Semiconductors that got returned. </i>

392
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:51,460
<i> And now, we will become a non-profit foundation that will help other corporate victims.</i>

<i> If I dance the Tango here, do you know what it's called? </i>

399
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,820
<i> It's the Tango in the room. </i>

400
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:43,210
<i> This is why I hesitated. </i>

401
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:45,870
<i> I was afraid that I might fall in love with you. </i>

<i> I know you have a wound. </i>

404

<i> A wound that is unbearable that you have to make another wound to endure. </i>

405
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:28,580
<i> You follow your heart. Before the season comes, I'll go and get Cosmos flowers for you. </i>

406
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:33,430
<i> Then someday, you'll bloom your flower for me. </i>

407
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,820
<i> It was my first time realizing it. </i>

408
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:42,930
<i> The best thing is in ordinary things. </i>

409
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,100
Nice to meet you, Ms. Lee Ra El. I'm your flight attendant.

410

I'll take care of you comfortably until we arrive in Buenos Aires.

411
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:12,950
What can I get for your company?

412
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,620
I'm traveling by myself.

413
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:21,620
I thought you had company since the seat was reserved.

414
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:25,430
The person who was going to travel with me couldn't come.

415
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:29,070
So instead of him, I'm only bringing the instrument.

416
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,710
That's so unfortunate to hear.

417
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:35,170

<i>Buenos Aires? I've never even been there before.</i>

<i>It's a roundtrip ticket, right?</i>

Independent?

462

You need to get your facts right.

463
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,110
More like you ordered me around and were dependent on me.

464
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,850
I did?

465
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:18,560
Are you going to see Ra El in Buenos Aires?

I'm not sure if I'll meet her there,

or if she'll even have the time for me if we do.

472
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:41,530
Is it time for you to hear her answer to the question you asked?

<i>[Tango]</i>

481
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:51,500
<i>You said with Tango, even a mistake becomes a dance.</i>

482
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:57,240
<i>Then whatever we had, it was love, and it was beautiful as is.</i>

483
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:03,210
<i>Even if I went back to the beginning knowing everything, I would still fall for you...</i>

484
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:05,810
<i>and fall in love again.</i>

485
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:17,680
Thank you, everyone.

486
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,590
Today was my last show.

487
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:23,910
<i>I played you "Adios" to represent parting ways now and with the past.</i>

488
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:32,290
True love gives you the courage to move on to the next stage.

489
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:38,990
I also plan to bury the past and walk toward the future.

490
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:41,870
I don't know what it will be.

491
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:48,000
But I'm sure it will be good.

492
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:55,230
That's why the last song I chose to play is about freedom.

493
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:44,230

501
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,910
Shall we dance a tango together?

502
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,950
I would like that.
