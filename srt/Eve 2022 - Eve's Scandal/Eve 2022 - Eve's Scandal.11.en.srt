It's the contract of the inside trader who turned over Gediks.

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,640
If we can obtain the original Gediks contract from Chairman Kang's safe,

00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,350
I got it.

157
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,940
Chief Secretary, it's late.

158
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,020
Is something the matter? You called for me all of a sudden.

159
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,520
I was a little surprised.

160
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,080
Have a seat.

161
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,930
Yes.

162
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,510
By chance, did I do something wrong?

163
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,420
<i>[Statement Inquiry]</i>

164
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,970
The Swiss account with a different name. It's you, right?

165
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,800
You had taken out some funds from almost every project.

166
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,510
Is Prime Minister Han Pan Ro aware of this?

167
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:47,070
At this rate, how can I trust you and work with you

168
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,820
on the Zeus Project?

169
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,550
<i>[Blue House]</i>

170
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,570
Ms. Kim Seon Bin is the daughter of the person who took care of me.

171
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,550
Kim Seon Bin?

172
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,100
Kim Seon Bin! The one who had an affair with Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom...

173
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,350
Hey, Kim Jeong Cheol.

174
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,380
Yes?

175
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,760
Ms. Kim Seon Bin is family to me.

176
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,070
Do I need to explain further?

177
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,700
No, Sir. I understand what you mean.

178
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,010
The tea is getting cold.

179
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,200
Welcome.

180
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,910
Would you like to order?

181
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,270
- One coffee and one tea, please.
- Sure.

182
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,790
You like tea, Ma'am.

183
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,590
I had no choice, but to...

184
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,960
reveal your identity to Kang Yoon Kyeom, Ra El.

185
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,330
If you side with Chairman Kang, what about my safety?

186
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,530
And what happens to the lawsuit?

187
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,810
Even so, does it make sense to change the security system?

188
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,990
Put it back the way it was.

189
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:52,340
I only want one thing. I won't stop your lawsuit, but

190
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,230
you can't expose it in the press. Only send your attorney to court.

191
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,240
I must find out the truth behind my mom, and I must see

192
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,210
Han So Ra die.

193
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,180
In return, I'll give you the original Gedik's contract and even turn over Kang Yoon Kyeom's secret safe.

194
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,660
This isn't a negotiation. It's a threat. If you reveal my identity without my permission,

195
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,050
we all go down together.

196
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,240
Chief Secretary Seo?

197
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,230
I didn't know you'd be here.

198
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,930
Yes, Seon Bin went out for a moment.

199
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,700
Yes.

200
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,040
You said you had something to give her. Should I give it to her for you?

201
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,920
No. I'll give it to her directly.

202
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,120
As you please.

203
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,560
We've only met for work. It feels different meeting you outside of work.

204
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,450
You seem different here as well, Chairman Kang.

205
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,340
Is that so?

206
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,170
I don't know much about politics. By chance, Chief Secretary Seo...

207
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,690
do you know the difference between a politician and a businessman?

208
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,430
A politician is reckless in that he'll guarantee success even though the probability of it is low.

209
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,170
A businessman never invests in something that's not going to pan out.

210
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,150
Merger and acquisition, investment decisions, and in all things. And of all things,

211
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,890
thinking of a woman who's in love with another man...

212
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,810
He doesn't do such a thing, either.

213
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,000
Is that so?

214
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,290
This is the difference between a politician and a businessman that I'm aware of.

215
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:02,800
A businessman is overly sure about what he can see.

216
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:09,810
In contrast, politicians try to read things that are not visible.

217
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:16,080
For example, deciding a woman will be yours forever just because she's in front of you right now.

218
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,430
A politician will never make that kind of arrogant assumption.

219
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,120
Chief Secretary Seo, when did you come here?

220
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,990
Did you have dinner?

221
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,070
Should I bring out some food for you?

222
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,400
No, I'm just here to hand something over.

223
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,730
I should get going.

224
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,380
Why don't you two comfortably talk? I'll leave you two alone.

225
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,410
It's okay. I'm sorry to visit you without previous notice.

226
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,650
Why don't we have a proper meal together next time?

227
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,980
Let's do so, Chief Secretary Seo.

228
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,550
Then, I'll see you later.

229
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,630
This is the draft of Jang Moon Hee's lawsuit that I obtained.

230
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,850
Thank you. I'll look into it.

231
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:45,630
Ra El, I'll ask you directly.

232
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:51,230
Are you sure you only feel vengeance toward Chairman Kang?

233
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,020
Why are you asking that?

234
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,870
It's because I'm anxious.

235
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,510
You told me everything else, but why did you not tell me that you are living with him?

236
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,640
You don't have to stay with him.

237
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,500
Do you really have feelings for Chairman Kang?

238
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,240
After Ms. Jang, are you also accusing me of that?

239
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,180
Why do my feelings matter?

240
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,980
Isn't it enough if I accomplish what I must?

241
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,590
I'm tired of those melodramas.

242
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,580
Do you think I'm talking about melodramas right now?

243
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:51,040
Thirteen years ago, you asked me...

244
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,690
what my name meant.

245
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,410
<i> Lee Ra El. It's a beautiful name. </i>

246
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,930
<i> Does your name have a meaning to it? </i>

247
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,790
<i> The one who belongs to God. My dad gave that name to me. </i>

248
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:11,660
<i> But, Dad, about the name Ra El. </i>

249
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,390
<i> The one who belongs to God? </i>

250
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,130
<i> What does that mean? </i>

251
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,930
<i> Does it mean it's the one who's almighty, like God? </i>

252
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,810
<i> How can a human be powerful like God? </i>

253
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,770
<i> Then, what's the one who belongs to God? </i>

254
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,010
<i> It means the one who does not belong to the world. </i>

255
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,880
<i> What does that mean? </i>

256
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,480
<i> In this world, there are a thousand, a million wrong ways. </i>

257
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,740
<i> And the one who belongs to God means who will not go down any of those wrong paths. </i>

258
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,330
<i> It's the one who does not belong to the world, </i>

259
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,610
<i> so it means the one who doesn't have any wrong ideas. </i>

260
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,640
<i> Do I really not have any wrong ideas? </i>

261
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,690
<i> No matter what kind of hardship comes, just follow your heart. </i>

262
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,650
<i> Then, it'll be the right way, no matter what. </i>

263
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,820
<i> So it's an amazingly good one. </i>

264
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,830
My heart is filled with vengeance.

265
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,750
And I'm following where my heart goes.

266
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,360
Okay, I get it.

267
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:24,250
But if you really have feelings for Chairman Kang,

268
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:29,300
then you'll fall into tremendous pain.

269
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,010
I hope you don't go down that path.

270

<i> [One unread message] </i>

<i>[Chairman Kang Yoo Kyeom] </i>

272

<i> As you healed me, now I want to try my best to heal you. </i>

273
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,590
<i> Are you sure you only feel vengeance toward Chairman Kang? </i>

274
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,580
Are you okay?

275
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,350
- Did you get hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

276

<i> One day, your love can burn down everything you built up until now. </i>

277

278
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,260
<i> I hope you don't go down that path. </i>

279
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,940
Seon Bin.

280
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,200
Bo Ram's mom.

281
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,740
Madam Han So Ra is very sensitive about it.

282
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,910
Is it okay for you to come out here?

283
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,160
It's because Da Bi wants to come to kindergarten.

284
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,450
After getting away from her mom and staying with me,

285
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,680
Da Bi became much brighter.

286
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,890
Are you taking care of Da Bi right now?

287
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,920
Did you not know about me staying with her?

288
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,900
The Chairman, Da Bi, and Bo Ram as well. We are all staying together.

289
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,540
I see.

That wench showed up.

293
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,950
I'm following her right now. Da Bi is in the car as well.

294
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,000
I think I can find where the chairman is staying.

295
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,100
Do not lose her.

296
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,760
Text me immediately when you figure out the address.

297
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,690
<i> Yes, Ma'am. </i>

<i>[Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom] </i>

300
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,620
Chairman, I think someone is following me.

301
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,590
They are trying to find this place.

302
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,090
You don't know about my wife or her father. It's dangerous. You have to get away from it.

<i> Shall I pretend to go back to the kindergarten and not go to the house? </i>

00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,000
Yes, do so. I'll go to the kindergarten right now.

305
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,160
Secretary Cha, get the car ready now.

306
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,680
Did you find their hideout? Where is it?

<i> Ma'am, it's me, Marco. </i>

308

Ma'am, I have slept with Eun Dam Bi.

309
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,990
I also got enough photos for proof.

There is no reason for my daughter to be mistreated like this.

465
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,800
We'll just strip him of everything and kick him out like a beggar.

466
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,510
I will never get a divorce.

467
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,830
I would rather die than have a wench like her take my husband!

468
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,650
How do you plan on winning back a punk who lost his mind?

469
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:36,270
This happened because you went over there with a hammer!

470
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,060
Shut it!

471
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,980
That method won't work to change his mind.

472
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,730
You failed to manage your husband.

473
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,900
So just shut your mouth!

474
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,670
Sir, please.

475
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,450
Our family is in shambles.

476
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,180
Complete shambles!

477
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,800
It's a shit show because of one girl.

478
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,030
Let's do this, Chief Secretary Seo.

479
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:22,380
If it were up to me, I wouldn't just sit back.

480
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:27,040
But since you care for her dearly, she's off limits.

481
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,270
Then in order for her to live

482
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,750
and for me to live,

483
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:38,240
the only option left is to file a countersuit.

484
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,280
Let's take all of Yoon Kyeom's fortune through the divorce.

485
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,790
And you, in return for me not messing with that woman,

486
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:53,390
you must help with the lawsuit. Don't you agree?

487
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:15,190
<i>Meet me once you leave Han Pan Ro's home.</i>

488
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,900
Do Hwan, I will never get a divorce.

489
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:35,340
Dad and I will have to go our separate ways.

490
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,750
Yes, Madam.

491
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:48,710
Do Hwan, I know you're desperate to get money for your mom's surgery.

492
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,730
Get her that surgery.

493
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:04,010
<i>[Check]</i>

494
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,680
Thank you so much, Madam.

495
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,440
You are all that I have.

496
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,120
You have to be on my side.

497
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,910
Yes, I'm ready to do whatever you ask.

498
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:26,650
Bring that wench to me without alerting my dad or husband.

499
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,880
Do whatever it takes.

500
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,340
I heard about Han Pan Ro's lawsuit idea.

501
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,940
I think this is going to become a big war, Ra El.

502
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,140
It's okay, there's an upside.

503
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:50,720
If Han Pan Ro's lawsuit gets entangled with Teacher Jang Moon Hee's lawsuit,

504
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,490
the fact that he illegally took LY and Gediks will be revealed to the world.

505
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:00,970
All right then. Then I'll use this lawsuit...

506
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:04,930
to prove that you are the rightful heir to Gediks.

507
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:11,130
It's right that Kang Yoon Kyeom is stripped of everything and thrown into a bottomless pit.

508
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,970
You are the owner of LY, Ra El.

509
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:21,020
Let's start with the biggest divorce lawsuit that Korea has ever seen.

510
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:26,060
Request for joint services from former Supreme Court prosecutor Kim Myeong Cheol's law firm,

511
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:29,450
and Korea's biggest law firm, Park and Kim's Tae Eul.

512
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:32,310
Yes, Prime Minister.

513
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:50,880
<i>It's right that Kang Yoon Kyeom is stripped of everything and thrown into a bottomless pit.</i>

514
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:58,060
<i>Just like you healed me, I want to try to heal you, too.</i>

515
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,510
<i>Is it delicious?</i>

516
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,680
<i>Do I have to eat it, too?</i>

517
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,150
<i>This is delicious.</i>

518
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,580
<i>It's so tasty.</i>

519
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:08,500
<i>You should have been happy, Lee Ra El.</i>

520
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,120
<i>How could you feel sympathy for him?</i>

521
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,930
Cosmos?

522
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,790
I knew you would notice the Cosmos flower the first.

523
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,460
It's not even spring yet.

524
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,510
But how did you get the Cosmos?

525
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:13,620
Before autumn comes, I'll go get Cosmos even if I have to go to the other side of the planet.

526
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:17,210
Somehow Cosmos flowers make me think of you.

527
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:21,040
<i> It's Cosmos flowers that exactly look like you, Ra El! </i>

528
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,360
<i> It would be nice if every day were my birthday! </i>

529
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,380
<i> Would it not be possible? </i>

530
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:30,620
<i> Why not? If it makes you happy, I'll do anything for you. </i>

531
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,840
<i> Then, Dad. The Cosmos is the problem. </i>

532
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,840
<i> You give me a Cosmos bouquet every year on my birthday, but it only blooms in autumn. </i>

533
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,640
<i> Then before autumn comes, </i>

534
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,840
<i> I'll go to the other side of the planet to get it. </i>

535
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,390
<i> Cosmos is said to be the first flower made by God to light up the world. </i>

536
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,430
<i> So from now on, your world </i>

537
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:55,480
<i> will lighten up every day, every year! </i>

538
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:59,460
<i> Mom and Dad, I love you. </i>

539
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,770
I know you have a wound inside you.

540
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:08,870
An unbearable wound that you need to make another one.

541
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,050
I know it could've not been easy to say it.

542
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:12,480
It's okay.

543
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,600
You follow your heart. Before the season comes,

544
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,410
I'll find and bring the Cosmos for you.

545
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:25,380
Then you'll bloom for me someday.

546
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,960
<i>There's something else I prepared.</i>

547
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,620
<i> After you lose your husband, money, position, </i>

548
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:15,820
<i> and when your heart and body start to rot, would you finally get it then? </i>

He's my husband.

00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,970
I will never let you take him away from me.
