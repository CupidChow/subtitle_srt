Bandoneon?

156
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,640
What's a bandoneon?

157
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,330
It's a tango instrument.

158
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,280
Are you even acquainted with such a subculture?

159
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,520
The female dancer is Korean.

160
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,580
Who is that woman? How can she dance so well?

161
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,310
Is she an entertainer?

162
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,550
Her style kills, seriously!

163
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,170
That woman is supposedly a parent.

164
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,370
- Really?
- Did you hear? She is a Liyan parent.

165
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,950
She is a kindergartener's mom?!

166
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,670
They say she is also a Liyan parent.

167
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,760
Liyan's lost its class.

168
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,170
What a downgrade to be associated with someone like her.

169
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:06,180
Thanks to the chairman, this event's fundraising has already surpassed the target.

170

She is a parent of the "Royal" Class, but I had no idea she was so skilled.

180
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,660
The Royal Class?

181

<i>You were amazing.</i>

182
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,660
I've never seen her before.

183
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,570
Which family is it to belong in the "royal" class?

184
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,700
I heard her mother's side has a connection to the foundation.

185
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,000
After "experiencing" her, if there's to be any issue...

186
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,160
let me know, please.

187
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,430
<i>That was a great performance.</i>

<i>- Good to meet you.

She appears even younger up close.

190
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,150
- How old do you think she is?
- She looks younger than you.

192
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,520

Hello. How do you do?

195
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,890
It is my honor to be in the same class as you.

196
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,490
We enjoyed the performance.

197
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,450
I wanted to meet you two the most.

198
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,560
I also am a member of the SE club.

199
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,910
Really?

200
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,800
You are a SE member, you say?

201
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,530
Did the 1,000-member limitation expire? I heard there were no new members.

202
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,140
I've been a member for some time.

203
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,820
My mom is an original member.

204
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,800
I see.

205
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,960
Why haven't we seen you before?

206
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,660
You're right...

207
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,810
Have we ever met you while exercising?

208
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,810
If I don't make myself up, I don't get noticed.

209
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,890
Both of you have some sort of aura, so you are noticeable.

210
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,870
To be honest, I stole glances at you two as if I were witnessing stars.

211
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,140
I alone, that is.

212
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,440
Gosh, stop.

213
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,010
<i>...since this year's program is diverse.</i>

214
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,770
Mom, can I go to play in the playroom?

215
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,560
Of course.

216
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,140
Bo Ram, I think your friend over there is also into ballet.

217
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,550
Would you like to ask where she takes lessons?

218
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,840
Wouldn't it be nice for your friend to take lessons from me with you?

219
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,500
I will ask, Mom.

220
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,170
Anyone who wants to visit the playroom, feel free to go together.

221
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,600
<i>Say hello.</i>

222
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,320
Do you want to come with us to the playroom?

223
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,290
Mom, may I go with them?

224
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,150
Go on.

225
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,250
Have a good time.

226
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,000
She is so cute.

227
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,010
You look young. How old are you?

228
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,980
I am 28.

229
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,060
Twenty... eight?

230
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,230
How great is your husband that you can marry so young?

231
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,510
Is your husband here? What does he do?

232
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,170
He is just an ordinary office worker. He couldn't make it due to his job.

233
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,140
How come you dance so well? Are you a professional dancer?

234
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,470
Not at all. I started Tango as a hobby.

235
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,490
I just fell in love.

236
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,400
You are that skilled when it's just a hobby?

237
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,780
Wow.

238
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,080
You know Han So Ra, right?

239
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,970
She is also in our class.

240
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,240
Does Ms. Han So Ra not like interacting with others?

241
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,190
It's well known that Han Pan Ro, the former party leader, raised her without manners.

242
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,170
During her eldest's stay, even as class president, she associated with no other parents.

243
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,840
She believes she is the only one who's high class.

244
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,990
No way! Will Han So Ra be the class president again?

245
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,780
She's so old. Someone closer in age to us should be president now.

246
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,810
That's true.

247
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,950
Should you be the president this time, Sis?

248
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,330
Hello.

249
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,960
Yes.

250
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,480
Would you come towards the front gate?

251
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,030
All right.

252
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,290
A flower delivery service is said to be up front. Please excuse me for a moment.

253
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,800
Mr. Driver?

254
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,270
Are you here to deliver something?

255
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,300
Ta-da.

256
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,520
What is going on, Honey? I thought you said you would finish late today?

257
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,330
I finished work early and flew here because I missed you.

258
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,320
Here, congratulations.

259
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,460
I should have seen your show, it's a shame that I missed it.

260
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,820
Aside from the show,

261
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:36,040

Liyan has progressed quite well in that time.

Liyan is quite brilliant.

00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:12,430
<i>Is this a crazy bitch? If your dad doesn't sign, he will die.</i>

315
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,710
<i>Dad!</i>

316
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,880
<i>It's okay. It's okay. Don't laugh.</i>

317
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,750
<i>Quickly, come on!</i>

318
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:31,350
<i>All right. It's good. Okay.</i>

319
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,010
<i>The world knows it if you say, Han Pan Ro.</i>

320
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,310
<i>[Liyan Kindergarten]</i>

321
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,950
As a token of our appreciation, we...
<i>[Han Pan Ro]</i>

322
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,870
Prime Minister Han Pan Ro's donations were exclusively used towards building the gymnasium.

323
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,570
I see. How wonderful.

324
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:17,060
Wow, it expanded!

325
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,400
I think it'll be great for kids to run around in.

326
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,230
We built the inner wall to accommodate children's stature.

327
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,520
Wow, this is all new to me.

328
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,930
It's awesome, Brother!

329
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:33,870
Wow, this looks so fun!

330
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,220
The classrooms are designed for the comfort of our pupils

331
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,570
to receive a supreme education.

332
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,190
The pupils will come to handle every instrument present.

333
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:56,340
Our Liyan graduates are already taking home first place in the world competitions in every category.

334
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,980
Liyan Kindergarten is producing the top graduates in every category.

335
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:06,370
You are working so tirelessly for the children, maybe I should build you an equestrian center next time.

336
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,340
Gosh, thank you so much.

337
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,590
- What? You are going to donate again?
- Yeah.

338
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,440
You don't have any more grandchildren who would enroll?

339
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,160
What are you talking about? We should have more grandchildren.

340
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,270
Don't you think so, So Ra?

341
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,080
Come on, Dad.

342
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,300
Thank you so much for coming today.

343
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,990
Chairwoman, you are so passionate.

344
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,800
It's all thanks to you.

345
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,740
Brother, if the equestrian center is built here, it will be unbelievable!

346
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,640
No, I'm going to build the equestrian center next to me.

347
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,660
Da Bi, you gotta study hard and become a great person. Okay?

348
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,300
I will!

349
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,830
Da Bi, shall we go?

350
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,860
This way.

351
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,810
He created a blockbuster by writing the only political book uniquely read by the 2030 generation.

352
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:03,240
We are proud to call an alumna, the congressman Seo Eun Pyeong.

353
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,450
Yes, nice to meet you. I'm Seo Eun Pyeong.

354
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,030
Because the forward (on the book) says the man who opens the tasty restaurant for politics,

355
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:22,590
hence believing that Seo Eun Pyeong is going to introduce us to a tasty restaurant,

356
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,180
it's not the case.

357
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,980
<i>[Seo Eun Pyeong, Autumn Book Concert]</i>

358
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,920
This book honestly was written in my embarrassing times.

359
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,180
While studying for the qualifying exam, I was also a "Give up 5."
<i>(T/N: O-Po: 5 po gi = give up)</i>

360
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,010
Dating, marriage, birth, home purchase, and interpersonal relationship.

361
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,270
I gave all those up.

362
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,840
I didn't have people to meet and didn't have any money, so

363
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,220
I must have made solitary-living recipes by a thousand.

364
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:53,620
But then it became a book and the book became the funds...

365
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:58,000
But you wouldn't think it stopped at a book, do you?

366
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,510
If I get fired from politics, then I can just open a small hole in the wall restaurant and

367
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,910
charge our alums only half the price.

368
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,140
Don't you think you'd visit out of curiosity at least once?

369
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,000
Eventually, it will become a tasty restaurant by word of mouth, and eventually,

370
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,370
wouldn't I become successful once again?

371
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,350
The point of my talk today is

372
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,380
"Give up 5," you say? I was also "Give up 5".

373
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:32,690
Let's just not become a "Give up 7". The one that gives up on dreams and hopes.

374
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,770
Though I have no notion of how you are spending time and what you are doing,

375
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:43,370
the time now will come back to you as the mighty power in ten years' time,

376
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,930
just like me who is standing here.

377
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,480
Everyone, please don't give up.

378
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,280
Everyone, let's put our efforts forth.

379
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,230

No one had any news on the mother or the daughter.
