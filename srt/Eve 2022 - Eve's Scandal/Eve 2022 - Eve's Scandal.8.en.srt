She intends on staying at a hotel until the incident settles down.

So, how are you running your household exactly?

46
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,000
Is this also my fault?

47

Given the fact that you ran over here at once.

100
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,180
I drank a glass of champagne with a friend and hit that car by accident.

101
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,370
I ran because I thought it might cause much talk,

115

all the gifts we are owed are all determined already.

116
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,740
I believe I deserve to receive a gift each and every year of our marriage.

117
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:22,260
Our marriage is not happenstance or sentimentalism.

Never.

125
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,700

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,110
have another woman?

127
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,640
No.

128
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,800
Your words tell me no, but your eyes tell me otherwise.

129
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,990
I really hoped it wasn't true.

130
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,890
It was more like a prayer than a hope.

161
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:11,140
The car that fled the scene was my husband's gift, but it was stolen.

162
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,640
So I was going to catch the thief without my husband finding out, but I failed.

163
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,400
If the police were to catch the driver, everything will be resolved.

164
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,050
What? They've labeled my car as a wanted vehicle?

165

Make sure Ms. Kim Seon Bin isn't exposed.

166
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,910
Hide the vehicle and send the bodyguard overseas.

167
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,080
What is it?

168
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,360
Ms. Kim Seon Bin is yet to pick up the phone.

All right. Whatever you decide,

I trust it.

180

Didn't you say the box you gave me contains a plan?

181

There was nothing in it.

<i>I don't have any plans, Ra El.</i>

Not having any plans is my plan.

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,000
commit a deed like a monster...

188
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,700
or...

189
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,200
something even worse than that?

190
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,240
Do it all. It's all right.

191
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:53,590
Yes, Chief. Did you find the culprit?

192
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,150
Is it possible to get the driver's phone number?

193
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,490
If it is our company's employee, we will handle it within the organization.

194
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,870
She was on her way to running abroad.

Yep.

Hello, Miss. I'm asking you for the final time.

198

Whom did Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom ask you to guard?

Shit. You are getting blood on me.

200
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,560
Drag her out.

201

According to So Ra, it is a designated driver.

215
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,490
We can reveal the driver's identity.

Yes, Sir.

218
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,720
So, Kang Yoon Kyeom used me to threaten his father?

219
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,580
Haven't you figured out what he's up to?

220
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,370
Not yet. I'm still in the middle of finding out.

221

Is someone... supposed to come?

They say that the VIP is coming.

299

Did you find her finally?

300
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,720
I did find her. She was going to run away with her tail between her legs.

301
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,680
Coward bitch.

302
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,730
Who said she ran away with her tail tucked?

303
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:03,130
If one doesn't show, it is running away. It's past 12:00 p.m. It's a bust.

304

She's here.

I'm asking what you are saying.

307
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,350
I told you to release the bodyguard immediately.

308

Why do you not listen to me?

309

Madam.

321
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,630
Would it be all right to begin the parent interview session?

322
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,770
Sure.

323
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,980
Could you stand side by side, please?

324
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:25,110
Last time, you both put out an amazing performance together.

325
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,460
Are you still as close to each other as you were back then?

326
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,500
Crazy bitch.

327
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,720
Get your act together.

328
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,360
Do you want to be found out being played by me?

329
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,970
If you'll excuse me. I'll only be interviewing So Ra.

330
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,160
Bo Ram, come here. Shall I show you something funny?

331
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,870
<i>Yes, please!</i>

332
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,170
Go play.

333
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:01,760
I thought I'd lose my mind missing you.

334
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,930
How can you not keep in contact for so long?

335
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:10,230
I also missed you. A lot.

336
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,100
Let's be together.

337
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,800
I'll go to the Rose house after the party.

338
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,080
It can't be. Not anymore.

339
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:32,090
This will help your TF Team.

340
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,600
We are over.

341
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,350
What do you mean we're over?

342
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,830
Madam found out.

343
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,750
It doesn't seem possible to see you again.

344
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,460
Not see you again? That won't happen.

345
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,840
There's no way.

346
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,360
You must be out of your mind.

347
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,850
Totally crazy.

348
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,010
Daddy! Can you open this, please?

349
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,910
Okay.

350
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,130
Let's talk later.

351
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,050
I'll take my leave.

352
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,950
Hey!

353
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:45,140
I'm going to kill you. I'll tear your heart to pieces.

354
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:51,570
Feel the hellish pain. I'll make you beg for death.

355
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,940
You'd make me beg to die.

356
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:02,390
Those aren't unfamiliar words to me. But this may not be the best time for you to do so, Madam.

357
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:06,890
What I might be thinking? Why I did it?

358
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:12,870
And what will I do in the future? You've not a single inkling of any of it.

359
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,860
What would you do when you haven't even understood the issue?

360
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,630
Why will I need to understand the likes of you? I'm just going to bury you.

361
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,920
I will give you some homework.

362
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,910
How about pondering why something like this happened to me?

363
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,680
It's about time.

364
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:37,530
You've never really had to think like that before. Because you were always the perpetrator, never the victim.

365
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,190
It's a question familiar to those who suffered a big misfortune.

366
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:46,380
Why such misfortune as this has come to me?

367
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,750
The question that doesn't leave your brain.

368
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:56,190
The question that makes you die of not knowing the answers to.

369
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:03,410
Why? Why do you suppose?

370
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:23,530
When you find the answer, I can take it a wee bit easy on you.

371
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,910
Honey!

372
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,820
Shush.

373
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,760
Talk with me.

374
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,860
- Get in the car.
- Why would I get in your car?

375
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,970
Are you going to leave separately despite all the eyes watching? Get in quickly.

376
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,780
I said get in quickly. Get in if I tell you to get in.

377
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,380
Let go of me.

378
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,400
Let's talk.

379
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,420
You having an affair makes me seethe,

380
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:32,850
yet you picked the one that is least suitable. Have you any idea how degrading this is?

381
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,330
I can never forgive her.

382
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,230
- I will not sit back idly and leave her be.
- I was the one who began.

383
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:44,730
She doesn't deserve the blame. Blame me.

384
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,490
You're still worried about that bitch?

385
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:53,830
Not me?

386
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:59,720
I understand how you feel. That's why you should hate me.

387
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,060
Unbelievable.

388
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,020
And?

389
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,310
I'm sorry.

390
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,080
And!

391
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,870
And what else?

392
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,470
Tell me what you want.

393
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,130
What I want?

394
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:25,000
I want this to have never happened.

395
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,130
I'm saying it will do if you haven't had the affair!

396
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,830
Let's go home and talk.

397
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,030
Why should I? I'm going to my father's house.

398
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,450
First, head home.

399
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,200
I'm going to think about what to do at dad's house.

400
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,130
Driver Park, turn the car around.

401
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,950
Grandma!

402
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,690
Honey.

403
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,460
Honey, thank you for coming back to me.

404
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,610
I realized it desperately that

405
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:19,430
I can't live without you. Let's start again. I will do better.

406
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,600
Your secret. Can you tell me what that video I saw was about?

407
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:38,820
Okay, I'll tell you everything.

408
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,670
Vice President Kim Yi Sak. He is the bad guy.

409
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,260
That guy sold Gediks to LY.

410
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,960
It's true that I was an entry-level employee then. But I have no reason to be threatened by anyone.

411
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,270
I never saw the Gediks CEO or his daughter.

412
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,970
Don't let anyone else get involved in this problem.

413
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,010
I won't allow it.

414
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,140
If you were afraid of dad finding out, why did you touch that bitch?

415
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,970
I haven't forgiven you for what you've done.

416
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:39,880
If you cause any issue, I won't sit idly by.

417
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,010
Who is threatening who just now?

418
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,400
Don't ignore my warning.

419
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,100
Spend one night at your dad's and come home tomorrow.

420
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:39,200
He confessed that Kim Yi Sak sold off Gediks.

421
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,430
I think it can be admissible in our lawsuit.

422
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:46,590
You ignored me before, but now you want to help?

423
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:49,820
It's not that I ignored your words, Ma'am.

424
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,960
My determination to sue together hasn't changed.

425
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,800
Didn't you say you'd make Han So Ra divorce?

426
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,600
Whatever I do against Han So Ra,

427
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,070
it won't disrupt the lawsuit.

428
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,900
You sure are stubborn.

429
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,770
You think that playing with someone's feelings is as easy as cutting radishes with a knife?

430
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:13,430
As I said before clearly, I do not have feelings for Chairman Kang.

431
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:17,420
Even if I did, it isn't important.

432
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,780

433
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:36,180

434
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:44,890

435
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,370
- Chairman.
- Yes.

436
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:48,240
We have a problem.

437
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,190
In order to enter the New York market, Yoon Kyeom

438
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:54,840
established a TF Team.

439
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,870
There are many experts.

440
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,740
What about the people who were pushing for the IPO?

441
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,310
Why the TF Team?

442
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:05,240
LY currency circulation was only a decoy.

443
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,810
We were stabbed in the back.

444
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,060
That little...

445
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,410
<i>[LY Pay New York market entry celebration drone show]</i>

446
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,420
What do you mean LY Pay? Not currency circulation?

447
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,660
In the currency, both you and your in-law own shares, but

448
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:24,020
LY Pay's share 100% belongs to Yoon Kyeom.

449
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,800
So what you're saying, that he's listing it in the NY market?

450
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:33,270
If he succeeds, taking over the company with the cashflow is only a matter of time.

451
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,500
I'm sorry, Sir.

452
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,680
You may not enter.

453
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,100
How dare you?

454
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,780
Have you any idea who I am?

455
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,860
Without specific permission from Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom, he asked that we do not permit your entry into the company.

456
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,180
How dare...!

457
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:16,260
- Call Yoon Kyeom.
- Yes, Sir.

458
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,130
You will get what you deserve.

459
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,990
Yoon Kyeom, that bastard, dare fool me?

460
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:31,870
He's a nasty bastard who'd even play with his own parent.

461
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:34,390
Repulsive bastard.

462
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,880
What is it?

463
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,220
I apologize. No one can enter without Chairman Kang's permission.

464
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,590
What an unholy bastard!

465
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:54,020
My son-in-law is such a bastard. You are his father, aren't you?

466
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,740
It appears that he stabbed your back, too.

467
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,610
What a great household.

468
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:01,130
Wait! There was a video as well, wasn't there?

469
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:02,470
Shall I say, "Like father, like son?"

470
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:06,540
Watch what you say! Who do you think started this mess?

471
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,080
What nonsense! Are you trying to say it was because of me?

472
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,520
Since you are nibbling your way into the company in order to take over the shares,

473
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,870
the strife has happened, of course!

474
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,140
LY was originally mine to begin with, you thieving bastards!

475
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,670
How dare you use profanity in my presence, you lowly servant!

476
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,340
- You're a parasite!
- What?

477
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,130
The kind that kisses conglomerate's asses, a political parasite!

478
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,100
You little...

479
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,550
Watch your mouth, please.

480
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:33,420
What impertinent bastard!

481
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,420
How the hel...

482

Fuck.

You bastard, you still—

What...?

486
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,790
- Let go!
- Come on!

487
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:48,730
You have to suck it up.

488
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:49,710
Let go of me now.

<i>I was holding back, trying to let it go.</i>

LY is originally mine, you unholy bastard!

549
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,780
Where are you going?

550
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,090
I need to go somewhere real quick.

551
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,930
So Ra, that bitch.

552
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:04,650
She can't even keep track of her husband's whereabouts?

553
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,900
What must have she been up to for me to have been humiliated like this?

554
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,310
Hurry and find her.

555
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,850
Yes, Sir.

556
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:21,320
<i>So Ra, I tried to calm your father but it's not working. He's headed your way.</i>

I'm in front. I'm going crazy...

558
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,560
because I miss you. Just for a moment...

559
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:06,560
I'll see you... for just a second.

560
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:12,790
I can't. Think of your wife.

561
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,730
I know.

562
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:20,210
But on a day like today, the only person I'm thinking about is you. Please let me see you for a second.

563
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,750
<i>Please.</i>

564
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,460
It's over between us.

565

Chairman Kang.

566
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:06,680
How could you show your face here? Bo Ram's dad knows about you two.

567
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,240
Don't cause any more trouble. If you don't listen to my warning,

568
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,690
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

569
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,920
Go home.

570
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,230
I can be by myself.

571
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,990
Lay down. I'm okay.

572
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,740
You seem like a good person.

573
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:04,610
Can you tell me where the Chairman and the TF Team are celebrating?

You think being a chairman makes everything okay?

Calm down, General Manager Jang.

Who are you to tell me to calm down?

- Please don't be like this.
- Honey.

Why are you holding me back? You should be holding him back!

Don't touch her.

Who's the one that should be saying that?

She's my wife.

As long as you're acting like this, I can't let you near her.

It's over for you. If word gets out about this, it's over for you!

616
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:47,130
The only reason you can yell like this is that you're her husband legally.

617
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:51,790
- Does that mean we should take care of things legally?
- What?

618
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,680
Are you trying to say you'll have us divorced?

You are, too.

<i>After having gone through all the moments, will it start to boil over.</i>

<i>And from liquid to gas,</i>

635
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:06,000

01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,660
<i>you lose your sanity</i>

640
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,930
<i>and do things you shouldn't do.</i>

641
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:30,080
♫ <i>Promised not to let you down</i> ♫

642
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,570
Stop!

643
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:37,150
- No! <i> - Lee Ra El.</i>

644
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:39,880
She probably won't stop with getting Han So Ra a divorce.

645
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:44,880
Tell Chairman Kang that Ra El is the daughter of Lee Tae Joon.

646
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,630
As soon as you can.

647
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:51,480
<i>You reach the threshold and do things you shouldn't do...</i>

648
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,060
<i>How are you trying to use that to your advantage?</i>

649
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:58,460
<i>It's an opportunity to</i>

650
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:05,170
<i>change the destiny that was determined by God.</i>

651
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:09,270
♫ <i>Just feel me lose my mind</i> ♫

652

658
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:45,530
<i>What is the reason you called me here?</i>

659
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:47,140
<i>Honey.</i>

660
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:50,010
<i>You put in a lot of effort.</i>

661
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,900
<i>What is the reason Han So Ra hates me so much?</i>

662
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,510
<i>Psychopath.</i>

663
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,250
<i>I can't leave you alone, can I?</i>

664
01:06:57,250 --> 01:07:00,730
<i>Sounds like a thrill.</i>

665
