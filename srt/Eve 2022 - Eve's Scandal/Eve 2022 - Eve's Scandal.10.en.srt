00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:42,300
Han So Ra, you'll never think about the reason why.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,130
Then, that would make me a crazy psycho.

that I'm unpredictable?

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,680
I will make sure to turn your life completely upside down.

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,610
You'll try to stop me, but I'll get past you.

15
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,740
I wonder which one of us will win?

16
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,630
Has his location stayed the same?

17
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,740
And Secretary Cha?

18
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,320

I'm looking for a place for us to stay together.

21
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,080
Seoul, Namhae, Jeju... There are houses and apartments.

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,380
If you have a preference of where and what, let me know.

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,140
I'll issue a change of position to another location for your husband.

24
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,990
Once he ends his relationship with you, I'll compensate him well.

25
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,170
If not, things will go wrong.

26
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,140
You can keep Bo Ram with you, or send her with your husband.

27
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,100
You do whatever you want. I'll support you no matter what.

28
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,460
My wife is taking it well, too.

29
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,050
So let's take care of things one at a time.

30
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:59,860
By the way, is your wife involved in business management?

31
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,930
It's something that she's wanted to do for a while. I gave her permission as a means to calm her down.

32
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,020
Let's be careful with our relationship for the time being.

33
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,380
I'm sorry we're always meeting in secret.

34
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,120
Where are you going?

35
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,460
I have some things to tend to at the school.

36
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,720
I've requested a meeting with the principal.

37
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,410
- So you're leaving now?
- It just occurred to me.

38
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,880
It was hard setting aside time like this.

39
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,300
I wanted to be with you alone.

40
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,830
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,280
I was going crazy because I wanted to hug you so badly.

42
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,830
Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?

43
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,980
I'm late.

44
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,300
Make time for another day.

45
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,330
I'll make sure to set aside a longer period of time.

46
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,830
- Han So Ra?
- What is it?

47
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,340
Oh, I'm from "Tomorrow's Economy."

48
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,950
Is it correct that the fight between the in-laws was due to stake holds?

49
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,980
I also heard that the CEO of the shopping mall is going to change. Can you give us a hint as to who it is?

50
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,460
- I'm sorry.
- Ms. Han?

51
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,740
Whether the fighting was about stakes or not, what does it matter to them?

52
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,910
Is it their money?

53
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,060
Fight between in-laws or not. Because they keep prying into this, it's hurting my dad's pride even more!

54
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,990
It's a good thing that there is interest in the CEO of the shopping mall.

55
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,750
Chairman was able to drive out the older candidates to seat you there.

56
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,440
Any woman would be jealous of that.

57
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,840
Please disregard Kim Seon Bin.

58
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,430
Once you get involved with the company with the chairman, your class will be incomparable.

59
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,960
Tell the PR team that I will be the one to reveal who the CEO is.

60
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,080
- Tell them to stay quiet until then.
- Yes.

61
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,270
- Call Jang Jin Wook.
- Yes, Ma'am.

62
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,390
If you would take care of things, then I would be grateful.

63
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,290
I was so suffocated and angry all alone.

64
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,680
I've met with a lawyer, but the opposing person is the chairman.

65
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,320
Ms. Han, you'll stop your husband. Right?

66
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,260
I really have no one to trust but you.

67
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,760
Manager Jang.

68
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,440
Yes, Ma'am.

69
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,440
- You think I called you so that we can team up?
- Huh?

70
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,920
You can't control your own wife?

71
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,220
Idiotic bastard.

72
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,210
And you call yourself a man.

73
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:08,730
Choose. Quit or get fired.

74
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:19,000
This is an insider transaction table from 13 years ago, when Gediks Semiconductors was being sold.

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,980
You, Jang Jin Wook, lead efforts to decline the company's value and failed projects as a development employer.

76
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,630
This...

77
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,210
This applies to anyone that had worked for Gediks though!

78
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,270
If everyone was involved, does that mean something illegal is no longer illegal?

79
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,950
A developer who lied about a developing project.

80
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:40,080
If people find out about this, you would not be able to set foot anywhere in this industry.

81
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,600
- Ms. Han.
- Wrap up things here,

82
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,730
and take your family out of the country.

83
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,900
You have exactly ten days.

84
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,700
Ms. Han!

85
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,410
Please leave.

86
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,590
You want to move us to the States?

87
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:11,420
This is so abrupt. What are you talking about?

88
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,310
Might as well.

89
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,940
My mom has been asking us to join her in the States for a while now.

90
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,960
And I've thought about it,

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,950
but even with my wife's issues, it would all be taken care of if we go to the States.

92
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,870
- But still...
- I know this comes to you as a surprise.

93
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,430
But... I think this will be the best for us.

94
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,170
It doesn't sound like a bad plan, considering Bo Ram.

95
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,370
We can start new beginnings in a new place.

96
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,650
Look into it.

97
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,460
It won't be too hard since my mother is there.

98
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't worry too much. I'll be sure to take care of you.

99
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,100
Mom, are you available to talk?

100
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,080
I have no words to say.

101
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,600
Once the lawsuit starts, Han Pan Ro, Kim Jeong Cheol,

102
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,860
and our identities will all be revealed.

103
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,810
His not being here might be an advantage to us.

104
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,310
Don't you think so?

105
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,870
Till I find a time to end things properly,

106
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,230
let's buy some time.

107
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,110
<i>Manager Jang Jin Wook just put in his notice.</i>

108
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,070
The reason is that he is immigrating with his family to the States.

109
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,510
What?

110
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,410
<i>[Letter of Resignation]</i>

111
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,520
Bo Ram, you haven't been able to play with Da Bi for a while, right?

112
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,540
There's a tablet in the break room. Make a video call with her and invite her to your birthday.

113
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,270
I'd love that Mom!

116
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,620
Why don't you pick up your calls?

117
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,960
I had some things to take care of at the school.

118
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,480
Is it true that you're going to the States with your husband?

119
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,490
I'm thinking about it.

120
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,210
We need to talk. Now or later, when is it best for you?

121
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,000
Let me think about it, and I'll contact you.

122
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,320
What you just said... Are you saying you really might go to the States?

123
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,480
I told you.

124
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,680
I'm in the process of organizing my thoughts.

125
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,480
- Wait.
- Until when?!

126
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,070
Why are you acting unlike you, Chairman?

127
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:27,350
Weren't we in a relationship that allowed us to be strangers when we felt like it?

128
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,280
Wait until I feel like seeing you again.

129
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,120
Tell me the reason why you're suddenly acting like this.

130
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:56,560
Did you think everything would go your way?

131
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,420
I will contact you.

132
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,130
<i>Kang Yoon Kyeom has already given me his heart.</i>

133
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,850
<i>It means that I can cruelly ruin him.</i>

134

The president will be awarding the certificate of appointment.

135
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,760
Certificate, Seo Eun Pyeong.

136

He is on a roll!

144
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,710
I wonder what he's after?

145
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,710

- Or the prosecutor?
- What are you talking about?

Whichever way we use is all up to your decision.

We have an overwhelming amount of information on them.

You know Da Bi's friend Bo Ram's mom?

155

What is it? Is something the matter?

158
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,300
Ah, you know the woman that So Ra liked?

159
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,240
You know her, too. The one that could Tango amazingly well.

160
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:33,660
Apparently, that woman requested something from the Department of Education... I wonder what it is.

161
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,270
Ah, I'm sure it's probably no big deal. I'll look into it.

162
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:43,200
Brother, this supplement is amazing for the knees, too.

163
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,910
What did you say?!

164
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,490
The one Yoon Kyeom had an affair with is that woman?!

165
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,630
Wow, that punk...

166
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,060
Screwing around with a daughter's friend's mom?!

167
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,040
Freakin ballsy, that bastard!

168
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,170
Lower your voice, please.

169
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,190
If Dad finds out, I'll be left holding the bag for leaving a fish with a cat.

170
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:12,210
I barely scored the chairman of the mall position with the affair as the excuse, I don't want to be found out.

171
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,050
Ah... that's why Director Jang put in his notice.

172
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,780
I'm sending her to the States.

173
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,660
Look at this punk.

174
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:24,430
I'm going to announce that I am the chairman when we open the Giovanni & CL opening.

175
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,740
If I handle it properly, Dad will quiet down and

176
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,000
I imagine I will forget about that bitch when I get busy.

177
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,270
Are you satisfied with the store?

178
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,590
How do you feel about the store?

179
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,150
Incredible! What a ravishing store? Congratulations!

180
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,340
He says that it is an amazing and upscale store, and that he likes it.

181
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,200
Thank you.

182
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,080
<i>CL has finally penetrated into the market of department stores.</i>

183
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,810
CL has finally penetrated into the market of department stores.

184
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,130
<i>The business partner that helped CL make a decision to enter a store is LY Group.</i>

185
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,280
The business partner that helped CL make a decision to enter a store is LY Group.

186
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:33,810
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, the president of the LY group Yoon Kyeom Kang.</i>

187
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,060
The main character of today is actually not me.

188
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,690
It is LY shopping mall CEO Han So Ra, who put a lot of effort into the inducement of CL.

189
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,840
Han So Ra really snatched the shopping mall, eh?

190
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,750
She successfully stole from her brother-in-law.

191
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,280
I have been referred to as "my wife" all along.

192
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,810
So when he refers to me as the CEO of LY Shopping Mall, it makes me feel a bit embarrassed.

193
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,950
Hence, I don't have any specially prepared speech.

194
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,750
Everyone, please continue shopping here only til today,

195
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,660
and use LY Shopping Mall for your shopping needs going forward.

196
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,310
Thank you.

197
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,810
That bitch appeared. Who invited her? Was it Giovanni?

198
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,040
She is not here. No one without an invitation can enter, Madam.

199
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,500
You must be mistaken, Madam. You might be overwrought.

200
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,650
I saw her, I tell you.

201
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,050
<i>By the way, being a psycho... doesn't that mean that one doesn't know what she would do?</i>

202
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,730
How dare you come here?

203
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,420
I can't even congratulate you when we were close in the past?

204
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,700
You are fabulous, Madam.

205
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,150
What to do? It's bleeding.

206
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,410
Why not tattle on me to your daddy?

207
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:27,690
By the way, why don't you tell your daddy about me? Shall I do it for you?

208
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,200
Stop there.

209
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,090
Stop right there!

210
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,640
<i>What's wrong?</i>

211
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,960
You brought her here?

212
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,100
Did you really?

213
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,450
What are you talking about?

214
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,530
That bitch is here right now!

215
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,930
You two met, didn't you? Did you bring her here for a date?

216
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,160
That must be it.

217
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,750
Why are you being like this?

218
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,050
She's not here, I mean it!

219
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:16,170
She was at the shop just now and I talked to her, but you're still going to tell me she's not here?

220
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,830
Why don't you just cut off my nose while my eyes are open? (Lie in clear sight.)

221
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,190
What about it?

222
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,580
She brought flowers.

223
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,090
Do you need to watch the cameras?

224
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,810
<i>That bitch is roaming all over the place since we let her on your behalf.</i>

225
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:35,190
<i>I should have had her kneel down in front of me!</i>

226
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,330
<i>No, I'm the idiot.</i>

227
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,770
<i>I was stupid for thinking that getting her kicked out of the school and sending her to the States would solve everything.</i>

228
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,240
<i>Bring her here now and make her kneel!</i>

229
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,840
<i>Please stop!</i>

230
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,940
Was Chairman Kang having an affair?

231
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,260
That's crazy. What kind of woman was she?

232
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,480
- That is crazy.
- Really.

233
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,760
What's wrong? Did something happen?

234
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:28,620
Your conversation just now was being blasted through the speakers.

235
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,500
<i>- Welcome!
- Welcome!</i>

236
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,070
<i>Congratulations!</i>

237
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,630
Get lost.

238
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,580
Leave!

239
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:23,400
Rumors are going around that you've been having an affair.

240
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,270
We need to stop it.

241
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,070
Do something!

242
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,540
How could that be stopped?

243
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,160
So you won't even try?

244
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,800
Where are you going?

245
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,200
<i>How dare you come here?</i>

246
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,560
<i>I can't even congratulate you when we were close in the past?</i>

247
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,850
<i>You are fabulous, Madam.</i>

248
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,220
It was her.

249
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,550
The one that put a mic into my purse and broadcasted it to the entire store was that bitch.

250
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,400
Stop it.

251
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,250
What should I stop?

252
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,900
You don't know how psychotic she is!

253
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,030
Lurking, skulking, and disappearing...

254
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,860
She's mentally ill!

255
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,320
I'm telling you to please stop!

256
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,720
Why are you yelling at me?

257
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,460
She's the one who told me that you were having an affair. Did you know that?

258
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,440
She was the first one to tell me that you had another woman.

259
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,510
And she was the one who told me she slept with you!

260
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:22,470
She's playing us!

261
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,110
Are you crazy?

262
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,360
Let go!

263
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,660
Da Bi!

264
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,560
Why are you crying? It's me. Don't cry.

265
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,840
Da Bi, you were startled, weren't you?

266
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,720
Come here, my baby.

267
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,780
Da Bi, it's okay. Don't cry. I'm sorry.

268
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,880
She announced in front of my brother-in-law that she was the owner of the shopping mall.

269
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,670
Yoon Kyeom, that bastard is immoral. His father-in-law hits you

270
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:33,130
and his wife is a crazy lunatic. Do we really leave that kind of bastard alone, Father?!

271
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,800
Snatching the mall away from my husband is equivalent to asking him to die.

272
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,780
How do I live on now, Father?

273
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,770
How can I face the world after being taken by my younger brother's wife?

274
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,600
Chairman, Madam Seo who is hospitalized...

275
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,830
is in critical condition. The chief of the hospital sent a message.

276
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,600
Ms. Han, I'm here.

277
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,370
Ms. Han!

278
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,480
Are you okay?

279
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,010
I'll bring the first aid kit.

280
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:41,720
<i>I see why... you seek the chairman's love so much.</i>

281
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,140
<i>Your birthday was our first day.</i>

282
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,000
<i>He's not a man I'd want to lose, that chairman.</i>

283
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,970
<i>You're crazy. Definitely crazy.</i>

284
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,590
<i>It's bleeding. Why not tattle on me to your daddy?</i>

285
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,830
<i>By the way, why don't you tell your daddy about me? Shall I do it for you?</i>

286
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:12,560
Please... from inside my head...

287
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:19,230
I want to get rid of the thought of that bitch!

288
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,450
I'm Han So Ra.

289
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,660
Han So Ra.

290
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,960
But I'm Han So Ra!

291
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,450
Who is she to...

292
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,760
Who the hell is she to me!

293
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,610
You know, as for me,

294
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,580
no matter what happens,

295
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,040
I will never go back under my father's control.

296
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:09,910
The "classroom" is hell...

297
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,680
<i>So Ra...</i>

298
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,330
I'm going to save my marriage no matter what...

299
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,930
and I'm going to live well.

300
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,360
Were you really the one who told everything to my wife?

301
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,330
Was it also you who broadcasted my disgrace into the store?

302
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,300
Disgrace?

303
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,160
Am I your disgrace?

304
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,300
You know very well that's not what I mean!

305
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,530
It is. You don't like the idea of me becoming known and are embarrassed.

306
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:39,610
You wanted to hide me far away and see me only when you felt like it.

307
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,880
I had another reason for hiding you. I did my best to be with you.

308
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
I even committed an unbelievable act.

309
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,810
What more? What more do I need to do?

310
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,120
Ah, is that your best?

311
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,350
Taking me as the second woman?

312
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,380
I have zero interest in being the second anything,

313
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,070
so if that's all you have to offer, leave me.

314
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,500
- Watch your mouth.
- Why should I?

315
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,190
Does horror become romance if I change the word?

316
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,790
Woopdidoo, a conglomerate is not a big deal.

317
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,210
Do you think having some money puts you in the selected-by-god category?

318
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:13,330
Whose money is it anyway? Where did you nab them from?

319
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,990
Is a home a gratuity for sex?

320
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,580
The one who enjoyed the sex was me. So I should be the one to pay for service.

321
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,790
Don't go any further and make me explode.

322
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,480
When you were meeting me in secret... It was fun, no?

323
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,920
A man who walks on eggshells around his wife has no charm.

324
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,320
Do you think you can see me again after committing this kind of treachery?

325
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,210
I'm sure it won't do. When you get mad, you sever your relations with your biological parents.

326
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,780
I didn't meet you for this horrid outcome.

327
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,680
Was I the one who caused this situation?

328
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,740
That's right. We all have our own burdens.

329
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,180
I think I must have forced the issue.

330
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,880
Let us...

331
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,760
never see each other again.

332
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,620
Chairman...

333
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,710
I am sorry.

334
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:24,800
You saw, didn't you? The one who decides whether we see each other or not... is me.

335
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,560
Wait and see what I decide.

336
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,000
Go now.

337
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,090
<i>[Ra El]</i>

338
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,720
<i>You are the one that is more important than myself.</i>

339
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,160
<i>I love you.</i>

340
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,680
<i>[Prime Minister Han Pan Ro]</i>

341
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,710
Yes, Prime Minister. I was about to call you.

342
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,000
There are a lot of rumors about the conflict between the two households.

343
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,100
Yes. I was about to ask for your help regarding this issue, Chief Seo.

344
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,510
I'm planning on teaching them a lesson. If the carrot doesn't work, isn't it a turn for the stick?

345
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:47,150
<i>If you promise not to touch Seon Bin, I will grant you anything you wish. Just don't hurt her.</i>

346
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,940
<i>Why should I?</i>

347
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,170
<i>So what exactly would you do to Seon Bin?</i>

348
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,440
I'm just going to tell Daddy. I don't know what comes after that.

349
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,820
You can never do that. If you do, Seon Bin will get hurt.

350
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,470
<i>Did you tell your father about Seon Bin? Did you?!</i>

351
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,170
You tell her to come and kneel in front of me.

352
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,970
Ask me.

353
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,470
<i>Not to Seon Bin. To me!</i>

354
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,610
<i>I'm going to play a round of golf with Dad. What? I can't?</i>

355
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:27,050
<i>Fine. You take the shopping mall. Take it all.</i>

356
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,650
<i>You can't give me the CEO position?</i>

357
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,660
That's all I am to you, huh?

358
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,660
I have to take it up with my dad.

359
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,510
All right.

360
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:43,560
Leave Seon Bin alone. I will give you the CEO position.

361
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,450
<i>There's another reason why I hid you. I did my best to be with you.</i>

362
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:58,380
<i>I committed an unbelievable act. What more? What more do I need to do?!</i>

363
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:14,500
<i>[Attorney Seo Eun Pyeong: I have information for you regarding Chairman Kang. Let's meet.]</i>

364
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,380
I'm sorry about that day. I was overly emotional.

365
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,490
Today, I came because I had something to tell you.

366
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:58,980
Former Prime Minister Han Pan Ro can blackmail you with the slush fund.

367
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,130
The objective is to obtain shares.

368
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,050
How did you find that out?

369
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,210
Chief of Staff Seo Eun Pyeong told me.

370
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,310
Why would Chief Seo do that?

371
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,350
Because he is aware of my concerns for you.

372
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:22,110
Has it been decided that you would relocate to the States with Director Jang? Then, what will become of us?

373
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,040
Or you haven't decided yet.

374
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,930
We decided.

375
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,860
<i>[Secretary Cha]</i>

376
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,680
What is it?

377
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,120
<i>Madam Seol is in critical condition, they say.</i>

378
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,860
<i>Wife of the LY Group's head, Seol Gyeong Ok, who has been hospitalized for nearly 8 years,</i>

379
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,650
<i>is said to be in critical condition with pneumonia from a second infection.</i>

380
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,170
<i>Despite being attached to an ECMO machine, an artificial breathing device...</i>

381
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,240
<i>Chairman went to visit his filial home.</i>

382
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,370
He went to his filial home? Without me?

383
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,190
I confirmed it through Secretary Cha.

384
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,330
He should have taken me along with him if he was planning on going!

385
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,970
Why would you go alone? You should have taken me with you.

386
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,470
<i>What does your father and brother say? Does it seem appropriate for me to go?</i>

387
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,140
Don't come. We are in the middle of discussions with the family.

388
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,730
Then what about my dad? He should go.

389
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,880
<i>Then I'll come with my daddy.</i>

390
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,990
It'll be better than to go alone and get framed for it all.

391
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,200
<i>I will call you again.</i>

392
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,540
<i>Although it hasn't been smooth sailing to this point,</i>

393
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,940
<i>you can't know for sure what else might happen in the future.</i>

394
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,970
<i>When you are truly facing danger,</i>

395
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,450
<i>the only ones who can lend you a hand are blood kin.</i>

396
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:05,460
<i>Even if that blood kin is only half related.</i>

397
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,570
<i>I know that your pain is great.</i>

398
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:24,180
<i>You would do anything to heal, even if that meant believing in the myth of the bandoneon.</i>

399
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:32,210
<i>In the end, even this may become one of the processes of healing.</i>

400
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,290
<i>Please go with the future far away in mind.</i>

401
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,660
This is the first time I see you drink alcohol. Shall I bring you a drink with lower alcohol content?

402
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,220
Where is it? I'll bring it.

403
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,400
No need. Stay.

404
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:21,220
I think Chairman Kang also knows about Han So Ra's murder.

405
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:27,280
He was worried that I could be hurt should Han Pan Ro finds out about my presence.

406
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:32,100
That would mean that Han So Ra, Han Pan Ro, Kim Jeong Cheol...

407
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,290
all of them have participated in murder.

408
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:41,620
The time has come to face Han Pan Ro and Kim Jeong Cheol as Chairman Kang's woman.

409
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,130
Ra El, when they find out about you...

410
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:50,350
Lee Ra El already died thirteen years ago.

411
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:54,300
Even if they were to find out, I do not fear them at all.

412
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,970
To the deed done to me,

413
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:04,230
more cold and wickedly,

414
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,850
I will pay them back.

415
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,220
You told me I should feel pressured to survive.

416
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:45,840
I, like others, have warm blood in my veins

417
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,880
and my heart beats.

418
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,500
Unfortunately, there's nothing I can put in it.

419
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:01,140
I don't want to feel any remorse of conscience towards you.

420
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,520
So no matter what happens to me,

421
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,880
I hope you also don't feel any remorse.

422
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:17,200
No matter how much you say you have become a different person,

423
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,110
I can still see through to your agony.

424
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:24,370
If you think this would make me change my mind, you've miscalculated.

425
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,580
I'll wait for you until the heat returns to your heart.

426
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:32,170
The one who'll remain next to you until the end is me anyway.

427
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,290
<i>LY Group's Cheong Ok Ju's wife and Hyun Yeok Produce's eldest daughter,</i>

428
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,790
<i>Madam Seol Gyeong Ok passed away.</i>

429
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,430
<i>Madam Seol Gyeong Ok...</i>

430
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:50,560
<i>These punks would let the daughter-in-law find out about the passing of the mother-in-law via news?</i>

431
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,860
Let's just go, Daddy. If we don't go, we would be giving them a reason.

432
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,210
Wouldn't they say we didn't show at the funeral due to shares?

433
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,970
Then it becomes our fault.

434
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,450
Let's go.

435
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:13,590
We will go, but let's take District Attorney An Gong Pil and all the prosecutors under him to accompany us.

436
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,950
Isn't that the prosecutor who was specially appointed to handle the LY slush fund?

437
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:20,040
We have to use that level of power in the background so that they will be intimidated.

438
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,690
Father!

439
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,920
Isn't that the District Attorney An Gong Pil?

440
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,120
Father-in-law...

441
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:41,110
Mother-in-law especially cared for me...

442
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:44,080
and loved me...

443
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,490
My heart is breaking so much to part with her like this, Father-in-law...

444
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,130
Mother-in-law...

445
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,450
What a show.

446
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,130
Gosh, are you pretending to be filial?

447
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,450
Why not apply to becoming an actress? It's not too late.

448
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,000
Brother-in-law. Sister-in-law.

449
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,140
We are gathered to send off Mother-in-law in a restful manner, no?

450
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,170
We should cooperate among the family.

451
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,170
Tell her to forget it.

452
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:24,320
Let us go care for Da Bi.

453
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,040
Hey, Da Bi...

454
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,700
<i>I'm here Aunt!</i>

455
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:43,920
<i>Ma'am!</i>

456
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,110
<i>Thank you for coming, Chief Seo.</i>

457
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,510
<i>Thank you.</i>

458
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,300
<i>We pray for Madam Seol's soul to rest in peace.</i>

459
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:06,370
<i>Chief of Staff Seo, thank you for coming by.</i>

460
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,180
<i>This is a younger sister who I count as family.</i>

461
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,760
<i>She is here on her connection to Chairman Kang's daughter.</i>

462
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,590
<i>How deep must be your grief to such sudden news?</i>

463
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,740
<i>My heartfelt condolences to you, Sir.</i>

464
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:56,670
<i>Honey, Honey! That time at the luxury goods store,</i>

465
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:02,240
<i>that fight between your brother and his wife over your brother's affairs. Doesn't it seem that it's that woman?</i>

466
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,340
<i>You think so too, don't you?</i>

467
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,000
<i>She was suspicious at the CL store during the event.</i>

468
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,260
<i>Yoon Kyeom, that bastard. Aims high, eh?</i>

469
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,280
<i>Crazy bastard.</i>

470
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:22,960
What? Are you pissed?

471
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,660
The one who's 100 times more pissed than you

472
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,440
is me.

473
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,680
It sounds like you let that woman in, despite knowing all about it.

474
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,710
I will bring Da Bi.

475
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,810
Why don't you get lost immediately!

476
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:21,000
How dare you to come here? Get lost immediately!

477
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:36,770
Da Bi, it's okay.

478
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,090
Da Bi, don't cry.

479
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,090
What the hell are you doing?

480
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:46,720
Whose side are you on?

481
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,090
What is it?

482
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,170
I asked you what is it?

483
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,560
I will talk to you in private, Sir.

484
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,640
Honey.

485
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,740
Answer me. I'm asking a question.

486
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:10,640
<i>By the way, why don't you tell your daddy about me? </i>

487
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,980
<i>Shall I do it for you?</i>

488
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,620
I believe the chief mourner is waiting.

489
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,640
Please head over.

490
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,680
Are you crazy? Shut up.

491
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,080
I wasn't about to tell him that story...

492
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,520
I guess your daughter is keeping a lot of secrets from you.

493
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,410
What secret?

494
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,060
Does that thing want to die or something?

495
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,760
Seon Bin,

496
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,880
let's go. I have other schedules.

497
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,520
I'll take my leave.

498
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,960
<i>[LY Victim class action suit inauguration ceremony]</i>

499
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,440
The representative of LY's victim class action suit,

500
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,990
Dr. Jang Moon Hee has arrived.

501
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:13,140
<i>[LY Victim class action suit inauguration ceremony]</i>

502
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,420
My name is Jang Moon Hee.

503
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:21,420
To the patience of the 31 litigants who have waited through a long prep time,

504
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:26,090
and to the bravery of the legal team of Eunseo, I express my deep respect.

505
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:30,280
In addition, I'd like to thank you for abiding by the clause that demands keeping the secret.

506
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:36,040
From this moment on, I will be at the forefront.

507
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,620
<i>You bastard.</i>

508
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:51,160
<i>Was a woman the reason you acted crazy?</i>

509
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,110
<i>Were you unable to tell Heaven and Earth apart because of a woman?</i>

510
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:00,140
<i>Find the identity of the bitch this bastard had an affair with.</i>

511
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,720
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

512
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,750
<i>[Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom]</i>

513
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,570
Pick it up.

514
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:32,840
<i>[Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom]</i>

515
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,550
<i>You said you have decided, right?</i>

516
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:50,640
Would I be able to hear the answer I missed then?

517
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:56,620
No matter how cold you act towards me, I know there was sincerity

518
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,250
<i>behind your act of sending me to the funeral.</i>

519
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:06,030
I'd like to know what you really want.

520
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:15,110
I don't want to be the hidden woman.

521
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:19,490
Not Han So Ra,

522
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,130
but I'd like to be your woman.

523
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:04,980
<i>The only childhood memories I have, consisted of beatings without reason</i>

524
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,290
<i>and the fear that I must survive at all costs.</i>

525
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,010
<i>Father, Brother, and I are walking on thin ice.</i>

526
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,610
<i>I don't know how Father-in-law will behave.</i>

527
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:26,980
<i>We have to be methodical.</i>

528
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:31,880
<i>Even in the presence of your mother's last moment, does the issue regarding shares take priority?</i>

529
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,070
<i>I don't have the feeling that she's my mother.</i>

530
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:40,790
<i>Not a single drop of her blood runs in my veins, and she was cold to the point of being scary.</i>

531
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:44,950
Mother.

532
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,840
Mother.

533
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:52,490
<i>They all had a reason to hate me, individually.</i>

534
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,780
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

535
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,710
<i>Kneel!</i>

536
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:01,720
<i>Your mother is a commoner and you are commoner.</i>

537
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,120
<i>Would your kid be any different?</i>

538
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,980
<i>I only have taken you in to support Chi Kyeom who is ailing and lacks ability.</i>

539
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,190
<i>I never took you in to consume your older brother!</i>

540
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:15,030
<i>You said you will be a king.</i>

541
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:17,920
<i>You have already earned what you needed to.</i>

542
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:24,920
<i>This also may be a part of the healing process.</i>

543
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,830
Living as a businessman's family

544
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:45,840
isn't an easy thing.

545
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,490
There are many hardships.

546
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:53,030
Still, you must not forget that we are family.

547
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:57,810
Comfort each other for the loss of a mother,

548
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:01,670
use this as the catalyst to mature.

549
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,120
Honey.

550
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,760
Shall we talk?

551
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:39,930
What meaning would living like this have?

552
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,520
What do you mean?

553
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,660
I lived while accomplishing the tasks I had to complete.

554
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:51,460
Since your father came to know about Seon Bin and my relationship,

555
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,680
I guess there will be another task to complete tomorrow.

556
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,330
Honey...

557
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:05,420
I am tired.

558
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,330
I want to stop doing the work I'm supposed to do.

559
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:15,010
I'd like to live while doing what I'd like to do.

560
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,030
What do you mean?

561
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:29,520
No, I rather not hear. You're just tired.

562
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,260
You are not in your right mind after the passing of your mother.

563
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,470
Get some rest.

564
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:35,950
Your head will clear up with some sleep.

565
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:40,640
This is the clearest moment in my life.

566
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,040
Let's split up.

567
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,150
Let's not live together anymore.

568
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,270
<i>- Never mind.
- Should we take a picture?</i>

569
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:26,230
<i>One, two, three!</i>

570
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,260
<i>Yay!</i>

571
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,050
<i>- Thank you!
- Ra El, happy birthday!</i>

572
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:35,860
<i>Now, ta-da!</i>

573
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,880
<i>A gift.</i>

574
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,620
<i>It's so pretty, Mom.</i>

575
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,210
<i>We should update the family photo every year.</i>

576
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,120
<i>Very cool!</i>

577
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:00,490
<i>Gosh, I'm totally happy. I wish every day was a birthday.</i>

578
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,500
<i>No matter how many days we discuss, my decision won't change.</i>

579
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,710
Let's divorce.
