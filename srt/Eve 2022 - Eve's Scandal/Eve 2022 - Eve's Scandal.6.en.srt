Digging around, throwing fits, cursing. What do I need to do for you to stop?

I called him because I was worried about you.

72

73
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,540
Did you put the GPS in the car because you were worried as well?

74
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,010
What GPS? I don't know what you're talking about.

75
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:59,390
Secretary Cha, who told you to put the GPS on my car?

There's only one person in this house that can give an order like that.

Get out.

79
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,810
How is that important?

80
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,950
If you love your husband, you can do something like that.

81
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,090
Then what is important? Your birthday?

82
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,910

You want me to act like one of your employees.

90

needed a place to rest.

91
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,150
Then you can rest.

92
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,260

Why are you in the guest room? For what?

96
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,450
I don't want to sleep in the same bed as you. Let's sleep separately.

The bride was so pretty.

105

You must be tired from the long drive. What about breakfast?

106
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,930
I ate at a rest stop.

Honey, you're home?

108
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,640
Honey, there was a package in front of the house.

109

Sorry, Honey. I'm sorry, Mother-in-law. I think the package was sent by mistake.

114
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,610
I'm going to make a quick call.

118
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,830
Take a look at this person.

119
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,290
This one is nice. He doesn't talk or create accidents.

- On Han So Ra's birthday, of all days?
- That's wild!

130
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,050
Is that why she hasn't been showing her face lately?

131
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,480
She must be embarrassed.

132
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,430
She must have lost it after being stood up by us and her husband staying out all night.

<i>I think you need to head home.</i>

163
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,040
What's going on?

164
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,740
Are you hurt?

165
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,810
Chairman is home. Da Bi, your dad is home.

166
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,240
Da Bi! Are you okay?

167
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,550
Dad!

168
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,190
Honey.

169
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,740
What the heck is this?

170
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:39,590
<i> It's insanely spontaneous. It blurs your consciousness. </i>

171
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:44,170
<i> And with formidable destructive power, it paralyzes your rationality. </i>

172
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,750
<i> You can't hide the love. </i>

173
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,630
Da Bi, are you okay? Are you hurt?

174
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,370
Da Bi, go to your room!

175
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,080
Da Bi, don't move, you'll get hurt. What do you think you're doing!

176
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,820
Did you just yell at me?

177
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,880
And in front of your employee's wife?

178
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,680
Da Bi, don't cry.

179
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't cry.

180
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,070
So Ra, you'll get hurt from the broken glass pieces.

181
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,010
Why don't you stay in your room? For your safety?

182
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:57,260
Did you see the way he yelled at me? The way he looked at me?

183
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,130
I wasn't able to see clearly.

184
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,880
It's Valerian root tea. Please have a sip.

185
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,130
It will help you calm down.

186
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,770
This is a catastrophe. I think everybody got blinded by something.

187
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,790
How else could he have acted out like that?

188
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,020
I won't let this go.

189
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,990
I won't let go of all those people who messed up my birthday party!

190
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,020
Tell the partners of Eun Dam Ri and Yeo Ji Hee to see me separately. Okay?

191
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,460
How could they do this to me?

192
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,110
It's the idea for the new shopping mall. Why don't you show this to your father?

193
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,760
Everything will go back to its place when you keep yourself busy.

194
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:45,880
Let's show how strong you are and put Eun Dam Ri and Yeo Ji Hee in their place.

195
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,020
Do you have a plan?

196
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,850
We're going to have our performance soon.

197
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,080
She's asleep.

198
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,670
Rest up.

199
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,120
I did mix in some sleeping pills,

200
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,830
but what if she wakes up?

201
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,060
Then, why did you make me like this?

202
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,990
I hope it doesn't leave a scar.

203
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,550
Have you been eating well?

204
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,890
It's delicious.

205
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,660
I'm not the best cook.

206
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,160
I didn't know...

207
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,190
that the best things...

208
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,320
can be found in the most ordinary moments.

209
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,890
<i> [Fate] </i>

210
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,390
I thought you only listened to tango music.

211
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,090
It is tango music.

212
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,610
You can tango to Korean songs, too.

213
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,690
Do you know what we would call it,

214
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:23,250
if I danced tango here?

215
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,600
It's tango in the room.

216
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,380
This is why I hesitated.

217
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,750
Because I didn't want to fall in love.

218
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,880
In the Han Pan Ro's voice analysis files,

219
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,510
there are at least twenty legally effective files.

220
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:07,010
It's evidence of illegal mergers and acquisitions, including Gediks Semiconductors, from Chairman Kang's cell phone.

221
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,710
- Thank you for your hard work, Ra El.
- Let's ask the law firm to sue them.

222
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,630
Let's do it that way.

223
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:18,250
If we ask the law firm to sue, you must be prepared for your true identity to be revealed.

224
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,980
Then it will be harder for us to collect the evidence, and that's why I'm pushing a lawsuit as a last objective.

225
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,510
I want to put Han Pan Ro and Kang Yoon Kyeom in court.

226
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,770
I want to do it as soon as possible.

227
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,140
I feel the same way as you.

228
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,330
But like our original plan,

229
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,650
when we acquire Chairman Kang's safe is the best time to sue them.

230
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:41,210
Also, that way, we can make this public to society.

231
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:45,080
Still, I want to speed things up.

232
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,960
I guess you are uncomfortable with Chairman Kang.

233
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,670
It's not easy to get into bed with your archenemy.

234
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,050
I want to end this soon.

235
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,900
Honey, you came home after midnight last night. Did you go somewhere?

236
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:23,530
Why did you throw this package away?

237
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,790
Gediks Semiconductors was your first workplace.

238
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,810
Why did you lie to me?

239
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,650
And what is this?

240
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,100
What's going on here?

241
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,750
I don't know either! It was delivered incorrectly.

242
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,830
Honey.

243
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,250
You said you weren't hiding anything from me.

244
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,890
I married you because I believed that you were a simple, pure person.

245
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,790
Until you tell me what all these are about, do not even think of touching me.

246
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,330
Honey.

247
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,820
Get out.

248
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,800
<i> I want you to lose someone you love. </i>

249
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,300
<i> Until you want to die because of that pain. </i>

250
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,160
I didn't tell my dad about you acting this way.

251
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:47,560
I'll be on the Autumn Recital Documentary next week.

252
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,730
My dad is coming to see my performance as well.

253
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,110
You know my dad is fast at reading the room.

254
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,580
He'll suspect things are wrong if you don't come.

255
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,660
Are you threatening me?

256
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,220
I'm saying this on your behalf.

257
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:09,160
What's the point of pretending to have a good relationship in front of others when we are not?

258
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,030
I'm putting in a lot of effort.

259
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,250
Compared to before, I'm laying low and not really doing anything.

260
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:22,150
You're laying low? Is that something to be proud of?

261
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,550
How can you live well after committing such a thing back in the day—

262
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,810
That was an accident!

263
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,980
So we make a deal with the Seoul City Government that we'll clean up the brothel area,

264
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,330
and turn that area into LY Group's shopping center?

265
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,130
Yes.

266
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,000
We can't even open anything over there yet.

267
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,890
That's a great idea!

268
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,140
Right, the brothel area is a problem for Seoul City.

269
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:06,980
Brother, what if we merge this with the Zeus business?

270
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,970
If we have a shopping mall as well, it's easier for money laundering.

271
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,800
Also, the business gets bigger. Isn't that a perfect idea?

272
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,230
You're right!

273
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:20,100
I want the biggest shopping center in all of Korea.

274
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,190
You brought Assemblyman Seo Eun Pyeong before.

275
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,570
So Ra is on a roll these days!

276
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,860
Who's the person who came up with this plan?

277
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,310
I did it.

278
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,710
Be honest.

279
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,830
Who is it?

280
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,510
<i> She's one of the mothers from the parents' association. </i>

281
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,900
<i> I told her I'd promote her husband, and now she's putting every effort into me. </i>

282
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,010
<i>I'll introduce you to her when you come to the recital.</i>

283
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,440
Now that Han Pan Ro has taken the bait of the shopping mall,

284
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,110
I think we can get the LY Group's money-laundering route soon.

285
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,920
I'll start contacting the law firm.

286
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,820
I don't think it's a bad idea to speed things up, as you said.

287
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,010
You've exceeded my expectations.

288
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,420
I'm sorry about what I said last time,

289
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,750
that you are inexperienced. I want to sincerely apologize.

290
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,270
You took this...

291
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,130
as your life's work.

292
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,750
A lot of our information can only be picked up by the people close to them.

293
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,660
If the LY legal team learns about our lawsuit,

294
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,680
you will be the first one they'll suspect, Ra El.

295
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,620
Since your acquaintance was built overnight.

296
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,560
I'm concerned you may be the recipient of their retribution,

297
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,060
even before the case goes public.

298
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,080
Put some distance between Kang Yoon Kyeom and you.

299
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,940
It's for safety's sake.

300
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,950
All right.

301
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,640
Please double check all related data to the end. Let's call it a day.

302
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,970
Okay.

303
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,370
Um...

304
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:19,590
What are your thoughts on the offer of becoming the Blue House Secretary?

305
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,190
The speaker is trying to assess what my thoughts are, but I have no inkling.

306
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,910
I will think on it some more. Please give me some time.

307
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,150
Is it the Do-Not-Disturb DD Day?

308
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,180
A time alone before making a big change?

309
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,840
I know it's a useless question, but I'm still curious.

310
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,270
You completely go off the radar on DD Day. Where exactly do you go?

311
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,580
Can't you share a little bit?

312
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,130
DD Day's meaning is literally Do-Not-Disturb. So if I let you in on it, would it really be a DD Day?

313
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,690
It'd be an Open Day instead, no?

314
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,390
That's true.

315
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,440
Please get home.

316
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,750
Good job today!

317
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,780
<i>Ra El.</i>

318
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,500
<i>This is regarding the job request previously made. Contact me when you can.</i>

319
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,910
That's right. That's right.

320
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,230
Wow, it's the madam!

321
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,520
So cool!

322
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,050
You are so pretty.

323
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,440
- What is this about?
- We felt bad for not celebrating you on your birthday.

324
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,770
We are a so-called parents' dance group. We should at least, celebrate each other.

325
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,340
Never mind. It's already passed.

326
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:58,050
♪ <i>Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you</i> ♪

327
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,440
Enough, don't you think?

328
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,040
Secretary Kim.

329
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,700
I will accept your affection.

330
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,870
We also prepared a gift.

331
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:17,930
It's a premium brand from this industry.

332
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,380
Since a shop opened in Cheongdam-dong, I bought this one.

333
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,860
<i>- Oh my god.
- Was this your idea?</i>

334
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,500
I heard about your birthday.

335
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,840
It made me feel bad that you were alone, so I prepared this gift as a cute joke.

336
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,610
I heard when you get old,

337
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:49,340
"that" is more superior than the husband.

338
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,340
I hope it makes you feel better.

339
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,090
Why don't we cut the cake?

340
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,400
I will bring a piece if you go to the lounge.

341
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,640
Did you see?

342
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,930
Right where it hurts.

343
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,860
Please lower your anger. I had no idea they were up to this.

344
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,250
The madams have taken their leave.

345
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,320
Please open them.

346
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,770
What is this money for, Madam?

347
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,940
It's an allowance.

348
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,940
Ma'am?

349
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,100
Use it where you need it.

350
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,680
All this?

351
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:11,780
In this, there are three times the amount of what you have.

352
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,290
Sleep with Eun Dam Ri and Yeo Ji Hee for one night.

353
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:25,490
You can tempt them or use some other method...

354
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,830
Whoever delivers the result first,

355
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,800
will take it all.

356
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,240
One thing, there's got to be proof.

357
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,670
A definitive one.

358
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,360
Take your leave.

359
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,390
Sis,

360
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,420
should you really go to this length despite how much you dislike them?

361
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,410
It's a crime.

362
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,390
I've always lived doing whatever I pleased.

363
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,630
What if it becomes a problem?

364
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,120
There was never once a problem.

365
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,450
Have you done things like this before?

366
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,750
Do you know why Father doesn't let me work?

367
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,990
Because I'm childish?

368
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:46,610
I always cause trouble and Dad always handles the aftermath.

369
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:51,920
I'm sure the old man is probably tired of it. I bet he'd like to live in peace.

370
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,230
Did you do things like this regarding Chairman Kang

371
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,690
or LY Group?

372
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:11,000
The trouble I caused in order to marry him was probably the biggest.

373
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,960
What was it?

374
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,520
I switched two women's fate... lightly.

375
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,380
In order to marry him, that is.

376
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,570
When he was single, the amount of marriage talk amongst the chaebols was extraordinary.

377
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:30,110
He was infamous for his good looks, tall stature, and growing up as the ultimate elite without a scandal to his name.

378
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:33,690
The competition was fierce, but I was older...

379
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,590
and married once before.

380
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,950
And so?

381
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,770
The rumor had it

382
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,000
there was a woman who he was affectionate with.

383
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,900
So, I took care of it.

384
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,540
And then some woman interfered with my plan, claiming we return her husband's company.

385
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,790
Gediks Semiconductor company's wife or something.

386
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,520
Gediks was my dowry.

387
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,770
One young, one old woman.

388
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,730
They switched their fate.

389
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,060
Thanks to me.

390
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,440
Gediks...

391
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,950
I mean...

392
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:33,310
To those women, what exactly did you do to those women?

393
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,940
You'll get hurt, if you know too much.

394
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,560
There will be many interesting events ahead of us.

395
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,160
You can look forward to it as well.

396
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,050
<i>[Ra El]</i>

398
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:04,900
What is this about, Ra El? Why do you ask about your mother's last appearance?

399
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,360
Did you hear some news?

400
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,860
Just before she disappeared,

401
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,050
what she spoke about,

402
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,510
how she appeared in that last moment,

403
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,680
do you have anything you can tell me?

404
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,430
It's important.

405
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:30,350
Shortly after I left for the US,

406
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,900
she disappeared from the nursing home she was staying at.

407
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:40,150
I don't have any further knowledge of it than what I already shared.

408
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,710
Han So Ra...

409
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,740
Do you suppose there is a possibility that she harmed my mom?

410
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,330
How does a person disappear without a trace?

411
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,260
Don't you find it strange?

412
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,980
When I went to visit your mother...

413
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,510
for the last time at the nursing home...

414
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:20,280
<i>Ah, are you okay? I brought some porridge for you.</i>

415
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,000
<i>I'd like you to stop coming here.</i>

416
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,380
<i>Your future is bright, Attorney Seo.</i>

417
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,250
<i>Don't get mixed up in a dangerous situation.</i>

418
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,850
<i>What kind of talk is that, Ma'am?</i>

419
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,730
<i>You listen to me.</i>

420
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,480
<i>From now on, never</i>

421
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,860
<i>come to visit me.</i>

422
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,610
<i>Do you understand?</i>

423
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:46,500
Your mother was always uneasy.

424
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,090
Shortly after your father passed away,

425
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,940
LY took over your father's company.

426
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,210
I thought it was all over then.

427
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:03,760
What did she say when she was leaving the hospital?

428
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,040
She said she was on her way to meet with her relatives.

429
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,370
She went missing right after that.

430
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:21,900
Though a person went missing without any cause, there has been no trace of her for over ten years...

431
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:28,540
The case doesn't make any sense. However, if the most powerful person was involved, then...

432
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,220
we may be able to solve the puzzle.

433
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,810
Of course, it's all a guess at this point, Ra El.

434
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,300
Ra El.

435
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,260
Oh, Ra El!

436
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,610
I only hoped that she lived.

<i>There isn't any known information about Ms. Kim Jin Sook.</i>

439
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:15,440
<i>Then some day,</i>

440
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,100

00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,960
Your father asks to speak with you.

449
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,920
You say the former Prime Minister Han Pan Ro wishes to meet?

450
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,880
He sent something our way via his secretary.

451
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,250
Mentioning something about how he appreciated your help at the kindergarten.

452
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,770
I'm sure he was trying to grab a chance thrown his way since a premium politician deigned a visit to his event.

453
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:05,640
You know well how Han Pan Ro conducts illegal deals mixing business and politics.

454
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,220
I cut him directly.

Is that right?

469
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,780
Han Pan Ro started to approach shopping malls.

He dares to snatch the play mall I gave your older brother?!

Your mother is of low birth, hence you are lowly born,

would your children be any different?

487
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:04,560

You weren't accepted so you could gobble your elder brother up!

As you know, they are the shining stars of our kindergarten?

546
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,850
We begin the musical recital of the students.

574

wouldn't he then no longer be mistaken?
