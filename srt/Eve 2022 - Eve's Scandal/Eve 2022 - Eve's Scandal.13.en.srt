Honey. Honey, you...

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,960
you don't know who this woman is. Right?

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,450
I will tell you.

12
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,160
Your tricks won't work, so stop.

Must I have someone drag you out?

17
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,950
You must be feeling great. For now.

18
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,440
It's my child's birthday party.

19
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,750
Even if you have something to say, can you say it later?

20
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,930
The child!

21
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,900
That's right. Whose child is that?

22
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,060
You will only leave if you are dragged out, is that right?

23
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,740
Secretary Cha!

24
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,140
It's fine, Secretary Cha. I'll be leaving soon.

25
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,850
Don't you think I expected this much?

26
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,010
Kang Yoon Kyeom, I know you too well.

27
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,910
When you've lived together with someone for several years.

28
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,940
You get to know the other person inside out.

29
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,730
Suspicion, once planted, never disappears.

30
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,340
One drop of doubt I spilled...

31
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,620
That one drop will start spreading through these clear waters.

32
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,730
It will cloud the entire body of water quickly.

33
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,520
Your relationship will end up like this blackened water.

34
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,990
If you want to satisfy your curiosity, see me personally, Honey.

35
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,320
True fear isn't when the event is upon us.

36
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,480
True fear is the anticipation...

37
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,230
of an unforeseen event occurring sometime in the future.

38
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,230
Get up. Let's go somewhere else.

39
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,210
I'm leaving.

40
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,510
There are many things I have to sort out because of her.

41
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,940
I'm so busy, so I'll be leaving now, Honey.

42
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,020
- It's me, Father-in-law.
- Why are you calling?

43
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,050
The woman who sued us for money.

44
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,720
How can she call so shamelessly!

45
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,230
Is she playing with us or what?

46
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,540
<i>How thick-skinned.</i>

47
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,100
What exactly is going on with the two of you?

48
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,430
On top of the divorce lawsuit, a 10 trillion won countersuit?

49
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,730
Don't you see the elders of the family and the orderliness?

50
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,990
What do you have to say after making the entire country in an uproar?

51
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,300
I truly understand how you must feel, Father-in-law.

52
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,670
I'm sorry, Father-in-law.

53
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,450
To get to the point, we won't be divorcing, Father-in-law.

54
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,720
I will tell you in person.

55
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,010
My husband will tell you that we won't be divorcing, shortly.

56
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,450
Thank you for the food. I'm going to the playroom to play. Let's go.

57
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,540
Have fun.

58
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:57,990
When my biological father passed and my mother remarried, my name changed.

59
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,650
Is that so?

60
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,680
It is the second marriage for Bo Ram's dad.

61
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,300
If I say I wasn't the biological mother, I thought that Bo Ram might have been hurt by it.

62
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,440
You did the right thing. I understand.

63
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,260
But there isn't anything I should worry about, is there?

64
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,440
<i>There is a moment that fear enters the picture.</i>

65
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,150
<i>As if...</i>

66
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,540
<i>one is trapped under water, it becomes difficult to breathe</i>

67
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,720
<i>Locked in confusion,</i>

68
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,280
<i>it feels like one would die from suffocating.</i>

69
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
<i>If one doesn't stand up to it quickly,</i>

70
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,540
<i>one loses.</i>

71
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,240
Are you suspecting me?

72
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,930
Like what Han So Ra said, are we over after a bit of love play?

73
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,080
I told you this while we were at the beach.

74
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
If you are hiding something, you need to tell me.

75
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,280
That way you can be at peace.

76
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,900
Whatever it may be, is fine.

77
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,300
As we are only just beginning,

78
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,060
we only need to learn about our past slowly.

79
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,410
<i>Director Kim Seon Bin: There will be torn paperwork on the table.</i>

80
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,940
<i>Please bring it to me secretly.</i>

81
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,370
<i>You say Han So Ra has found out about your name?</i>

82
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,430
She also found out about Ms. Jang Moon Hee approaching them with intent.

83
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,080
I don't believe she knows about Gediks Semiconductors.

84
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,590
- How about Chairman Kang's reaction?
- There isn't an immediate reaction, but it's fair to assume the countdown has started.

85
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,870
- The problem is Ms. Jang. I can't reach her.
- I will visit her.

86
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,980
<i>How can a person in the hospital do so? I'll go.</i>

87
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,810
I will try to obtain the original Gediks contract as quickly as possible.

88
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,390
Then I will contact the law firm for any news of Ms. Jang Moon Hee.

89
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,600
Please send this list to auditing.

<i>[LY Director | Kim Seon Bin]</i>

91

92
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,360
We have full intent to prosecute.

93
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,020
Yes, Ma'am.

94
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,970
- Executive Director?
- Yes?

95
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,840
I'm Jeong Myeong Ho from Auditing.

96
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,700
There's been a report from the Strategic Planning Office regarding your corruption.

97
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,450
Strategic Planning Office, you say?

98
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,400
I mean, what kind of... suddenly?

99
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,180
Director Kim?

100
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,480
Director...

101
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,530
Why the sudden...?

102
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,570
<i>This is a document for you to give up your shares. Let's put a stamp on it.</i>

103
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,790

<i>Mr. Executive Director.</i>

105

- It's okay. It's okay.</i>

108
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,520
Is it possible to chat privately with me?

109
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,420
Investigate and hand him over to the prosecution per my direction.

110
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,210
Come with us.

111
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,450
Director!

112
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,720
Um, why... LY's Audit Department?

113
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,640
I've retired from the company and have relocated to the States.

114
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,280
Retiree summons investigation?

115
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,300
It is a project personally overseen by Director Kim Seon Bin from the Office of Anti-Corruption Strategy Planning.

116
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:14,460
you are a person of interest in the liquidation of illegal corruption. If you do not cooperate with the investigation, we will hand over the information to the Prosecution.

117
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,300
<i>We are kicking off the establishment of a new office that will oversee every department in the company.</i>

118
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,400
<i>It will collectively be referred to as the Future Strategic Planning Office, and Mrs. Kim Seon Bin will be in charge of it.</i>

119
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,500
You are now resorting to accusations?

120
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,710
Are you saying that Director Kim Seon Bin canceled today's meeting as well?

121
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,210
She left in a hurry, claiming a top-secret investigation.

122
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,780
We can quietly find out her destination since the driver is one of ours, Chairman.

123
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,760
Ma'am?

124
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,340
<i>What shall I do, Chairman?</i>

125
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,290
Follow her.

126
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,250
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

127
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,280
<i>[Woonseo General Hospital]</i>

128
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,220
Then what of the cell phone? Did you not find Ms. Jeon Moon Hee's cell phone?

129
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,270
Only the cell phone was missing. The phone was turned off.

130
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,870
How about reporting it to the police to find it?

131
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,700
I will meet with Han So Ra first.

132
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,360
The one Han So Ra hates is me,

133
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,530
so there's no reason for her to hurt Ms. Jeon.

134
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,820
Ra El, even without the original contract,

135
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,170
I will somehow put support behind your lawsuit,

136
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,420
don't step forward if it is dangerous.

137
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,180
Let's go.

138
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,850
Oh, God...

139
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,600
Are you overdoing it by discharging yourself?

140
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,010
I have to take care of things

141
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,230
before something like this happens to you again.

142
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,040
Follow them.

143
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,030
<i>[Woonseo General Hospital]</i>

144
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,040
Isn't that Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom?

145
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,770
<i>[Chief of Staff Seo Eun Pyeong]</i>

146
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,270
It's been a while, Chief Seo.

147
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,220
What?

148
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,800
I understand.

149
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,000
Stop the car.

150
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,150
Who could possibly attack the Blue House's Chief of Staff?

151
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,450
Even though there was this shocking event,

152
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,930
how is it possible no one knows about it?

153
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,320
I didn't announce it on purpose. In order to wait for a suitable time...

154
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,820
What kind of timing are you speaking of?

155
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,080
I wanted one of the associated people

156
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,220
to hear about this first from me, so I could pressure them.

157
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,190
Who is it exactly?

158
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,180
I'm doing so, currently.

159
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,740
Are you doubting me?

160
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,960
It is a nonsensical tale.

161
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,950
How can you be so rude?

162
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,470
Han So Ra, Han Pan Ro, Kim Jeong Cheol, and Kang Yoon Kyeom.

163
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,540
You are all seen as one, from an outsider's perspective.

164
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,220
If you'd like to be seen different from them,

165
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,450
stop the plan they're scheming now.

166
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,990
I hope that you do not get linked when the punishment is dealt with.

167
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,190
If you'll excuse me...

168
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,170
Chief Seo.

169
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,520
Your rivalry towards me, needlessly frequently meeting with Seon Bin,

170
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,920
not announcing the fact that you were attacked. None of it makes sense.

171
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,910
Except... it will all be explained away with one thing.

172
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,070
Do you love Seon Bin?

173
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,130
So are you doing something for Seon Bin?

174
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,030
What if that were true?

175
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:47,180
She is a woman who has chosen me already. What gives you the right to be so confident?

176
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,940
How is your love, Chairman Kang?

177
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,200
My love is... sacrifice.

178
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,570
I merely ponder what I can do for her.

179
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,750
It is because I don't believe the man who doubts and follows her while calling it love is my rival,

180
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,000
I can be confident.

181
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,770
You doubt her and yet call it love...? I don't know.

182
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,360
What a pity... I can know with certainty that you, Chairman Kang,

183
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,670
might not be by Seon Bin's side.

184
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,240
If you'll excuse me...

185
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,790
That would be nice as a shirt for my father-in-law.

186
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,220
That would be good for my brother-in-law.

187
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,120
Bring those, two cufflinks, and my sister-in-law's bracelet.

188
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,790
Yes, Madam.

189
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,480
I didn't want the hassle of experiencing the in-laws and didn't mingle,

190
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,430
but now that my mother-in-law has passed, I suddenly feel that the family is all we have.

191
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,980
Please excuse yourselves, so the ladies can converse in private.

192
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,180
Did my husband chase you out already?

193
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,480
What did you do with Ms. Jang Moon Hee?

194
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,960
You would be the one who knows better about your mother, why ask me?

195
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,820
Is it because she's a fake mom that you don't know each other well?

196
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,090
Tell me where she is.

197
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,540
Is there some kind of filial relationship between the two mother and daughter gold diggers?

198
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,880
How dare you make demands of me?

199
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,140
You are nothing once he tires of you.

200
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,710
You're in no situation to be boasting your upper hand.

201
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,480
That's what I should be saying to you.

202
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,120
Even after I leave,

203
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,740
if you can't reclaim your husband? Then what will you do?

204
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,710
You haven't thought of it, have you?

205
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,550
Why would I think of something like that?

206
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,490
The devoted wife who forgives the husband who was hurt by a golddigger is me.

207
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,820
Since I protected my household, I'd receive the whole nation's respect as well.

208
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,720
That is the end of this lawsuit.

209
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,980
Even if Chairman Kang finds out about

210
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,270
Dr. Jeong, your extramarital affair partner?

211
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,680
<i>Dr. Jeong? Where are you?</i>

212
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,210
<i>I must receive some counseling today.</i>

213
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,970
<i>- I'll be there right away.
- Where are you?!</i>

214
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,800
<i>Let me see you.</i>

215
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,540
And to add the fact that the Chief of Staff of the Blue House was attacked...

216
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,210
If it were to be Han So Ra's scheme, not only would you lose your husband,

217
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,300
could you reconsider living in this country at all?

218
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,320
Oh... to see you sweating after being found out about your golddigger nature...

219
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,220
I'll give you one day.

220
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,640
By midnight tomorrow, return Ms. Jang Moon Hee.

221
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,830
If you return her safely, I will leave Chairman Kang.

222
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,290
I'm saying I'll leave your "flower garden" intact.

223
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,960
Remember. It is under the condition that

224
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,550
not a strand of hair on Ms. Jang Moon Hee must be harmed.

225
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,880
What's the status of that bitch Jang Moon Hee? Nobody knows she's with us, right?

226
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,140
I've been keeping close tabs on her.

227
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,220
Feed her something and take care of her.

228
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,250
We might have to send her back.

229
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,550
Please open it, Brother-in-law. You too, Sister-in-law.

230
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,970
Why are you acting like this? It's burdensome.

231
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,680
Why is a woman who's in the process of a divorce lawsuit bringing us such gifts?

232
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,150
I'm telling you that we aren't divorcing.

233
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,840
That woman is a golddigger.

234
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,950
Father-in-law, it will soon be the 49th day of Mother-in-law's death.

235
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,210
I would like to be present.

236
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,640
I'd like to naturally publicize that our household is steadfast.

237
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,100
Father, I will call Yoon Kyeom.

238
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,690
Yes, Elder Brother.

239
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,990
My thought on divorce hasn't changed. Please send Da Bi's mom on her way.

240
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,710
<i>Is that right?</i>

241
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,080
I guess you don't have an ounce of feeling left for her.

242
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,680
What are you going to do if you lose all your money in the lawsuit?

243
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,210
Will you still divorce her?

244
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,210
All right, punk.

245
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,490
Yoon Kyeom says that the divorce is definite and to not receive gifts like these.

246
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,440
Please take them and leave, Ex-Sis-in-law.

247
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,980
No one intends to buy into your schemes here.

248
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,780
What are you all excited for?

249
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,520
Did he really...

250
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,360
say that? Still?

251
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,870
You saw me call him.

252
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,840
Even more than Yoon Kyeom who had an affair,

253
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,770
you who threw the 10 trillion won lawsuit at us are more reprehensible!

254
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,950
To you and your father, is our family a pond to scoop money off of?

255
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:11,130
You are early, Madam. We weren't able to prepare a meal since we were expecting you to arrive in the evening.

256
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,950
Please, never mind the meal.

257
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,490
Bo Ram's grandmother is ill, so I will move my things today.

258
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,150
Ah, by the way, the garden fence was leaning as if to fall,

259
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,110
I think the children might get hurt. Would you please repair it now?

260
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,540
Yes, of course.

<i>Lee Ra El.</i>

<i>After my biological father passed and my mother remarried, my name changed.</i>

<i>Suspicion, once planted, never disappears..</i>

266

<i>How about your love, Chairman Kang?</i>

267
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,460
<i>My love is... sacrifice.</i>

268
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,790
<i>It is because I don't believe the man who doubts and follows her while calling it love</i>

269
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,210
<i>to be a rival, I can be confident.</i>

270
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,470
<i>You doubt her and yet call it love...? I don't know.</i>

271
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,690
<i>Can you do me just one favor?</i>

272
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,150
There is a box bedecked with a ribbon in the vault.

273
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,480
Can you bring that to me?

274
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,700
Are you okay with me entering the vault?

275
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,250
Of course.

276
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,950
I changed the secret code because it is dangerous should Da Bi enter.

277
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,010
I will give you the code.

Mr. Attorney, I was able to get my hands on the original Gediks contract.
