00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,720
- Have you been well, Brother?
- Yes.

159
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,070
Chairman Kang.

160
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,030
Long time no see.

161
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,350
Have you arrived?

162
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,390
Wow. So Ra gets prettier every time I see her.

163
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:19,050
You all must know very well that Jeong Cheol gave up his position at the NIS (National Intelligence Service) trying to help us.

164
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,710
He was going to be part of our LY family anyway, so I told him to move in quickly.

165
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,810
Keep him as a vice-chairman. It'll be reassuring.

166
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,430
No use in filling the term of the bank president, just move now.

167
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,250
Yes, Brother.

168
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,160
Are you talking about the vice-chairman of the board of LY?

169
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,210
Of course, I mean that. Is there another vice-chairman?

170
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,960
Chairman, as you know, starting with the NIS,

171
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,270
I have quite the experience and connections in construction, banking, and even Liyan.

172
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,480
Yet I still know that I am undeserving of the position of vice-chairman.

173
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,970
In the parts that I am lacking, I will diligently learn from you, Mr. Chairman.

174
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,970
Please look after me, Chairman.

175
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,940
Good. Let's see how great a synergy we can get from the two of you.

176
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,430
Brother, I will head home.

177
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,140
All right.

178
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,890
I will head home.

179
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,330
Dad, see you at home!

180
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,850
Okay, I'll see you at home, Da Bi.

181
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,840
Yoon Kyeom, that kid. He thinks the company is all his.

182
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,430
If you hadn't gotten married to him, LY would've easily been in the top 30.

183
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,280
I'll have to plant some people around him so we don't get scammed by him.

184
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,340
What do you mean by scammed? You're going too far, Dad.

185
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,820
Are you taking your husband's side in front of your father?

186
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,570
No. I'm sorry. I was wrong.

187
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,410
Head home.

188
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,610
Yes.

189
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,790
<i>You knew, right?</i>

190
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,410
<i>Since when does Father discuss those types of things with me?</i>

191
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,780
<i>Is the vice-chairman a position for anyone?</i>

192
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,110
<i>He's not anyone.</i>

193
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,280
<i>It's true that Bank President Kim Jeong Cheol is capable.</i>

194
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,270
<i>That's what you and your father think.</i>

195
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,100
<i>You're going to accept it anyway. Just let it be.</i>

196
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,160
The statistics are missing from the survey data, but the executive officer isn't picking up.

197
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,190
He went to eat, but I guess he forgot his phone.

198
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,820
When he comes back, please tell him to come to my room.

199
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,240
Yes.

200
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,110
<i> [Lee Ra El's mother's hospital] </i>

201
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,390
- Hello?
<i>- This is the nursing home.</i>

202
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,680
<i>Recently, you asked about Miss Kim Jin Sook, right?</i>

203
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,700
<i> [Naeil Hospital Care] </i>

204
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,860
I was surprised that Assemblyman Seo Eun Pyeong came all the way here.

205
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,620
I'm sorry, but are you a relative of Kim Jin Sook?

206
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,040
No. I knew her during my time as a lawyer.

207
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,390
At the time, I tried to look into how she was doing multiple times,

208
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,720
but there was no way for me to know.

209
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,210
Did you hear anything about her?

210
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,580
No, we don't know either.

211
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,090
Even her resident registration number has expired.

212
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,840
Oh, I understand.

213
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,430
Then, for what reason did you call?

214
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,170
A couple of years ago, someone paid additional hospital fees,

215
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,840
but the law has changed since, so I have to return the money.

216
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,920
They paid hospital fees?

217
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,240
Who?

218
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,380
<i>They didn't leave a contact number, so we have no means of contacting them.</i>

219
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,590
There is someone who comes every couple of months.

220
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:40,000
They check for any information on Miss Kim Jin Sook, but they don't leave a contact number.

221
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,090
Is that person a female?

222
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,930
<i>Yes. I remember her being a young woman.</i>

223
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,110
<i>Is there any information on Miss Kim Jin Sook?</i>

224
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,600
<i>We have no news about Miss Kim Jin Sook.</i>

225
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,210
<i>Then is there any contact information?</i>

226
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,960
<i>Isn't your mother at the hospital? I thought you were with her.</i>

227
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,980
<i>- What are you doing?
- Find President Lee's seal for now. We can get the daughter's statement tomorrow...</i>

228
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,830
<i>Mr. Executive Director.</i>

229
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,420
<i>Hold on, hold on. Hey! Let go...</i>

230
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,710
<i>Hold on.</i>

231
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,150
<i>This is a document for you to give up your shares. Let's put a stamp on it.
[Inheritance Rights Waiver] </i>

232
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:22,840
<i>We're all doing this in order to survive. It's not a matter of one or two people.</i>

233
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,480
<i>Mr. Executive Director.</i>

234
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,230
<i>Dad trusted you the most.</i>

235
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,900
<i>How could you do this?</i>

236
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,560
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

237
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,100
<i>Let's put her fingerprint here.</i>

238
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,090
<i>Hold her correctly. It's okay. It's okay.</i>

239
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,940
<i>Stamp it. Just a little more.</i>

240
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,550
<i>A little more, okay.</i>

241
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,550
<i>- Hurry!
- Done.</i>

242
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,640
<i>Ra El! Ra El!</i>

243
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,800
<i>Ra El, are you okay?</i>

244
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,270
<i>Ra El!</i>

245
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,960
<i>Oh no!</i>

246
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,350
<i>Ambulance. Call the ambulance!</i>

247
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,890
<i>Ra El! Ra El! Wake up.</i>

248
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,280
<i> Ra El! </i>

249
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,110
You want to look into Han Pan Ro and his surroundings?

250
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,990
Let's follow up on the people around Han Pan Ro and Chairman Kang for exactly four days.

251
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,680
You could get in big trouble, Sir. That's illegal.

252
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,350
Ra El is just part of the past.

253
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:45,820
Yes. She is in the past, but the past is more important than the present.

254
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:51,380
If it is really Ra El that appeared, we can't ignore it.

255
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,930
If a problem arises, I will take all responsibility.

256
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,510
We will now choose a parent representative to lead our Liyan ceremony.

257
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,500
This is the most competition we have seen amongst the representatives,

258
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,230
so the CNM documentary team and other press companies are wondering who the representative this year will be.

259
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,450
You can volunteer yourself, or recommend someone else.

260
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:19,620
<i> If you want to earn something, make other people help you. </i>

261
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:26,860
As a homeroom teacher, I would like to recommend Da Bi's mother.

262
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,220
Is she kidding?

263
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,820
Just because she funded this building.

264
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,780
Talk about manipulation.

265
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,320
What? Did we not fund this school?

266
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,200
Right?

267
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,470
Mom, I want a snack.

268
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,470
A snack?

269
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,440
What is this? It's a diaper...

270
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,570
Oh, it's a diaper!

271
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,540
Let me see.

272
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,970
It's true!

273
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,680
Who's bag is it?

274
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,700
Kang Da Bi?
<i>[Kang Da Bi]</i>

275
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,050
Oh my, it was Da Bi's bag?

276
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,620
What should I do?

277
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,960
If I knew it was yours, I would've kept it a secret.

278
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,820
<i>Nyah nyah! Nyah nyah!</i>

279
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,710
<i>Nyah nyah! Nyah nyah!</i>

280
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:31,960
<i>She's a baby! She's a baby! She's a baby!</i>

281
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:38,780
<i>She's a baby! She's a baby! She's a baby!</i>

282
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,350
No Eul! What is this?

283
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:49,130
It's going to leave a mark! It's cut open.

284
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,670
- What did you do? Come here!
- Where did you learn to do this?

285
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,550
- It's okay.
- Miss Da Bi!

286
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,040
Oh my!

287
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,270
Madam, is Young Lady all right?

288
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,310
Why did you scream at Miss Da Bi?

289
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,720
Who are you?

290
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,180
Apologize to Miss Da Bi and Madam, Ma'am.

291
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,740
Don't you see my child is hurt?

292
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,160
My child got assaulted, why should I apologize?

293
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,160
She only did it because he deserved it.

294
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,090
I'm speechless at, "She only did it because he deserved it."

295
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,450
Is there a problem to say it's a diaper when he sees a diaper?

296
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,900
Forget it. Get out.

297
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,480
Why are outsiders meddling in this?

298
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,400
Wait a minute. Please calm down.

299
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,240
Let's get No Eul treated first.

300
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,160
We will select a representative next time. Let's wrap up the meeting here.

301
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,790
Miss Eun Dam Ri, we have a lot to discuss.

302
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:07,070
I'm quite busy today, so

303
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,420
let's meet up sometime later.

304
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,150
Get the car ready and bring Da Bi out.

305
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,120
<i>The greatest woman.</i>

306
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,720
<i>And the woman who wants to be the greatest.</i>

307
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,080
<i>Greed that can never be satisfied.</i>

308
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,140
<i>I'll escort you all to Hell.</i>

309
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,160
"Let's get No Eul treated first"? Whose side are you on?

310
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,550
What do you mean by siding? I never took anyone's side.

311
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,320
Whose side are you on? Huh?

312
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,310

Does having a rat hole-sized mall make you a conglomerate?

Because she got construction going on in Dubai, she thinks she's at the top?

How do I push out this crazy bitch from the kindergarten?

Do you think my dad will let me have my way?

402
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:04,320
Never mind. If he finds out about Da Bi not being potty trained, I'll be the target of his criticism.

403
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,570
Using Kim Jeong Cheol for this might be suitable, don't you think?

00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,230
In my opinion, he also might be tough (to convince)?

00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,370
That mere sum is also considered money?

476
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:07,350
What do I need to do in order to screw her over?

477
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:12,480
I need to crush those who don't know their place.

478
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:20,240
I'm Han So Ra. Han So Ra.

481
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,180
Here.

482
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,350
Geez.

What are you looking at?

484
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,250
I apologize.

485
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,600
I'm going home tomorrow. Arrange the other house.

486
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,140
Yes.

487

Secretary Kim can pick up Da Bi, Chairman.

488
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,180

489
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,510
Yes, Sir.

490
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,280
How pretty, Da Bi.

491
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,590
- Da Bi.
- Daddy!

492
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:43,230
- Did you have a good time?
- Yep!

493
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,390
Welcome.

494
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,520
I'm sorry. I'm a bit late.

495
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,030
I didn't notice the time passing as I was busy playing with Da Bi.

496
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:54,290
How was your day, Da Bi?

497
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,430
- Daddy, I learned how to jump.
- Really?

498

Da Bi...

501
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,430
I'm on my way to the bathroom. Would you like to come with me?

502
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,520
Never mind.

503
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,670
Did you major in dance?

504
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,360
I only studied ballet in high school.

505
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:38,030
I injured my ankle, so I couldn't study further.

506
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,530
I'm sorry to hear that.

507
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:44,010
Instead, I ended up studying something really interesting.

508
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,660
Something you also know very well, Chairman.

509
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,850
- Me?
- Business Administration.

510
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,520
It's ironic.

511
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,820
You've learned an interesting thing.

512
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,710
Bandoneon.

513
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,430
It's rare (to see) in Korea.

514
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,100
Can you play it perhaps?

515
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,460
You know about Bandoneon?

516
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,950
I know a bit about Piazzolla.
<i>(Astor Piazzolla: an Argentine tango composer, bandoneon player, and arranger)</i>

517
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:22,450
It's surprising to learn that you have knowledge of Bandoneon, Chairman.

518
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,870
Do you know this song as well?

519
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:24,490
It sounds like a song from a very old movie.

520
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:47,770
A man dressed as the emperor went to a carnival, hurt his head due to an accident,

521
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:51,930
and lived all his life believing that he was the emperor.

522
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:58,330
It is a song about a man who has forgotten who he was.

523
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,870
How about you, Chairman?

524
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:08,760
Do you know who you are and

525
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,030
what kind of a person you are?

526
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:24,220
If you were ever attracted to Piazzolla and Tango, it could mean that you'd like to wake up from oblivion.

527

<i>Only focusing on the partner and myself.</i>

He mentioned he is on his way to pick up Miss Da Bi.

535

536

537
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,650
About the incident at the kindergarten... Chairman also became aware.

538

Gosh, I'm fatigued. Set up the massage accouterments.

Why did you pick up Da Bi yourself when there's Secretary Kim?

542
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:13,380
How can you be absent from home for so long?

543

Don't concern yourself about the kindergarten incident. I'll handle it all.

01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:59,150
♫ <i>I’m seeing through your eyes, and know what’s on your mind</i> ♫

<i>[Han So Ra]</i>

638
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:07,500
Please just keep being like this. I ask for no more than this.

639
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:12,360
You know, right?

640
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,630
Since the moment I first saw you,

641
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,080
there's been only one man

642
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,470
in my life.

643
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:26,280
♫ <i>Let go all your sorrow in my arms</i> ♫

644
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,840
♫ <i>Sorrow in my arms</i> ♫

645
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:32,000
♫ <i>Why do you still hesitate?</i> ♫

646
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
♫ <i>Promise not to let you down</i> ♫

647
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,210
♫ <i>I know you don't want to let me go</i> ♫

648
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,690
♫ <i>Don't let me go</i> ♫

649
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,760
♫ <i>Don't say a thing</i> ♫

650
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,910
♫ <i>I'm right next to you</i> ♫

651
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:53,280
♫ <i>Close your eyes</i> ♫

652
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,940
♫ <i>From my shadowed heart</i> ♫

653
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:59,530
♫ <i>Too far away</i> ♫

654
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:02,810
♫ <i>To go back in time</i> ♫

655
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:05,670
♫ <i>Close your eyes</i> ♫

656
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:09,600
♫ <i>Just feel me lose my mind</i> ♫

657
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:14,570
<i> [Eve] </i>

658
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:18,150
<i>I can expect you to take over the PTA (parent teacher association), right?</i>

659
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,160
<i>[Kim Seon Bin]</i>

660
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,370
<i>I'll make an excuse to be at the house often. I can do so, if I use Han So Ra.</i>

661
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:23,580
<i> That's a perfect metaphor. </i>

662
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:24,970
<i>I like it.</i>

663
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:28,620
<i>Will I be able to meet you at the vacation home?</i>

664
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,460
<i>It appears to be a connection to Chairman Kang, doesn't it?</i>

665
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:35,120
<i>If one doesn't bet it all, the game never ends, no?</i>

666
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,970
<i>Do my eyes play tricks...?</i>

667
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:39,650
<i>You are certainly hiding something.</i>

668
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:42,990
<i>Let's think of nothing else but follow where our bodies lead us.</i>

669
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:46,080
♫ <i>Just feel me lose my mind</i> ♫
