Who the hell are you to cross the line?

Who the hell are you to get inside my head?

11
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,390
You'd be happy facing a miserable death like the housemaid did?

12

So what happened?
<i>[Episode 5]</i>

16
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,650
Did you find something out?

17
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,730
What about Kang Yoon Kyeom's mobile phone number?

18
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,030
Did you fail to get his phone numbers, no less?

19
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:26,210
Are you telling me that despite all our effort to obtain his numbers, we have nothing to show for it?

20
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,690
I didn't have the chance.

21
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,240
How can you not have the chance when Chairman Kang came all that way?

22
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,140
What exactly happened?

23
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,540
He had an urgent matter to handle, so he left.

24
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,600
What about a promise for a future meeting?

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,290
Not yet...

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,000
What the hell is this?!

27
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,550
You are telling me that you sent away the man who came of his own volition.

28
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,960
Knowing fully well how much effort went into approaching Kang Yoon Kyeom, you let him slip away without as much as obtaining his contact information.

29
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,770
I staked my entire life on getting those bastards to face the law.

30
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,170
Exactly... what did you mess up?

31
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,220
There will be another chance.

32
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,240
You were played by him.

33
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,380
You are indeed... too young.

34
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,330
What is it that you'd like to say?

35
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,310
You don't know men, Ms. Ra El.

36
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,020
I suppose you never got the chance to.

37
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,890
- All you've done is approach your husband with ulterior motives and approach Kang Yoon Kyeom per my request.
- Cut to the chase.

38
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:47,630
I'm saying that you either appeared too easy or revealed your shallow trickery to him. How unpolished!

39
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,850
- That man will never return.
- What will you do if I snare him?

40
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,660
Since when was my age an issue?

41
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,500
The killers of my father were cruel, but no one, the world

42
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,310
nor you showed any consideration for my youth.

43
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,600
Back then I was...

44
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,620
truly young.

45
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,750
You may have set the stage, but the one who actually engaged in battle was me.

46
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,480
The one who has to bed a man they're not in love with is me!

47
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,060
I'm young and immature?

48
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,400
What the hell do you know?

49
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,050
Since you're so old and wise, you must have made a few mistakes.

50
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,180
If so, don't make the mistake of running that mouth of yours, either.

I'm truly moved by your care of the children in the midst of your busy schedule.

72
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,880
My dear husband appreciates you quite a bit for your cooperation.

73
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,400
He says he'd like to thank you in person. How do you feel about that?

74
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,720
Shall I set up a meeting?

75
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,500
I think you and my dear husband would see eye to eye.

76
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,700
Don't you think so, Bo Ram's mom? You'd come if I were to set up a meeting as well?

77
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,660
Of course. I should come along.

78
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,410
The chairman is a good person, Assembleyman.

79
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,770
I understand.

80
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,880
If the opportunity knocks, I shall meet.

81
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,700
I'll be back after dropping off the children.

00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,150
Deputy Chairman? Why are you answering my father's phone?

83
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,750
I will head home.

84
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,890
I'll definitely use this to sweet-talk my way into new roles for me.

87
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,470
Could I drive you home?

88
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,750
Would you?

89
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,420
It appears to be well-aged, Sis.

90
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,590
It surely is old. I was born and married here.

91
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,620
Then, I'll wait for you here.

92
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,950
The chat may run rather long. Come wait inside.

93
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,330
Come in.

94
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,280

95
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,880

96
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,430
Not at all.

97
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,020
Pretend you didn't see anything. If you know too much about the 1%, you'll get hurt.

98
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,230
- Hey, So Ra!
- Good to see you, Sir.

99
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,300
- Dad!
- Good to see you. What brings you here?

100
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,640
I have happy news.

101

Is that guy still holding on?

102
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,770

- You are to wait here, please.
- Certainly.

111
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,340
Are you all right?

112
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,170
I think I burned myself. Please bring me some cold water.

113
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,630
I will bring the first aid kit.

<i>Seo Eun Pyeong wants to meet Yoon Kyeom?</i>

115
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,030
That's right. I'm sure of it.

116
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:22,250
Why is that? Does he need money?

117
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,110
<i>He didn't show any intentions of that.</i>

118
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,280
<i>Save the motive for later.</i>

119
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,120
<i>Let's tie the knot when the connection has appeared.</i>

120
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,030
Pour in my money first.

121
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,530
As a young and capable man, he has a long expiration date.

122
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,420
If we get on the same side, we could last at least twenty years.

123
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,070
I got it.

124
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,530
Here's a cold towel.

125
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,940
Thank you.

126
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,690
I was congratulated quite a bit by my father.

127
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,680
I'm feeling great.

128
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,920
- Did he mention giving you a role?
- He said he'd let me know on my birthday.

129
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,190
I guess I will wait.

130
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,550
It's my dear hubby!

131
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,160
Honey!

132
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,130
I was on my way back from dad's. Bo Ram's mom drove me.

133
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,180
- How's your father?
- The same, of course.

134
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,390
I have good news. If you hear it, you'd want to give me everything I ask for for my birthday.

135
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,610
Let's talk inside.

136
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,020
I just had a good idea.

137
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,140
You wanted to work, Sis.

138
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:09,520
Why does a smart person like you beg for a spot?

139
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,200
Just prove your capability in a public setting.

140
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,300
<i>Don't even give him water. You have to starve him to get him to pay attention.</i>

141
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,320
<i>Should we call the family to show his plight?</i>

142
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,430
If we remove the background noise and run the voice analysis, we could probably use it as evidence.

143
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,840
Woonsang Trade Company seems to be in the same predicament as your father's, Ra El.

144
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,400
Later, we should have him join the lawsuit.

145
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,480
It'd be too late. Please save him now.

146
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,410
Woonsang Trade Company's CEO Lee Changwon.

147
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,960
How and with what would we help?

148
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,900
Provide a lawyer and share the information so he can have the proper legal defense.

149
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,520
Our identity will be revealed if we do so.

150
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,640
I will bring an end to it before that happens.

151
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,580
If we ignore the victim when we encounter them, how are we different from them?

152
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,920
Although this world is a jungle, I won't become a beast myself.

153
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,200
Let's talk again after you have made successful strides.

154
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,240
Han Pan Ro, Han So Ra, Kang Yoon Kyeom. I made strides toward all three at the same time.

155
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,180
They'll be in court in no time.

156
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,730
Did Kang Yoon Kyeom contact you somehow?

157
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,430
Don't you worry.

158
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,170
On Han So Ra's important day,

159
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,130
he will choose me.

160
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,510
<i>Wait! Please look this way!</i>

161
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,610
<i>Look over here, please.</i>

162
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,790
<i>Smile for the camera.</i>

163
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,940
<i>Why does a smart person like you beg for a spot?</i>

164
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,200
<i>Just prove your capability in a public setting.</i>

165
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,110
Isn't that Seo Eun Pyeong?

166
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,950
<i>- My gosh.
- Is that really him?</i>

167
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,070
This is grand.

168
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:44,530
A historical meeting of a presidential candidate and the richest chaebol.

169
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,090
Isn't that Assembleyman Seo Eun Pyeong?

170
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,470
What brings a person like that here?

171
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,550
Sis requested for an interpreter.

172
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,380
Assembleyman!

173
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,090
He's your connection, Sister-in-law?

174
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,380
I heard that Chairman Giovanni wants to enter the political arena?

175
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,360
Wow! You are something else, Sister-in-law.

176
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,020
Welcome.

177
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,250
Assembleyman Seo Eun Pyeong, let me introduce you. This is CL's chairman, Giovanni.

178
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,900
This is LY's chairman, Kang Yoon Kyeom.

179
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,470
My close friends will translate.

180
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,620
It is nice to meet you, Assembleyman Seo Eun Pyeong. I've wanted to meet you for some time.

181
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,820
So did I, Chairman Kang. Nice to meet you.

182
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,280
This is Assembleyman Eun Pyeong Seo,

183
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,480
and this is Chairman Yoon Kyeom Kang.

184
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,490
And this is his wife, So Ra.

185
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,760
Nice to meet you.

186
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,550
My husband and I are close acquaintances of the chairman and his wife.

187
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,260
Pleasure.

188
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,350
Sister-in-law, why don't you introduce my husband?

189
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,280
You don't like it when I get involved. Won't you introduce him yourself?

190
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:35,070
Assembleyman Seo Eun Pyeong is the one who is garnering all the attention as a future political star.

191
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,140
Seo Eun Pyeong is a future presidential candidate.

192
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,520
That's wonderful.

193
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,050
Nice to meet you. I'm Seo Eun Pyeong.

194
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,990
"Nice to meet you, I'm Seo Eun Pyeong."

195
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,300
Nice to meet you, too.

196
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,290
I love Korea, and I would like for you to tell me more about it.

197
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,110
He says that he loves Korean culture very much, and looks forward to working with you, Assembleyman.

198
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,250
Thank you for your affection.

199
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:00,910
"Thank you so much."

200
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,350
Thank you so much. It's a pleasure.

201
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,470
You speak Italian very well.

202
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,480
Though I picked it up a little as foreign languages are fun, I lack depth.

203
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,140
Would you care for more champagne?

204
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,790
Oh, thank you.

205
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,370
Excuse me, but are you a model?

206
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,960
No, I'm a simple housewife.

207
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,060
I can't believe it. How is that possible?

208
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,350
Thanks a million.

209
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,470
You're welcome.

210
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,110
Be careful.

211
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,120
Thank you, Assembleyman.

212
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,590
Take it easy on the drinks.

213
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,830
CEO Kang's weekly Bar Association seminar happens on the 2nd floor here.

214
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,360
CEO asked you to come by and support it a bit. I think he happened to see you by chance.

215
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,770
I understand.

216
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,190
Then please continue with your conversations. I have a schedule I've got to keep.

217
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,660
Please excuse me.

218
00:23:53,110 --> 00:24:01,550
<i>[Event in Progress]</i>

219
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,360
Assembleyman, thank you for coming to

220
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,830
such a difficult occasion.

221
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,110
Don't be like this, Ra El.

222
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,850
Please treat me with ease.

223
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,540
We can certainly do so considering our connection.

224
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,160
I know you don't typically come to events like these.

225
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,650
Though I don't want to burden you,

226
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,930
it was necessary for me.

227
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,360
Will there be a way to repay you? Please let me know.

228
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,050
I know it.

229
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,220
Your incessant need to repay any kindness.

230
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,320
But don't worry too much. This wasn't for free.

231
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,330
I'll request a task, so make your payment in skill.

232
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,830
I think that Assembleyman Seo is quite taken with you.

233
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,090
I'm certain.

234
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,410
He's just a neighborhood friend I knew growing up.

235
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,500
I'm a married woman anyhow.

236
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,210
Of course, you're more tempting as a married woman. Forbidden fruit.

237
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,130
Goodness, Sis.

238
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,470
Anyway, thanks to you,

239
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,850
I became a capable woman.

240
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,910
You were originally a capable person that didn't have an opportunity.

241
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,450
Your wish to run a department store,

242
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,650
wouldn't it be fitting if you ran your sister-in-law's shopping mall?

243
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:52,400
Isn't Eun Dam Ri's shopping mall just as large as the Myeongam-dong mall?

244
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,840
<i>Your wish to run a department store...</i>

245
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,950
<i>wouldn't it be fitting if you ran your sister-in-law's shopping mall?</i>

246
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,690
We should send our kiddo

247
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,040
to Liyan Kindergarten.

248
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,520
Do you have a child that's kindergarten age?

249
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,190
Liyan kindergarten is a good place, CEO.

250
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,790
But the kid I'm speaking of is a middle schooler.

251
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,540
What?

252
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,820
I'm saying the one I want to send to the kindergarten is a middle schooler.

253
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,560
Crazy, right?

254
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:51,310
I'm saying Ms. Seon Bin, you are that charming.

255
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,210
Since you lit a fire in a man's heart,

256
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,490
take responsibility for it.

257
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,110
Thank you for being so complimentary.

258
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,630
It's more than that, I say.

259
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,970
Chairman Giovanni clearly liked Assembleyman Seo's attendance, no?

260
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,810
What do you think? I have the right to brag. Right?

261
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,620
That's right.

262
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,660
I don't require any premium brand items or cars for my birthday.

263
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,380
Give me something else.

264
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,010
Tell me.

265
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,620
Let's go to the suite of our hotel.

266
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,400
Decorate the entire room with my favorite roses.

267
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,310
I want to exchange our love all night.

268
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,390
Just like our honeymoon time.

269
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,270
Sister-in-law! What is that woman about?

270
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,550
Why did you bring a woman that's not fit for an event like this?

271
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,670
So cheap.

272
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,070
Why are you begrudging my little sis, Sister-in-law?

273
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,200
Can't you see?

274
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,430
You mean, how your husband is having a good time?

275
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:15,460
At least, he is being more gentlemanly towards my little sis than to any other woman. I'm so glad.

276
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,580
Are you trying to piss me off?

277
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,420
"Piss..." Oh my gosh, Sister-in-law.

278
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,210
How can you mention such a profane word...

279
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,140
You see that he's drunk.

280
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,430
<i>Because you ignored him, he got mad and drank!</i>

281
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,800
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

282
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,820
<i>Why do you say his cause of drinking is because of me?</i>

283
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,520
<i>Who else ignored him if not you?</i>

284
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,670
<i>Why are you always trying to cut me down, Sister-in-law?</i>

285
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,520
<i>Younger Sister-in-law, do you think you are someone special?</i>

286
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,580
<i>Are you saying that I do not matter at all?</i>

287
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,790
Then what are you, exactly?

288
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,740
Elder Brother.

289
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,050
You have imbibed too much.

290
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,590
- I'm not drunk.
- Why don't you take your leave?

291
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,780
Look here. Are you the older brother?

292
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,360
I am the older brother.

293
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,930
Ms. Seon Bin, isn't he a fool?

294
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,570
Let's go somewhere else.

295
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,760
I said please take your leave!

296
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,010
Look at this punk.

297
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,640
Come here you punk. Let go. Let go!

298
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,270
What do you think you're doing?

299
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,520
Are you not worried about how you appear to others?

300
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,200
How can you act like this when you say you care about how you appear to others?

301
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,540
What is your concern, Chairman?

302
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,990
At the very least, your brother doesn't seem a coward.

303
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,690
What?

304
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,250
Do you want to see me lose it?

305
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:20,530
Why do you think my action is because of you, Chairman?

306
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:25,320
Did you say I should wait, like a dog awaiting for its master?

307
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,120
Why should I?

308
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,550
I am no longer interested in you, Chairman.

309
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,540
What do you want?

310
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,260
Let's be together now.

311
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,660
<i>You were afraid that you'd fall in love.</i>

312
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,190
Let's get out of here, I say.

313
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,970
I was enamored by a moment's anger,

314
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,450
but I regained my senses, thanks to it.

315
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,620
My desire to be your "one-night stand" has disappeared.

316
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,530
That kind of treatment is not suitable for my preference.

317
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:49,170
If you want me, you should crawl to me. Beg me saying that you like me.

318
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:53,790
I will be the master, not you.

319
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,780
Do you remember the poker game?

320
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,350
The win or lose comes at the very end, only once.

321
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,800
Come to where I call you.

322
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:21,210
On your wife's birthday. This is a notice, not an invite.

323
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:30,490
If you show, you will have the whole me; but if you refuse, there are no second chances.

324
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,790
The choice is yours.

325
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,420
<i>[Kim Seon Bin Dance Studio]</i>

326
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:58,660
Adorama is a solo Tango dance without a partner.

327
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,540
It's called the art of free league. As much as that, it makes women beautiful.

328
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:12,310
Were you born for Tango, Ms. Han So Ra?

329
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,660
Your dance posture is remarkably beautiful.

330
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,680
- Is that right?
- I'm being serious.

331
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,060
With this much talent, you could debut at Milonga.

332
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,430
Don't you think?

333
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,550
What is Milonga?

334
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,350
It's a club where you dance Tango.

335
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,560
Everyone appears elegant in their garb.

336
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,440
I think they dance with strangers.

337
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,250
Since the topic was introduced, let's all go to a Tango club.

338
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,420
How about on your birthday, Madam?

339
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,430
Oh, that's a good idea. I agree!

340
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:48,870
Then, I'll scrutinize only the skilled dancers and plan a VIP party.

341
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,780
You are all planning my birthday party without my consent.

342
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,720
Madam changed her orders for her birthday party.

343
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,900
Again?

344
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,870
In the afternoon, parents' party. At night, busy with the event with the chairman.

345
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:09,130
As such, cancel the big surprise party.

346
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:13,250
Instead, prepare a subdued party.

347
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:17,560
We have to cancel the celebrity singer and the quartet.

348
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,400
A subdued surprise...

349
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,250
- What do you suppose that could mean?
- I mean, if it's subtle, then how can it be a surprise?

350
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,620
That's what I'm saying.

351
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,610
What do we do, Secretary Kim?

352
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,430
I think I'm going to be ill tomorrow.

353
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,020
Oh my gosh.

354
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,690
I wanted to gift you a tango dress.

355
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,720
Oh my word, it's beautiful.

356
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,190
I recommend this one for the debut at Milonga.

357
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:58,860
This... is for your birthday with the chairman.

358
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,620
Adorno, display it ever so slightly.

359
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,040
Just look at you. How can I not favor you?

360
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,160
So pretty.

361
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,440
- And my husband?
- The chairman is in his study.

362
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,080
Keep the hotel my husband reserved for my birthday from me a secret.

363
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,500
You know I like surprises.

364
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,300
Yes, Madam.

365
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:38,080
I said it clearly. I like surprises.

366
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,440
A subtle surprise.

367
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,370
I will look forward to it.

368
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,860
<i>Come to the place of my choice. On your wife's birthday.</i>

369
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,720
Da Bi.

370
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,530
Dad said he has to think about something.

371
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,320
That's why I have to

372
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,920
be quiet.

373
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
Ah, you're home.

374
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,460
Honey,

375
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,990
are you worrying about my birthday?

376
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,410
I'll like any place that you pick out.

377
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,710
Mommy, are you going somewhere?

378
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,660
Oh, Mommy and Daddy are going to a hotel on mommy's birthday.

379
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,580
Wow!

380
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,530
Madam, happy birthday.

381
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,720
There's nothing.

382
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,570
It's a subtle surprise.

383
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,160
We canceled the decorations and event.

384
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,800
Instead, we invited the Michellin chef from New York, Mr. Gabrielle, and prepared a feast.

385
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,100
How about my husband?

386
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,380
He went to work.

387
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,150
It's a handmade cake by Mr. Gabrielle.

391
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:44,280
You should have awakened me when he was going to work!

392
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,720
We apologize, Madam.

393
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,050
Chairman left very early, and we thought that perhaps he had prepared an event we were unaware of.

394
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,520
Get out of my way!

395
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,000
Chairman.

396
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,150
We made a reservation for the Meridian Hotel's suite.

397
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,810
Happy birthday.

398
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,880
It's a riding helmet.

399
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,270
Since your father loves riding, I figured you'd need one as well, Da Bi's mom.

400
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,820
I prepared a luncheon with the foundation personnel.

401
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,730
My birthday schedule doesn't allow for additional events.

402
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,920
Ah, I see.

403
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,020
You can go. Only come if I call you later at night.

404
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,800
Tonight's party is a secret.

405
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,690
- Yes, Madam.
- See you later...

406
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,500
Sis, you came?

407
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,460
What is it? Is something the matter?

408
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:48,760
Assembleyman Seo Eun Pyeong is requesting to meet. On your birthday of all days...

409
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,730
Conressman Seo Eun Pyeong is very important.

410
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:01,690
Of course, he comes first. Go on. There will be others at the party.

411
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,990
All the others will be here.

412
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,400
There are many chic people in Milonga.

413
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,150
You can elevate your expectation, Sis.

414
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,320
All right.

415
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,260
Assembleyman Seo.

416
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,810
Take good care of him.

417
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:56,900
Ms. Dam Ri, something came up and I can't make it to Milonga.

418
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,910
Would you mind handling Ms. Han So Ra's birthday?

419
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,090
- One, two.
<i>- One, two.</i>

One, two.

421

Why would we handle that woman's birthday?

422
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,750
Never mind. We won't go either.

00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:38,320
Today is my birthday. Today is my birth...

475
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:45,940
Today is my birthday.

476
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,700
Today is MY BIRTHDAY!!

477
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:50,480
In this project, among my designs,

478
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,240
your painting is most beautiful.

479
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,610
Starting from the minions, a safe source of funds, and power.

480
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,700
Moreover...

481
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:02,840
Okay.

482
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:09,980
Seo Eun Pyeong?

483
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,410
<i>[Seo Eun Pyeong]</i>

484
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:13,860
Seo Eun Pyeong will join us?

485
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,250
Look forward to it.

486
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,470
This one is going to be epic.

487
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,170
<i>[So Ra]</i>

488
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,170
What?!

489
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,620
Dad.

490
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:34,650
Today is my birthday.

491
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,650
But he...

492
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,910
turned off his phone and went somewhere else.

493
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:44,530
Even GPS won't work.

494
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,970
You still haven't found people to celebrate your birthday?

495
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,550
How can you succeed in any role, at this rate?

496
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:54,250
So frustrated. Hang up!

497
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:40,350
I prepared your bath.

498

<i>[Bo Ram's Mom]</i>

499

<i>Sister So Ra?</i>

500
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,480
Seon Bin.

501
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,690
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

502
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:10,680
<i>My birthday was ruined.</i>

503
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,370
<i>Milonga, the suite, everything.</i>

504
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:17,970
I love him to death.

505
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:22,730
<i>But I guess my way of loving is wrong.</i>

506
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:26,660
If you love someone, you can't grant them freedom.

507
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,620
What about your father?

508
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,870
Is he going to give you some work as a birthday present?

509
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:41,590
He has no intention of giving me any work.

510
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:45,400
Seon Bin, I'm so lonely.

511
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:52,000
Sis, should I come over?

512
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,700
You're the only one I have.

513
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,780
It's okay, I'm fine.

514
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,510
Just come tomorrow, not today.

515
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,890
<i>I'll help you...</i>

516
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:10,370
take over the mall.

517
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:14,390
Yes, let's do it.

518
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:17,920
I'll be the president and you can be the vice president.

519
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,640
Let's do it together.

520
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,050
Okay, Sis.

521
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,530
<i>The person you're trying to reach is unavailable.</i>

522
