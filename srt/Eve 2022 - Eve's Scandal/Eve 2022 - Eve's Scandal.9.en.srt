If this gets spread out, you'll get destroyed. Do you know that?!

24
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:37,380

Throw out all of those and erase them from your memory.

No, I'll bring it to him.

I'll go and warn him.

53

If you provoke him, Chairman Kang might come out more aggressively.

54

Then, should I stay quiet?

You crazy wench.

She's been crossing a line recently, so I'm teaching her manners.

112
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:08,050
While preparing for the event, she tested my patience by brazenly talking back to me.

113
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,870
When I'm the owner of her husband's company.

114
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,870
The arrogance.

115
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,910
Did I do that?

116
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,450
I did not know.

117
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,350
Don't let her in my sight, whether it be during class or events.

118

Until I officially decide on how to deal with her,

119
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,110
if anyone shows her kindness...

120
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,090
or befriends her, I'll interpret it as a challenge against me.

121
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,860
I'm sorry for ruining the mood.

122
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,810
But it's also important to properly discipline my subordinates.

Let's look at the next page.

129

I think there's a typo here, so fix this too.

130
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,390

Sit down.

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,890
Both you and I should say what's on our minds.

134
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,730
Don't you think so?

135
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,300
There's something I realized after what happened.

136
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,730
That you...

137
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,630
are such a novice.

138
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,150
I wouldn't have known if you didn't tell me that you were having an affair with my husband.

139
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,760
There were probably two reasons why you told me.

140
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,240
Either you couldn't control my husband or you wanted to break up our marriage.

141
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,300
That's the grand conclusion you came to?

142
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,950
My husband just wanted to relieve his momentary desire.

143
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,670
You think something so meaningless would ruin our relationship?

144
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,690
The couple that owns Korea's number one company?

145
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,680
Carry on.

146
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:33,230
There were countless women who tried to seduce him.

147
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,960
Naturally, right? They wanted to break us up and have him for themselves.

148
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,740
Is there even a relationship to break?

149
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,460
You haven't slept with your husband in five years.

150
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,090
Your delusional jealousy made you keep tabs on him.

151
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,540
The woman who checked for makeup powder out of anxiety.

152
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,660
Was it not you but someone else?

153
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,340
You're right. Our long-time conflict was a huge headache for me.

154
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,160
We needed revolutionary intervention.

155
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,430
You took on that role.

156
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,930
He comforted me with all his heart.

157
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,830
All night.

158
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,690
It was so nice.

159
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:33,000
We argued a little but decided to overcome this and come out stronger.

160
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,040
They say after a storm comes a calm.

161
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,050
Why? Is that not the case for you and your husband?

162
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,540
Don't beat around the bush and get to the point.

163
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,970
Do you know what I earned thanks to you?

164
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,510
Shopping mall.

165
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,170
He's even given me a managing position.

166
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:13,110
I'm now a proud director who has voting rights.

167
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,460
My husband admitted his mistake and said he'll boost my self-esteem.

168
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,580
We came to the wise decision to overcome this for our kid.

169
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,200
This is the world of adults.

170
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,450
Got it?

171
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,160
All right, let me get to why I really called you.

172
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,950
I can't just let you off, right?

173
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,530
You knew there would be consequences for messing with me.

174
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,500
You look like you could take a hit.

175
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,630
How thrilling.

176
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,920
Honey.

177
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,910
- Are you ready?
- Of course.

178
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,630
Honey, how do I look today?

179
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,670
You look great.

180
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,280
Call Korea Exchange that we're leaving now.

181
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,890
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go, Honey.

How could the face of a wife who found out about her husband's infidelity look like that?

194
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,780
Even I can't tell the difference...

00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,140
of whether it's all for show or they're actually happy.

196
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,090
Chairman Kang didn't say anything else afterward?

197
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,450
Did he contact you?

198
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,970
I think we need to consider things might not go according to our plan.

199
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,220
I doubt those two will ever get a divorce.

200
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,230
I'm worried about you whenever I think of what they did to your mother.

201
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,770
Let's try to come up with a plan.

202
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,040
Even if I come across the worst situation,

203
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,150
I have no regrets.

204
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,490
The person by the name of Lee Ra El...

205
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,240
never even existed in this world anyway.

206
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,470
The only person I'm worried about is Ms. Jang.

207
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,400
The person I call my mother.

208
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,490
If things go south for me, she'll need someone to take care of her.

209
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,510
Please help her.

210
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,880
Aren't you worried about yourself?

211
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,840
I'm sorry for burdening you.

212
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,140
No, don't be sorry.

213
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,170
I said I'll do anything you wish.

214
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,780
Rest. Thank you for everything.

Ra El.

216
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,760
You asked me before why I treat you so well.

217
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,850
I didn't want to pressure you,

218
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,400
so I hid my feelings toward you until now.

219
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,110
But now, I have changed my thoughts.

220
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,520
I will pressure you a bit.

221
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,420
How can you think there would be nobody who'd be sad if you disappeared from this world?

222
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,720
Even if there's nobody else, at least you have me.

223
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,390
You...

224
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,710
You are more important

225
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,110
than my own existence to me.

226
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,830

Also, I want you to feel the pressure.

There's someone who loves you this much in this world.

Also, I won't act like a shadow from now on.

I'll see my senior, who's a lawyer today.

259
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,810
And I'll discuss what Chairman Kang did.

260
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,310
- You're going to see a lawyer?
- Yes.

261
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,900
Chairman Kang is coercing us by abusing his power in the workplace.

262
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,940
He's threatening another person's family by abusing his power as chairman. I shouldn't let that happen.

Mrs. Han So Ra wants to see me soon.

269
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,540
She told me to come to the director's room.

<i> Lee Ra El will be able to make Han So Ra get divorced. </i>

Oh, my habit just popped out. Please pardon me.

280
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,670
It's fine. So Ra's mom was my best friend.

281
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,920
She's like a daughter to me.

00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,700
We are on the verge of appointing him, but I decided to work with him as soon as possible.

285
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,510
The first mission for me to do as chief secretary will be to open the General Assembly of the World Economic Council.

286
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,070
I think I'll have a lot of work to ask for your cooperation.

287
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,200
Of course, I should cooperate with all my enthusiasm.

288
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,040
Your teamwork will be great even before seeing it since you two are alumni.

- What is this?
- You'll know when you see it.

Why did you invite me here?

Please lead the organizing of the representatives of Korean people in business.

That's a very important role.

If you take the role, I would love to trust you and give you autonomy.

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,220
It wasn't much of a preparation.

313
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,390
As you can tell from seeing it, there will be more for you to work on.

You have so much faith in me.

<i> [Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom] </i>

318
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:18,330
<i>Chairman, I have something to discuss with you. Will it be okay to have a drink with me?</i>

319
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,790
<i>Yes.</i>

320
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,790
<i>Let's do so.</i>

321
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,990
<i>Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom!</i>

322
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,460
<i>- What is this?
- You'll know when you see it.</i>

323
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,390
<i>Chairman!</i>

324
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,170
A man gave a document to Chairman Kang.

325
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,060
<i> A document? </i>

326
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,620
I stopped Chairman Kang from opening it.

327
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,810
But that man was also a victim of the LY incident.

328
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,990
<i> Do you have any idea about this? </i>

329
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,060
Can you call Chairman Kang right now?

330
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,880
I'll do something about that document.

331
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,240
<i> [Kim Seon Bin] </i>

332
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:18,720
I couldn't show how happy I was to see you when I ran into you at the kindergarten.

333
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,970
<i> - You can understand me, right? </i>
- Of course.

334
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,900
Let's see each other soon.

335
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,560
Let's meet somewhere other than where we used to meet.

336
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,480
Where is that?

337
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,910
<i> There's a hotel where we have a lot of schedules. </i>

338
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,140
<i>Not just me, but for you as well,</i>

339
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,950
nobody will think it's weird for us to go in there.

340
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,050
You want to meet in a hotel?

341
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,470
<i>He's just relieving his temporary wants. </i>

342
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,260
<i> Do you think that will break our relationship? </i>

343
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,690
<i> The owner couple of Korea's number one company? </i>

344
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,570
<i> I miss you. </i>

345
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,530
Are you drunk?

346
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,810
A little bit.

347
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,470
So I miss you even more.

348
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,430
Please go home safely.

349
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,560
<i> Let's talk again soon. </i>

350
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,740
I'm going to reveal my real name and identity to the law firm next week.

351
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,670
It would've been perfect if we possessed the secret safe,

352
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:35,030
but now we have to expect the search and seizure after the lawsuit.

353
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,750
If I reveal that I'm the one who's filing the litigation, I need to clear out my stay in this house as well.

354
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,200
I can't stay here until my true identity gets caught by others.

355
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:49,620
Will you leave here with me?

356
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,980
Please give me some time.

357
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,690
Are you still having that dream?

358
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,080
The nightmare where you die.

359
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,060
Sometimes.

360
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,240
I always consoled you that that dream is far from reality.

361
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,450
I said you are this strong, so you wouldn't get hurt.

362
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:25,070
But these days, you probably have reasons to have that kind of dream.

363
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,630
That's what I thought.

364
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:33,290
It's because there's poison growing inside of your heart.

365
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:39,030
The poison that can take your life away... it's love.

366
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:45,010
It's a common story to ruin everything and even lose their lives all because of love.

367
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,110
It's because love makes humans weak.

368
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:51,720
I've known you since you were fifteen years old.

369
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,850
No matter how much you deny it, the important thing is I can see it.

370
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,630
Your love, Ra El.

371
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,980
It can burn down everything you built up until now one day.

372
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,200
I'll give you a call soon.

373
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,760
- I'll be waiting for it.
- Okay.

374
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,630
Have a good night.

375
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,020
<i> [Ra El] </i>

376
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,970
Yes. Thankfully, I got the document.

377
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:10,040
But, Ra El, I think you need to check this on your own.

378
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:20,640
<i> Kim Seon Bin is Lee Ra El, the only daughter of Lee Tae Joon of Gediks Semiconductors.</i>

379
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,990
<i> Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom, you need to know about the true identity of Kim Seon Bin. </i>

380
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:35,230
<i> Your love, Ra El, can burn down everything you built up until now one day. </i>

381
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:40,130
The person who knows this much about you...

382
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,610
Is it the one you call your mother?

383
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:58,470
<i> I handed the document safely to Chairman Kang.
[Kim Hyun Cheol] </i>

384
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,350
Where have you been?

385
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,040
I'm going to reveal my identity and put myself at the front.

386
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,780
I have a lot of things to prepare.

387
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:29,780
You know, about my dream.

388
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:34,860
That dream is not a nightmare, actually.

389
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,320
It's a dream where I kill everyone I want to murder.

390
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,730
So it's a dream where my wishes come true.

391
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,330
But you said you die at the end.

392
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,310
I lied to you.

393
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,300
One by one,

394
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,680
I kill the people I want to murder.

395
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,450
And I catch the most vicious devil

396
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,910
that I need to kill at the end.

397
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:18,310
<i>Even God turns away from that devil.</i>

398
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,440
<i>That devil is brutal...</i>

399
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,330
<i>and vicious.</i>

400
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,580
<i>That devil is...</i>

401
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,730
<i>myself.</i>

402
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,200
Even in the dream, I didn't want to become a demon like those people.

403
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,120
So I lied to you.

404
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,540
I'm going to stain my hands with blood.

405
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:06,450
But I still wanted to stay a good person.

406
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,280
Isn't that funny?

407
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,530
That a human can be this selfish?

408
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,480
But I woke up from that nonsense.

409
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,790
The real fear is not becoming the devil...

410
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,110
but losing.

411
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,360
You have to win in this fierce battle, no matter what.

412
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,280
Don't you agree?

413
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,530
So...

414
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,220
I'm going to take your advice as well.

415
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,080
You're right.

416
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,790
I've fallen for Chairman Kang.

417
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,310
A man and a woman.

418
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,950
It was a world that I didn't know.

419
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:56,770
My rationality gets paralyzed against my will.

420
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,340
I was terrified.

421
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,250
Also, I agree with you that I have nothing else but my body.

422
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,370
How about this?

423
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:21,060
The opponents are several incredibly powerful people.

424
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:27,660
There are a great many variables.

425
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,350
But I didn't take them into account.

426
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,010
I can't control all the variables.

427
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,230
But we can encroach in here.

428
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,050
Kang Yoon Kyeom has already fallen for me.

429
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,540
This means I can destroy him viciously.

430
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,840
I can make them suspicious and kill one another, too.

431
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:58,840
Those people who threw me into the pits of hell...

432
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,080
I...

433
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,380
I...

434
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,940
will have to cut their airways.

435
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,490
I will do better, Ms. Jang.

What did Father say?

450
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,930
Hey, the media is hounding him by calling it, "Troubles of the in-laws,"

451
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,910
and how Han Pan Ro is on a downward spiral. He's extremely moody.

452

00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,250
does that suddenly reverse the brawl we had in public with the in-laws?

477
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,970
It'll be quicker to find a way to scold Yoon Kyeom instead of So Ra.

478
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,880
Darn you!

479
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:19,890
Gosh, please, calm down. Don't be angry.

480
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,330
Darn it!

481
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,830
So Ra. So Ra, are you okay?

482
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,530
Are you okay?

483
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,340
<i>You have to practice for the concert. Come to the studio tomorrow.</i>

484
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:35,390
<i>- Contact Korea Exchange that we're heading out now.
- Yes, sir.</i>

485
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:53,950
<i>I want to beat every one of them to death.</i>

486
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,710
<i>The cheating scums are running wild and shamelessly.</i>

487
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:15,000
<i>But I couldn't do anything because of Dad.</i>

488
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,530
<i>Not even beating them to death would suffice.</i>

489
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:23,370
<i>I kept my temper in check to get the shopping mall and director position.</i>

490
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,400
<i>I want them all out of my sight.</i>

491
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,840
<i>How can I live feeling wronged like this?</i>

492
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,520
<i>I'm about to lose it.</i>

493
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,930
<i>[Kim Seon Bin Studio]</i>

494
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,170
I saw the CCTV footage from the day of the bag incident.

495
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,580
You switched the kids' bags.

496
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,180
How could you do that?

497
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,020
Seriously, I can't wrap my head around it.

498
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:11,900
It must've been her scheme to turn us against each other to claw her way into upper-class society.

499
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,640
Gosh, I can't believe this.

500
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,220
I thought better of you. How disappointing.

501
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:21,450
After deliberation, the Liyan Foundation has decided to kick Bo Ram out.

502
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:26,360
The concert team will break up, and you'll obviously be dismissed from your role as Vice-Chairman of the PTA.

503
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,580
You're laughing?

504
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,620
All that trouble was unnecessary.

505
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,440
I was going to break up the concert team anyway.

506
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,060
It has become useless now.

507
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,240
There's no need for you to come anymore.

508
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:01,640
Oh, right. Being kicked out of the kindergarten is a different story though.

509
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,120
It's not me who will be kicked out, but you, Han So Ra.

510
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,440
Why do you think she hates me this much?

511
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,790
Aren't you curious?

512
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:18,320
You two must be happy.

513
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:22,080
Nothing is more fun than watching others fight.

514
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,350
You can all leave.

515
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,190
<i>What's the song you gave?</i>

516
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:48,330
<i>My husband was swamped with work, so the mood wasn't romantic, but it wasn't bad.</i>

517
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,630
You have finally gone crazy.

518
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,460
Is that how I look?

519
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,890
Look at your face.

520
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,680
Madam!

521
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,890
What's your deal!

522
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:42,460
There are multiple CCTVs.

523
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,950
Is a man going to beat a lady up?

524
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:52,290
Go and play bodyguard at home.

525
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,380
You haven't left yet?

526
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:35,600
You psycho bitch.

527
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:53,360
"Psycho bitch"?

528
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,840
Madam, don't concern yourself with her.

529
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,920
Let's leave.

530
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:19,820
You pathetic wench.

531
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:22,440
You're a waste of my time.

538
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:38,070
I called you because I missed you, but realized I shouldn't.

539
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,820
I didn't want to disturb you.

This wench has completely lost her mind.

01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:30,180
How dare you call her!

545
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:33,120
<i>Then deliver this to her.</i>

546
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:38,500
<i>Han So Ra, you'll never think of the reason.</i>

547
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,410
Then that does make me a psycho bitch.

548
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:43,650
<i>You read me well.</i>

549
