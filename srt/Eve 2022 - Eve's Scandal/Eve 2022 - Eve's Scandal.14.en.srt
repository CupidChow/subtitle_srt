When I fell for temptation,

11
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,330
how much did you make fun of me?

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,400
I bet you were happy that it was going according to your plan.

I opened my heart to someone.

But the price for that is this.

You could've gotten caught. Why did you not run away?

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,970
It's because of the Gediks contract, isn't it?

26
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,350
- Where's the contract?
- I don't have it!

27

How can all of Gediks people be this stubborn?

Brother, please have some rest.

41
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,820

00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,650
- Okay, do it right.
- Yes, Sir.

43
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:09,150
Jang Moon Hee, you had better drop the lawsuit.

44
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,510
Write a statement saying it was all your conspiracy,

45
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,820

- So Ra, why would you take this woman out?

71

Jang Moon Hee? Who's that?

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,250
The one who placed a joint action lawsuit with the LY victims?

102

120
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,730
Do you know the meaning of what you just did?

121
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,560
Why don't you apologize to

122
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,550
the prime minister? It's not too late.

123
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,040
Don't butt in, Kim Jeong Cheol.

124
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,830
I'll be crystal clear with you.

125
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,710
Send back Jang Moon Hee.

126

Let's go.

127
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,410
I'll get going now.

128
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,800
We searched everywhere in Han Pan Ro's house, but...

129
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,010
we didn't see even a trace of her.

130
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,300
Ms. Jang...

131
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,280
The police are still looking for her. Let's wait.

132
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,150
Is something the matter?

133
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,550
Chairman Kang...

134
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,140
barged into the hangout. He saw everything.

135
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,640
Did he try to hurt you? That punk?

136
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,320
I did everything I could.

137
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,560
Let him be.

138
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,370
I hope we've seen the worst of each other.

139
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,350
Then it can't get any worse.

140
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,830
Dad! Dad, I'm sorry! Please let me live...

141
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,990
If you had released Jang Moon Hee, Seo Eun Pyeong would've seen you release her!

142
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,970
Then, what do you think would've happened to me?

143
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,040
I've put so much work into you! How dare you screw me over!

144
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,160
You don't deserve to live, either, just like your mother.

145
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,000
You might as well just die now!

146
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,850
Brother!

147
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,940
I took care of Jang Moon Hee.

148
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,110
Man-crazy wench.

149
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,220
Put this wnech away instead of Jang Moon Hee!

150
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,250

151

Dad...

152
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,560
What are you doing?

153
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,900

154
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,690
Dad...

155
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,430
Find her no matter what. If you can't find Lee Ra El,

156
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,020
find one of the two, between Jang Moon Hee or Seo Eun Pyeong.

157
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,380
Then we can find Lee Ra El.

158
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,380
Yes, Chairman.

All right. What's this?

162
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,090
Hello?

163
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,580
<i>This is the police. Is Jang Moon Hee your mother?</i>

164
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,510

Before the ministerial conference, I got attacked in the middle of the night.

Who would've done that? Was it a political force?

The one who was the former Prime Minister of this country.

414
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,120
And the number one company of this country who's connected with him by marriage. It's a power-related corruption by them.

415
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,710
Assault, murder, illegal mergers, and acquisitions.

416

Power-related corrupted businesses, and so on. There are countless.

They are people wanted and the most wanted.

You sent in Kang Yoon Kyeom to appease me, and Han So Ra was waiting for him?

477
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,900
That wasn't even an apology.

478
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,380
I'm going to kill her.

479
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:42,180
I'm going to kill them all.

480
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,140
Ra El!

481
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:58,370
Why are you here?

482
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:01,330
Then, why are you here?

483
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:14,080
Honey, you have nothing to be sorry for to her.

484
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,420
Please come to your senses!

485
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,310
You're the man who brought LY as the world's number one.

486
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:29,610
Why can't you overcome a crisis like this?

487
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:36,420
We can win if we work together.

488
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:44,530
Why did you do it?

489
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:50,350
Why did you do it, Da Bi's mother?

490
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,030
You already had power, money,

491
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,510
you had everything.

492
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,790
If I didn't have Gediks,

493
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,590
you wouldn't have married me.

494
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,400
I did it because I loved you.

495
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,080
Even now, you're all I have.

496
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,910
Honey.

497
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,340
That's not love.

498
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:30,620
Let me go now. Let me leave.

499
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,120
That's all I want.

500
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,600
You wanted Gediks!

501
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,530
You were desperate to fulfill that desire! That's why my dad and I have blood on our hands!

502
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:48,700
I did it so you didn't have to, so why are you being like this?

503
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,030
You even got more benefits than us!

504
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:57,330
No matter how much you want it, you and Lee Ra El are enemies.

505
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,340
<i>Death.</i>

506
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:02,540
<i>I want you, Han So Ra, Han Pan Ro, and Kim Jeong Cheol to die, and then it'll be even.</i>

507
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:07,490
<i>All four of you die. If someone refuses to die, then you kill them all,</i>

508
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:10,260
<i>and then die yourself at the end.</i>

509
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,680
<i>Then it'll end.</i>

510
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,930
You and I share a common destiny.

511
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,620
Are you listening to me?

512
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,850
Are you listening? Honey!

513
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:26,750
I asked you if you were listening to me.

514
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,020
If you leave that wench alone, you'll get hurt.

515
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:36,030
We need to work together and catch her, that's our fate!

516
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:44,880
All I had... was one wish.

517
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,850
Even if I couldn't love,

518
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,940
I just wanted...

519
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:04,130
to remain a good person to her. That was my wish.
