12
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,080
I didn't want you to turn your back on your family, so I called her.

00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,830
I just wondered and she thankfully helped me.

22
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,840
I think I was nervous.

23
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:27,170
It's not because you were nervous, but it was unbearably hard for you.

24
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,910
I only knew one thing, but not the other part.

25
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,170
I only blamed you for falling in love,

26
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,340
but I didn't know...

27
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,950
you were trying so hard not to love him.

28
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,140
If you want to follow your heart, you can hear blame from only one person.

29
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,240
From me.

30
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,700
What's the meaning underneath

31
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,020
for you to say that?

32
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,470
What can I say? You have to live your life.

Is this Eun Dam Ri? This is Han So Ra.

35
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,910
I'm fine. How can a daughter of a media company owner trust something like that?

36
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,320
The countersuit is for the show, and we'll never get divorced.

37
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,200
As you would've assumed, the other woman is Bo Ram's mom.

38
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,330
It is really Bo Ram's mom.

39
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,440
When did it all start? I doubted it until now.

40
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,280
But people don't know that the other woman is Bo Ram's mom, who's a married woman.

41
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,740
I'll allow your family company to cover it exclusively.

42
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,890
Also, about how she was having fun with guys while dancing.

43
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,370
I'll tell you about her usual behavior.

44
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,040
So why don't you cover it exclusively? People love provoking news.

45
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,850
- Send the material that you made to Eun Dam Ri's press company.
- Yes, Ma'am.

46
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:31,800
If I poke her from every angle, she can't help but have to crawl out.

Look how haggard you got!

53
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,760

54
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,600
Are you okay?

55
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,680

56
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,420
I feel like I'm going to die.

57
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,430
I understand that.

58
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,410
But don't ever think about a bad decision. You have to think about your child.

59
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,610
Auntie, can you meet up with my husband?

60
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,490
If the president couple tries to persuade him, how can he say no?

61
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,800
Okay, let's do so. I'll call in Chairman Kang and talk to him sternly.

62
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:54,620
- Oh, my So Ra! What should I do with you, poor thing?
- Auntie...

63
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,270
<i> I found where Kim Seon Bin and the chairman are.

64
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,210

<i>Where are they now?</i>

66
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,020
They are at the chairman's vacation house.

67
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,550
Catch her when my husband is not around.

68
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,160
I don't care if she dies while you are abducting her. Bring her to me, no matter what.

69
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,860
<i> Yes, Ma'am. </i>

70
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,070
Do you have a reason why you got into the Tango?

71
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,670
I started Tango while learning multiple dances after I stopped doing ballet.

72
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:59,240
Actually, I fell for the Tango the moment I saw it for the first time.

73
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,560
<i> Ms. Jang, I'm sending you a photo. </i>

<i>Welcome to our bar. This world is full of pain, but no wound can't be healed.</i>

75
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,860
<i>Feel that you can connect with others through the Tango without a conversation.</i>

76
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,460
<i>Tango is a dance where you communicate </i>

77
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,080
<i>and understand each other to heal.</i>

78

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,990
Shall we just run further away?

80
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:42,080
It's somehow ominous going back to Seoul.

81
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,800
You've never gone to Argentina, have you?

82
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,740
Since you like Tango, you'll love Buenos Aires.

83
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,880
If I'm with you,

84
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,140
I can leave behind everything and go.

85
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,380
Can you? It doesn't make any sense.

86
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,350
What's the secret that you are hiding from me?

87
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,600
I don't care about your past.

88
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,240
But the thing that's bothering you feels like it's an ongoing thing.

89
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,320
There's nothing like that.

90
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,740
Then, why did you collapse in the church?

91
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,500
What is it that you are afraid of?

92
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,920
I said there's nothing.

93
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,530
You did this again recently.

94
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,670
Please tell me what the reason is.

95
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,110
I finally gave a divorce notice to Bo Ram's dad.

96
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,480
Everything is so sudden. It's pressuring me, of course.

97
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,710
You have to tell me what you are hiding...

98
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,760
for us to be happy.

99
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,470
Han So Ra started an all-out attack against Ra El.

100
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,450
Saying that she's a married woman and has a moral issue.

101
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,580
At this rate, before the LY disintegrates,

102
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,460
Ra El's true identity will get revealed first.

103
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,860
What if it gets revealed while she's with Chairman Kang?

104
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,290
It's terrifying just thinking about it.

105

I know that you are helping Ra El.

109
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,570
She attempted suicide.

110
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,410
<i>After her parents' accident,</i>

111
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,310
<i>she had a severe panic disorder.</i>

112
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,040
<i>She had a huge mental issue,</i>

113
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,920
and it's still difficult to say whether she's fully healed.

114
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,620
I saw Ra El with Chairman Kang.

115
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,450
And she seemed unstable.

116
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,910
<i>She has started to hurt herself again.</i>

117
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,080
She loves him, but can't admit it.

118
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,520
And she's about to drag him down to hell, so she must feel terrible.

119
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,160
I have to use Ra El.

120
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,680
But I don't want to see...

121
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,850
a person dying again.

122
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,420
If she wants to choose Chairman Kang,

123
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,110
tell her to do so.

124
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,720
I cannot send my blessings.

125
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,390
Tell her to disappear as it is now...

126
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,980
or never come back to Seoul.

Ms. Jang Moon Hee came to see me.

130
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,070
If what I can see...

131
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,810
was also seen by Jang Moon Hee,

132
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,520
it's certain.

133
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,760
It's certain that you love Chairman Kang.

134

What do you want me to do?

135

If I leave, where should I go?

136
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,760
If I leave with Chairman Kang, are you two really going to accept it?

137
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,190
- It's not like that.
- If we allow it,

138
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,980
do you want to go with him?

139
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,560
Why are you talking about this unnecessary thing?

140
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,070
I heard that you were trying to kill yourself!

141
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,690
If you don't want to make me worry about you,

142
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,730
give up your feelings toward Chairman Kang.

143
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,490
I can't watch nor interrupt it.

144
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,990
And I definitely can't say for you two to leave like what Ms. Jang Moon Hee said.

145
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,190
That's why it's driving me crazy!

146
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,100
Go back inside.

147
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,710
I told you there's no need to respond to the press.

148
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,230
Whatever people say, just ignore it. Leave it alone for a while.

149
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,690
I'll still give the TF team work instructions,

150
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,220
so only tell the Team Leader to contact me separately.

<i> I just want you to be safe. </i>

160

162
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,020
Lawyer Seo, are you okay?

163
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,380
<i> Chief Secretary Seo. </i>

164
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,900
<i> I heard you know well about the woman who ruined my daughter's life. </i>

165
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,410
<i> Kim Seon Bin is like family to me. </i>

166
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,460
Run away!

167
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,540
Lawyer Seo!

168
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,710
No..!

169
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,390
Lawyer Seo.

170
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,100
- Haven't you found them yet?
- No, Sir.

171
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,550
Look around all the way out there, too.

172
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,280
Yes, Sir.

173
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,240
What did Seon Bin's mother say?

174
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,480
What about the security team or the police said?

175
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,150
Where are you now?

176
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,850
What? You attacked Seo Eun Pyeong?

177
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,210
Did Chief Secretary Seo see your face?

178
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,190
I-I think he couldn't see my face.

179
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,730
There was no street light over there.

180
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,350
How can you do work like that!

181
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,860
You...

182
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,990
You stabbed the Chief Secretary of the Blue House.

183
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,370
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

184
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,800
It's driving me crazy.

185
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,420
Find out now.

186
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,610
Look into how much he got injured.

187
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,810
Find out if he saw your face.

188
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,190
- Hurry up!
- Yes, Ma'am.

189
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,030
Are you sure you're not hurt?

190
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,560
Whose blood is this?

191
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,830
The man who came to rescue me got hurt.

192
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,440
Do you remember the face of the man who came to you?

193
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,120
Is that important? Whether it's that man or another man,

194
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,790
Madam will send more and that will be so easy for her.

195
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:04,420
This is an all-out war for me. Hiding in the shadows and being framed as the other woman...

196
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,800
I will not do it any longer.

197
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,230
<i>I'll present to you our future strategy alongside the leader who will lead LY.</i>

198
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,160
<i>Powerful leadership that will break through unfavorable factors.</i>

199
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,650
<i>As swift driving force is necessary,</i>

200
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,610
<i>we'll launch a Strategic Planning Office that will oversee all departments. </i>

201
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,070
We'll designate it as the Future Strategic Planning Office

202
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:17,190
and Kim Seon Bin who was in charge of listing LY Pay will oversee the office.

203
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,720
<i>I'm Kim Seon Bin.</i>

204
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,470
They say crisis brings opportunity.

205
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:38,330
I will turn the crisis that LY Group faces into a chance for a major twist.

206
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,900
It's a semiconductor silicon wafer.

207
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:46,130
Most semiconductor companies including LY choose to produce 12-inch types.

208
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,680
However, I suggest we revive the foundry to produce 8-inch types.

209
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,580
LY possesses core technology for producing

210
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,320
8-inch semiconductors from the genius businessman

211
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,770
Lee Tae Joon from a merger 13 years ago.

212
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:07,290
<i>Ra El, this is the original version of the semiconductor that I'm producing.</i>

213
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,040
<i>Wow...</i>

214
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,110
<i>At the time, Gediks Semiconductor technology took over the global market swiftly</i>

215
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,260
<i>and was the core technology that brought us into the smartphone era.</i>

216
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,530
<i>This is still the best technology in the 8-inch semiconductor market.</i>

217
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,650
This is the contract where the top five semiconductor foundries in the country

218
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,260
want an exclusive contract with LY.

<i>Legal Team, Development Team, Finance Team, Security Team, everyone...</i>

222
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,030
they will temporarily receive directions from the Future Strategic Planning Team.

223
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:43,390
I ask for your cooperation for the sake of LY.

224
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,100
He gave her a Strategic Planning Team?

225
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,040
That's the heart of the company!

226
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,600
Slush funds and whatnot, she could see everything!

227
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,990
But, Brother, that woman

228
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:23,170
brought in the top five semiconductor companies who have never cooperated with LY!

229
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,140
Is this something an ordinary woman can do?

230
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,840
Oh my! Oh God, my blood pressure!

231
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,310
Calm down...

232
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,320
Are you okay?

233
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:42,110
Prime Minister, it looks like the divorce settlement could be several hundred billion won.

234
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,140
We have a chance. Please don't worry.

235
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,470
Several hundred billion? That won't be enough to go around!

236
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:52,130
Brother, calm down. Calm down...

237
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,530

LY's madam and LY's director Han So Ra.

240
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:08,600
CEO Kang Yoon Kyeom disturbed corporate management due to his personal life and brought about the lowering of the company stock prices.

241
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,640
This is clearly an illegal act as an executive of the company.

242
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,140
We'll request compensation for damages.

243
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,850
Also, Ms. Han So Ra will take counteraction

244
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,790
regarding the division of property from the divorce.

245
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,000
The lawsuit is for the amount of 10 trillion won.

<i>Take it! Take the photo! 10 trillion?</i>

<i>[The lawsuit is for the amount of 10 trillion won.]</i>

When did I? Who filed my lawsuit without my permission!

249
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,690
Bring the car.

250
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,370
I won't get a divorce. I said I won't. Why are you doing this?

251

Hurry up and cancel the countersuit!

Your father was in a meeting. He barely managed to fall asleep. Please be quiet.

254
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,990
I'll never divorce him.

255
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,970
There is no divorce in my life!

256
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,780
Then what? Huh?

257
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,300
If you don't get divorced? How will you stop a man who left home saying he wants to leave you!

258
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,360
We just have to get rid of that wench.

259
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,080
I'll take that wench out of this life!

Pull yourself together, wench!

She's different from those women of the past.

The whole country is talking about you and that wench.

263

If you mess with her right now, all the past will come to the surface as well! Got that?

264
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,190
Gosh, Brother. You're right, Brother.

265

So Ra knows it, too. Please calm down.

He got rid of my mom and covered it up within the organization.

That's how it remained a perfect crime.

I have to recover quickly and leave, so I can protect you.

274

I thought murder was something one should never do.

275

And as bad as it is, there is one more thing one should not do.

And you're not?

280
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,480

Not before you met me.

I like it now much more than when I didn't know you.

283
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,390
I'm going to lie down for a bit.

284
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,940
<i>She started self-harming again.</i>

If you truly love Chairman Kang,

you can muster up the courage. It's okay.

290
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,450
But when I think of what you'll go through in the future,

00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:09,620
I hope you avoid all this and be at peace.

292
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:20,100
Now, I know why they say love isn't about possessing someone.

293
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:33,260
Gosh, it's so pretty. This one, too. It came out so nicely.

<i>Whoever gets to do it with one of them will get it.</i>

Isn't that crazy?

301
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,650
Han So Ra hired them.

302
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:06,620
The payment was each 100 million won and 300 million won. She offered 900 million won if they succeeded.

Where is the video of Ms. Eun Dam Ri?

310

- Answer me.
- Damn it...

311
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,610
I'm here to report Madam Han So Ra of LY Group

313

She gave us money and told us to do some terrible things.

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,090
- LY Group's Han So Ra?
- Yes.

315
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,690
She paid us 100 million won...

316
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:04,810
so we fell for it, and we were blinded by our greed.

317
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,500
I'm sorry.

My goodness, So Ra. That's a crime.

325

How could you do such a thing?

326
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,340
No, Aunt, there's a misunderstanding.

<i>I'm sure you've got a reason</i>

328
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,660

329
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,540

00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,150
Is it him?

333
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,090
This isn't real, right?

334
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,130
No... It can't be...

335
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,630
What are you doing? Make her leave!

336
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,020
Let go. Let go!

Madam! Madam!

338
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
Take her outside.

339
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,820
This is my house. How dare you tell me to leave!

340
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:23,290
Then, drag her out.

341
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,300
Are you crazy? Let go! Don't you know who I am?

342
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,860
Let go! Are you crazy?

343
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,480
Let go me! This is my house! Why should I leave?

344
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,850
Let go me!

345

00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,260
Honey.

349
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,050
Our time together...

350
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,210
wasn't all difficult.

351
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:52,500
We were happy when we bore our children, and we were happy watching them grow, Honey.

352
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,500
A married couple goes through good and bad, everything.

353
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,790
The countersuit. That's not a solution, Honey.

354
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:07,890
I'll cut my ties with my dad, and I'll only focus on my life with you.

355
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,140
Please give me one more chance, Honey...

356
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,350
It's too late.

357
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,920
Do you think it will be any different living with that wench? What? The physical relationship?

358
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,420
That doesn't last.

359
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,450
You get sick of each other when you live together. It's all the same.

360
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:35,770
You and I married as a transaction.

361
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,600
But for the first time, with a pure heart...

362
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:46,280
I only looked at the person. How could this be the same as before?

363
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,440
It's completely different. If you agree to the settlement,

364
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,290
I'll give you my assets. You won't be sorry.

365
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:57,410
I don't need money, Honey.

366
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,360
I want you.

367
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,060
You're the only man in my life.

368
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,130
Nothing can replace you, Honey.

369
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,620
Secretary Choi, take Madam Han home.

370
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,050
Nonsense...

371
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,360
Honey, don't go! Don't go!

372
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,870
Don't go, Honey! Honey!

<i>I'll create a new life and will do...</i>

376

Hey!

377
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,850
- Bo Ram, do you want me to show you my house?
- Sounds good!

378
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:07,020
If I live here, Da Bi will be disturbed.

379
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,500
I'll go home after a little while.

380
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,710
That's why I asked you to move into a new house.

381
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,950
Da Bi is happy to be home.

382
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,310
Chief Secretary Seo Eun Pyeong has confined himself at home.

383
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,810
If the issue with Seo Eun Pyeong is exposed, too, I'm...

384
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,360
Do whatever you have to do to stop it.

385
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,130
I'll be sure to stop it. Please regain your strength, Ma'am.

386
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,500
It's okay.

387
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,450
What's going on between Chief Secretary Seo and that wench?

388
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:37,660
What's the nature of their relationship that she went there with him? Does anything come to mind?

389
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,000
I did notice something strange.

390
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:46,410
That woman addressed Chief Secretary Seo a little strangely.

391
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,060
<i>Attorney, are you okay?</i>

392
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:54,910
Why would she call him "Attorney"? He quit law a long time ago.

393
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,420
Look into when, where, and how those two met.

394
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,860
Yes, Madam.

395
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,510
<i>I hid it in the secret locker for the toe shoes.</i>

396
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,780
<i>I know the password, too.</i>

397
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:30,770
I won't send the kids to kindergarten tomorrow and stay home with them.

398
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,650
I want to help Da Bi adjust to not having her mom around.

399
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,880
All right, then.

400

403
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,300
He's an orphan, but he's saying their parents were close?

404
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,510
I'll look into it more.

405
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,620
Wait, who?

406
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,420
What was the name of that wench's mom?

407
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,610
It's Jang Moon Hee.

Jang Moon Hee.

410
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,240
This name should sound completely new to me.

411
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,160
But why does it feel familiar?

412
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,730
Jang Moon Hee...

413
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,990
Jang Moon Hee...

Jang Moon Hee.

415
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,370
I remember.

416
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,760
Try it with this.

417
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,720
- Here.
- Okay.

418
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:13,430
Oh, right. Didn't you say you were leading a TF team meeting?

419
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,270
I can push that to tomorrow.

420
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,300
The company needs you.

421
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,610
The kids are together, so they'll be fine.

422

Just today.

423
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,970
It's because I'm worried about Da Bi.

424
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,610
All right then. I'll be back.

429
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:59,650
I will play the seeker.

four, five...

432
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,680
Bo Ram is a great seeker.

433
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,610
There's only one place she will never find us at.

Excuse me.

436

You called for me?

437

They want to play at the playground.

00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:07,030
You got caught?

475
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,940
Is he suspicious of you?

476
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,010
Not yet.

477
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,700
<i>[Teacher]</i>

478
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,890
<i>I'm sending you the pictures from the secret safe for now.</i>

479
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,110
Do you recognize this place?

480
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:13,420
It's my first time here, but I'm sure you came here often because of your daughter.

481
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,170
Your daughter was the LY semiconductor researcher who died, right?

482
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:24,370
Gosh, my memory is pretty good.

483
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,390
Don't you agree, Do Hwan?

484
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,170
Let's take some time to solve a few riddles.

485
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:45,050
Why does a woman who protested about losing her daughter suddenly have another daughter?

486
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:52,500
Kim Seon Bin. Did you adopt a fully grown adult?

487
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,560
What are you and Kim Seon Bin?

488
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,980
Why do you two unrelated women pretend to be family?

489
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:15,770
You two. Did you approach us on purpose?

490
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:22,690
Just because one lowly researcher died, did you come to mess us up with this petty revenge?

491
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:00,170
I love this kind of stuff.

492
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,980
It's thrilling.

493
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,580
Shall we have a drink?

494
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:59,830
You said you were going to see your mother. Did you?

495
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,170
Yes.

496
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:10,970
Can you explain what this unsettling feeling is?

497
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:14,390
What feels unsettling?

498
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:16,420
You.

499
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:23,290
It is exactly as I explained.

500
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:26,360
We were simply playing hide and seek.

501
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:33,040
But why do you feel so distant to me?

502
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,970
We are living together.

503
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:40,270
You shouldn't feel distant.

504
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:43,050
That's why it is an irony.

505
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:51,790
I am crazy about you, but I'm not dumb.

506
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:57,520
Don't let me search for the answer to why I feel this way myself.

507
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:16,300
Madam, it's been so long since I've seen you this lively.

508
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,510
- Secretary Kim.
- Yes?

509
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:23,650
You're smart enough to find out Chairman's schedule, right?

510
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:28,950
I want to meet him and that wench together. Is it possible?

511
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,240
I'll look right into it.

512
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:48,380
You pull off the CEO look pretty well now.

513
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,970
I guess I should say a lowly commoner has turned her life around.

514
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,410
It seems you have no pride either, Han So Ra.

515
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:04,290
Seeing that you're stalking me, too.

516
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:12,330
It is over for you now.

517
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,340
Lee Ra El.

518
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,990
Lee Ra El.

519
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:30,110
Lee Ra El.

520
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,900
Look at your face.

521
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,570
I haven't felt this satisfied in a long time.

522
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,500
Yes, Secretary Kim?

523
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,150
Chairman has arrived?

524
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:06,600
All right.

525
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,380
How is my husband?

526
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,950
Take the kids elsewhere. Make sure they don't come.

527
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,530
Yes, Sir.

528
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:38,190
You won't let me see my daughter?

529
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,890
Isn't that too cold?

530
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:44,910
Must you stoop this low?

531
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,370
Leave before you get humiliated.

532
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,740
You will end up thanking me.

533
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,110
What are you doing? Come over and sit.

534
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:36,750
Honey, you don't know who this woman is. Right?

535
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:45,150
I will tell you.

536
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:49,090
Your tricks won't work, so stop.

537
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:05,480
This is Kim Seon Bin's middle school entrance picture.

538
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,370
But her name is different.

539
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:17,530
Lee Ra El.

540
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:19,710
<i>[Lee Ra El]</i>

541
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:23,180
♫ <i>Don’t say a thing</i> ♫

542
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,280

♫ <i>From my shadowed heart</i> ♫

545
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:35,860
♫ <i>Too far away</i> ♫

546
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,090
♫ <i>To go back in time</i> ♫

547
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:42,010
♫ <i>Close your eyes</i> ♫

548
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:45,910
♫ <i>Just feel me lose my mind</i> ♫

549
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,110
♫ <i>Just feel me lose my mind</i> ♫

550
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:57,880
♫ <i>Oh, find the lost hours of our love</i> ♫

00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:04,560

♫ <i>These feelings won’t fade. Hold me tight</i> ♫

553
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:17,020
<i>[Eve]</i>

554
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:21,350
<i>I dropped a single drop of suspicion. It will blacken both of you.</i>

555
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:27,630
<i>I'm confident because I don't see a man who is suspicious and tails her as a competitor.</i>

556
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:29,090
<i>Follow her.</i>

557
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:30,660
<i>Why aren't you picking up, Do Hwan?</i>

558
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,570
<i>We have to send Jang Moon Hee.</i>

559
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:33,990
<i>That evil wench.</i>

560
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:35,710
<i>Send back Jang Moon Hee.</i>

561
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:37,140
<i>A group formed of LY victims?</i>

562
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:40,320
<i>I have the will to hand over the embezzlement records of LY's employees to the prosecutors.</i>

563
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,490
<i>There is a tape-recorder.</i>

564
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:44,270
<i>I have secured the original copy of the Gediks contract.</i>

565
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:48,200
<i>I'm going to leave Chairman Kang's side.</i>
