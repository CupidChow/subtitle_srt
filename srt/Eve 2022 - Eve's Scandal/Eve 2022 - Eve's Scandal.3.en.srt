What do you think after giving me a facial? Don't you think there's a change in me?

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,160
Yes, Madam. Since you take care of yourself consistently despite your busy schedule,

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,010
your elasticity has improved.

13

I mean, can't you tell it's gotten better than usual?

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,110
Of course, it looks good. Your complexion is much smoother.

Would you like to see the result?

00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,360
- Here you go.
- Not from the facial!

17
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,210
I asked if you noticed the natural collagen.

18
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,520
Natural collagen?

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,510
Naturally produced collagen after being loved by my husband.

20
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,520
Yes, I noticed it.

- Not always! Lately!

Yes, I did notice.

Are you asking for a different list of plastic surgeons other than Dr. Oh, Madam?

27
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,590
I said OB/GYN. What do you mean plastic surgeons?

28
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,800
I wasn't aware that OB/GYNs performed plastic surgeries.

Don't you know vaginal plastic surgery?

Yes, Ma'am.

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,600
It's a Christian Louboutin custom-made order. Made for only one person.

Dam Ri's initials are on the shoulder strap!

78
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,490
Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom made a request at the headquarters.

79
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,470
Chairman Kang did that personally?

80
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,300
He's worried about No Eul's injury.

81
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,660
He asked me to convey how apologetic he is.

82
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,420
I gave him the hint regarding the gift. What do you think?

83
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,050
How did you know what I liked?

84
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,590
I scanned through some info. I worked as a reporter at Maximums.

85
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:26,900
Luxury brand magazine Maximums? Then you must know all the schedules of fashion shows and new releases.

86
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,660
It's a part of my day-to-day.

87
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,640
- It's nice.
- Pretty good.

88
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,470
The chairman should come in person and apologize to you as well, right?

89
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,080
That'd be nice, but...

90
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,090
He does seem pretty swamped.

91
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,370
Something like this is more practical, however.

92
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,830
How lucky! I wish Han So Ra's daughter would fight with my child, too.

93
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,500
Don't ask for it.

94
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,540
In any case, I'm still so irritated whenever I think of Han So Ra.

95
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,890
I know!

96
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,180
I do know a way to mess with Han So Ra.

97
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,000
Are you interested?

98
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,560
Who sent these?

99
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,070
A parent from the kindergarten PTA is here.

100
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,450
Hello, Madam. I'm the temporary PTA president.

101
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,320
Eun Dam Ri is reflecting on her wrongdoings very much and sent them to apologize to you.

102
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,830
Please forgive her generously.

103
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,300
Doesn't Eun Dam Ri have a mouth or legs?

104
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,170
She's just afraid of being denied.

105
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,870
Eun Dam Ri looked faint-hearted.

106
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,480
There are tons of PTA events to plan, but they're all on hold.

107
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,530
Please come and resolve the situation, Madam.

108
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,900
You're the president.

109
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,530
Why am I the president? We didn't even vote on it.

110
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:20,000
As the temporary president, I called everyone. Everyone voted for you unanimously, Madam.

111
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,640
You'll be in charge of the parent meeting, right?

112
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,220
These look like Lisa Ecule shoes.

113
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,840
Lisa Ecule shoes?

114
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,680
La Quatorze changed their designer.

115
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,960
The new designer is trying to be eco-friendly.

116
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,060
The design stands out even more.

117
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,730
It suits your noblesse oblige mindset, too.

118
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,480
Oh my.

119
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,150
Even your feet are elegant.

120
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,840
You're so lucky.

121
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,280
You speak well.

122
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,490
If there's anything you need, let me know.

123
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,340
I'm especially useful when it comes to shopping.

124
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,090
Why would he go somewhere like that?

125
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,910
He said he would go without his driver, so we don't know the reason.

126
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,540
It's your birthday soon, so it might have something to do with that.

127
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,740
You think so?

128
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,060
This is Ra El for sure. Her gaze.

129
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,390
I remember it clearly. But why...

130
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,730
why did she pretend not to know me?

131
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,790
Why is she living with a new identity?

132
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,170
This is related to Chairman Kang, isn't it?

133
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,970
Please look into the family she's living with.

134
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,480
But she said herself it isn't her, Assemblyman.

135
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,120
Chief Kim, should I order someone else, then?

136
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,000
No. I was just worried.

137
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,670
If you want it, then I will do it for you.

138
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,640
I'll ask this of you.

139
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,950
Then that means the rumor of Jeong Ye Na and Park Jin Woo having an affair was true?

140
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:14,090
Pictures of them together have been going around. I'll send them to you, too.

141
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,710
I couldn't believe my own eyes.

142
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,350
This is why you can't tell who someone is from the outside.

143
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,860
Eun Dam Ri and Yeo Ji Hwi look elegant, don't they?

144
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,020
There are rumors everywhere that they love to play around.

145
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,810
No wonder. Even if they're wealthy, they're not like you.

146
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,450
They're like knockoff designers, incapable of true elegance.

147
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,740
What a great analogy. Knockoffs.

148
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,710
How funny.

149
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,930
Madam, take a look in the mirror.

150
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,600
The concept is nice.

151
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,150
I like it.

152
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,260
How about finding a fit model who has the same physique as you?

153
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,700
You can make them wear clothes often and look at outfits objectively.

154
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,140
I heard all the ladies of the British royal family have one.

155
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,710
Having you is better than having ten shoppers.

156
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,020
Please look for me often, Madam.

157
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,450
Liyan has a lot of events. Would you like to be the deputy representative?

158
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,860
You can prepare events with me and talk on the side as well.

159
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,590
What do you think?

160
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,090
I'd love to, Madam. I mean... President?

161
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,010
I must have been too excited. How should I address you?

162
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,890
Call me Sis. When people are around...

163
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,640
Madam.

164
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,490
Sis?

165
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,010
What about my husband?

166
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,450
He's in the chairman's study room.

167
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,310
Bring a wine to the study. Set the bedroom up romantically.

168
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,100
Yes, Madam.

169
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,510
Honey.

170
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,440
What's the matter?

171
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,290
Honey, let's have a glass of wine.

172
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,020
You want to invite Jang Jin Wook and his wife to Se Hoon Jeong?

173
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,280
I'm not sure.

174
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,700
We've never called a subordinate before.

175
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,480
Don't think of them as subordinates, think of it as a meeting for preschool parents.

176
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,850
She seems smart, so I'm thinking of making her one of my people.

177
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,480
I want Bo Ram's mom to come to Se Hoon Jeong.

178
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,000
Honey.

179
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,230
What the elders want is one thing, but

180
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,870
I want children the most.

181
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,360
A son who looks just like you.

182
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,200
Honey.

183
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,000
Here.

184
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,950
<i>[Hogwanwon]</i>

185
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,050
Thank you, Son-in-law Jang.

186
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,800
Really, Unnie?

187
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,790
Are you really inviting me to Se Hoon Jeong?

188
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,540
By Se Hoon Jeong, does that mean the Chairman's villa?

189
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,820
I'd love to. I'll practice playing games from now on.

190
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,540
By the way, what's the music you gave me?

191
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,050
I couldn't set a romantic mood because he was busy,

192
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,420
<i>but the mood wasn't bad.</i>

193
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,800
Did the chairman like it?

194
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,560
Yes, Sis.

195
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,740
Thank you for inviting me. Good night.

196
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,040
Did you really get invited to the chairman's villa?

197
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,100
- Is that true, Honey?
- Yes.

198
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,570
You should start calling me the Queen of Connections from now on.

199
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,120
Really? It's true? Honey, thank you.

200
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,160
Mother-in-law, thank you.

201
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,610
I should bow to you. Actually, let me do it now.

202
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,590
Thank you.

203
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,600
You've bowed enough now.

204
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,600
<i>[Kim Seon Bin]</i>

205
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:12,680
Being invited to Chairman Kang's villa is an incredible opportunity.

206
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,540
You have to figure out the location of his account book or safe.

207
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,160
Han Pan Ro's home, Kang Yoon Kyum's home, Se Hoon Jeong.

208
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,870
Out of those three, the safe is definitely there.

209
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,820
I'll look for a chance to get in the house as well.

210
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,390
I can just use Han So Ra.

211
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:36,300
A woman like Han So Ra can turn her back in an instant, too. You must be careful.

212
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes, Teacher.

213
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,040
It's a restricted number.

214
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,300
Hello?

215
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,580
<i>It's Kang Yoon Kyeom.</i>

216
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,930
I should've apologized to No Eul's mother, but I was late.

217
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,970
I overstepped my boundaries and got involved.

218
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,600
Please forgive me, Chairman.

219
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,470
What do you mean to forgive, I'm thankful.

220
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,190
<i>By the way,</i>

221
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,200
Madam invited me to Se Hoon Jeong.

222
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,440
Will I be able to see you...

223
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,770
at the villa?

224
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,360
I look forward to it.

225
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,190
I meant I look forward to the event.

226
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,270
Yes, Chairman. If you give me the date, I will go to you.

227
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,990
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Yes.

228
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,880
<i> [Kim Seon Bin]</i>

229
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:14,160
Kang Yoon Kyeom, who is known to keep his private life extremely confidential,

230
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,180
contacted you separately?

231
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,610
Ra El, you're doing very well.

232
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,020
He might have another phone.

233
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,200
It seems like Han So Ra had his first phone tracked.

234
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,020
The caller is hiding their number.

235
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,750
I think they know that they are getting traced.

236
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,400
The richest person in Korea...

237
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,360
is being surveilled.

238
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,660
After living in a prison that he chose,

239
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,680
now is the time for him to fall into the hell that we designed.

240
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,560
I told you that Chairman is not here.

241
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,820
At the time when Vice-Chairman has to report,

242
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,990
he's not here all the time.

243
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,850
Then can I take that as he's avoiding me?

244
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,260
I have no idea.

245
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh, my.

246
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,910
Okay.

247
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:39,200
Brother! I can't live like this, it's too miserable!

248
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,550
My son-in-law is outcasting me!

249
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,460
It feels awful, but what can I do? I have to solve it nicely.

250
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,250
Yes, yes.

251
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:59,490
When I open a second location in Cheongdam-dong, there will be many of our people, so make a lot of time.

252
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,310
Thanks to you, I think we should open a second location, too.

253
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,940
Good luck with your work.

254
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,080
I heard that the Chairman's vacation home is like a palace.

255
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,310
And that rumor is true.

256
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,900
How can this kind of place exist in the middle of Seoul?

257
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,210
<i>You look so pretty, my gosh.</i>

258
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,530
We should go for a trail ride in Jeju someday. I'll get things ready.

259
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,920
Oh, absolutely! Let's set a date for it.

260
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,400
Okay, cheers.

261
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,340
Cheers!

262
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,710
Wow!

263
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,420
Yoon Kyeom, the new member has arrived.

264
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,180
You're here? Welcome.

265
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,220
Thank you so much for inviting us, Chairman.

266
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,890
She's a close friend of mine.

267
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,980
Did you make a new friend?

268
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,360
Since you are a queen,

269
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,590
I thought you would never make a friend. But you are totally my type!

270
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,930
Sa Yeol!

271
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,260
Why don't you go back to your conversation? We'll look around a bit.

272
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,840
Okay, please do so.

273
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,540
- Did you come to work, President?
- Thank you for your hard work.

274
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,940
<i> [Caller number display restricted] </i>

275
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,930
- Who is this?
<i>- Madam Jeong, it's me. </i>

276
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,100
- Excuse me?
<i>- It's me. </i>

277

Who is this again?

278
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,330
You are here for the first time,

279
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,620
how can you play better than us, who played for twenty years?

280
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,260
Must be beginners luck.

281
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,800
You're pretending to be a beginner and have a poker face.

282
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,060
Wow, you are a total player. Don't you think so, Yoon Kyeom?

283
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,200
The real person with the skill is Chairman's wife.

284
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,140
I got a lucky set of cards, but she plays well even with an unlucky hand.

285
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,690
Did you hear that?

286
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:50,940
I guess you totally got into your husband's hobby!

287
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,220
Until the game is over, I'll concentrate.

288
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,730
Yes, Ma'am.

289
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,350
I'm not quite sure.

290
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,480
Without seeing my cards, I'll go all in.

291
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,310
Really?

292
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,530
Wow!

293
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,630
I know our Kyeom well, and his expression right now...

294
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,980
means a high pair or airline, at least.

295
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,550
Why don't you bet just half of that?

296
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,820
Are you giving up the game?

297
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,130
It's not giving up, but taking the chance.

298
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,830
If I don't risk everything, the game will never end.

299
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,900
I'll go all in, too!

300
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,980
Yoon Kyeom.

301
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,350
All in.

302
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,990
Wait! One second!

303
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:19,280
All of these chips will go to only one person.

304
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,430
Okay? Good.

305
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,930
Let's see the cards.

306
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,470
I have two pairs.

307
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,250
What about you, Honey?

308
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,950
I'm so curious, it's driving me crazy!

309
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,550
Yoon Kyeom, why don't you open your cards?

310
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,100
If he wins, it'll be mine anyway!

311
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,450
Wow, you were thinking of that!

312
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,690
Are you two a gambling couple?

313
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,960
Congratulations, Chairman.

314
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,210
Wait.

315
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,810
You have to check the last player's cards, too.

316
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,570
It's an Ace full house. How can you win over that?

317
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,490
That's right.

318
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,900
It's a game I can't win.

319
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,560
But since I bet everything, I'll test my luck.

320
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:36,170
Wait! Wait!

321
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,640
K full house.

322
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,840
That's an amazing card as well, but you'll still lose to our Kyeom.

323
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,650
This is crazy! This is an incredible game!

324
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,830
It's the four-card! Kyeom, the four-card came out!

325
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,700
I've never seen something like this before!

326
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,230
How can it be a game of Ace full house and four-card?

327
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,880
It's unbelievable!

328
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,630
Wow, amazing!

329
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,170
If a beautiful woman like you is a great gambler, everyone would fall for your tricks.

330
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,970
If you are a real great gambler, please go easy on me.

331
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,520
How can I marry a great woman as you did?

332
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,110
The trick is... saving a country in your former life.

333
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,120
Thank you.

334
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,240
Chairman, I think it's an urgent call.

335
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,500
What car accident?

336
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,630
<i> Madam Jeong got attacked by a car. </i>

337
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:18,130
<i> It's the same way as what happened to Singer Ji Hyeon Ah tragically. </i>

338
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,820
Let's talk tomorrow.

339
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:45,090
Chairman, I want to thank you.

340
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,840
Thank me for what?

341
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,680
You intervened amongst the mothers and trusted me.

342
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,550
You also invited me to the vacation home.

343
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,830
It's tango music.

344
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,760
I played it myself.

345
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,420
They say there are two types who fall in love with tango.

346
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:25,550
Those who like tango and those who need it.

347
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,950
Who are those who need it?

348
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,930
Probably people who need to be healed.

349
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,350
Tango is a communal dance.

350
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,530
You heal your wounds through the other person.

351
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:52,990
The day I tangoed with you, I felt an unexplainable connection.

352
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,970
Have you heard of the term "twin flame"?

353
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,710
It's when one soul is split into two, like a twin.

354
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,880
The two souls instantly recognize each other the moment they meet; they're lovers.

355
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,250
I thought that this must be how it feels...

356
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:26,710
when one meets their twin flame.

357
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,240
I felt there was a void in you.

358
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,210
I wanted to fill it for you.

359
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,510
What are you doing right now?

360
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:01,350
Bo Ram's Mother, I asked, "What are you doing?"

361
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,680
That day, when I tangoed with you,

362
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,220
- it was so intense.
- I'm not stupid.

363
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,360
You have given me multiple memories that were thrilling.

364
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,460
Do you have the results of the analysis data you've been gathering about me?

365
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,540
I'm someone you think is your twin flame.

366
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm your other half and I need to be healed?

367
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,060
Did you see a need for healing in me that I didn't know of?

368
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:46,960
I don't need to be healed nor do I have any wounds, so naturally I'm vexed.

369
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:54,280
I have a pretty accurate signal system.

370
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,480
It's my signal that senses danger.

371
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,970
I feel danger from you.

372
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,900
In a very bad way, too.

373
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,830
I have no feelings or emotions towards you.

374
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,370
Do not come any closer to me.

375
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,480
Do you understand?

376
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,900
I will remember you don't like being analyzed.

377
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,530
The music should be to your liking.

378
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,670
Your signal might sense danger, but mine senses a man's reaction.

379
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,830
You have no feelings towards me?

380
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,740
Then, why did you come to my studio?

381
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,240
Why did you invite me and call me, too?

382
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,140
They say in a twin flame, one is a runner and the other is a chaser.

383
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:39,110
I don't know if we are a twin flame,

384
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,970
but it seems clear that you are the runner.

385
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,100
What took you so long?

386
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,190
You look pale.

387
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,040
My period just started.

388
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,450
Are you sure you don't have to go home?

389
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,640
Hello!

390
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,640
Excuse me. Please excuse me.

391
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:36,020
Where is the chairman?

392
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,710
Chairman.

393
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,930
Chairman!

394
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:45,290
Where is our dear chairman?

395
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,450
Chairman!

396
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,700
Chairman! Hello?

397
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,330
How did you get here?

398
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,440
Oh, Chairman!

399
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,660
I am the vice-chairman,

400
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,660
but it's such a struggle to see you.

401
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,120
I figured you'd never invite me here,

402
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,680
so I invited myself to see you.

403
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,120
Chairman, you are too coldhearted.

404
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,420
Gosh, why—

405
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,700
Wh-Wh-What am I saying?

406
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,500
Gosh, I must be drunk. I'm causing a scene here.

407
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,600
I'm just kidding. It's just a joke.

408
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,590
Can you take care of him?

409
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:32,020
They must be on good terms.

410
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,890
Honey, are you okay?

411
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,680
Yes, I'm fine.

412
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,280
Gosh, I have only heard about this place.

413
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,110
Goodness, how impressive. It's so grand.

414
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,090
Chairman, I also...

415
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,580
want to be in your inner circle.

416
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,640
Let's meet somewhere else.

417
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,110
I'm already here, but you want me to leave?

418
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,630
Come on, that's mean.

419
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,670
Do you know all the trouble I went through...

420
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,450
because I had to clean up Madam Jeong's mess—

421
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,810
Gosh, the darn alcohol, alcohol, alcohol.

422
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,670
Get it together!

423
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,870
Don't be like that.

424
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,660
Let me in, too.

425
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,760
Chairman Kang.

426
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,150
Do you know how to play games?

427
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,350
- What?
- Come this way.

428
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,050
I like gambling.

429
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,660
So Ra, you're the best.

430
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,270
Thank you. Thank you.

431
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,530
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

432
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,650
My apologies. Excuse me.

433
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:02,150
Gosh, who is that beauty?

434
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,620
I know everyone else,

435
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,580
but I think we have never met.

436
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,810
She's the mom of Da Bi's friend.

437
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:12,470
He's the vice-chairman of LY.

438
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,470
It's nice to meet you.

439
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,250
Yes, hi.

440
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,300
But...

441
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,320
is something wrong with my eyes?

442
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,360
I thought you were a university student.

443
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,080
A university student!

444
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,480
She got married young, so she's still in her 20s.

445
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,170
This is her husband, our company's general manager, Jang Jin Wook.

446
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,320
Oh, General Manager Jang!

447
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,260
It's nice to meet you, Vice-Chairman. I'm Jang Jin Wook.

448
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,150
Oh, yes.

449
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,650
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me for a moment.

450
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,700
Yes, Chief Kim?

451
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,300
<i>Assemblyman! I found out something huge after digging into Kim Seon Bin's husband.</i>

452
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,060
<i>I'm heading over to your place right now, so I'll tell you there.</i>

453
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,740
What are you doing right now?

454
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,510
I-It was a mistake. I was taking off the thread...

455
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,470
Please let me go.

456
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:42,070
It became all in again!

457
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:45,180
I can't help it. So Ra, can you hand me over some more chips?

458
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,890
Aren't you playing too much because it's not real money? I think you should stop here.

459
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,510
Just one more last time!

460
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:55,250
Last chance! Okay!

461
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:58,890
I feel like I can win if we play one more time!

462
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:02,030
- I said, let's stop playing it.
- Why don't you stop now?

463
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,750
Honey.

464
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,890
Okay.

465
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:10,440
Stop it.

466
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,160
- I have to go now.
- Thank you.

467
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,270
Director Jang Jin Wook got married three years ago to his wife now.

468
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,020
If it's been three years, what about the child we saw before?

469
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,830
She looked like she would be a kindergartener.

470
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:27,570
She's a daughter from his first marriage. He divorced the child's mother.

471
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,960
He got married again and his mother-in-law lives with them. They are a regular family with no issues.

472
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,450
But the first workplace of Director Jang Jin Wook is a total shock.

473
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,060
What was it?

474
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,150
It was Gediks Semiconductors.

475
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:51,040
When that incident happened thirteen years ago, he was a new employee at Gediks Semiconductors.

476
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:59,550
Honey, I think every guest today fell for you.

477
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:04,930
It seemed like everyone was confused about why you chose a regular guy like me.

478
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:07,790
So I was convinced once more.

479
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:11,720
I won a lottery in this life!

480
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:17,910
On top of having a perfect wife like you, I even went to the Se Hoon Jeong.

481
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,540
It feels like a dream.

482
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,170
Honey, am I okay to be this happy?

483
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,860
Of course.

484
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,000
Of course, you can.

485
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,450
There are tons of employees who switched to LY from Gediks.

486
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,310
But why Jang Jin Wook?

487
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:40,430
He worked with Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom in Buenos Aires.

488
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,370
And Jang Jin Wook, this person...

489
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:49,200
He was one of the people who actively participated in handing over Gediks to LY.

490
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,150
We're home, Mother-in-law!

491
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:56,250
How was it? Was Se Hoon Jeong incredible like the rumors?

492
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,600
It was more than amazing.

493
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:04,390
The guests who came there were all great people, and they all welcomed us.

494
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,110
<i>It was a really amazing time.</i>

495
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,590
<i>Congratulations on becoming a close person to the chairman.</i>

496
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,360
<i>Thank you, Mother-in-law!</i>

497
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,390
- Honey.
- Don't touch me.

498
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:44,150
Rule number one of a couple. When one says don't touch, the other follows without questioning.

499
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:45,910
Get out.

500
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,770
Okay, I will.

501
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,630
Honey.

502
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,730
I'll do anything and everything if you want me to.

503
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:03,140
It's because I love you a lot. But...

504
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,110
But I want you not to push me away too much.

505
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,950
That's my wish. That's all.

506
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,700
Get some rest.

507

<i> Hey! Did you find it? How did it go? </i>

508
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,290
<i> Executive Director, I found a safe! </i>

509
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:50,970
<i> I also found CEO Lee Tae Joon's legal seal. </i>

510
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,580
<i> You did a good job. </i>

511
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:09,940
<i>How long did she prepare this?</i>

512
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:27,530
This is like she bet her whole life on this.

513
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:33,310
It's too dangerous.

514
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:37,400
I can't let Ra El go down that path.

515
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,550
What are you going to do now since you got caught by Chairman Kang that you were hurting yourself?

516
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:44,170
He'll think it's suspicious. And from now on,

517
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,420
he'll question everything.

518
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,570
Are you going to ruin everything that we built until now?

519
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:52,500
I'm sorry.

520
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,920
Why is your mental quality not so great?

521
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,140
You know what kind of people they are. Why are you so weak?

522
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:03,900
There's only one reason for me to use all of my fortune to save your life.

523
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,340
Work for the price I paid.

524
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:12,380
I...

525
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,920
I have to see those bastards falling.

526
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,260
If you screw this up,

527
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,190
even if it's you, Lee Ra El,

528
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,170
I won't leave you alone.

529

541
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,060
Mom, where are you going?

542
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,850
I'm heading to the grocery store.

543
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,990
I can get groceries, so why don't you get some rest?

544
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,860
I want to get some fresh air, too. So don't worry about me.

545
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,060
Bo Ram, message me when you think of anything you want to eat.

546
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,540
Yes, Mom. See you later!

547
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,270
Bye.

548
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,140
You’re here again.

549
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,520
I came to get some fresh air.

550
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,980
Has the auction for the bandoneon (musical instrument) started?

551
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:49,670
To appreciate all your concern for it, perhaps I should bring you a fake one.

552
00:51:54,350 --> 00:52:00,020
If the fake could replace what’s real, wouldn’t that be nice.

553
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,190
Just what's the big deal with the legend of Piazzolla?

554
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:08,270
You are you, but even the richest man in the Republic of Korea

555
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:11,690
also desires to possess the Piazzolla's bandoneon.

556
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,350
He even paid ahead of time.

557
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:17,250
It’s not up for auction yet, so how did he pay?

558
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:22,530
He said that he doesn’t care how much it cost, so he gave a blank check.

559
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,820
Who did?

560
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,790
It was a famous person…

561
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:31,400
I wrote his name somewhere. Let’s see.

562
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,240

<i> I’m interested due to personal reasons. </i>

Right when we were talking about him, here he comes.

00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,400
Look! The bandoneon competitors have met!

572
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:40,780
Miss, are you leaving?

573
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:00,520
Why do you need Piazzolla's bandoneon?

574
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,050
Any tango lover would want a Piazzolla instrument.

575
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:11,340
Not a person who needs the tango?

576

<i> Who are those who need it? </i>

579
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,320
<i>Probably people who need to be healed.</i>

00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:57,760
Just who are you really?

583
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:40,320
