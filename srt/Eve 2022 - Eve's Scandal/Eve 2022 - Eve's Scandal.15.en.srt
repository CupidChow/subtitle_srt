Your complicated feelings toward Chairman Kang...

11
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,080
I understand it.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,880
First, let's rush and wrap things up.

13

Pardoning only one person... I was using the dilemma that the suspects would face.

Making the suspects... suspicious of each other?

Are you sure?

33
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,140
The head of a conglomerate has never attended a public lawsuit.

Kang Yoon Kyeom personally informed the prosecution that he'll attend the trial.

36
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,090
If that's the case, it means he's willing to stand in front of the prosecution and the press.

37
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,250
What could it be? Trying to control the trial by playing it up in the press? Or...

38
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,500
throw his weight around and put the pressure on the prosecution?

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,760
I wonder what he's trying to do.

40
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,540
Tell him to come out.

41
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,460
No matter what he does, he can't defeat someone who's willing to put her life on the line.

There is.

63

I will charge them with murder.

<i>- What?
- Murder?</i>

68

Kim Jeong Cheol mainly conducted the torture

Depending on the result of the criminal trial, the scope of compensation for the damages will change.

117
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,720
To decide on the compensation amount, we must wait until the result of the criminal trial is finalized.

Lee Ra El, do you agree to this?

Chairman Kang's attendance here today is proving effective. They're trying to give him more time.

Do you think my family is that easy?

159
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,380
You'll never get away with this.

160
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,290
Kim Jeong Cheol is disabled, and Han Pan Ro is...

161
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,880
starting to look for ways to get out of it alone.

162
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,730
Chairman Kang knows he has to be on my good side to find a way to survive.

163
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,380
You saw it.

164
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:07,150
Han So Ra is the only one who is isolated without a solution.

165
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,090
It looks like Han So Ra alone will

166
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,470
take all the blame for the murders.

167
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:27,650
You're running out places to go and no one to take care of you.

168
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,220
You're going to break down helplessly.

169
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,410
What do we do now?

170
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,100
What nonsense.

171
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:45,110
It's good that we have some things in common. As for fear,

172
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,160
it's much scarier

173
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,290
when it squeezes in rather than when it hits you.

174
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,810
<i>You don't feel true fear when it actually hits you. When you think it's going to hit you soon...</i>

175
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,420
<i>The real fear is when it squeezes you.</i>

176
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:09,610
Even if you got what you wanted, you shouldn't have made enemies.

177
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,110
When you have enormous rage,

178
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,710
you don't even feel the pain of cutting into your skin.

179
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:28,240
You shed my parents' and my blood. Now...

180
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,740
pay it back with your blood.

181
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,940
I plan to spray your blood on my father's grave to let him know of your death.

182
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,770
Until the whole world is colored in your blood,

183
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,810
let's go for it.

184
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,510
<i>[Lee Tae Joon]</i>

185
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,120
Dad...

186
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,900
CEO.

187
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,600
I'm sorry we couldn't right the wrong that was done to you for such a long time.

188
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,770
We're not too far from it. So please wait a little longer.

189
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,760
And don't worry too much about Ra El. I'll...

190
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,080
I'll be with her to the end.

191
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,940
You know the trial?

192
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,760
You'll have to face Chairman Kang alone for mediation.

193
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,240
Will you be okay?

194
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,480
It's something I must do.

195
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,910
Okay.

196
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,170
<i>[Plaintiff]</i>
This mediation is separate from the lawsuit for the joint victims' group.

197
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:15,110
<i>[Defendant]</i>
Regarding the death of your father Lee Tae Joon and mother Kim Jin Sook,

198
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,900
it's mediation for compensation as their inheritor.

199
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,110
Is that correct, Ms. Lee Ra El?

200
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,460
<i>[Mediator]</i>
That's correct.

201
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,510
Mr. Kang Yoon Kyeom, you're willing to settle. Correct?

202
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,940
Yes, that's right.

203
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,730
Aside from Mr. Kang Yoon Kyeom, Ms. Lee Ra El has sued

204
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,030
Han So Ra, Han Pan Ro,

205
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,030
and Kim Jeong Cheol. The problem is that the three people

206
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,570
are not willing to settle.

207
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,930
I will convince them to settle.

208
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,580
Following is the argument from the attorney for those three.

209
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,730
Quite a bit of the evidence that Ms. Lee Ra El submitted

210
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:53,680
was acquired illegally and could not be considered as evidence.

211
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,450
The illegality of the means of acquiring the evidence is acknowledged. Stealing identity,

212
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,710
invasion of personal information, illegal recording, and etc.

213
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:07,230
They cannot be presented in the trial. They're all evidence you acquired through deception.

214
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,390
I lost my parents at age fifteen.

215
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,250
I had nothing in my possession.

216
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,620
No one listened to what I had to say. In order to reveal the truth,

217
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,310
that was the only way.

218
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,820
A little girl who had no choice...

219
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,970
getting things legitimately was a luxury.

220
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,990
<i>[Mediator]</i>

221
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,460
Also...

222
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,940
not everything was a lie.

223
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,750
Ms. Lee Ra El, it hasn't been confirmed whether your mother Kim Jin Sook...

224
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,640
went missing or is dead.

225
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,950
We're undergoing a criminal trial to figure out the details of her death.

226
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,240
The problem is that no verdict has been made.

227
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,720
Meaning it will be difficult to come to an agreement for this case.

228
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,310
I would like for this civil suit to end swiftly,

229
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:20,460
so that I can apologize to the plaintiff.

230
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,270
I will agree to all of Lee Ra El's claims...

231
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,590
and settle this case.

232
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,110
But there's no evidence to prove Kim Jin Sook's death.

233
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,900
I'll bring my mother's belonging in as evidence to prove her death.

234
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,050
Will that be able to prove her death though?

235
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:45,160
Coming to an agreement is most important in a civil case, so I'll confirm it myself.

236
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,730
All right then. I'll see you next time.

237
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,990
If everything wasn't a lie,

238
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,510
which part is true?

239
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:13,090
Why is that important? Will it help us come to an agreement?

240
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,050
I'm going to go.

241
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,930
I must hurry to submit my mother's belonging.

242
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,590
I will look into it myself.

243
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,100
That way, you can skip all the documents.

244
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,980
Let's go together.

245
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,020
I'll report on this after reviewing it again.

246
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,210
- Sure.
- Okay.

<i>[Kim Hyeon Cheol]</i>

248
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,510
Yes, Hyun Cheol? I'm listening.

249
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,600
<i>I was notified that they can't hand over Ra El's mother's belongings.</i>

250
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,170
<i>Han Pan Ro is claiming Ra El is guilty of identity fraud, which poses a problem.</i>

251
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,510
<i>What do you mean?</i>

252
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,910
I'm sorry, but we can't hand it over to you.

253
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,700
Han Pan Ro's team suddenly presented a legal problem.

254
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,640
The supervisory office has taken your mother's belongings.

255
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,630
I was given permission from the Public Interest Law Center.

256
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,480
We're still discussing what to do about this.

257
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,640
Give me a moment. I'll let them know your situation.

258
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,010
Why are you still wearing the ring?

259
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,500
I didn't have the chance to take it off.

260
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,230
Your chance was when you found out who I was.

261
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,270
I put it on because I love you.

262
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,390
I'll probably take it off when my love for you dies.

263
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,770
Just because I dislike you,

264
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,500
it doesn't mean my love has died. Don't you agree?

265
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:49,170
Tell me one thing. I believed we were a twin flame.

266
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:53,520
Your hurtful past reminded me of myself.

267
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,150
I felt connected to you.

268
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,600
Your feelings towards me,

269
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,480
was it ever once true?

270
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,930
They say a twin flame can communicate without words.

271
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,590
Apparently, in times of life or death,

272
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,640
they transcend time and space and find each other.

273
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,050
We are nothing like that.

274
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:32,430
I approached you to destroy you. There's no fate in that.

275
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,340
I'm sorry, Chief Secretary Seo.

276
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,570
I wasn't expecting you.

277
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,460
This document here proves that Lee Ra El is the rightful heiress.

278
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,390
This document is perfect, so why won't you allow it?

279
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,820
The truth is, Han Pan Ro is giving us a hard time.

280
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,390
I'm just a powerless employee, too.

281
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:11,290
Do you operate this place according to power, not principle?

282
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,700
Shall I do that, too?

283
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,960
We were given permission.

284
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,720

314
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,530
You were so young.

315
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,260
I can't even ask for forgiveness.

316
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,580
I'm so sorry.

317
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,380
That's right.

318
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,390
Only your death will suffice!

319
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,090
I'll do whatever it takes.

320
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,030
If I really must die,

321
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,990
I'll do it.

322
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,960
Go wait in the car.

323
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,140
Chief Secretary Seo.

324
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,550
What should I do now?

325
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,780
Please tell me.

326
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,000
<i>I admit to all the claims... that the victims of LY filed.</i>

327
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,650
Gediks Semiconductors was a target of acquisition.

328
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,780
Thirteen years ago, we offered a merger that they declined.

329
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,460
There was a plot to steal the company.

330
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,880
In that process, the CEO, Lee Tae Joon,

331
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,930
sadly lost his life.

332
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,770
It was due to complications from being tortured. It was premediated murder.

333
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:14,000
There is also a hidden truth to Kim Jin Sook, the CEO's wife, and Jang Moon Hee's death.

334
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:17,590
I believe that an investigation must be conducted.

335
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,240
Come out, Yoon Kyeom! Come out!

336
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,460
Chairman is not here.

337
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,770
I know he's upstairs!

338
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,140
Come out, you bastard!

339
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,880
I really have no idea.

340
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,590
Take him out.

341
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,110
- Please don't do this.
- Please stop.

342
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,990
I'm going to kill all of you.

343
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,600
Come out, Kang Yoon Kyeom, you punk!

344
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,820
Come out!

345
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,540
<i>In that process, the CEO, Lee Tae Joon, sadly lost his life.</i>

346
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,890
<i>It was due to complications from being tortured. It was premeditated murder.</i>

347
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,990
What?

348
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,870
He's basically proclaiming to come after me!

349
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,480
You think I'm a pushover?

350
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,790
I'm everyone's punching bag!

351
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,360
Have you seen the news?

352
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,010
- How could—
- You punk!

353
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,060
Shut up!

354
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,930
Brother! Hey!

355
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,610
Damn it.

356
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,970
Who's here?

357
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,550
The police are here to investigate you.

358
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:32,620
They opened up an investigation into Jang Moon Hee and Kim Jin Sook's murders after Chairman's press conference.

359
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,300
Tell them you don't know anything. Why me? I didn't do anything wrong.

360
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,800
A recording that will be crucial evidence... was submitted to the police.

361
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,550
The police chief informed us.

362
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,350
<i>You will betray one another.</i>

363
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:54,230
<i>Then die a lonely and sad death.</i>

364
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,510
<i>That is your punishment!</i>

365
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,580
<i>You wench. You captured Jang Moon Hee, right?</i>

366
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,710
<i>You starved Kim Jin Sook to death, didn't you?</i>

367
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,780
<i>You killed both of those wenches.</i>

368
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,500
<i>That wench knows I have this woman.</i>

369
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,880
<i>- If he knows—
- Put that down.</i>

370
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,970
Ma'am, the police are still waiting out front.

371
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,170
- What should I do?
- Tell them I'm not here!

372
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,500
Yes, I understand.

373
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:27,470
Where is he?

374
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,450
Call him.

375
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,430
Ask him what I should do.

376
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,180
Chairman Kang has been missing since the press conference.

377
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,370
Nobody knows his whereabouts.

378
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,380
The secretary's office is in full panic mode.

379
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,890
Who's the one who sent the recording to the police?

380
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:56,020
Who got it and how!

381
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,660
Wasn't the recording file sent to the police clever?

382
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,180
It was edited to make Han So Ra a suspect.

383
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,440
Do you know who did it?

384
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,290
Han Pan Ro and I made a deal. He said he'll hand you over to save himself.

385
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,890
<i>How dare you screw me over after everything I've done for you?</i>

386
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:35,140
<i>You don't deserve to live, just like your mother. You're obsessed with your husband.</i>

387
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,840
<i>Han So Ra is the only one deserted without a plan.</i>

388
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,980
<i>You're starting to lose people to turn to.</i>

389
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:45,340
<i>Nobody to take care of you. You'll be helplessly destroyed.</i>

390
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,940
It looks like fingers will be pointed at you for everything.

391
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,060
I won't believe anything you say.

392
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:05,400
The truck driver you and Kim Jeong Cheol hired to dispose of the body will be going to the prosecutors', too.

393
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,880
<i>You couldn't receive love even from your husband,</i>

394
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,680
and you're even being abandoned by your own father.

395
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,480
You'll have to die lonely.

396
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,570
Having received no sympathy from anyone.

397
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,810
Do Hwan, that bitch just told me—

398
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:54,860
- Is it true that my dad betrayed me?
<i>- Ma'am.</i>

399
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,910
<i>Prime Minister, he told the prosecutors' that you ordered it.</i>

400
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,090
That is his testimony.

401
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,100
<i>Somebody has to take the blame,</i>

402
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,910
in order for things to be taken a little lightly.

403
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,400
I didn't think Han So Ra's boyfriend would be anyone significant,

404
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,660
but this is so anticlimactic.

405
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,370
Moon Do Hwan.

406
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,970
Chief Secretary Seo.

407
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,590
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

408
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,500
My mother is ill.

409
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,240
I just needed the money. Please!

410
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,740
Please forgive me. I'm sorry!

411
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,590
How could I forgive an attempted murder?

412
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,630
It's not forgiveness you should be asking for.

413
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,880
Rather, you should be thinking about what you can do right now.

414
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,690
<i>[Woonseo Law Firm]</i>

415
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,350
This isn't enough evidence.

416
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,000
Photos of the prison...

417
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,700
were handed over to the police?

418
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,550
So Ra did this?

419
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,370
Yes.

420
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,810
That good for nothing bitch.

421
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,490
Damn it!

422
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,860
Prime Minister!

423
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,480
You can't do this to her. She's your daughter after all.

424
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,880
Who are you to say anything to me!

425
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,550
Move!

426
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,700
Father!

427
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,940
Did you hand me over?!

428
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,090
Did you sell me for you to save your own ass!

429
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,410
Good that you are here.

430
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,310
Did you hand over the jail photos?

431
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,990
Do you know who made me become like this?

432
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,410
This is all because of you!

433
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,390
You are the one who ruined everything!

434
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,180
Dad.

435
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,940
Dad!

436
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,190
Ma'am!

437
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:04,130
Ma'am, please stop it, at least now.

438
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,870
If you go this far, I'm dead, too.

439
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,150
How many times do I have to tell you to shut up!

440
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,040
If we let him go, it's not your problem.

441
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,340
I will be the first to die.

442
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,140
Hurry!

443
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,880
Lock it!

444
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,540
Lock it!

445
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,500
Open the door.

446
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,550
Open the door!

447
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,800
Open—

448
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,740
I won't stand back like Mom did.

449
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:54,260
I'm not the same kid who couldn't say a word!

450
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,320
Hey, open the door...

451
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,350
Stay alert.

452
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,870
I'll leave the house empty since so many people are coming here because of the lawsuit.

453
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:27,180
All of you are on vacation now. Don't come back until I call you.

454
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,990
Yes, Ma'am.

455
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,910
You get lost, too.

456
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,860
W-What about Prime Minister?

457
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,540
Can't you hear me?

458
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,760
Get lost. If you don't, you'll end up the same as him.

459
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,400
Got it?

460
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,240
Yes.

461
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:18,190
Chairman has never been out of touch for this long.

462
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:21,150
Shouldn't we file for a missing person with the police?

463
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,320
You can't contact Chairman Kang?

464
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:45,660
He left writing on the first screen of his computer, and it looks like a suicide note at first glance.

465
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,070
He also resigned from his position as the CEO.

466
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:53,220
I know it's not something to ask you, but I had no choice.

467
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:00,750
<i> I'm resigning as the CEO, and I'll give up everything I have. </i>

468
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,410
<i> Everything seems to collapse in a blink of an eye, </i>

469
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:06,950
<i> so I feel miserable, but it's all my responsibility. </i>

470
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:10,650
<i> Since there's no way to atone for those who suffered because of me, </i>

471
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,060
<i> I'm going to take it all on myself. </i>

472
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:18,730
<i> Die. If anybody resists dying, you'll kill everyone, </i>

473
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,840
<i> and you'll die at the end as well. </i>

474
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,850
<i> Then it'll be over. </i>

475
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,870
<i> So I'm saying, pay back with your life! </i>

476
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,580
<i> If I really have to die, I'll do so. </i>

477
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,520
Do you have any idea in mind?

478
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,700
I asked for his confession, but he disappeared.

479
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,770
I guess he decided to pay for his wrongdoing.

480
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,990
It's good.

481
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,410
<i> [Secretary Cha] </i>

482
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,400
I heard this through the legal team.

483
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,220
Chairman granted all of his rights and shares to you.

484
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:55,200
<i> And he gives his personal property to Ms. Da Bi. He wrote a will saying that. </i>

485
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,390
<i> It is said that he entrusted the management of it to the legal team until she became an adult. </i>

486
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:02,120
<i> It makes me have ominous thoughts. </i>

487
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,590
<i> [Chairman Kang Yoon Kyeom] </i>

488
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:19,770
<i> The person you are trying to reach has their phone turned off. It'll be connected to the voice mail after the beep.</i>

489
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:23,650
<i> You'll be charged once connected. </i>

490
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,770
I told him to die.

491
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,250
I told him to pay back with his life.

492
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:42,440
If Chairman Kang dies, I'm the one who killed him.

493
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,600
I shouldn't have said such harsh words.

494
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,590
Chairman Kang is not a weak person like that.

495
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,270
Let's look for him. Don't worry about it.

496
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:02,970
<i> Have you heard of the term "twin flame"? </i>

497
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,540
<i> It's when one soul is split into two, like a twin.</i>

498
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,820
<i> The two souls instantly recognize each other the moment they meet; they're lovers. </i>

499
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:15,180
<i> It is said that Twin Flames </i>

500

<i> will meet each other, </i>

501

<i> no matter what. </i>

<i> At the moment of life and death, </i>

<i> Twin Flames can find each other. </i>

<i> I could show my true self. </i>
