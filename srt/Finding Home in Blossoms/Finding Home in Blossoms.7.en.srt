1
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,640
Uncle Lei.

2
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,920
Uncle Lei.

3
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,860
Do you remember Ding Jianguo?

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,520
Ding Jianguo.

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,040
Ding Jianguo.

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,160
I know him.

7
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,400
Then do you

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,800
know Ciyang?

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,960
Ciyang was

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,280
a very popular girl.

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,320
Many young men liked her.

12
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,360
Ding Jianguo liked her too.

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,440
Ding Jianguo was a doctor.

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
He treated people in the village

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,860
and was highly respected.

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,840
I remember once

17
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,360
he cured

18
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,000
Ciyang's father's illness.

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,920
That's when Ciyang fell for him.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,080
Back then,

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,600
it was a brave act of free love.

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,400
Very brave.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,420
So what happened next?

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,160
Did they get married?

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,200
I...

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,080
Was my mother

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,039
died from complications during my birth?

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,600
Then why has my father

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,960
always forbidden me from asking about my mother

30
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,280
or coming to Tibet?

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,010
Is he hiding something from me?

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:15,960
Perhaps

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,240
he's concealing painful memories.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,760
Jianguo.

35
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,000
This is all I can help you with.

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,040
You're poaching my staff again.

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,720
Ping,

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,640
I'm just trying to

39
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,440
promote Taoyuan Mingju for you.

40
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,000
You can just shoot your own videos,

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,880
why are you making

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,610
an official promotional film?

43
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,840
To build momentum for the Peach Blossom Festival.

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
The director thinks

45
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,560
Suolang and Ding Nian

46
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,560
would be perfect as spokespersons.

47
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,240
Ding Nian

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,480
has to work the front desk here,

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,120
paint,

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,480
teach art at school,

51
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,200
and now shoot videos for you too.

52
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,530
She's getting a full-time salary from me.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,840
Sis

54
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,840
we need to catch this trending wave,

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,320
right?

56
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,200
It's a win-win.

57
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,960
Win-win.

58
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,760
Stop selling me empty promises.

59
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,520
Sis, look,

60
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,280
Qianqian has developed those

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,940
peach blossom tea and cookies

62
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,800
and they're already applying for food production licenses.

63
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,120
About your peach blossom wine,

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,360
let's talk about it, shall we?

65
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,440
Give up that idea

66
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,160
and stop trying to use me.

67
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,720
Sis,

68
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
let's discuss it,

69
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,280
we can cooperate for mutual benefit.

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,760
Hao!

71
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,440
You're finally here.

72
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,040
Come with me.

73
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,920
The director has arrived.

74
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,040
Let's go.

75
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,640
Ready, three, two, one, action!

76
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
Come on, you two actors, get a little closer.

77
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,920
Now, look more affectionate.

78
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Yes, that's it.

79
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,440
Just like that,

80
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,400
good, very good.

81
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,840
Cut!

82
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,760
What are you doing?

83
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,690
What's going on?

84
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,720
Production assistant,

85
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,399
let me see who this person is,

86
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:18,930
who is it?

87
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,360
Get back!

88
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,240
Who are you?

89
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,480
Dad, are you okay?

90
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,650
Are you alright?

91
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,840
Father, are you okay?

92
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,520
Who's your dad?

93
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Get out of the way!

94
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,600
Get up, Dad!

95
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,320
And you,

96
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,040
you're getting more and more out of line,

97
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,760
go back right now!

98
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,820
I'm not going back.

99
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,720
It's not what you think.

100
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
So you know

101
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,159
what I saw was too much, right?

102
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,159
Don't get upset,

103
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,220
your blood pressure will rise again.

104
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,120
You came here because of that guy,

105
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,240
didn't you?

106
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,440
No.

107
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,040
I...

108
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,600
We...

109
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,960
We're not real,

110
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,440
we're just acting.

111
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,640
Acting? What kind of acting?

112
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,370
You're not even an actress.

113
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,120
Exactly.

114
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,500
Creating a fake couple, you know?

115
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,880
It's a promotional strategy nowadays,

116
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,080
to attract traffic online,

117
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,320
it's not real.

118
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,540
Creating what?

119
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,600
A couple?

120
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Just remember

121
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,960
that it's not real, okay?

122
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,500
Well, if it's not real,

123
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,290
then you're coming home with me tomorrow.

124
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,330
I'm not leaving.

125
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,320
You won't stop until you drive me crazy, will you?

126
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,640
I don't understand,

127
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,280
this is my mother's hometown,

128
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,140
where you two met and fell in love,

129
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,720
why can't I come here?

130
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,320
You've already been here,

131
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,240
seen everything,

132
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,800
it's about time we left.

133
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,920
Dad.

134
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,760
Dad, I don't want to leave.

135
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,760
Could you take me to see

136
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,520
where you two used to live?

137
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,800
What about Mom's family,

138
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,360
where are my grandparents?

139
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,120
Oh, and

140
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,800
that photo of Mom,

141
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,120
where was it taken?

142
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,440
I want to find that peach blossom tree

143
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,520
and take a similar photo as a memento,

144
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,560
okay?

145
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,720
Back then, communication

146
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,580
wasn't as convenient as it is now,

147
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,080
we lost contact long ago.

148
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,960
It's been over 20 years,

149
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,800
Tibet has changed so much,

150
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,360
even I don't recognize some places anymore.

151
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,320
How would you find any

152
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,920
traces of our life back then?

153
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,340
Enough, Niannian,

154
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,660
listen to your father,

155
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,080
we're going back tomorrow,

156
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,520
and you'll find a proper job.

157
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,780
I don't want to go back,

158
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,640
I'm doing well here,

159
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,120
I'm doing what I love.

160
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,720
You're just wasting time here.

161
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,000
You.

162
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,960
You don't understand what I want at all.

163
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,560
This child of mine.

164
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:40,960
You.

165
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,720
Jianguo.

166
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,560
Tashi delek.

167
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,760
Still angry?

168
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,560
How dare you even ask.

169
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,520
Didn't you promise me

170
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,880
that you'd keep an eye on her?

171
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,320
If I hadn't

172
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,480
seen that video online,

173
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,140
she would've been tricked into going back home.

174
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,560
All these years

175
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,360
and you never came back to see me.

176
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,680
How could I find the time?

177
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,690
These years haven't been easy for you either.

178
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,360
Ding Nian is a good kid.

179
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,170
You've raised her well.

180
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,760
Did she ask you about what happened back then,

181
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,220
did you let anything slip?

182
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,040
Don't worry,

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
I stuck to what we agreed on.

184
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,740
The child is grown now,

185
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
what's meant to happen will happen.

186
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,120
She won't come back with me,

187
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,780
it must be because of that guy.

188
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,920
Which guy?

189
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,120
Solang?

190
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,840
He's a nice young man.

191
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,080
Whose side are you on?

192
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,720
Yours, of course.

193
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,280
When it's time for rain to fall and women to marry,

194
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,540
can you really stop it?

195
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,540
It's driving me crazy.

196
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,160
Teacher Ding, welcome!

197
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,280
Your room is ready for you.

198
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,760
We have quite a few guests these days,

199
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,920
only one standard room left,

200
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,320
so you'll have to make do with it.

201
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,920
That's very kind of you.

202
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
I'm not picky,

203
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,640
I can sleep anywhere there's a bed.

204
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Ding Nian, show your father around.

205
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,679
Ding Nian, you're back.

206
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,159
Hello.

207
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Qianqian.

208
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,159
Good.

209
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,480
Ding Nian.

210
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,080
Teacher Ding.

211
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,880
Come on, children.

212
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,280
Let's draw leaves together with teacher,

213
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,000
shall we?

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,720
Yes!

215
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,480
Yes!

216
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,720
Suolang.

217
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,440
Qianqian.

218
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,740
How beautiful!

219
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,200
You can hold up your drawings.

220
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,520
Can you show it to the teacher?

221
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,320
We just drew apples,

222
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,480
and now shall we draw some grapes?

223
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,760
Yes.

224
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,680
For our grapes,

225
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,600
don't they have lots and lots of little berries?

226
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,360
Right.

227
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,600
Let's start by drawing a grapevine.

228
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,480
The peach tree is young and elegant,

229
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,280
with bright and beautiful flowers.

230
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,040
The maiden is getting married.

231
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,200
May his household prosper.

232
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,000
Students,

233
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,400
this is our local

234
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,840
intangible cultural heritage from Linzhi,

235
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,040
called Bixiu.

236
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,080
When the arrow is shot,

237
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,480
it makes a special sound.

238
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,720
Its official name is

239
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,560
Gongbu Whistling Arrow.

240
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,600
It's a competitive sport.

241
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,840
Gongbu Whistling Arrow is a traditional

242
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,360
Tibetan archery sport.

243
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,960
Whenever a whistling arrow competition is held,

244
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,240
everyone in the village, young and old,

245
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,640
will dress in their traditional costumes,

246
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,120
prepare delicious food and highland barley wine,

247
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,400
come to the competition site,

248
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,600
and cheer for their archers.

249
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,120
They also form singing and dancing teams

250
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,520
to entertain and encourage their archers.

251
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,160
Teacher, I've been to one before,

252
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,890
and my dad even won first place.

253
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,920
That's impressive.

254
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Teacher, I want to become an archer too,

255
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,450
please teach us how to do it!

256
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,080
Then let me demonstrate for you,

257
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,560
okay?

258
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,560
Great!

259
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,080
It's just archery,

260
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,240
anyone can do it.

261
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,170
Come on, Solang,

262
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,480
give me the arrow.

263
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,240
I'll take a shot.

264
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,700
Here you go, Teacher Ding.

265
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,440
You know how to do this?

266
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,840
This is

267
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,080
too easy.

268
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,640
Come on, Teacher Ding.

269
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,170
Let's go.

270
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Let's have a competition.

271
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,080
Sure, let's compete.

272
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,880
Teacher Ding.

273
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,320
Teacher Ding.
