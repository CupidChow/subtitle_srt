1
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,280
Mom.

2
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,640
Mom.

3
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,160
Mom.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,120
Mom.

5
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,840
Mom.

6
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,280
Mom.

7
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,960
Mom.

8
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,160
Ding Nian.

9
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,860
Wake up, Ding Nian.

10
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,650
It rained all night yesterday,

11
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,600
so we can go mushroom picking today.

12
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,660
Mushroom picking?

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm planning to make stone pot chicken for lunch today.

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,170
You have no idea,

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,520
the stone pot chicken here is the best dish around.

16
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,920
Mushrooms are an essential

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,780
ingredient in stone pot chicken.

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,120
Slow down.

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,520
Is something wrong with my eyes?

20
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,080
I can't see anything.

21
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,880
That's because you're not familiar with them yet,

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,479
so you can't recognize them.

23
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,140
I'm getting tired.

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,440
I need a break.

25
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,450
In that case,

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,490
wait for me here.

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
Don't wander off.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm afraid you'll get lost.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,840
Okay.

30
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,420
I'll go ahead then.

31
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,079
Miss, are you hurt?

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,920
Are you okay?

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,920
Um, I'm sorry,

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,960
I was practicing hunting

35
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
with my pet rabbit

36
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,840
and you happened to be behind these bushes.

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,920
It's fine,

38
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,600
just hurts a bit from the fall.

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,200
Ding Nian.

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,240
Ding Nian.

41
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,210
Are you alright?

42
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,079
What's wrong with you?

43
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,360
How could you mistake a whole person for a rabbit?

44
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,200
Always bragging about having eagle eyes,

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,520
and you still made such a mistake.

46
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,440
If our Ding Nian loses even a single hair,

47
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
how will you make it up to her?

48
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,040
I'm sorry,

49
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,280
it's my fault.

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,200
Are you the one

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,060
who's looking for her mother?

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,960
You really told the whole village.

53
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,760
Of course,

54
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,400
now everyone in the village knows

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,460
about you searching for your mother.

56
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,240
Right, let me introduce you.

57
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,240
This is Ding Nian, who just arrived at our inn.

58
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,100
This is Sorang, who delivers vegetables to our inn.

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,240
What are you doing here?

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,530
Picking mushrooms.

61
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,360
I'm making a wild

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,460
mushroom stone pot chicken tonight.

63
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,079
You have enough in your basket if you're just making soup.

64
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,960
Well, I'm also making a wild mushroom medley tonight.

65
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,600
Can you eat that much?

66
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,960
Who said it's just for us?

67
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,810
We have guests coming over.

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,840
Qianqian, I want to try some too.

69
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,400
Sure, come over tonight,

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,079
I'll make you

71
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,600
some spicy stir-fried wild mushrooms. How's that?

72
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,240
Yay!

73
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,640
You two are...?

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,880
He's my uncle,

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,890
and he's single.

76
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,840
No,

77
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,170
that's not what I meant.

78
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,480
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,760
You're covered in mud because of me.

80
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,160
Let me take you both home.

81
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,520
You should change your clothes quickly

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,850
so you don't catch cold.

83
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,410
Let's go.

84
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Here, let me help.

85
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,560
Thank you.

86
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,779
Alright, let's go.

87
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,850
Take it easy.

88
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,970
That's nice.

89
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,340
Smells delicious.

90
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,400
Did Suolang shoot

91
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,860
all these videos himself?

92
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,400
Yeah.

93
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,040
He has a video account

94
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,409
with hundreds of thousands of followers.

95
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,880
Hundreds of thousands.

96
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,760
So he's basically an influencer, right?

97
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,360
Oh, right.

98
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,800
I forgot to mention when I introduced him,

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,960
his main job is being a video blogger,

100
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,400
and his side job is delivering groceries to us,

101
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,400
slaughtering chickens and cattle, things like that.

102
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,660
What hidden talents we have here.

103
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,210
Hello? Anyone here?

104
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,080
Are you still open for business?

105
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,000
Coming!

106
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,280
I'm so sorry.

107
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,480
I was busy in the back.

108
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,800
Do you have a reservation?

109
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,720
What, we can't stay without a reservation?

110
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,050
That's not what I meant.

111
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,160
What type of room would you like?

112
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
How long will you be staying?

113
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,720
You have king-size rooms, right?

114
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,640
We'll stay for three days for now.

115
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,280
Two rooms.

116
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,680
Fine, two rooms then.

117
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,520
So that's two king-size rooms.

118
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,900
Do you have any suites?

119
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,440
Yes.

120
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,800
Why would you need a suite just for yourself?

121
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,400
I'll stay where I want.

122
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,960
I'm paying for it myself, so mind your own business.

123
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,440
Whatever.

124
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,170
Is that okay?

125
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,560
As expected, these art student hands

126
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,760
just aren't meant for this kind of work.

127
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,770
I'm learning, aren't I?

128
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,680
Qianqian,

129
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
what's that dessert you made called?

130
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,720
The customers really like it.

131
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,850
Do you think I should add it to the menu?

132
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,200
Butter tea flavored madeleines,

133
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,440
the only ones of their kind in the world.

134
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,560
Adding it to the menu is fine.

135
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,680
But Ping,

136
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,560
that black and white A4 paper menu is way too ugly.

137
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,490
It doesn't do justice to my sophisticated desserts.

138
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,370
Does color printing come free?

139
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,000
As long as customers can read it clearly, that's enough.

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,440
You young people nowadays

141
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,640
have no idea how hard it is to make money.

142
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,970
Doesn't Ding Nian know art?

143
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
Why not ask her to hand-draw one for you?

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,060
A hand-drawn menu?

145
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,060
Let me show you.

146
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,720
Look.

147
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,080
This is what's trending now,

148
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,680
both beautiful and stylish.

149
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,360
Not bad at all.

150
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,440
Ding Nian, can you do it?

151
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,240
I can try.

152
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,080
You young people really know how to innovate.

153
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,010
I just can't keep up with the times.

154
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,240
Hand-drawn menu.

155
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,800
Ding Nian,

156
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,800
do you have all those things like paper and pens

157
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
that you'll need?

158
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,080
We don't need to spend money, right?

159
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,760
No need.

160
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,040
Smells so good!

161
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,200
I can smell the spicy wild mushrooms.

162
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,040
And there's wild mushroom stew

163
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
and wild mushroom chicken soup too.

164
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,760
We've achieved wild mushroom freedom.

165
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,560
We have to thank your good uncle for this.

166
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,040
No, no.

167
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,520
I'm really sorry for scaring Ding Nian.

168
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,720
So we should thank Ding Nian then.

169
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,840
Thank me for what?

170
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,120
I didn't pick the mushrooms,

171
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,080
I didn't cook the food,

172
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,960
I just took a fall, that's all.

173
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,159
Alright,

174
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,720
whether it's apologizing or thanking.

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,850
Everyone have a few more drinks later.

176
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,760
Qianqian is a top chef

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,130
and every dish she makes is delicious.

178
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,080
You're such a sweet talker,

179
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
Qianqian likes you the most.

180
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,440
Jianguo, is this Taoyuan Ming Residence?

181
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,700
I'm heading there now.

182
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:18,720
The golden mountain of Beijing shines its light in all directions.

183
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,520
Have a drink,

184
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,640
come on.

185
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:27,680
Chairman Mao is that golden sun.

186
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,240
Stand up with me,

187
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,920
so warm and so kind,

188
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,240
illuminating the hearts of us serfs.

189
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,760
Cheers!

190
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,480
We're walking forward,

191
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,560
illuminating the hearts of us serfs.

192
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,240
Come, cheers!

193
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,120
Have you been to many places, sis?

194
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,440
I guess so,

195
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,080
I've been to most coastal areas,

196
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,210
but never went west.

197
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,330
Are big cities just like in the movies?

198
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,280
Lots of tall buildings,

199
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,640
many beautiful overpasses,

200
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,380
and huge amusement parks.

201
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,360
That's about right.

202
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,080
Do you want to go to an amusement park?

203
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
When I save enough money,

204
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,080
I'm going to run away from home.

205
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,280
You must keep it a secret for me,

206
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm only telling you.

207
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,520
Okay, I'll definitely keep your secret.

208
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,850
How old are you, sister?

209
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,120
I'm 24.

210
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
What's your zodiac sign?

211
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,840
Scorpio.

212
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,440
My uncle is 23, Pisces.

213
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,890
It's finished. Take a look.

214
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,320
It looks amazing.

215
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,000
Suolang,

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,360
look at the drawing Sister Dingning made for me.

217
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,690
Rich.

218
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,280
What a unique style.

219
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,760
Do you like it, Zhuoma?

220
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,690
I love it so much.

221
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,680
You're an amazing artist.

222
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,200
No, I'm not.

223
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
I'm neither amazing

224
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,360
nor an artist.

225
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,490
You will be someday.

226
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,840
Your portraits really capture people's essence.

227
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,200
I have an idea.

228
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,320
You could draw portraits for the inn's guests,

229
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,360
as souvenirs for them to take home.

230
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,570
Draw portraits for guests?

231
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,840
Hey, Lei.

232
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,520
I'll buy a plane ticket and fly over right away.

233
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,840
Jianguo, calm down.

234
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
What about your job?

235
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,920
The kid is grown up now.

236
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,360
Let her have some fun for a few days.

237
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,200
I'll keep an eye on her.

238
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
But what if she finds out

239
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
about her mother?

240
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,740
Are you planning to hide it from her forever?

241
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,600
Tibet

242
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,300
isn't the same as it used to be.

243
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,760
Don't worry.

244
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,560
I remember the promise we made back then.

245
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,640
I'll quickly arrange my current work.

246
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,500
I'll fly over as soon as possible.

247
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,360
Let's hang up.
