1
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,880
Ding Nian.

2
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,120
Something big happened.

3
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,520
Something big happened.

4
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,640
Something big happened, Ding Nian.

5
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,800
What happened?

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,000
What's going on?

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,130
Your family of three

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,280
has gone viral.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,010
Who took this photo?

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,240
How come I didn't know about it?

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,480
Who cares who took it,

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,570
it's trending everywhere now.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,840
Ding Nian.

14
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,560
You better be ready for this windfall coming your way.

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,039
No,

16
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,760
we're not a family of three.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,120
A paradise on earth.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,320
A family of three,

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,400
this is what all those city workhorses

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,920
dream of having.

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,690
Ding Nian, oh Ding Nian.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,720
Don't be the well-fed person

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,050
who can't understand a hungry man's pain.

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,200
Zhang Haoran.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,340
I've always wanted

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,960
to create a unified plan for the entire village

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,200
and all the peach blossom-related industries

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,400
together.

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,759
I've been developing this idea for over half a year.

30
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,360
Last time,

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,440
we caught a wave of online attention

32
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,120
and gave

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,080
our tourism economy a small boost.

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,680
This time,

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,720
there's an even bigger wave of attention

36
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,720
that we must take full advantage of.

37
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
Well, um,

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,280
to generate income for our village

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,560
and help our villagers increase their wealth,

40
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,289
I've decided

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,240
to go all in.

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,000
Can you cut the clichés?

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,130
Just speak plainly.

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,400
Ship a couple.

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,400
Ship a couple?

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,600
I'm just a nobody,

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,800
why would I ship with anyone,

48
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,639
Solang?

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,639
He's already

50
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,640
a video blogger with hundreds of thousands of followers.

51
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,520
If you ship yourself with him,

52
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,960
how could you still be a nobody?

53
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,420
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

54
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,960
I love this idea!

55
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,720
Ding Nian and Solang

56
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,050
look perfect together,

57
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,100
like they were born to be a couple.

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,680
I want to be your number one

59
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,000
CP fan.

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,440
Don't stir things up.

61
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,280
It's not just up to me

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,240
to decide.

63
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,440
You need

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,840
to ask

65
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Suolang

66
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,170
and discuss it with him.

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,280
Suolang

68
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,730
has already agreed.

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,079
Auntie.

70
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,200
Don't call me that.

71
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,060
Solang.

72
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,440
Could you introduce

73
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,370
what this activity is to everyone?

74
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,840
We call this Bixiu,

75
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,960
or Gongbu Whistling Arrow in Chinese,

76
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,080
it's one of Nyingchi's

77
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,880
intangible cultural heritages.

78
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,540
Can you demonstrate it for us?

79
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,940
Come on, you try it too.

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,960
Like this.

81
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,690
Hold the bow steady,

82
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
aim precisely,

83
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,040
feel the power,

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,320
follow your arrow

85
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,980
as it flies toward the target.

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,120
Calm down,

87
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,530
this isn't real,

88
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,160
we're just acting.

89
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
I did it!

90
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,519
Is it okay?

91
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,440
Not too obvious,

92
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,240
right?

93
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,320
Ding Nian.

94
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,600
What's wrong?

95
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,280
I need

96
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,680
to ask you for a favor.

97
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:35,880
What is it?

98
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
My grandfather saw our video

99
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,480
and thinks we're actually together.

100
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,010
He's really happy about it.

101
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,409
Seeing him so happy,

102
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,250
I didn't tell him the truth.

103
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,840
My grandmother's birthday is coming up in a few days

104
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
and they're having a bonfire party.

105
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,940
My grandfather

106
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,580
wants me to bring you home for dinner.

107
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
Grandpa

108
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,680
wants

109
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,640
you to take me home for dinner.

110
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,380
What about you?

111
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,000
Of course I want you to go too.

112
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Look at the lovebirds

113
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,240
surrounded by pink bubbles.

114
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,640
No, we were just

115
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
shipping celebrities.

116
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,560
Well, sometimes pretend romance

117
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
can turn into the real thing, right?

118
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,440
Ciyang.

119
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,400
You're back.

120
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,720
Ciyang.

121
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,800
Grandpa, you know Ciyang?

122
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,520
Ciyang.

123
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,320
Ciyang.

124
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,280
Ciyang.

125
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,720
Grandpa.

126
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,120
Is she the Ciyang you're talking about?

127
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,240
Yes.

128
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,480
Yes.

129
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,760
The Han doctor

130
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,240
and Ciyang.

131
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,480
The Han doctor.

132
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,300
Is this man the Han doctor?

133
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,440
That's him.

134
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,080
Doctor.

135
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,280
Doctor.

136
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,930
Grandpa,

137
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,640
do you know where my mother's home is?

138
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,160
Ciyang,

139
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,440
let's go drink.

140
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,880
Grandpa, I'm not Ciyang.

141
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,840
You are Ciyang,

142
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,480
let's drink.

143
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,010
Grandpa.

144
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,320
Let's drink more.

145
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,960
Ciyang, I'm not drunk.

146
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,640
Ciyang.

147
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,080
Ciyang, let's go drink.

148
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,200
Ciyang.

149
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,640
I'm sorry,

150
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,680
my grandfather's condition can flare up suddenly.

151
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,140
We'll ask him another day,

152
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,730
don't worry for now.

153
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
It's okay.

154
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,840
Although

155
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,360
I don't have specific news about my mother yet,

156
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
at least now I can confirm

157
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,400
that my mother was from here.

158
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,970
Dad didn't lie to me.

159
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,080
I even suspected him before,

160
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,900
which was pretty ridiculous.

161
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,410
He loves you so much,

162
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,290
how could he ever lie to you?

163
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,520
I know he loves me,

164
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,880
but why

165
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,080
has he always refused to tell me

166
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,440
about my mother?

167
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,440
What exactly

168
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,920
happened back then?

169
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,880
I just realized,

170
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,320
since we can't find information about your mother

171
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,280
Ciyang,

172
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,200
why don't we look into your father instead?

173
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,240
Since your father was a medical aid worker in Tibet,

174
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,800
there must be records left behind.

175
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,460
Yes, right.

176
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,180
Why didn't I think of that?

177
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,760
Solang.

178
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,540
Secretary.

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,040
Who's this?

180
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,120
I understand.

181
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,680
This is your girlfriend.

182
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,620
Secretary.

183
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,120
Her name is Ding Nian,

184
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,600
her father

185
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
used to be a medical aid doctor here in Tibet.

186
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,480
We'd like to find

187
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,680
the documents he left behind back then.

188
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,800
I need to hurry to

189
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,280
the high-speed rail station to pick up Duoji.

190
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,360
You two go upstairs first

191
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,160
and look for Old Lei in the archives room.

192
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,560
Okay.

193
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,440
Duoji is back.

194
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,800
Yes, Duoji is back.

195
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,800
Come to my place for dinner tonight,

196
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,640
to welcome Duoji back.

197
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:09,960
Sure.

198
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,490
Alright.

199
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,210
Okay.

200
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,720
She's Ding Jianguo's daughter.

201
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,600
Do you know Ding Jianguo?

202
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,760
Let me think,

203
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,410
it's been so many years.

204
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,400
If you knew Ding Jianguo,

205
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,360
my father might have

206
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,760
left some documents here.

207
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,090
Could you help me check?

208
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,360
You'll need to show some proof.

209
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,000
I can't just look up records for you.

210
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,080
This is private information,

211
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,480
right?

212
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,520
What kind of proof do you need?

213
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,980
Proof that you're Ding Jianguo's daughter.

214
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,840
I...

215
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,920
Son,

216
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,600
once you're back, don't leave again.

217
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,860
You earn little but spend a lot out there.

218
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,890
What could I possibly do if I come back?

219
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Look at Suolang,

220
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,520
he does any kind of work,

221
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,160
and isn't he doing just fine?

222
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,840
He is him, I am me.

223
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,120
Don't compare him with me.

224
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,240
Didn't you say you wanted to start an e-commerce business?

225
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,560
I gave you all my savings,

226
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,620
and what happened?

227
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,880
I just had bad luck.

228
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,740
No matter what,

229
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,640
after you come back,

230
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,840
you better behave yourself,

231
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,960
stop upsetting your mother,

232
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,220
her health isn't good.

233
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,360
Okay.

234
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,360
Mom.

235
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,040
Mom.

236
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,040
Mom.

237
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,440
Mom.

238
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,200
Mom.

239
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,040
Ding Nian.

240
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,440
Ding Nian.

241
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,720
Ding Nian.

242
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,840
What do I need to do to prove

243
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,040
that I'm Ding Jianguo's daughter?

244
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,480
We should go to the Secretary's house for dinner now.

245
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,210
I heard he also invited Old Lei.

246
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,930
Let's take this opportunity to ask again.

247
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,330
Let's go.

248
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,040
Tashi delek.

249
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,720
Sonam.

250
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,360
Later,

251
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
you should toast Uncle Lei a few more times.

252
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,020
I want to wait until he's drunk

253
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,340
to ask about my father.

254
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,760
Uncle Lei.

255
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,400
I'd like to toast you as well.

256
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,500
What a handsome young man.

257
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
Thank you, Uncle Lei.

258
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,840
Well done.

259
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,800
Why did he pass out?

260
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,400
That's just how Lao Lei is,

261
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,360
once he's had enough to drink,

262
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,490
he starts sleeping.

263
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,320
Come on, Suolang.

264
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,960
Let me toast you,

265
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
come on, it's been a long time since we've seen each other,

266
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,800
have some food.

267
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,730
Long time no see.

268
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,720
Uncle Lei.

269
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,040
Uncle Lei.

270
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,980
Do you remember Ding Jianguo?

271
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,680
Ding Jianguo.

272
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,120
Ding Jianguo.

273
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,280
I know him.

274
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,520
Then do you

275
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,920
know Ciyang?

276
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,960
Ciyang was

277
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,520
a very popular girl,

278
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
many young men liked her,

279
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,160
including Ding Jianguo.
