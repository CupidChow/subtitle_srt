1
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,120
Mr. Ding

2
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,320
I've never seen you smoke before.

3
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,440
I quit over 20 years ago,

4
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,580
ever since Nian Nian was born,

5
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,490
I haven't touched a cigarette.

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,840
Mr. Ding,

7
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,140
please don't take it to heart,

8
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,900
Nian Nian is heartbroken too.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,280
After you left,

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,680
she cried for a long time.

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,120
Nian Nian?

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,760
Since when are you on such familiar terms with her?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,130
This incident really frightened her,

14
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,200
she's never experienced cyberbullying before,

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,530
so she's feeling anxious and distressed.

16
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,810
She was somewhat

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,760
careless with her words,

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,160
I apologize to you on her behalf.

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,560
Who are you

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,759
to apologize for her?

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,280
If she hadn't been faking a relationship with you,

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,009
would this mess have happened?

23
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:41,720
I've forgotten

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,720
whose idea it was in the first place.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,520
At first we just thought it was fun,

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,130
but the truth is,

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,560
I've had feelings for Nian Nian for a long time.

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,800
Tomorrow I'll post a video

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
telling everyone

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,920
that I genuinely care about her.

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,020
Don't you dare!

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,960
Over twenty years ago,

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,640
you fell in love with Ci Yang

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,520
and bravely had Ding Nian together,

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,980
so why can't we do the same?

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,120
Is this some kind of twisted fate?

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,560
I'll get it.

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,880
I'll handle it.

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,240
Take care.

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,600
The food factory has paid part of the advance,

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,800
with the rest due at the end of the month.

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,850
How am I going to fill this financial hole?

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,760
I've calculated that

44
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,920
we have about a 75% return rate.

45
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,600
Why can't these people tell right from wrong?

46
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,720
The fake relationship is one thing,

47
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,480
but business is completely separate!

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,800
We deceived people first,

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
so we're in the wrong.

50
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,930
This is all my fault,

51
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,640
I was too eager for quick success,

52
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,079
and I've dragged you and Ding Nian into this mess.

53
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,360
It was your idea,

54
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,240
but we all agreed to it.

55
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,040
Since we're adults,

56
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,770
we need to take responsibility for our mistakes.

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,600
Um,

58
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,720
is there anything I can help with?

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,760
I'm planning to report this situation

60
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,090
to the Party Secretary,

61
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,360
would you come with me

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,420
for moral support?

63
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,380
He's probably busy today,

64
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,940
dealing with the public opinion crisis.

65
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,320
It's really a case of one thing affecting everything else,

66
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,240
I never imagined

67
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,440
that this incident

68
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,240
would impact the entire village.

69
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,160
Yeah, who would have thought?

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,200
First thing tomorrow morning,

71
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,860
I'll update my video account.

72
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,610
I hope I can make amends.

73
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,680
What are you going to say?

74
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,010
I believe in one saying:

75
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,240
sincerity brings miracles.

76
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,450
Are you really leaving?

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,520
We need you right now,

78
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,650
why are you leaving?

79
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,560
It's too late to catch the high-speed train now.

80
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,600
Stay at my place for the night,

81
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll drive you tomorrow.

82
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,680
Why are you so upset?

83
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,360
A drink will make you feel better.

84
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,159
I won't drink.

85
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,000
So in your eyes,

86
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm just a bad person,

87
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,800
a bad person.

88
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,320
Teacher Ding.

89
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,320
My heart really hurts.

90
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,440
She's stabbing me in the heart,

91
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,360
Lao Lei.

92
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,480
For over 20 years,

93
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,320
I've worried myself sick over her.

94
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,960
But in her heart,

95
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,920
how did I become the villain?

96
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,280
Jianguo.

97
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,740
The child is definitely in the wrong.

98
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,520
So inconsiderate,

99
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,680
so inappropriate.

100
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,560
I'll go scold her right now.

101
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,420
Don't you dare!

102
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,280
I can't even bring myself to scold her,

103
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,540
what right do you have?

104
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,159
Look at you.

105
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
My precious daughter,

106
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,680
who could be more miserable than me?

107
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,640
My little darling doesn't want me anymore.

108
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Hello everyone, I'm Sorang.

109
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,890
First of all,

110
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,780
I want to apologize to my fans.

111
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,200
No matter what,

112
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,120
lying and deceiving people is wrong.

113
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,400
But this whole shipping thing

114
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,800
was entirely my idea.

115
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Please stop attacking

116
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,570
other innocent people.

117
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,400
Second,

118
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,360
I want to apologize to everyone

119
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,760
who made purchases during our livestream.

120
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm sorry for bringing Ding Nian into the livestream

121
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,880
to attract attention

122
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,220
and benefit from the traffic.

123
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,920
My original intention

124
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,960
was to help sell more products from our village

125
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,420
and generate more income.

126
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,040
I never expected

127
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,640
that we would end up being consumed by the fame.

128
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,480
Finally,

129
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,280
I want to apologize to Ding Nian.

130
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,620
I wasn't brave enough.

131
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,520
Even though I really like you,

132
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,760
I didn't have the courage to tell you directly.

133
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,200
I chose to use this fake relationship

134
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
to get close to you

135
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,730
and enjoy the happiness of being with you.

136
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,320
After spending this time together,

137
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,920
I've realized my feelings for you are genuine.

138
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,120
But I also know

139
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,600
you can't stay here forever.

140
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
And I can't go with you

141
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,440
to live in the big city.

142
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,120
Ding Nian.

143
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,040
Ding Nian, wake up.

144
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,880
Ding Nian, look at this.

145
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,600
Suolang posted a new video.

146
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,200
You can't stay here forever.

147
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,420
I can't go with you to live in the big city either.

148
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,960
So, Ding Nian,

149
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
this love with an uncertain future,

150
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,850
are you willing to start it with me?

151
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,080
That's so romantic.

152
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,680
A public confession online.

153
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
I'm so touched.

154
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,680
But I can't make a decision right now.

155
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,880
Why not?

156
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,460
Why overthink when you like someone?

157
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,720
If you like someone,

158
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,159
just be with them.

159
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
It's not that simple.

160
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,080
My father...

161
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,600
It's too early for this.

162
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,480
What are you thinking about?

163
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,680
I can't just think about myself.

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,320
Dad.

165
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,600
Dad.

166
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,440
Hey, Dad.

167
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,320
Uncle Lei.

168
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,920
Jianguo.

169
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,840
Wake up,

170
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Nian Nian is coming to see you.

171
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,640
Stop joking,

172
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,320
she left me,

173
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,720
why would she look for me?

174
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,200
Your daughter just called,

175
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,200
wake up now,

176
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,559
get up.

177
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,520
What time is it?

178
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,120
Oh no,

179
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,799
I need to go,

180
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,240
I'll miss my high-speed train.

181
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,400
What are you doing?

182
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,960
I'm leaving,

183
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,799
nobody wants me here,

184
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,299
I'd better go quickly.

185
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,780
What's wrong with you?

186
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,780
Why are you angry with your child?

187
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,520
Sit down,

188
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,040
please sit.

189
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,160
You're a grown man,

190
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,480
look at you now.

191
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,480
Old Lei,

192
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,770
do you think if back then

193
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,880
I hadn't taken Nian Nian,

194
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,880
my life path

195
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,680
would be completely different?

196
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,400
Without Nian Nian,

197
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
I probably

198
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,240
would have married and had children.

199
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,700
What would my wife be like?

200
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,040
Would my children

201
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,840
be as adorable as Nian Nian?

202
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,520
But even so,

203
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,360
I've never regretted it,

204
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,200
not even now.

205
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,960
I understand.

206
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,040
I get you.

207
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,000
You know, blood ties

208
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,680
are innate.

209
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,130
Nian Nian and I don't have that.

210
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,660
Then we just don't.

211
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,740
You're overthinking.

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,530
What are you talking about?

213
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,000
Niannian.

214
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,440
Niannian.

215
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,770
Listen to me, Niannian.

216
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,880
Jianguo.

217
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,880
Niannian.

218
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,260
Don't run away.

219
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,440
Niannian, listen to me.

220
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,480
Come quick, something's happened.

221
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,200
Wait for me.

222
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,480
Niannian, you're back.

223
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,360
You're back.

224
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,200
Jianguo.

225
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Teacher Ding.

226
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,400
Jianguo.

227
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,840
Hurry.

228
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,880
This is where the mudslide happened that year.

229
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,040
All the victims

230
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,970
are buried here.

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,130
Your grandparents,

232
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,480
and your biological parents.
