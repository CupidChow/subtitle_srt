1
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,200
You're too kind.

2
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,840
Thank you.

3
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,400
Ms. Ping.

4
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,720
Mr. Ding.

5
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,440
Come visit my place sometime when you're free.

6
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,400
Teacher Ding.

7
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Ms. Ping.

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,520
Pleased to meet you.

9
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,440
Sorry for the trouble.

10
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,240
Thank you.

11
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,640
Teacher Ding.

12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,080
Want something to drink?

13
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,360
Sure, I'll have some.

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,039
Teacher Ding.

15
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,680
You never let me drink before.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,130
You're making an exception this time.

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,080
It just hit me

18
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,640
this time that

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,160
my daughter

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,600
is already 24 years old.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,039
Here.

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,970
Actually...

23
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,880
I used to find you so annoying.

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,580
I thought you were so nagging,

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,600
so stubborn,

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,560
always trying to control everything I did.

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
But I know

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
that in this world,

29
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,020
you love me more than anyone else.

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,000
Must be Qianqian's spicy beef.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,860
It's too spicy.

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,240
Making my eyes water.

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,200
In the past,

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,920
I was too strict with you.

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
When I think about it now,

36
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,760
I find it ridiculous myself.

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,400
Do I look a lot like my mom?

38
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,420
Don't I?

39
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,600
Exactly the same.

40
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,380
It's hard for me to imagine

41
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,920
all these years,

42
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,880
every time you saw my face,

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,480
you'd think of my mother,

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,260
yet you still tried so hard to hide the truth.

45
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,130
You went through so much

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,600
to protect me,

47
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,380
and I kept making you angry every day.

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,200
I was so thoughtless.

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
It wasn't as bad as you make it sound.

50
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,840
Besides,

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,520
you've given me

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,640
so many happy moments.

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,640
The two of us,

54
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,380
having this father-daughter bond in this life,

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,480
I'm very happy

56
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,140
and content with that.

57
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,240
I'm happy too,

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,680
and content as well.

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,800
I think having a father like you

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,329
makes me incredibly lucky.

61
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,120
If Mom can see us from heaven,

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,850
she would surely be comforted.

63
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,200
Our little Nian Nian

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,160
has finally grown up.

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,930
I've made up my mind.

66
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,300
I want to stay here.

67
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,200
I want to draw

68
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,000
and be a teacher at the same time.

69
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,930
Are you sure about this?

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,920
You're not against being a teacher anymore?

71
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,760
I was so focused on becoming an illustrator before.

72
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,120
I had no real understanding of teaching as a profession,

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,850
and you kept pushing me into it,

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,680
so I rebelled

75
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
and wanted even less to be a teacher.

76
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,850
But after experiencing it for a month,

77
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,360
I suddenly understand

78
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,620
the meaning behind the title 'teacher.'

79
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,279
I saw so many children

80
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,680
calling me Teacher Ding.

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,480
Teacher Ding.

82
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
When I see the pictures they've drawn

83
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,800
and how proud they feel,

84
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,000
it warms my heart.

85
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,080
And so many people like my paintings,

86
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,720
I even make a living with my art,

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,240
I've experienced unprecedented fulfillment,

88
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,520
I feel so valuable,

89
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,159
so happy,

90
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,620
and I truly accept myself.

91
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,960
Come.

92
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,000
I wish our little artist Ding

93
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,860
will create more and better works in the future.

94
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,420
Cheers.

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,290
Thanks, Dad.

96
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,720
Did you watch Suolang's video?

97
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,400
I couldn't avoid it, could I?

98
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,720
Daughter.

99
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,840
I think Suolang

100
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,080
is a brave and responsible young man.

101
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,920
If you really like him,

102
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,080
I won't object.

103
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,320
Really?

104
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,480
I trust my daughter's judgment.

105
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,460
Thank you, Dad.

106
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,000
Good.

107
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,159
Thanks, Dad.

108
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,040
Ping,

109
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
I'm planning to make a flower bed out front.

110
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,280
Duoji, I have something to tell everyone.

111
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,200
Go get everyone, please.

112
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,760
Alright.

113
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,680
I'm not dead,

114
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,880
so why are you crying?

115
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,960
That's enough.

116
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,960
Okay.

117
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,840
Ping.

118
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,280
We'll miss you.

119
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,240
My son

120
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,600
is taking me to Beijing to enjoy life,

121
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,659
so you all better give me some smiles.

122
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,560
Ping,

123
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,600
since I came here to support Tibet,

124
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,320
with its high mountains and long roads,

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,850
I've been really homesick.

126
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,200
You've always treated me like your own child,

127
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,400
giving me the best food and drinks,

128
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,640
always thinking of me,

129
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,200
and helping me with so many things, big and small.

130
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,640
I...

131
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,440
It's nothing serious.

132
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,380
From now on,

133
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,890
if you all stand united,

134
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,940
you won't fear any difficulties.

135
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,720
Remember, when you come to Beijing to visit me,

136
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,890
I'll take you to see Tiananmen Square.

137
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,700
The inn is yours to manage from now on.

138
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,440
Me?

139
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,960
Yes,

140
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,840
didn't you say you'd work like an ox and a horse

141
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,240
to make up for the losses?

142
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,800
Now you'd better do a good job,

143
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,400
because I'll be coming back to check on you randomly.

144
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,960
If you don't do well,

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,730
I'll have to teach you a lesson.

146
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,040
Sister Ping,

147
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,000
I think...

148
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,370
Suolang and Ding Nian might be more suitable than me.

149
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,040
They're busy promoting their partnership.

150
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
I don't have time for that,

151
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,100
you don't even have a partner,

152
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
so it has to be you.

153
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,410
I heard Teacher Ding is leaving next week.

154
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,560
He's been here for a long time.

155
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,340
What about you?

156
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll

157
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,929
decide after the Peach Blossom Festival.

158
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,039
Ding Nian.

159
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,240
What if I ask you to stay?

160
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,920
It's a very selfish act.

161
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,440
So, are you saying

162
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,040
you want me to leave?

163
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,210
How could that be possible?

164
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,160
I've always told you

165
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,360
to do what you love.

166
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,880
So I won't interfere with your choices

167
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,960
or your decisions.

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,480
Solang, look!

169
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,080
It's so beautiful.

170
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,800
I think

171
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,000
I probably won't ever leave this place

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,080
to live elsewhere.

173
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,280
I also know

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,800
that you'll leave here someday.

175
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,810
I can't promise you any future,

176
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,280
that would be lying

177
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,410
and irresponsible.

178
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,560
I only know this moment.

179
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
I really like you.

180
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,480
Solang.

181
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,000
Perhaps

182
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,840
we only have

183
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,040
this one spring together.

184
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,440
But our lives

185
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,890
have more than just one spring.

186
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,280
You've always told me

187
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,880
to do what I like.

188
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,120
Well, now

189
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
I like you.
