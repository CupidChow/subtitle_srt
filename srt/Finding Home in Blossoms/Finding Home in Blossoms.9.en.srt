1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,480
Daughters grow up

2
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,610
and start making their own decisions.

3
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,280
Actually, I'm quite jealous of you.

4
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,000
Jealous of me?

5
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,760
At least you have someone

6
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,440
around to argue with.

7
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,040
My son

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,800
doesn't even want to say a single word to me.

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
Where

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,840
is he now?

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,240
In Beijing.

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,480
He's doing well,

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,280
insists on having me move in with him.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,560
Isn't that wonderful?

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,920
Your son is successful,

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,800
wants you to enjoy life with him.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,860
What's not to like?

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,960
But I've lived here

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,240
for almost 40 years.

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,240
I don't want to move anywhere else.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,520
But that doesn't mean

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,020
you two should stop talking altogether.

23
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,880
Because

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,520
his father...

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,820
Teacher Ding should know.

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,280
That mudslide over 20 years ago.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,160
I know.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,039
Do you remember the statistics?

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,160
Four deaths.

30
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,440
One missing.

31
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,320
The missing person

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,680
was the child's father.

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
I was thinking...

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,200
He's not confirmed dead,

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,120
just missing,

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,840
so there's a chance he might still be alive,

37
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,440
right?

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,720
What if he comes back someday

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,650
and I'm not here?

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,960
What then?

41
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,100
That's why I need to stay here.

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,020
But my child doesn't understand,

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,940
he thinks I've gone crazy.

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,320
So that's what this is about.

45
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,880
Every family really does

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,600
have its own troubles.

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,000
Raising a child

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,600
all by yourself isn't easy,

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,520
it's been hard on you.

50
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,640
Actually, I think

51
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,570
you have it harder than I do.

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Look,

53
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,840
you're a grown man

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
raising a daughter all alone,

55
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,780
being both father and mother,

56
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,400
it can't be easy.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,360
It's all in the past.

58
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:46,800
Here.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,360
Why so glum?

60
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,640
Had another fight with your dad?

61
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,840
My dad,

62
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,560
he may be overbearing

63
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,560
and nagging,

64
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,560
but for my sake

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,180
he hasn't remarried all these years,

66
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,520
and has put all his energy

67
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,160
into raising me.

68
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,720
I suddenly realize

69
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,170
I shouldn't treat him this way.

70
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,640
So, you mean

71
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,000
you should listen to him

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,660
and go back to being a teacher?

73
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,640
Of course not.

74
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,840
I just think

75
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,970
I should communicate better with him.

76
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,840
He loves me so much,

77
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,960
he'll surely understand me too,

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,560
right?

79
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,380
Someone who loves you will always support your dreams.

80
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,800
Ding Nian, look at this!

81
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,530
I prepared some sweets for you.

82
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,079
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,080
Tell me

84
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
why Sister Ping's prices are so high

85
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,520
yet people still come

86
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,720
preferring expensive accommodations

87
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,640
rather than those with better value?

88
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,200
Because Sister Ping clearly knows

89
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,480
her target audience.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,080
Target audience.

91
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,640
Sister Ping has always known how to

92
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,480
build her brand and reputation

93
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,960
and she's also learning online marketing.

94
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,159
She lets guests

95
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,680
post positive reviews with photos

96
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,120
to get discounts on their stay.

97
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,320
If regular customers refer new ones

98
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,120
she even gives them commission.

99
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
You know what?

100
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,520
Isn't she great at business?

101
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,040
I guess so.

102
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,400
But without Ding Nian

103
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,040
she wouldn't have become this popular.

104
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,880
So you see how clever she is

105
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,940
immediately latching onto Ding Nian

106
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,370
just like she did with Qianqian back then.

107
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,640
You know what

108
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,280
now she's using Ding Nian

109
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,480
to get to you.

110
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,080
What's between me and Ding Nian isn't real.

111
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,880
It was Haozi's idea

112
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,560
for us to fake a relationship.

113
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,760
Fake a relationship.

114
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,280
You... you really

115
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,240
consider me your brother

116
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,500
yet keep me in the dark?

117
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,480
That's how it is now.

118
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,050
But who knows

119
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,120
what might happen in the future?

120
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,600
I get it, Suolang.

121
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,120
You've developed feelings.

122
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,980
You've fallen for her, you know that?

123
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,240
Come on.

124
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,159
Alright, we're getting ready for the livestream,

125
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,490
starting at 7:30 sharp.

126
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,120
Are you two strangers or something?

127
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,380
Move closer together.

128
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,880
I've never done a livestream before,

129
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,960
I'm so nervous.

130
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,760
Don't worry,

131
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
if you don't know what to say,

132
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,480
just speak less,

133
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,610
I'll do the talking.

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,400
All those product descriptions,

135
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,730
you memorized them all?

136
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,120
You don't need to memorize everything perfectly,

137
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,200
just get the general idea,

138
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
plus we have a teleprompter anyway.

139
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,520
This tea

140
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,240
uses ripe Pu'er as its base

141
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,640
and only during the third process

142
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,040
do we add peach blossoms.

143
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,920
This way it combines the

144
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,280
rich flavor of Pu'er tea

145
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,480
with the fresh elegance of peach blossoms.

146
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,920
As you know, Pu'er tea is rich in tea polyphenols,

147
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,560
while peach blossoms contain amygdalin

148
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,200
and vitamins among other nutrients.

149
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,240
Then our product

150
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,400
comes in vacuum packaging,

151
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,520
contains no preservatives,

152
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,580
so you can enjoy it with peace of mind.

153
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,560
Additionally,

154
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,240
during Qianqian's development of this tea...

155
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,280
I actually tried many different tea bases

156
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,080
before finally choosing Pu'er.

157
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,320
First of all,

158
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,480
Pu'er is commonly consumed in Tibet.

159
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,800
Secondly, its overall flavor is rich and rustic,

160
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,960
which perfectly matches the regional characteristics.

161
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,000
Like our peach blossom pastries,

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,720
we ship within 7 days after ordering,

163
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,120
and since these are food products,

164
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,960
once opened, if there are no quality issues...

165
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,090
we don't accept returns or exchanges.

166
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,360
Why are you looking at jokes during our livestream?

167
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,320
What are you laughing at?

168
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,640
Nothing.

169
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,280
No way, you have to tell us,

170
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,240
share it with our viewers

171
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,040
come on,

172
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,770
let everyone have a good laugh.

173
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,120
I just saw a corny joke.

174
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,240
Do you know how

175
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,560
Zhao Zilong died?

176
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,040
How did he die?

177
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,080
He died of cholecystitis.

178
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
Is cholecystitis fatal?

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
Cholecystitis isn't fatal,

180
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,560
but Zhao Zilong

181
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,960
was all gall! (courage)

182
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,000
Right.

183
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,120
Cheers!

184
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,920
Try all these dishes I made.

185
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,520
Nian Nian, look.

186
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:15,920
See?

187
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,640
I've shared the livestream link

188
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,040
to all the group chats.

189
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
They're so supportive.

190
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,240
They all placed orders.

191
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,400
Look!

192
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,320
Dad, you're amazing.

193
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,000
Nian Nian,

194
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,240
you look so pretty on camera.

195
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,080
I took a screenshot for you, look.

196
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,720
I already saw that.

197
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,520
Why are you using your real name

198
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,919
as your ID?

199
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,919
What ID?

200
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't know what you mean.

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,059
Change it quickly.

202
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,700
I don't know how to.

203
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,679
Can you help me change it?

204
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,300
Look, it says 'Ding Jianguo'.

205
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,840
Look, Lao Lei,

206
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,840
how much this place has changed.

207
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,320
It really has changed a lot.

208
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,980
If you hadn't shown me the way,

209
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,610
I definitely wouldn't have found this place.

210
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,160
Yes,

211
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,480
over these 20 years,

212
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,040
Tibet has changed quite a bit,

213
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,700
but you haven't changed much.

214
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,120
You don't look 65 at all,

215
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,800
more like early 40s.

216
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,240
Don't joke with me.

217
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,560
When I left Tibet for Zhejiang back then,

218
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,640
I was already in my early 40s.

219
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,400
You have no idea

220
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,160
how stressful it is being both father and mother

221
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,040
to a child.

222
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,160
But what about Nian Nian?

223
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,280
She's been sensible and lovely since she was little.

224
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,040
Alright,

225
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,600
now you're just showing off.

226
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,240
Jianguo,

227
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,440
do you remember

228
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,200
those two apprentices you trained back then?

229
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,730
They're both studying at medical school now.

230
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,560
They've become proper doctors.

231
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,120
Really?

232
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,960
That's wonderful.

233
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,520
It looks desperate,

234
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,400
creating fake couples just to sell products

235
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,530
and grab attention.

236
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,160
What did I tell you?

237
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,890
Lying is simply unacceptable.

238
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,080
This kid.

239
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,450
Women's reviews

240
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,080
national reviews.

241
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,400
Women's reviews

242
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,800
national reviews.

243
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,860
National reviews.

244
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm furious!

245
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,840
Who is it?

246
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,280
Who would be so despicable?

247
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,040
This is clearly someone

248
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,560
deliberately targeting us.

249
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,680
And those comments

250
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,280
are just someone trying to stir up trouble.

251
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,400
How's the situation now?

252
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,200
Many customers are requesting refunds

253
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,160
because we haven't shipped anything,

254
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,200
so we have no choice but to issue full refunds.

255
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,120
We're done for.

256
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,450
It's all my fault. I messed everything up.

257
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,400
This isn't your fault.

258
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,680
How could anyone blame you?

259
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,280
Your intentions were good.

260
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,000
Which little bastard

261
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,360
is behind all this?

262
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,200
This has sold us all out.

263
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
Not many people knew about this.

264
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,240
I must catch this

265
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,040
traitor.

266
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,000
Everyone, listen to me.

267
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Now is not the time to place blame.

268
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,280
We need to think about

269
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,320
how to fix this.

270
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,680
Teacher Ding,

271
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,940
please help us figure something out.

272
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,570
Let him help us find a solution?

273
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,520
I bet he's the happiest one here.

274
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,880
Me? Happy?

275
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,960
Isn't this what you wanted? For me to go home with you?

276
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,760
Well, now

277
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,040
you're getting your wish.

278
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,720
Nian Nian,

279
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,000
what are you talking about?

280
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,880
If you don't want to go back,

281
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,200
I've taken two months off.

282
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,280
I can stay here with you.

283
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,560
Don't I know you well enough?

284
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,120
You're always going on and on about

285
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,920
what I should be doing at my age,

286
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,600
forcing me to live the life you've planned for me.

287
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,960
You're capable of anything.

288
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,760
Do you suspect

289
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,400
that I exposed you all?

290
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,530
Who else could it be?

291
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,680
I've run so far away,

292
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,540
why won't you just leave me alone?

293
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,680
I'm just worried about you.

294
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,880
What are you worried about?

295
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,760
That I'm too happy?

296
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,480
That I'm too free?

297
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,640
That I'm doing things I actually enjoy?

298
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,840
I'm all grown up now,

299
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,520
why don't I have

300
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,320
any right to make my own choices?

301
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,080
Fine.

302
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,480
So in your eyes,

303
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,480
I'm just the villain.

304
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,400
I'm the bad guy.

305
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,720
Teacher Ding!
