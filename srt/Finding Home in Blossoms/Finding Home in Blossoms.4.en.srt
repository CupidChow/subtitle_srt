1
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,200
Every spring

2
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,530
when all the peach blossoms bloom here

3
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,410
it's an endless sea of flowers.

4
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,490
The peach trees here

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,000
are indeed different from those in the city,

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,130
they're beautiful.

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,360
Haozi said you should paint the local scenery,

8
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,690
so I should be a good host

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,320
and take you around to explore,

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,580
to find inspiration for your paintings.

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,920
Actually,

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,620
I watch your video channel every day,

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,039
and I've already found a lot of inspiration from it.

14
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:08,570
So are you

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
making good progress with your painting?

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,650
It's going well.

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,760
Here I feel

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,760
as if

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,840
my mother in heaven

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,500
is silently watching over me,

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,420
so I can quickly get into the zone,

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,440
and paint whatever I want.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,130
This tree is called Nilan Wood.

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,280
This tree has a name?

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,600
I named it myself.

26
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,800
Nilan in Tibetan

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,840
means 'dream'.

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,680
Once when I was little,

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,080
I came out alone to herd cattle

30
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,479
and got lost around here.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,120
I slept under this tree all night.

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,320
In my dream, a goddess told me

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,039
she was the deity who guards peach trees

34
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,160
and would protect me.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,840
Until the next day,

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,770
when my family found me, I realized

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,600
there had been wild animals prowling around that night,

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,000
they had killed two cows,

39
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,420
and I had no idea at all.

40
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,440
But

41
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,200
all these trees look the same.

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,250
How did you recognize this one?

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,080
I can distinguish

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,640
the differences between every peach tree here.

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,120
Every flower,

46
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,000
every blade of grass, every tree

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,130
in this world is unique.

48
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,970
There are no two identical trees in the world.

49
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,840
It's called

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,160
Nilan Wood.

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,640
Hmm.

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,400
Actually,

53
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,810
I often have a recurring dream.

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,160
In the dream,

55
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,120
I see my mother standing in front of a peach blossom tree,

56
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,079
smiling at me.

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,079
Just like that drawing in your sketchbook.

58
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,040
This is the only photo

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,480
my mother left me.

60
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,000
I've already asked around for you,

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,280
but there are too many people named Ciyang,

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
without any other specific information,

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,000
it's indeed difficult to find her.

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,880
It's okay,

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,120
it must be difficult to find her,

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,050
after all, it's been over 20 years.

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,079
Look,

68
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,060
that's Namcha Barwa Peak.

69
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,160
Today

70
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,960
the weather isn't cooperating,

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,660
I can't see it anymore.

72
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,320
It's okay,

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,450
even if you can't see it,

74
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,240
the mountain is still there.

75
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,800
Everyone.

76
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,800
Everyone.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,720
You guys

78
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,200
are going viral.

79
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,560
Taoyuan Ming Residence is going viral.

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,520
Don't you check your phones?

81
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,000
No.

82
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,160
That couple who came

83
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,090
for their honeymoon a few days ago,

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
one is fashion blogger Xiaoye,

85
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,240
the other is photography blogger David Wang.

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,280
The night before last,

87
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,920
when Xiaoye was livestreaming,

88
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,780
she praised our food and service,

89
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,240
and especially the portrait Ding Nian gave them.

90
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,100
And guess what?

91
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,160
That portrait

92
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,890
has gone absolutely viral.

93
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,560
Now everyone online is asking

94
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
if every guest gets a portrait.

95
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
Yes, absolutely.

96
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,160
Every guest gets one.

97
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,320
I've already replied to users from our official account.

98
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,519
We'll give portraits to all our guests.

99
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,570
Haozi, you're awesome!

100
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,280
Really?

101
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,200
That painting actually went viral?

102
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,330
You have no idea how popular Xiaoye is.

103
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm guessing

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,240
there must be a bunch of couples

105
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,720
on their way here right now.

106
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,680
Get ready to take orders.

107
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,340
How's it going?

108
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,440
It's true,

109
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,800
we're fully booked for the weekend.

110
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,240
See that?

111
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,800
Hurry up,

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,159
tell Baima to find someone to help.

113
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,040
Qianqian,

114
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,280
the kitchen needs to prepare more food.

115
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,159
Oh right,

116
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,360
is the menu ready yet?

117
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Almost done.

118
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,400
Let me see just how popular it is.

119
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,760
I have an idea,

120
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,480
we need to strike while the iron is hot.

121
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,320
What?

122
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,800
Aren't we preparing for this year's Peach Blossom Festival?

123
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,320
I'd like you to create some paintings for the festival

124
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,580
for online promotion.

125
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,760
I...

126
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,000
can I really do it?

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,080
Of course you can,

128
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,920
as long as people like it.

129
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,680
It just proves you're a good artist,

130
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,080
right?

131
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,090
Well,

132
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
I'll try my best.

133
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,760
Give it a try.

134
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,720
Just try it.

135
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
It's freshly baked,

136
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
eat it while it's hot.

137
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,560
Look,

138
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,320
this is so embarrassing.

139
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,720
I knew you didn't have time for breakfast this morning.

140
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,320
We were looking for someone to collaborate with anyway,

141
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
and you came at just the right time.

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,530
I'll try my best.

143
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,520
You can do it.

144
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,280
Okay.

145
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,560
Ding Nian.

146
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,960
I have an idea now,

147
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,400
give me those paintings.

148
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,520
I've been looking at them over and over,

149
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,120
and I like them more and more.

150
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,920
I think

151
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:37,840
we could turn them into

152
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,360
cultural and creative products.

153
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,159
Like postcards,

154
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,960
notebooks, stamps, stickers,

155
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,400
these basic products.

156
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,600
They're quick to make and low-cost,

157
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,240
and young people really love them nowadays.

158
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
I love those merchandise items.

159
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
You like them too?

160
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,480
That's great.

161
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,640
Let's look into it,

162
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,680
study it carefully, come on.

163
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,880
Come,

164
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,360
take it easy, slow down.

165
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,880
Hello.

166
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,840
Could you both please provide your ID cards?

167
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
I need to register your check-in.

168
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,680
We're not in a hurry to check in.

169
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,480
We'd like to get portraits done.

170
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,920
No rush, no rush.

171
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
Check in first

172
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,480
and put your luggage away.

173
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,080
When you go out later,

174
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,200
take plenty of photos,

175
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,880
choose a nice one and send it to me,

176
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,680
then I'll arrange for your portraits.

177
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
I see.

178
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,320
What was that peak called again?

179
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,380
I want that one too.

180
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,360
Namcha Barwa Peak.

181
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,080
Right.

182
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,600
If you want to photograph that scenery, you'll need to take a car.

183
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,280
No, no, no. We want to ride horses.

184
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,120
Then I'll help you arrange for horses.

185
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,250
That would be great.

186
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,820
Come on, everyone!

187
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,240
30 yuan for half an hour,

188
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
for horseback riding in our village,

189
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,320
it's the standard rate for everyone.

190
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,800
Okay?

191
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,760
Take care!

192
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,050
Enjoy your stay.

193
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,040
Welcome.

194
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,040
Come,

195
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,100
register here.

196
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,440
Take care.

197
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,410
Are you done with the painting?

198
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,640
Just finished.

199
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,140
I left some food on the windowsill

200
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,520
so you can grab a bite.

201
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,900
Mare's milk and barley cakes,

202
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,120
they help with sleep.

203
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,170
It actually suits my taste,

204
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,560
but I've always liked strong flavors.

205
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,760
What do you all think?

206
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,600
Ajala.

207
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,120
How's the taste for you?

208
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,080
So spicy!

209
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,760
Spicy!

210
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,200
I think...

211
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,880
I find it a bit salty,

212
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,520
but if you eat it with rice

213
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,580
or barley cakes, it's actually fine.

214
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,890
There's just one issue though,

215
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,320
it tastes great right off the stove,

216
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,840
but not so good when it gets cold.

217
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,440
And with the current weather,

218
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,680
dishes cool down quickly.

219
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,720
That's not a problem.

220
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,120
We can keep it warm with a flame underneath.

221
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,400
Considering people's varying tolerance for spice,

222
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,440
I think we should offer two flavors.

223
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,919
One mildly spicy,

224
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,460
and one regular spicy.

225
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,919
Good, let's do that.

226
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,960
Also,

227
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,299
I'm planning to set up our front yard,

228
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,760
get some outdoor tables and chairs,

229
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,440
sun shades, string lights,

230
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,640
fire pits and such.

231
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,040
Sister Ping, you're going all out!

232
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,280
The village is really

233
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,680
emphasizing the Peach Blossom Festival this time.

234
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,480
In life,

235
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,460
you need to seize opportunities.

236
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,360
For the comprehensive upgrade

237
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,240
of our courtyard's facilities,

238
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,010
I've decided

239
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
to increase the room rates by 30%.

240
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,040
That much?

241
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,600
Aren't we including paintings too?

242
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,130
Do you think art comes free?

243
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,300
The artist hasn't even been paid yet.

244
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,760
I'm still working on the numbers, aren't I?

245
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,160
Once I've figured it out,

246
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,760
Ding Nian,

247
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,170
you'll get your fair share.

248
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,240
Thanks, sis.

249
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,480
About the cultural products,

250
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,140
I've ordered some notebooks,

251
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,620
postcards and stamps.

252
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,240
When they're ready,

253
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,640
I'll put some in your inn,

254
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,440
and some at the post office,

255
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,570
to see how they sell.

256
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,880
Here's the contract.

257
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,560
Since I'm using your artwork,

258
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,880
let's keep this professional,

259
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,160
and pay the proper royalties.

260
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,800
We'll go with

261
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,760
an advance plus commission

262
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
for your payment.

263
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,040
Is this for real?

264
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,200
I feel like I'm dreaming.

265
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,240
No rush, take your time to review it.

266
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,560
Contact me anytime if you have questions.

267
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
I'll be going now.

268
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,480
Thanks, Hao.

269
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,410
Bye, no problem.

270
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,800
I really didn't expect this.

271
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,130
It all happened so fast,

272
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,680
like I'm in a dream.

273
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,460
Your talent has been recognized.

274
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,000
I need to thank you properly.

275
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,080
Thank me?

276
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
That tree,

277
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,360
the Nilan tree,

278
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,500
there might really be a spirit living inside it.

279
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,520
Well, this spirit has excellent taste.
