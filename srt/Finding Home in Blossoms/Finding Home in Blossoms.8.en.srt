1
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,680
My head

2
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,480
is spinning,

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
I feel so dizzy and nauseous.

4
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,520
The patient's condition is due to

5
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
intense physical activity

6
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,600
triggering his existing hypertension.

7
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,640
Please complete

8
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,400
the admission procedures as soon as possible.

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,240
Okay, thank you.

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,760
You're welcome.

11
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,200
Thank you.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,130
You're welcome.

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,840
You clearly don't know how,

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,240
so why are you butting in?

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,760
Grandpa.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,680
Good child.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,640
Teacher Ding,

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,039
this is my grandfather.

19
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,120
He heard you were hospitalized

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,920
and came specially to visit you.

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,120
Village Chief,

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,320
what brings you here?

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,480
Good doctor.

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,440
Please sit,

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,100
have a seat.

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,810
I'm getting old.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,680
Getting old indeed.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,759
That's right,

29
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,420
not like the old days anymore.

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,690
This place has changed so much.

31
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,020
When I was volunteering in Tibet,

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,400
the roads weren't even built yet,

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,920
we had to walk to get into the village.

34
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,880
Whenever it rained,

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,400
it was impossible to get in at all.

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,640
Yes,

37
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,900
you've worked so hard.

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,280
Saving lives and healing the wounded.

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,240
A good doctor.

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,170
You're too kind.

41
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,520
Good girl,

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,050
my granddaughter-in-law.

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,800
Getting married.

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,280
No, no,

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,240
that's not right.

46
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,770
No, no, that's not correct.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,759
Grandpa.

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,680
Teacher Ding needs to rest,

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,080
let's go home first

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,600
and come back to visit another day.

51
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,280
Let's go.

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,160
Goodbye, Grandpa.

53
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,800
Village Chief,

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I'll come visit you when I'm better.

55
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,680
Good.

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,079
What's going on?

57
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,360
What do you mean by daughter-in-law?

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,120
It's not what you think.

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,520
The old village chief has Alzheimer's.

60
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,900
He's confused one moment and lucid the next.

61
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,760
Solang wanted to cheer up his grandfather,

62
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,040
so he asked me to pretend with him,

63
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,320
to make him happy,

64
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,960
just like those fake celebrity couples,

65
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,840
it's all fake.

66
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,880
Alright,

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,160
calm down,

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,240
lie back down,

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,160
or you'll get dizzy again.

70
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,820
Isn't that deceiving people?

71
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,600
Isn't that morally questionable?

72
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,760
Come on, Teacher Ding.

73
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,680
Don't make such a big deal out of it,

74
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
it's just a white lie.

75
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,560
A white lie.

76
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,720
Son, what are you doing?

77
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,360
Dad.

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,760
I'm planning to turn our house into a guesthouse.

79
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,200
What?

80
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Look at Taoyuanming Residence,

81
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,920
their business is so good.

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,320
We could run a guesthouse too.

83
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,920
Why do you always jump from one idea to another?

84
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,090
Didn't you tell me not to go out?

85
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,380
Now I finally came up with an idea,

86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
and you're against it again.

87
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,480
But have you ever worked in this business?

88
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,520
Do you have any experience?

89
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
I can learn.

90
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,079
You make it sound so easy.

91
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,600
That Taoyuanming Residence

92
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,720
has been in business for over a decade.

93
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,560
This kind of business

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
requires long-term commitment,

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,600
and with your temperament, you can't handle it.

96
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,160
Why is it always like this?

97
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,040
I haven't even started,

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,440
and you're already throwing cold water on me.

99
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,720
Because when you do things,

100
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,180
you never follow through.

101
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,090
Son, have you thought about

102
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,540
if we turn our home into a guesthouse,

103
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,170
where will our family live?

104
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,760
Besides, Sister Ping's place

105
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,420
was built up little by little.

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,760
It started with just three guest rooms,

107
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,000
and gradually developed to what it is now,

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
which is already quite impressive.

109
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,680
Since my dad arrived,

110
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,850
I've been exhausted every day.

111
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,920
I'm tired during the day, tired at night,

112
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,680
physically exhausted, mentally drained.

113
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,040
I finally understand

114
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,500
why you ran away from home.

115
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,880
But I think Teacher Ding is quite adorable.

116
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,160
Alright.

117
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,200
Drink up.

118
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,400
Let's sing.

119
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't just leave your glass sitting there.

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,320
This aged wine

121
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,560
is offered by the Moon Fairy herself.

122
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,960
Suolang.

123
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,840
I actually envy you.

124
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,520
You can do whatever you want.

125
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,080
No one stops you or puts you down.

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,640
You're as free as the wind.

127
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,050
You're a free stallion,

128
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,890
a soaring eagle.

129
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,920
I envy you more,

130
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,640
going away to college,

131
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
seeing the world.

132
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,159
Here.

133
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
But what's the point?

134
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm still controlled

135
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,680
by my old man completely.

136
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,600
Actually,

137
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,290
I'm starting to understand them a bit now.

138
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
They're just afraid we'll take the wrong path.

139
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,560
Wrong path?

140
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,810
What exactly is the wrong path?

141
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,240
It's like,

142
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,970
they clearly know everything,

143
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,440
they know there are no shortcuts in life,

144
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,640
but when it comes to us,

145
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,100
they lose all rationality

146
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,640
and just want to straighten

147
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,900
every path ahead of us.

148
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,840
My dad says,

149
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,540
a gentleman stays away from the kitchen.

150
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,560
I said, good thing I'm a woman.

151
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,680
But now I understand,

152
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,120
he was afraid I'd find it too difficult.

153
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,800
But when I'm doing

154
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,440
something I love,

155
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,800
how could I find it difficult?

156
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,160
It's pure happiness.

157
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,200
Duoji.

158
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,800
Do you really want

159
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,200
to come back and run a homestay?

160
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,560
Yes.

161
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,170
Good.

162
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,490
Let me give you some advice.

163
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,280
You should

164
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,080
work at Taoyuan Ming Residence first,

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
without asking for payment.

166
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,560
And then?

167
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,600
Learn diligently from Sister Ping.

168
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,860
Once you've

169
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,280
learned how to operate

170
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,480
and manage a homestay,

171
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,810
prove it to your father.

172
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,159
I believe

173
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,560
your father will definitely support you.

174
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,360
That's right.

175
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,159
Exactly,

176
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,880
if your father sees you

177
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,760
taking things seriously,

178
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,290
he'll definitely acknowledge your efforts.

179
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,120
Me.

180
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,760
Can I?

181
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,200
Yes, you can.

182
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,400
Really?

183
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,520
Yes.

184
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:06,880
Here.

185
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,360
Come on.

186
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,640
Cheers.

187
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,640
Sister Ping.

188
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,720
I've been thinking

189
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,520
and your place is perfect for me.

190
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
It might suit you,

191
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,080
but you don't suit me.

192
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,760
Look,

193
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,520
I have Qianqian for cooking,

194
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,760
Baima for cleaning,

195
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,460
Dingian at the front desk,

196
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,280
and Suolang for all the heavy lifting.

197
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,880
Tell me,

198
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,340
what else do I need?

199
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,000
Me.

200
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,650
I can do everything they do.

201
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,440
For example, when Dingian goes to school,

202
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
I can work at the front desk.

203
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,480
When Suolang goes to shoot videos,

204
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,540
I can carry things.

205
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,680
When Qianqian needs assistance,

206
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,000
I can wash vegetables and stuff.

207
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,920
I've watched you grow up,

208
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,690
you little smooth talker. You're too clever,

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,460
and I don't believe you're here just to work.

210
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Then give me a probation period,

211
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,880
test me out, okay?

212
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,280
That works.

213
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,000
One month probation,

214
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
with no salary.

215
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,720
Deal.

216
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,060
Here's the situation:

217
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,440
we're selling products through livestreams,

218
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,280
and our main products are

219
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,040
peach blossom pastries and peach blossom Pu'er tea.

220
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,680
And then,

221
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,720
our cultural and creative merchandise

222
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,520
will be given away as free gifts.

223
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,970
Such beautiful creative items as free gifts?

224
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,880
People might actually buy our products

225
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,340
because of our free gifts.

226
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,720
Can I get one as a gift first?

227
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,360
You

228
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,200
can ask Ding Nian for the original artwork,

229
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,799
why do you need the free gift?

230
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,130
Is this painting

231
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,880
really drawn by Nian Nian?

232
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,120
Pretty good, right?

233
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Ding Nian is a natural-born artist.

234
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,240
We plan to make a few dozen sample sets first,

235
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,080
and then produce and manufacture

236
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,920
based on the volume of online orders.

237
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,960
We'll only sell what we make,

238
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,480
promising delivery within seven days.

239
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,560
This way we won't have

240
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,000
a supply-demand imbalance,

241
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,560
right?

242
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,040
How are you so clever?

243
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,000
Not really,

244
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,520
for the sales part,

245
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,920
we'll mainly rely on Ding Nian and Suolang.

246
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,520
I teach at school twice a week now,

247
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
and spend the rest of my time at the guesthouse,

248
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,400
managing the front desk and painting.

249
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,280
I can see that

250
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,960
you've adapted to your role as a teacher,

251
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,090
which is quite good.

252
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,580
At least you've gained

253
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,400
some volunteer teaching experience in Tibet.

254
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,560
Dad, why are you always like this?

255
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,040
What did I say?

256
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,160
I'm doing what I love,

257
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,890
without any ulterior motives.

258
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,360
Nian Nian,

259
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,320
you're too idealistic.

260
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,040
Life is practical,

261
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,600
and you'll have to face reality sooner or later.

262
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,730
You need to survive,

263
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
you need to make money to support yourself.

264
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,640
Tell me,

265
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,240
can you really stay

266
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,440
in this place forever?

267
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,120
I... I don't know.

268
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,050
I haven't really thought about it.

269
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,970
Life unfolds one step at a time.

270
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,440
I understand all the principles you're talking about,

271
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,700
but I don't want to live that kind of life.

272
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,640
Yes,

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,880
of course there are hardships here,

274
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,540
and times when I'm exhausted,

275
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,160
but what I feel is

276
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,240
happiness

277
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,160
and freedom.

278
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,680
Be honest with me,

279
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,480
do you want to stay here

280
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,800
because of Suolang?

281
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,570
If that's what you want to think, I can't stop you.

282
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,360
Dad.

283
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,640
This is Mom's hometown.

284
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,770
Everyone here likes me,

285
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,320
and what I'm doing is meaningful.

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,730
I feel a fulfillment and happiness I've never experienced before.

287
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Many things are just beginning now,

288
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
and I'm definitely not leaving.

289
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,240
Fine,

290
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,160
then I'll stay with you.

291
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,820
You're not going back to work?

292
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,920
I'll take time off.
