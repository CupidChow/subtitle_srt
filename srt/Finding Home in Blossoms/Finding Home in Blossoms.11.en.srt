1
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,680
All the victims

2
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,770
are buried here.

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
Your maternal grandparents

4
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,580
and your biological parents.

5
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,080
Take your medication regularly,

6
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,840
you'll feel better in two or three days,

7
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,700
and recover completely in a week.

8
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,020
They liked each other,

9
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,400
but due to circumstances,

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,370
they couldn't be together.

11
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,920
Following her parents' arrangement,

12
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,560
Ciyang

13
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,479
married a local young man named Gesang.

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,610
A year later, she gave birth to you.

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,970
Old Ding was really heartbroken then,

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,280
so he threw himself into his work.

17
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,720
When people tried to set him up,

18
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
he wouldn't even give them a glance.

19
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,360
Soon three years passed,

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,520
and his aid work in Tibet came to an end.

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,680
I remember that winter

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,140
came particularly early.

23
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,620
There was a lot of rain.

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,360
Dr. Ding,

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,560
there's been a mudslide by the river,

26
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,400
people are seriously injured,

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,120
please come help quickly.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,650
Alright.

29
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,500
Ciyang.

30
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,400
Ciyang.

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,960
Ciyang.

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,680
My

33
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,920
my daughter.

34
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,600
After the mudslide investigation

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,440
is complete,

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,120
wait for me, okay?

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,440
It's confirmed that your mom and dad,

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,740
your grandparents

39
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,900
all perished in the accident.

40
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,120
You are the only bloodline

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,890
they left in this world.

42
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,320
Thinking that you don't have

43
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,380
a single relative left in this world.

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
I couldn't bear it.

45
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,010
I decided to hide the truth.

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,920
After completing the adoption procedures,

47
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,450
I took you back to Zhejiang.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,200
I named you Ding Nian.

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,260
Nian as in 'never forget.'

50
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,650
From then on,

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,720
you became his own daughter.

52
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,840
To let you grow up

53
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,000
like an ordinary child,

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,800
we all thought

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,920
it would be better

56
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,850
not to let you know about your past.

57
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,320
But as a single man,

58
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
he sometimes feared he couldn't take good care of you.

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
So he never considered

60
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,770
getting married or having more children.

61
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,600
Nian Nian.

62
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,200
I've been

63
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,920
reflecting a lot lately.

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,880
Was it wrong

65
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,920
for me to keep this from you?

66
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,320
By not letting you know about your origins,

67
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,560
you'll never know

68
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,280
where your roots are.

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,079
But I was afraid.

70
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,240
Nian Nian.

71
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,360
Dad really wasn't trying

72
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
to deceive you.

73
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,240
I just wanted you to be a simple,

74
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,280
happy child.

75
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,000
To grow up without worries.

76
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,880
To live a happy and peaceful life forever.

77
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm sorry, Dad.

78
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,080
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,970
It's so late,

80
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,240
who is it?

81
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,720
Luosang.

82
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,040
Son,

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,560
why are you back?

84
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,640
Well, our homestay is trending online,

85
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,300
seems better than I expected.

86
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,960
All the buzz is just online,

87
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,320
it's nothing special.

88
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Now we don't even get a fly coming in.

89
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,660
Why don't you come with me to Beijing?

90
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,640
How could I possibly do that?

91
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,360
I'm supporting so many people here.

92
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,400
You can barely take care of yourself,

93
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,320
yet you're still worrying about others.

94
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,200
That's exactly why we need to get through this together.

95
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,120
I can't just abandon ship,

96
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,640
that's not who I am.

97
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,280
Mom,

98
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
I know what you're thinking,

99
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,010
it's been so many years. Stop waiting.

100
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,840
What do you know?

101
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,760
I think Ding Nian's emotions have stabilized now

102
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,360
and the father and daughter should be able to have a good talk.

103
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,160
Actually,

104
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,840
knowing one's true identity

105
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
is a good thing.

106
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,960
Even though I'm not her,

107
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,560
I still hope

108
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
she can get along well with Teacher Ding,

109
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,680
just like before.

110
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,250
No, wait.

111
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,880
Even better than before.

112
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,960
What do you think?

113
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,640
Will Niannian like

114
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,120
the mochi I made?

115
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,060
Whenever I was sad before,

116
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,210
Grandma would always make this for me.

117
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,800
With your thoughtfulness,

118
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,330
she'll definitely like it.

119
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,680
Auntie will definitely like it.

120
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,180
Let me contribute something too.

121
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,370
This jar of wine,

122
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,420
you finally decided to dig it out.

123
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,000
This wine

124
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,880
was left by your father.

125
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,880
I was planning

126
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,940
to wait until he returned to drink it.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,200
Not waiting anymore.

128
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,130
The year your father disappeared,

129
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,080
you were just in elementary school.

130
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,280
In the blink of an eye,

131
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,010
you've grown up so much.

132
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,800
I still remember

133
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,280
when Dad rode out on his horse that day,

134
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,690
both he and the horse disappeared.

135
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,240
If he's alive, we should see him;

136
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,040
if he's dead, we should see his body.

137
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,160
We haven't seen anything,

138
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,720
so why say he's dead?

139
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,280
This is the wine Dad brewed that spring,

140
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,659
and now there's only one jar left.

141
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,320
When you buried it,

142
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,480
did you already know

143
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,320
that Dad wasn't coming back?

144
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,640
Then why did you

145
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,200
wait so desperately?

146
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,260
A widow's doorstep attracts gossip,

147
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,450
but I firmly believe

148
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,860
my husband isn't dead.

149
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
So I'm not a widow,

150
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,640
and you're a child with a father.

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,080
Parents' hearts everywhere

152
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,980
are essentially the same.

153
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,860
Today when I saw Ding Nian and her father,

154
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,920
I suddenly felt the weight

155
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
lift from my heart.

156
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,010
This jar of wine,

157
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,570
I'll give it to them, father and daughter.

158
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,840
Although Solang took

159
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,240
all the blame for this,

160
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,800
it was actually my fault.

161
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,240
I wanted to use their popularity

162
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
to make our Peach Blossom Festival happen this year,

163
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,400
but I never expected it would backfire

164
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,440
and cause such huge losses for our village.

165
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,040
I take full responsibility.

166
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,770
Stop lingering there. Come in.

167
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,220
Do you need something?

168
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,520
Actually, I was the one who leaked this.

169
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,640
You leaked it?

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,320
You?

171
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,640
Why would you do that?

172
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,480
That night I was drinking with friends,

173
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,080
got too drunk,

174
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,680
and blurted everything out.

175
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,320
But I really didn't expect

176
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,920
things would turn out like this.

177
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,560
You're truly useless at doing good but excellent at making trouble.

178
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,840
Even though that's the case,

179
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,360
deceiving the public is definitely wrong,

180
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,800
but we can't blame Duoji entirely.

181
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,920
That's one thing,

182
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,440
but what you did was also wrong.

183
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,920
Yes,

184
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,320
I know.

185
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,000
Taking shortcuts like I did

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,200
was definitely wrong.

187
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,000
I apologize.

188
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,760
Ping!

189
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,880
Look what you've done!

190
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,680
Ping!

191
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,800
I'm going to kill you today.

192
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,200
Ping,

193
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,130
you little brat.

194
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,760
Oh my!

195
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,600
Ping,

196
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,360
I know I was wrong,

197
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,400
really.

198
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,440
Can I make up for it?

199
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,400
I'll be your servant from now on,

200
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,320
won't fight back if you hit me,

201
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,200
won't talk back if you scold me,

202
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,800
honestly.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,480
Well, think carefully about

204
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,920
how much work you'll have to do

205
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,480
to make up for the damage.
