1
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,360
Which young lady has fallen for someone?

2
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,360
Why are you sneaking peeks at my phone?

3
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,880
I don't need to sneak a peek.

4
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,760
As soon as I hear that music,

5
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,820
I know exactly what you're watching.

6
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,170
Sounds like you've watched it many times too.

7
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
That's true.

8
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,539
I am excited about something.

9
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,760
Suolang suggested

10
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,520
that I draw portraits for guests

11
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,600
as souvenirs.

12
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,400
I enjoy drawing anyway,

13
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,840
and the guests

14
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,170
are readily available.

15
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,289
I can practice my skills

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,920
while providing emotional value.

17
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,160
I think it's a great idea.

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,970
You should give it a try.

19
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,560
Your only cost is time,

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,479
and time is the one thing we have plenty of here.

21
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,660
Let me tell you,

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,979
when I was in Shanghai,

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,080
I felt like I never had enough time.

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,680
I wished I could stretch

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
every minute into two,

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,290
like a slave struggling on the time poverty line.

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,440
But since I came here.

28
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,440
I've become the master of my time.

29
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,440
But I might not have enough supplies.

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,240
Order them online,

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,400
and have Sister Ping

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,640
pick them up from the delivery station next door.

33
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,320
Even though we're in a village,

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,050
the delivery service is still quite convenient.

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,160
Alright,

36
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll talk to Sister Ping tomorrow

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
and set up a small booth at the front desk.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,760
As long as you don't let Ping pay,

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,500
we can work something out.

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,400
I'm going to bed. Good night.

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,060
Good night.

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,320
Ma'am.

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,200
Have you seen this woman?

44
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,450
She's so beautiful.

45
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,640
Sir, do you know Ciyang?

46
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,700
No, I don't.

47
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,320
Ding Nian!

48
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,520
What is it, Ajia?

49
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,800
Hello.

50
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,320
My name is Zhang Haoran,

51
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,040
I'm the village official here.

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,560
He's our village official,

53
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,820
he can definitely help find your mother.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,860
We all know about your situation.

55
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,680
I've only been here for a year,

56
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
so I'm not familiar with things from before,

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,040
but I can help you look

58
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,970
in the archives.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,640
What's your mother's name?

60
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,360
How old is she?

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
I only know her name is Ciyang,

62
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,560
born in 1972,

63
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,570
I don't know anything else.

64
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,640
In that case,

65
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,040
there won't be any electronic records from back then,

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,080
but I can check the paper archives for you.

67
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,810
Don't worry,

68
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,320
we'll definitely help you,

69
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,240
I promise I'll help you find your mother.

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,760
Thank you.

71
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,840
Haozi.

72
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,680
I made this Basque cheesecake especially for you

73
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,000
to thank you for everything you've done for Ding Nian.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I haven't even started working yet.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,659
Our Haozi is the most capable,

76
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,770
the best and most amazing guy ever.

77
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,330
He'll definitely help you.

78
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,560
How many people did you tell?

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,320
What are you afraid of?

80
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,920
More people means more help.

81
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,820
Well, I need to get to work now.

82
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,320
Don't worry, I'll definitely help you.

83
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,960
I'll definitely help you.

84
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,520
You don't need to be so polite with him,

86
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,320
just feed him regularly and he'll be fine.

87
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Thank you so much.

88
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,400
Qianqian, come out and get the groceries.

89
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,960
Coming!

90
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,280
You went mushroom picking for us early this morning again.

91
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,200
I saw you really enjoyed them yesterday.

92
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,800
I'd like to apologize again.

93
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,800
Nature is truly the greatest artist.

94
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,880
Yes.

95
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,200
Every tree,

96
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,720
every flower,

97
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,520
every sheep,

98
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
every horse,

99
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,860
they're all nature's unique masterpieces.

100
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,280
This meat looks amazing!

101
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,810
I'm making steak for lunch.

102
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,159
Oh, by the way,

103
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,200
Ping called me specifically to say

104
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,280
there's a chicken that needs to be slaughtered.

105
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,360
Don't kill it!

106
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,040
It just laid eggs,

107
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,170
it needs to recover.

108
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Where are my fern shoots?

109
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,610
Here.

110
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,240
They're quite fresh.

111
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,680
Then I'll make stir-fried fern shoots with cured meat for lunch.

112
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,560
So which is it, steak or fern shoots?

113
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,160
Only children make choices,

114
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,140
adults like me want it all.

115
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,200
Hello, I'd like to ask

116
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,680
how far is it to drive from here to Sejila Mountain

117
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,159
and is the road condition good?

118
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,760
I'm not really sure about that

119
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,680
let me ask my boss

120
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,640
she knows the area well.

121
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,040
Why don't you just use GPS?

122
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,280
Why ask so many questions?

123
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,120
What if we run into the same situation as the day before yesterday?

124
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,000
You always do this

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,720
never preparing for anything in advance.

126
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,120
Isn't this what traveling is all about?

127
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,200
Full of surprises and unexpected moments.

128
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,480
You call that a surprise?

129
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,610
Thanks for nothing.

130
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,920
Are you ever going to let this go?

131
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,760
You've been complaining for two days

132
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,360
still can't get over it, huh?

133
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,120
My boss just replied

134
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,120
she says it takes a little over an hour to drive there

135
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,360
and the road is in good condition.

136
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,680
Drive safely

137
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,600
and have fun.

138
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,080
If they have something to say,

139
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,800
why can't they just talk it out

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
instead of fighting?

141
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Ajala,

142
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,080
you're quite the gossip.

143
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
No, it's not that.

144
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,680
Well,

145
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,480
that woman brought

146
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,320
two large suitcases,

147
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,120
and hung up two wedding dresses

148
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,280
in the room,

149
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,700
they're so beautiful.

150
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,010
So they're here to take wedding photos while traveling.

151
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,090
Then they definitely shouldn't be fighting.

152
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,360
Let's hope they make up soon.

153
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,120
Spicy beef rice noodles.

154
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,480
Butter tea with onsen egg.

155
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,440
And a meat pie.

156
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,000
Sir, have you decided what to order?

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,660
Yes, I have.

158
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,600
I'll have the same as her.

159
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:28,930
Okay.

160
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,000
Don't order the same thing.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,440
You're controlling what I eat now?

162
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,559
Can't you make your own decisions

163
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,760
for once in your life?

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
Right, you're the one with all the ideas,

165
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,720
insisting on going to Sejila Mountain Yuanming Residence

166
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,679
to see Namcha Barwa Peak.

167
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:37,880
Tao Yuanming Residence.

168
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,679
And what happened?

169
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,600
It rained heavily and we couldn't see anything.

170
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,679
Is that my fault too?

171
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,400
Couldn't you have checked the weather forecast first?

172
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,960
Mountain weather changes rapidly,

173
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,080
it's hard to predict.

174
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,640
And even without rain,

175
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,700
Namcha Barwa Peak is rarely visible.

176
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Did you hear that?

177
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,360
Even locals say

178
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,720
weather forecasts don't work well here.

179
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,250
What a waste.

180
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,720
If you won't eat it, I will.

181
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,180
Did I say something wrong?

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,520
No.

183
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,600
Brother, you're absolutely right.

184
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,360
Women shouldn't be spoiled.

185
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,300
They need to be coaxed.

186
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,450
Coaxed, really?

187
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,880
That one there,

188
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,140
any more coaxing and she'll be the queen.

189
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,640
You have to coax them.

190
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,920
Bro,

191
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
teach me

192
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,560
how to sweet-talk that girl,

193
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,290
she won't respond to anything.

194
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,360
Hey girl over there, look this way,

195
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,400
look over here,

196
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,880
please don't ignore me,

197
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,880
there's a boy here

198
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,280
who's really cute.

199
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,120
How did he turn into such a fool?

200
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,480
Nonsense,

201
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,640
this is definitely a horse-wrangling man.

202
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,680
Tashi delek.

203
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,240
What's going on here?

204
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,520
I've asked around,

205
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,720
we're going to see Mount Namcha Barwa.

206
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
We don't necessarily have to climb Sejila Mountain,

207
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,720
there's a high spot nearby

208
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,800
where we can see it too.

209
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,460
The weather is nice right now,

210
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,760
let's try our luck.

211
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,400
This is for us.

212
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,480
A gift for you all,

213
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,320
This drawing is amazing!

214
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,720
David, this looks even better than your photos.

215
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,760
something for you to keep as a memento.

216
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,360
Thank you,

217
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,160
really,

218
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,840
thank you all.
