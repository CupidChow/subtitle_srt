00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,280
Lyrics: Soya la

2
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,640
happy life

3
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,039
is like Mount Namcha Barwa.

4
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,000
What's your name, miss?

5
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,240
My name is Ding Nian.

6
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,240
Ding Nian.

7
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,880
This is our inn's

8
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,160
cleaning lady.

9
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,320
Her name is Baima,

10
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,840
you can call her Ajia La.

11
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,720
Ajia La.

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,720
Ajia La in Tibetan

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
means something like 'big sister.'

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,080
Are you here in Nyingchi to see the peach blossoms?

15
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,680
We've got a flat tire,

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,039
can't drive anymore.

17
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,960
The inn isn't far anyway,

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,920
let's walk back.

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,880
Here.

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,170
Baima, help her carry this.

21
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,480
Thank you.

22
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,009
Let's go.

23
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,040
What's wrong?

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,000
Nothing.

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,720
Coming!

26
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,920
Could it be

27
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
she went to Tibet?

28
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,220
We're here.

29
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,040
What's going on with you guys?

30
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,880
Where's the car?

31
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,000
The car got a flat tire

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,720
on the road.

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,960
You had to take a shortcut

34
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,840
instead of staying on the main road.

35
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,880
Where are my things?

36
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,240
In the trunk,

37
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,040
you can get them yourself later.

38
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,760
So you're Ding Nian?

39
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,280
Yes, this is Ding Nian,

40
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,880
Ding Nian.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,079
This is our chef, Sun Qianqian.

42
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,520
From now on, you two

43
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,579
will be roommates.

44
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,480
Hello, just call me Qianqian.

45
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,720
You can call me Nian Nian.

46
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,360
Can you take me to the car?

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,160
Let's take the first step toward our dessert freedom.

48
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,690
Let's go.

49
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,720
Ask Ajiala to take you there,

50
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,450
I need to show Ding Nian around.

51
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,079
Alright then.

52
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,840
Ajiala,

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,770
let's go.

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,560
During the online interview,

55
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,960
do you remember the things

56
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,890
I told you about?

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,880
Yes, I do.

58
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,400
This is your work phone.

59
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,800
Our inn's WeChat account

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,279
has quite a few regular customers

61
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,079
and new guests referred by them.

62
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,040
You need to provide good service.

63
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,279
Also, familiarize yourself with those booking platforms

64
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,640
as soon as possible.

65
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,680
Make sure you understand

66
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,740
the check-in, check-out, and room change procedures.

67
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,920
We only have eight rooms in total,

68
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,320
so it's not difficult to manage.

69
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,450
If you have any questions, just ask me.

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
Here's the key to your room.

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,040
Okay.

72
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,960
Hey, Lao Lei,

73
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,490
what's wrong with Jianguo?

74
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,920
My daughter might have gone to Tibet.

75
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,960
I'm so busy with work

76
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,120
and can't get away right now.

77
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,560
Ding Nian has come to Tibet.

78
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,080
She had an argument with me

79
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,340
and ran away from home.

80
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
I'm guessing she might have gone to Tibet.

81
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,840
Alright, I'll help you look into it right away

82
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,600
and get back to you.

83
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,160
Okay.

84
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,400
Thank you so much.

85
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's welcome our new team member

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,800
Ding Nian.

87
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,120
Welcome.

88
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,080
Though I don't know how long you'll be staying with us,

89
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,760
but

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,520
I still hope that here with us

91
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,980
you'll find the answers you're looking for.

92
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,240
Come.

93
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,159
Welcome.

94
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,360
Welcome.

95
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,800
Come try our chef Qianqian's cooking.

96
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,880
Go ahead, eat up.

97
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,400
These are all my specialties.

98
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,040
I used Sister Ping's new oven

99
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,840
to try making these madeleines.

100
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,920
Try some too.

101
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,680
Thanks.

102
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,980
This is delicious!

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,240
You're so talented.

104
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,640
Can you even get dessert ingredients here?

105
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,880
Let me tell you,

106
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,760
we have the freshest yak milk here,

107
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,320
which is an excellent ingredient.

108
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,920
For everything else, I asked Sister Ping

109
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,600
to order them online for me.

110
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,040
You know,

111
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,840
it's hard to find madeleines,

112
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,520
Basque cheesecake and Opera cake here,

113
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,520
so I decided to make them myself.

114
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,760
I see.

115
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,840
When someone is doing

116
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,440
what they love,

117
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,960
they really do shine.

118
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,920
Eat up, have some food.

119
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,200
You look like you could be from around here.

120
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,600
Actually,

121
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,120
my mother was a local from Nyingchi.

122
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,560
Well then.

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
Why aren't you staying with your grandmother?

124
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,240
Why come work at my shop instead?

125
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,960
I've never met my grandmother.

126
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,560
This is my first time in Nyingchi.

127
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,290
First time in Nyingchi?

128
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,720
I...

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,960
my father never brought me to Tibet.

130
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,160
He never told me anything

131
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,880
about my mother.

132
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,520
All I know is

133
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,960
that my mother was from Nyingchi.

134
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,040
Does your father have some dark secret?

135
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,160
Kids, don't make wild guesses.

136
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,200
I don't know either.

137
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,680
He's always so secretive about it.

138
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,720
Whenever I ask him

139
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,840
about my mother and grandmother,

140
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,520
he gets angry.

141
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,760
I've always been confused.

142
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,220
I can't understand

143
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,039
why he reacts so strongly.

144
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,840
So.

145
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,690
Have you ever seen your mother?

146
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,280
No.

147
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,040
My father said

148
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,320
that my mother

149
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,600
died from complications during my birth.

150
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,480
She only left one photo for me.

151
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,880
Whenever I see girls

152
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,840
being close with their mothers,

153
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,400
I wonder...

154
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,160
If my mother were still alive today,

155
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,600
she would be

156
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,000
53 years old now.

157
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,160
What would she look like?

158
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,160
So I decided

159
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,080
to visit my mother's hometown

160
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,620
and search for traces of her past.

161
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,920
I know this place very well.

162
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,880
I'll get the whole village to help you find information.

163
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,840
For a little brat, you've got quite an attitude.

164
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,000
Sit down.

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,080
You think you know better than me?

166
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,760
No.

167
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,560
Ding Nian, don't worry,

168
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,920
Sister Ping will take care of it.

169
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,680
Thank you.

170
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,080
Eat up.

171
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,200
What made you

172
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,800
decide to run away from home?

173
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,720
My daughter is home.

174
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,040
Look, I've made a table full of dishes for you.

175
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,840
Come, let's eat.

176
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,660
Come, sweetheart.

177
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,360
Dad needs to talk to you about something.

178
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,960
Look, it's been two years since you graduated.

179
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
You said you wanted to take the graduate entrance exam,

180
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,250
and I supported you,

181
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,600
but you didn't get in, did you?

182
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,760
It doesn't matter.

183
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,640
But with your major,

184
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,800
you shouldn't let it go to waste,

185
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,080
you should put it to good use.

186
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,920
As it happens, there's a public institution exam

187
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,160
for the Teachers' College Elementary School,

188
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,120
and Dad has already registered you for it.

189
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,600
What?

190
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Isn't that great?

191
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,960
You're a proper graduate

192
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,040
from the Teachers' College Art Department,

193
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,760
so becoming an elementary school teacher there makes perfect sense.

194
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,440
Didn't I tell you I want to be an illustrator?

195
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,480
It won't affect anything,

196
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,000
you can teach and paint at the same time,

197
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,840
isn't that the best of both worlds?

198
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,920
Look, at this Normal University Elementary School,

199
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,320
being an elementary school teacher

200
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,120
is both stable and relaxing.

201
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,250
And in the future when you get married.

202
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,200
Who are you throwing that at?

203
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,240
You're so disrespectful.

204
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,770
Why are you always like this

205
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,860
since I was little?

206
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,640
You arrange everything in my life.

207
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,560
When I was young,

208
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,480
I liked sports,

209
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,080
but you insisted I learn dancing.

210
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,000
I preferred short hair,

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,240
but you made me keep it long.

212
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,200
When I grew up,

213
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,120
I wanted to apply to a university in Beijing,

214
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,160
but you wouldn't let me, saying it was too far.

215
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,640
I wanted to study art design,

216
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,920
but you said it's hard to find a job with that.

217
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,880
You found me

218
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,800
some teaching-oriented art major instead.

219
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,080
I'm already 24 years old,

220
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,600
yet you still control how long my skirts are

221
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,460
and what time I come home at night.

222
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,960
I'm only doing what's best for you, aren't I?

223
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,000
Mom is watching from heaven,

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,660
is this really for my own good?

225
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,120
Does your father know you came to Linzhi?

226
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,290
I can't tell him.

227
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,280
My father explicitly forbade me from coming to Tibet.

228
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,600
If he finds out,

229
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
he'll definitely drag me back home.

230
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Qianqian.

231
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,560
Qianqian.

232
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,720
Qianqian.

233
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,640
I've already said no raising chickens,

234
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,840
no chickens allowed.

235
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,400
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

236
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,280
I saw it could lay eggs,

237
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,360
so I kept it.

238
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,520
Wouldn't it be nice to have fresh eggs every day?

239
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,320
Quick, quick,

240
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
get it out of here.

241
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,440
I'll...

242
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,040
I'll do it.

243
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,120
Chicken!

244
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,320
Open the door!

245
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,380
Call Suolang tomorrow

246
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,720
to slaughter it for me.
