1
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,520
Ding Nian.

2
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,000
I've been thinking about your paintings

3
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,920
and decided to pay you for them.

4
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,520
Look,

5
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,170
all things considered,

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,560
60 yuan per painting,

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,640
how does that sound?

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,280
That much!

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,640
This counts as a value-added service,

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,880
just like meal fees,

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,200
we can't keep doing this

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
for free forever.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,379
We've already raised the room rates,

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
we'll charge guests 30 for each painting,

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,000
and I'll give you another 30 from the room fees.

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,010
Thank you, Sister Ping.

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,140
Ding Nian is going to get rich,

18
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,920
she just landed a cultural creative contract,

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,450
and now she's getting paid for her paintings.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,880
These young girls nowadays,

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,920
they're really capable,

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,320
so talented in many ways.

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,960
Hello, Principal.

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,480
Hello.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
She's the painter from the big city.

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,650
Sister, this is our principal.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,860
Hello, Principal.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,880
It's like this,

29
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:31,760
our school...

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,360
We're planning during the Peach Blossom Festival

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
to hold a calligraphy and painting competition.

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,680
But our school

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
currently has only one art teacher.

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,680
We were wondering

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,840
if you could help us

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,640
teach the children how to paint?

37
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,680
You should go teach at the Normal University Elementary School.

38
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,880
It's a stable, easy job that makes you more marriageable.

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,090
Sister Ding Nian, can you? Please?

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,930
Is that okay?

41
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,810
Why are you spacing out?

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,920
Well,

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,200
Zhuoma said

44
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,120
their school is organizing

45
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,960
a painting competition for the Peach Blossom Festival,

46
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,720
and she wants me to substitute teach.

47
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,160
Isn't that perfect?

48
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,900
You graduated from teachers college after all.

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
If she wanted to be a teacher,

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,040
she wouldn't be here now.

51
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,320
Well, if you don't want to do it,

52
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
then don't go.

53
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,090
Exactly.

54
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,240
But I don't want to disappoint Zhuoma.

55
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,840
That's not good,

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,100
you'll get sunburned.

57
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,040
How come you don't get sunburned when you're outdoors every day?

58
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,320
I'm different from you,

59
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,579
I'm used to it already.

60
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,440
If you come out to sketch often,

61
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,640
you could buy one of those sun umbrellas,

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,370
like the ones used for fishing.

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,960
It's fine.

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,860
I'm half Linzhi local too,

65
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,730
so I've got some sun-resistant genes.

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,840
Ding Nian.

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,200
Did Zhuoma

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,000
put you in a difficult position?

69
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,480
Did she tell you?

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
She can't keep anything to herself.

71
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,360
I...

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I've never taught children before.

73
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,520
I don't know how.

74
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,040
Really?

75
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,840
Yes.

76
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,920
Then why do you look unhappy?

77
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,880
Do I?

78
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,340
I'm actually quite happy.

79
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,520
Ding Nian,

80
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,960
do you not want to be a teacher

81
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,090
because you personally don't want to,

82
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,660
or because of your father?

83
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,120
Sometimes we

84
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,480
develop prejudice against something

85
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,240
because of a certain person.

86
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,130
What did Qianqian tell you?

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,280
If you truly didn't want to be a teacher,

88
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,210
you wouldn't be so conflicted now.

89
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,820
Everyone cares about you, Ding Nian.

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,520
Do you want me to go?

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,960
My wishes,

92
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
Zhuoma's wishes,

93
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,890
or anyone else's wishes don't matter.

94
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,800
What matters is what you want.

95
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,810
You need to listen to your own inner voice.

96
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,680
Everyone, come try this!

97
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,040
I've developed something new.

98
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Come on!

99
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,240
Here.

100
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,000
Thanks.

101
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,580
Here, Ping.

102
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,400
Delicious.

103
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,440
Amazing!

104
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,170
You replaced butter with ghee,

105
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,000
giving it more local flavor.

106
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,800
This was developed under Hao's guidance,

107
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,520
a specialty snack

108
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,460
called Peach Blossom Pastry.

109
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,720
Really, the taste is quite unique,

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,840
sweet and salty,

111
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,680
blending together with a rich aroma.

112
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,410
It's so good!

113
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,920
Well, it's all thanks to Hao

114
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
for giving me the inspiration.

115
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,480
No, no.

116
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,800
We should thank you.

117
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,200
No, thank you all.

118
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,360
Our Peach Blossom Festival merchandise

119
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,400
is getting more and more diverse.

120
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,280
Next up,

121
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,880
Ping, it's your turn.

122
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,360
Me?

123
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,450
What do you want me to do?

124
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,080
Share your family's peach blossom wine recipe,

125
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,000
won't you?

126
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,360
We can develop it together,

127
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,420
split the profits,

128
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,280
what do you think?

129
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,160
That's not possible.

130
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,820
Oh, come on!

131
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,780
Stop talking about it.

132
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,720
Qianqian.

133
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,409
What's the story with the peach blossom wine recipe?

134
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,760
I don't know much about it either.

135
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,840
This recipe was passed down

136
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,720
from Pingcuo's family.

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,720
Who's Pingcuo?

138
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,280
Pingping's husband,

139
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,280
Zhaxi Pingcuo.

140
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,330
He went missing.

141
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,060
I've heard about that.

142
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,940
There was a mudslide one year,

143
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,560
and then he disappeared.

144
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,420
No one knows if he's alive or dead.

145
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,060
His fate remains unknown.

146
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,240
No wonder Sister Ping has stayed here all this time.

147
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,360
He must be dead.

148
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,520
Pingping just doesn't want to

149
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,080
accept the reality.

150
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,480
So is Sister Ping

151
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,960
the only one who has the recipe now?

152
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,600
That's right.

153
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,440
She brews peach blossom wine every year,

154
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,300
just a few jars,

155
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,880
and she drinks it all herself,

156
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,410
not even guests can get any.

157
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,720
That's understandable.

158
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,200
Haozi wants to develop

159
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,640
peach blossom wine, tea, and pastries

160
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,520
into products,

161
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,320
then find some popular streamers to sell them,

162
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,159
which would also serve

163
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,690
as promotion for our Peach Blossom Festival.

164
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,080
Students,

165
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,159
this is Teacher Ding whom we've invited

166
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,760
for our calligraphy and painting competition.

167
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,490
Teacher Ding

168
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,200
is a young artist.

169
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,060
Let's give her a warm welcome.

170
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,440
Today, let's draw a sun together,

171
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,240
shall we?

172
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,880
Yes!

173
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Then I'll draw first.

174
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,240
Just follow along with me.

175
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,200
Okay.

176
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,120
Good, first

177
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,120
let's draw a circle for the sun.

178
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
So what kind of leaf

179
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,280
did we just draw?

180
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,560
A heart,

181
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,200
a big leaf.

182
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,600
Now let's draw

183
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,480
a four-leaf clover like this, okay?

184
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,320
Okay.

185
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,260
Your sun has a smiley face.

186
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,240
You can draw this again.

187
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,960
Teacher Ding,

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,760
why is the sun red?

189
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,440
I think the sun is clearly orange.

190
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,320
No one says the sun has to be a certain color,

191
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,560
you can draw it however you want,

192
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,960
even if it's green, that's perfectly fine.

193
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,440
A green sun?

194
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,200
How can there be a green sun?

195
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,970
There's a poem that goes like this,

196
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,920
paint a green sun,

197
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
to make summer cool.

198
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,040
That poem is wonderful!

199
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,760
Teacher Ding is amazing,

200
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
of course she is.

201
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,160
Suolang!

202
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,440
Look at my drawing.

203
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,120
What a beautiful painting!

204
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,040
Like teacher, like student indeed.

205
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,770
That's because Zhuoma is smart

206
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,010
and learns quickly.

207
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,600
To thank Teacher Ding for her selfless dedication,

208
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,000
I've come specially today to invite you

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,280
to visit our home.

210
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,760
Visit your home?

211
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,159
Isn't that

212
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,039
a bit too formal?

213
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,040
Sister Ding Nian,

214
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,360
please come, Teacher Ding,

215
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,600
we'll have yak meat

216
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,720
and butter tea.

217
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,000
But I've been out all afternoon

218
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,360
and need to get back to work.

219
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,040
Sister Ping can't manage alone.

220
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,320
It's dinner time now,

221
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,720
and more importantly, I've already spoken with Sister Ping.

222
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,040
Sister Ding Nian,

223
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,520
sister,

224
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,760
please.

225
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,880
I'll come.

226
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,480
Come on

227
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,610
get on the horse.

228
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,370
Don't be afraid.

229
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,320
Are you okay?

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,040
This is my grandfather,

231
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,000
this is my grandmother,

232
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,600
just follow my lead when greeting them.

233
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,440
Hello, Grandfather,

234
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,280
hello, Grandmother.

235
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,080
He used to be

236
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,880
the elder chief of Gala Village.

237
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,320
So you were the village chief.

238
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,080
My grandfather doesn't speak much Mandarin,

239
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,340
you can communicate with body language.

240
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,680
Artist.

241
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,120
I'm not really an artist,

242
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,120
my name is Ding Nian,

243
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,920
or you can just call me Nian Nian.

244
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,440
Artist.

245
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,440
Let's sit down and eat.

246
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,290
Here, try some yak meat.

247
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,120
These are all our local dishes,

248
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,480
are you getting used to the food?

249
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,410
It's delicious.

250
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,240
It has that

251
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,120
authentic local food flavor.

252
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,640
Try our butter tea as well.

253
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,240
Mudslide.

254
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,280
Strange,

255
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,320
I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before.

256
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,280
Grandpa,

257
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,120
I really don't know.

258
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,680
Grandpa.

259
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,240
What did your grandfather say?

260
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,360
I think I know her.

261
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,240
Strange,

262
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
I really think I've seen her before.

263
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,160
Grandpa started forgetting things last year,

264
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,800
then we took him to the hospital for a check-up,

265
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,860
it's Alzheimer's.

266
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,000
It's getting worse this year,

267
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,840
his memories are becoming confused.

268
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,160
He kept saying

269
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,520
"mudslide" just now,

270
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,440
who knows what he's remembering.

271
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,640
Do mudslides happen often around here?

272
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,200
I heard from Baima last time that

273
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,740
Sister Ping's husband

274
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,120
also disappeared

275
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,220
during a mudslide.

276
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,120
They happen occasionally,

277
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,400
but casualties are rare

278
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,600
in these situations.

279
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,680
The population density here is already low,

280
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,280
and mudslides mostly occur in the wilderness.

281
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,720
Since your grandfather was the old village chief,

282
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,520
is it possible he knew my mother?

283
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,850
I've already asked him many times,

284
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,080
but

285
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,280
his memory has deteriorated badly,

286
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,280
so I couldn't get much information.

287
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,690
It's been several days,

288
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,720
and I still haven't found any news about my mother.

289
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,040
I'm starting to wonder if my father lied to me.

290
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,960
How could that be?

291
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,220
Why would he lie to you?

292
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,820
My dad is just strange.

293
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,080
Even if my mom died in childbirth,

294
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,200
he didn't need to cut off

295
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
my connection with my grandmother.

296
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,800
Whenever Tibet is mentioned,

297
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,040
he gets all nervous.

298
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,820
And I don't even look like him,

299
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
I sometimes wonder if I was adopted.

300
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,650
Don't overthink it.

301
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,320
Once we get news about your mother,

302
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,780
everything will be clear.

303
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,040
But I'm curious,

304
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,800
what made you decide to attend classes?

305
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,660
It's because of all of you.

306
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,760
Because here,

307
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,200
I see everyone working so hard

308
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,940
and passionately doing what they want to do.

309
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,760
I want to try that too.

310
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
Since you came here,

311
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,620
this place seems brighter

312
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
and more vibrant.

313
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,160
Really?
