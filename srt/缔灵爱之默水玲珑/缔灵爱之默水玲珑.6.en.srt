1
00:00:00,988 --> 00:00:05,988
(light music)
(wine splashing)

2
00:00:09,188 --> 00:00:12,168
(glasses clinking)

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,965
(air whooshing)

4
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:17,058
(metal clanging)

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,727
(dynamic music)

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,883
(reel ticking)

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,010
(thunder rumbling)
(dog barking)

8
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:38,371
(reel whirring)

9
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:43,175
(anticipatory music)

10
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:48,177
(hooves clomping)
(bystanders chattering)

11
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:52,890
(music continues)

12
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,859
(music continues)

13
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:12,848
(music continues)

14
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:17,064
(horse snorts)

15
00:01:18,062 --> 00:01:19,939
- Look there.

16
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:20,774
- So what?

17
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,028
It's just another saddle tramp.

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,858
- [Kid 1] No, look here.

19
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,848
- [Kid 2] Bosh!

20
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,423
Everyone knows Link Maddock
only works the Indian territory.

21
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,723
- [Kid 1] Look again, you know it all.

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,473
- Well, I'll be.

23
00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:41,133
What does that book say about him?

24
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,128
- [Kid 1] It says all his blood money

25
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,988
is saved in a buried coffin

26
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,778
atop a derelict confederate graveyard.

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,708
- [Kid 2] Where?

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,388
- No one knows.

29
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,268
But the book says he keeps it real secure

30
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,743
from those that do find it.

31
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:59,278
(metal clangs)
(horses whinnying)

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,738
- [Kid 2] My daddy said
he once saw Maddock shoot

33
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,518
a stray dog that pissed on
his boot, midstream too.

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,988
- [Kid 1] Come on, let's follow.

35
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,073
I got me an idea.

36
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:12,491
(light western music)

37
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,884
(music continues)

38
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:31,876
(music continues)

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,718
- Deputy, I told you when you see these,

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,638
you tear them down.

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,528
I will not have my office being used

42
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,203
as a advertisement post
for these mud shows.

43
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,808
Donations for the widows and orphan fund

44
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,278
ain't till December.

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,912
You're a few months early, Mister?

46
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:57,997
(objects clattering)

47
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,108
All right, all right, all right.

48
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,383
Mister, I could have you shot for that.

49
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,543
I'm not doin' business with an armed man.

50
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:10,773
It's a town ordinance.

51
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,080
Don't worry, you'll get it
back after you leave my office.

52
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:21,965
I don't like bounty hunters
hangin' around my town.

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,538
So I suggest when we're done here,

54
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,263
you just keep on walkin'
outta Coffee Field, Mister?

55
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,270
What'd you say your name was again?

56
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,963
- I didn't.

57
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,118
- That an accent?

58
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,263
You're not American?

59
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,753
- Is that gonna buy?

60
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:44,043
- All right, see what you got here.

61
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:51,407
(flyer thuds)

62
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,398
What of it?

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,783
That mess could be anyone.

64
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:08,315
(rooster crowing)
(hooves clomping)

65
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,882
I'll be damned.

66
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,878
(bell tolling)

67
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,928
You'll need to converse

68
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,453
with the county judge about your reward.

69
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,403
I can't help you.

70
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,390
- Courthouse is in Caulker City.

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,003
It's a day's ride.

72
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,393
- Yep.

73
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,188
So, I suggest you get gone

74
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,213
and get your quarry outta here
before it rots any further,

75
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,463
'cause in this town, blood is
thicker than this tin badge.

76
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,948
See, Pinto, Pinto Sykes,

77
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,963
is my deputy's second cousin.

78
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,128
That means son of a bitch that he was,

79
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,808
he's my first cousin, and
son of a bitch or not,

80
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,308
that makes him family.

81
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,083
And no matter what the law
says, I can't trade on family.

82
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,675
- Hm.

83
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:15,094
(indistinct)

84
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:22,814
All the same, I'll take my money now.

85
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,053
- You stupid fool.

86
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,773
I'm giving you a chance
to walk outta here.

87
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,570
- In silver.

88
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:38,892
- All I got for you is lead.

89
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,542
(match strikes)
(deputy exclaims)

90
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,332
(deputy groaning)

91
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:48,921
(anticipatory music)

92
00:05:48,923 --> 00:05:52,172
- I'll save your burial costs.

93
00:05:52,174 --> 00:05:54,111
(fire whooshing)

94
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:59,113
(deputy exclaiming)
(music continues)

95
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:08,406
(both groaning)
(music continues)

96
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:09,656
(townsfolk exclaiming)

97
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:11,991

113

(music continues)

114
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:30,885
- Jesus, you got him.

115
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,758
You were right.

116
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,488
He's got reward out for
him in Coachees County.

117
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,588
It says right here in your book.

118
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,088
You weren't joshin'.

119
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,200
We're gonna be rich!

120
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:44,664
(child vomits)
(townsfolk clamoring)

121
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:49,666

147
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:47,328
(Link grunting)

148
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:14,871
- Three weeks.

149
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,238
It's how long you've been here,

150
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,353
if you were wondering.

151
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,663
I'm Sister Marie.

152
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,783
The bandage?

153
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,448
Before I devoted my life to the church,

154
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,263
my father was a horse doctor,
and he taught me his practice.

155
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:35,308
(sighs) I always
suspected he wanted a son.

156
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,448
- Horses?

157
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,281
- Yes.

158
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:39,658
It does seem that man and beast

159
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,573
are quite the same on the inside.

160
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,448
- Jesus.

161
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,018
- I am so glad that you brought him up.

162
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,138
You see, it was Christ who saved you.

163
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,348
The Lord works through me, Mr. Maddock.

164
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,598
He is the one who saved you.

165
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,173
He is the one who gave you
a second chance, not I.

166
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,603
You see, I believe that the
Lord has a plan for you.

167
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,098
He wants to give you every opportunity

168
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,093
for you to be set on the
right path this time,

169
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,848
tempting you with ownership

170
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,528
of your previous weapon
would be unbearably cruel.

171
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,458
So, I sold your gun.

172
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,293
- What?

173
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,983
- It's all a part of the
Lord's plan, Mr. Maddock.

174
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,575
Do you not remember the burning?

175
00:12:42,577 --> 00:12:45,347
(fire whooshing)

176
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:49,918
For days it's all you would
talk about day and night.

177
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,668
All you would speak about are demons,

178
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,178
apostles of hell that were torturing you

179
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,800
with visions of what you would endure

180
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,683
in the devil's layer for the
mortal sins that you committed.

181
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,941
- I was sick.

182
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,578
- No, no.

183
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,668
It was not the delirium, Mr. Maddock.

184
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,433
Satan had a hold on you.

185
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,218
He had been waiting all your life

186
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,398
and for a brief moment he had you.

187
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,963
But that is in the past now.

188
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,253
He has a plan for you to
do better than you did.

189
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,237
Like, "Thou shalt not murder."

190
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,083
Well, Mr. Maddock, you must be starving.

191
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,983
You get dressed now and
I'll get you something.

192
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:44,510
(gentle music)

193
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:53,952
(music continues)

194
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:57,121
(children chattering)

195
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:07,028
(music continues)
(children screaming playfully)

196
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,523
So, you've seen the children.

197
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,968
Orphans, poor dears.

198
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,256
The parish runs the church.

199
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:22,158
(chuckles) The town orphanage, really.

200
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,963
To be honest with you,

201
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,993
we haven't had many donations lately.

202
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,038
So, we've taken to growing
and selling the harvest,

203
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,073
but no luck thus yet.

204
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,438
And the only donation we've had

205
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,558
so far this year was your
gracious contribution.

206
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,088
- Hm.

207
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,098
- Your sold gun, of course.

208
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,893
And the-
(boots clinking)

209
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,297
One moment, please.

210
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:56,299
(bell tolling)
(townsfolk chattering)

211
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:18,325
(knife scrapes)

212
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:23,739
(boots clinking)

213
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,603
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,293
That was Mr. Greeves, the bank president.

215
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,408
He has done everything he can
with the board of directors

216
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,908
and if they can't (inhales
shakily) meet the required amount

217
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,408
of charity by the end of the month,

218
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,408
then the bank is gonna take
back the orphanage (sniffles).

219
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,628
- Throw them back out on the street?

220
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,878
- They could stay here
for a little while longer,

221
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,788
but the parish does not have the funds

222
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,963
to feed the dozens of hungry mouths.

223
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,668
If there were some kind soul

224
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,578
who could make a sizable donation,

225
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,813
I'm sure we could keep finding them homes.

226
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,808
I'm so sorry.

227
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,610
I'm gonna let you enjoy your dinner.

228
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,533
- If someone were to?

229
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,473
- Yes?

230
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,198
- Saving those foundlings
would go a long way

231
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,018
for a man's salvation, wouldn't it?

232
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,017
- Well, yes, but...

233
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,869
(hooves clomping)

234
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,143
- I'll be back before the
bank comes to collect.

235
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:51,610
- Mr. Maddock, thank you.

236
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:02,865
(Sister Marie sighs)

237
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:06,117

- [Grey Cloud] Sir, please.

299
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,750
- [Link] Where is he?

300
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,148
- Some woodsman.

301
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,798
Lives south of here.

302
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,688
But Grey Cloud knows no names.

303
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,613
He swears to the high spirit.

304
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,348
When Grey Cloud was ensnared
in his steel animals jaws

305
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,943
the other four left him to die.

(knife scrapes)
(pensive music)

307
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,698
- [Link] Where is the money?

308
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,533
- All around.

309
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,168
Difficult to see in shroud of darkness

310
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,118
and master spirit's anger.

311
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,068
Others left with gold.

312
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,348
No such luck for Grey Cloud.

313
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,873
In confusion, he came
across worthless paper.

314
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,460
Now, Mister, I must ask you,
in this day, in this age,

315
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,668
who the fuck keeps Confederate script?

316
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,963
- Call me sentimental.

317
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,133
Why'd you do it?

318
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:43,121
- (breathing heavily)
My people need money.

319
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,778
Man came.

320
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,013
A white eye like you.

321
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,888
Promised Grey Cloud you would lead

322
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,840
to money if he and the others followed.

323
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,933
- This man hired the others too?

324
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,388
- He was with us.

325
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,638
- The others, all strangers to this man?

326
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,113
- A stranger to Grey Cloud.

327
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,558
But he can only speak for himself.

328
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,518
- Why hire help when he could
have the whole pot to himself?

329
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,288
- That white eye was no fool.

330
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,358
He said you would be dangerous.

331
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,203
- He was right.

332
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,353
- [Sister Marie] "Thou shalt not murder.

333
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:20,653
Thou shalt not murder."

334
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:26,493
- Huh, leaves a lot of
room for self defense.

335
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,183
- Crazy white man.

336
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,120
Grey Cloud would like the
use of his leg again, please.

337
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,973
In return, he will help
you track down others.

- What words are these?

341
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,253
- Cherokee.

342
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,883
Or until we meet again.

343
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,233
Pray to your sky spirit we don't.

344
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,050
- But Grey Cloud is Mohawk.

You need a little bit of

436
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,295
but as my old grande used to say,

437
00:34:37,297 --> 00:34:39,628
"Only way to follow
one good practical joke

438
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,617
is with another."

And besides, I'm pretty proud of my work

440
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,713
and I don't often get to show it off.

441
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,230
Pretty good, eh (chuckles)?

442
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:53,668
I bet you'd look pretty good decoratin'

443
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,818
up on my wall you funny son of a bitch.

444
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,348
Why don't you toss me up them nuggets

445
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,238
and maybe I'll put you up outta that hole.

446
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,578
- You'll have to come down and take them.

447
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,623
- (chuckles) Is that so?

448
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,423
Ah.

449
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,793
Well, funny man, there's
something gotta happen first.

450
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,463
Shit!

(chuckles) Reckon the jokes on me, eh?

453
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,268
I've been killin' critters my whole life

454
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,483
but I never killed a person before.

455
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,828
These ways, if you don't count Injuns.

456
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,508
But never no white man before.

00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,343
- Hm.

458
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,468
You know, it's easy.

459
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,218
Just come down and I show you.

460
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,208
- (chuckles) Oh, yeah.

461
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,802
Yeah, you are funny.

462
00:35:48,804 --> 00:35:49,798
No, no, no, no.

463
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,093
You wait right there.

464
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,061
Wait right there.

465
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:54,847

This way, that way I didn't have to look

478
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,663
you in the face and I was...

479
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,703
There you go.

480
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,677
Not so funny are we now, Mister?

481
00:37:17,043 --> 00:37:19,876

484
00:37:32,462 --> 00:37:34,978
What are you playin' at?

485
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,813

00:38:16,273 --> 00:38:18,190
Mister, Mister, please.

490
00:38:19,044 --> 00:38:21,371
- Names and whereabouts of (indistinct).

491
00:38:21,373 --> 00:38:22,983
- I would if I knew.

492
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,803
They just showed up at my place.

493
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,648
They said there was an organized posse.

494
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,448
They was after a bad man

495
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,728
and if I was to help 'em in their affair,

496
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,515
whatever spoils is to be had
when all was said and done,

497
00:38:35,517 --> 00:38:38,943
and I'd get my share on
account of my courage.

498
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,145
It didn't seem on the up and up,

499
00:38:42,147 --> 00:38:43,563
but I need the money.

500
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,500
I can't say as I got a very
good look at any of 'em,

501
00:38:48,502 --> 00:38:53,502
but there was an Indian
and a Mex, and a woman.

502
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:56,703
Craziest lookin' bunch I ever seen.

503
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,228
Mister, you let me up outta this,

504
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,228
I'll hope you track 'em down.

505
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,883
You ain't gotta pay me or nothin'.

508
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,468
- Hey Bobby, why don't you go see

509
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:16,618
if we can salvage anything
outta that hovel over there.

510
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,320
I think we got this taken care of.

513
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,088
Mister, we don't know who you are,

514
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,923
but man, are we glad you came,

515
00:39:44,956 --> 00:39:49,048
'cause this hillbilly pepperwood
is a tough nut to crack.

516
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:53,038
Now, as the saying goes
stand and delivered.

517
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,068
Well, I guess in your case
standin's outta the question,

518
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,018
so why don't we get right
to the deliverin' part?

519
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,138
What do you say?
(gun cocks)

520
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:00,971
Oh, shit!

- Hey, Mister (chuckles).

546
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,925
Glad to see you come out
the other side on that one,

547
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:17,973
but you may not be so lucky next time.

548
00:42:19,846 --> 00:42:22,833
This place is crawlin' with opportunists.

549
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,690
Have you give anymore
thought to takin' me along?

550
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,063
Come on!

551
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,397
(light western music)

552
00:42:39,463 --> 00:42:41,130
(bell tolling)

553
00:42:41,132 --> 00:42:46,132
(horse whinnying)
(townsfolk chattering)

554
00:42:49,227 --> 00:42:53,888
- [Sheriff Sykes] God damn (coughs).

555
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:56,890
(tolling continues)

556
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,583
- Oh (chuckles).

557
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,088
Gentlemen, I'm afraid you've
missed today's sermon.

558
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,828
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

559
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,943
- Sister, I heard you're
harborin' a fugitive,

560
00:43:13,063 --> 00:43:14,608
a foreigner at that.

561
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:18,598
- Listening to idol town
gossip is as bad as sin.

562
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,793
- I don't deny bein' a sinner, Sister,

563
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,303
but today is not our day to confess.

564
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,433
It's yours.

565
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,007
- Why (chuckles)?

566
00:43:29,963 --> 00:43:30,794
(Sister Marie groans)

567
00:43:30,796 --> 00:43:32,788
(Sister Marie exclaims)
(pensive music)

568
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,523
Why are you hidin' Link Maddock?

569
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:40,006
- I do not know what you mean!

570
00:43:40,008 --> 00:43:41,648
(Sister Marie groans)

571
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,623
- Who's sinnin' now, Sister?

572
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,458
(Sister Marie groans)

573
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,333
My deputy can make it hurt more,

574
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,153
much more.

575
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,038
- My side of the family always

576
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,660
did have a strong grip
didn't we (chuckles)?

577
00:43:59,662 --> 00:44:00,591
(Sister Marie whimpers)

578
00:44:00,593 --> 00:44:02,789
- Link Maddock is a bad man.

579
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:04,099
He's a very destructive man.

580
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:05,691
(Sister Marie groans)

581
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:08,788
For the good of your
community and yourself,

582
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:10,746
tell me where he is.

583
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:14,331
- I don't know (whimpers).

584
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,343
- Is he comin' back?

585
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,653
He'll come back.

586
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:29,147
(Sister Marie groans)

587
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,798
- And we'll be watching anyone
who comes in and outta here.

588
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,576
- You're not the law
here in Junctionville.

589
00:44:37,578 --> 00:44:39,718
You have no jurisdiction.

590
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,878
- You worry about God's law.

591
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,592
You leave earthly law to me.

592
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:46,261
(pensive music)

593
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:54,670

(old man coughing)

607
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:43,863
- Come on out.

608
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,003
Bad things don't sing
dirty songs by themselves.

609
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:54,012
- (laughs) You got that right, son,

610
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,723
no matter how the wind blows.

611
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,818
- You don't know how close
you came to dying just now.

612
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,159
- Oh (chuckles).

613
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,605
(shot firing)

614
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:11,188
(laughs) You got that twisted, son.

615
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:15,448
You don't know how close
you come to dyin' just then.

616
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,390
- Could have given a man some warning.

617
00:46:17,392 --> 00:46:21,663
- (chuckles) Now, if I'd
have given the game away,

618
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:24,358
you'd have been the man splattered

619
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,263
all over the ground instead
of that fella over yonder.

620
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,028
Nobody trounces through here on purpose.

621
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,978
Where are ya headin' to?

622
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,208
- Junctionville.

623
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,528
- Half a day's ride down that away.

624
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,283
Yeah, for you full day's walk.

625
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,240
I'd offer you my roan but you
know she died awhile back.

626
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,688
- Hm.

627
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,398
I wouldn't have asked anyhow.

628
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,993
- So, what?

629
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,893
Are you on some sort of a crusade?

630
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,250
- Something like that.

631
00:47:02,747 --> 00:47:06,448
- Yeah (chuckles), the Lord sure do pick

632
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,523
him some strange warriors.

633
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,968
- I'm obliged to you for
your help and conversation.

634
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:18,388
- Listen, soldier boy,

635
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,488
before you get goin' now,

636
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:21,717
that trail (sighs),

637
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,558
it's the fastest way to Junctionville,

638
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,088
but it's full of highwaymen and Haints.

639
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,090
- Haints (chuckles)?

640
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,608
A little old to be
believing in ghost stories.

641
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:38,673
- Oh now, you got that twisted again, son.

642
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:43,828
Advanced age has offered me
the opportunity to see things

643
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,663
you ain't never gonna see,

644
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,378
things I don't understand
and I couldn't explain 'em

645
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,168
if I had a hundred lifetimes.

646
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,193
Now, as a smart fella once said,

647
00:47:57,367 --> 00:48:02,163
"There are strings of things
in heaven and earth, Horatio,

648
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,687
than are dreamt of in your philosophy."

649
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,693
- Very obliged again.

650
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,893
- Hold up, soldier boy.

651
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,833
I'm the curious sort.

652
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:22,053
You mind tellin' me what's got
you on this mission of mercy?

653
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,713
- Would you believe keeping
a roof over babies heads?

654
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,212
Or making a pretty face smile?

655
00:48:29,214 --> 00:48:31,078
(bell tolling)

656
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,538
(sighs) Last but not least,

657
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,527
maybe keeping my vessel from burning.

658
00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:38,848
(shot firing)

659
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,163
- All noble causes, son.

660
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,943
And in order of importance.

661
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,116
- Forever and always.

662
00:48:48,118 --> 00:48:50,177
(old man chuckles)

663
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:54,183
- Son, nobody lives that long.

664
00:48:58,934 --> 00:49:02,101
(light western music)

665
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,920
(urine splashing)
(music continues)

666
00:49:11,922 --> 00:49:12,755
- Ah.

667
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:16,401
- Well, well.

668
00:49:16,403 --> 00:49:17,234
(woodsman grunting)

669
00:49:17,236 --> 00:49:19,588
If Grey Cloud had moment capturer,

670
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,655
this would make one pretty picture.

671
00:49:21,657 --> 00:49:23,008
(picture thuds)

672
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,178
- [Woodsman] You!

673
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,378
- Yes.

674
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,248
Grey Cloud.

675
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,898
- I'll be callin' you anything you like

676
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,208
if and you be gettin'
me up out of this sink.

677
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,458
- You left Grey Cloud to die then.

678
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,498
Why should he help you now?

679
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,338
- Because you won't be gettin'

680
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,868
very far on that piece of jerky

681
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:39,628
you got caught in that trap
back there all by yourself.

682
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:40,498
Now, come on.

683
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,468
- Where is government money
you took from burial suit?

684
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,048
Give to Grey Cloud, and he will spare you.

685
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,238
- You got the wrong white man.

686
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,228
That's son of a bitch.

687
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,688
He caught up to me and
he took it all back.

688
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,788
And the longer we're sitting
here crackin' walnuts

689
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,943
with our asses, the
further away he's gettin'.

690
00:49:56,945 --> 00:49:59,695
(birds chirping)

691
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:05,869
(ladder thuds)

692
00:50:05,871 --> 00:50:10,871
(Link panting)
(light western music)

693
00:50:15,058 --> 00:50:17,891
(music continues)

694
00:50:25,046 --> 00:50:27,879
(music continues)

695
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:37,875
(music continues)

696
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:43,657
(fire crackling)

697
00:50:43,659 --> 00:50:48,659
(Link gasps)
(music continues)

698
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:55,802
(music continues)

699
00:51:02,998 --> 00:51:05,831
(music continues)

700
00:51:12,941 --> 00:51:15,774
(music continues)

701
00:51:23,023 --> 00:51:25,856
(music continues)

702
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,528
(door closes)

703
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:35,523
- Sanchez, forgive me if I don't stand.

704
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,555
- We both had a ways to walk today.

705
00:51:39,557 --> 00:51:42,393
- (chuckles) That we did.

706
00:51:44,192 --> 00:51:46,768
(horse whinnying)

707
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,970
- That's what I owe you.

708
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,668
I would like a receipt or some form

709
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:53,733
of paper proof that my
debt to you is done.

710
00:51:56,904 --> 00:52:01,851
(train horn blaring)
(train chugging)

711
00:52:01,853 --> 00:52:04,270
(safe opens)

712
00:52:11,499 --> 00:52:14,332
(hinges creaking)

713
00:52:16,352 --> 00:52:18,685
(lid thuds)

714
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,211
(horse whinnying)

715
00:52:22,213 --> 00:52:24,630
(door thuds)

716
00:52:25,554 --> 00:52:28,323
- That old goat didn't
have much left did he?

717
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,948
- Senor Greeves, please.

718
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:32,783
The paper.

719
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,818
- What's the matter, amigo?

720
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,113
Don't trust me?

721
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:39,868
- I don't like loose ends.

722
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:42,628
- Maybe you shoulda made
sure he was dead then.

723
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,128
- I don't know too many
men that could take

724
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,588
a spade to the head twice.

725
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,988
- For a man like Link Maddock,

726
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,333
I do not believe it's sufficient.

727
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,338
- You were there, too.

728
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,308
You could have been more thorough.

729
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:00,453
- That's what I hire you lot
for, to not dirty my hands.

730
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,295
- [Townsperson] Sweet Jesus!

731
00:53:04,297 --> 00:53:09,297
(townsfolk chattering)
(horse whinnying)

732
00:53:14,046 --> 00:53:15,963
- Adios, Senor Greeves.

733
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:20,338
- What's your hurry, Sanchez?

734
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:23,733
Not in a hurry to gamble what
little you have left are ya?

735
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,913
Really should be more careful.

736
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:32,908
- What I have left is to
buy a new horse and wagon.

737
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,108
- Leavin' town?

738
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,668
- Yeah.

739
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,734
I suggest you do, too.

740
00:53:37,736 --> 00:53:39,457
- (chuckles) I can't leave.

741
00:53:39,459 --> 00:53:40,438
(water splashing)

742
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,593
Not until I collect what Jennie owes me.

743
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,038
You know how females are (chuckles).

744
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,708
No sense of direction.

745
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:53,283
Probably got herself lost
in that thicket somewhere.

746
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:55,970
- Well for your sake, Senor.

747
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,413
I hope she returns soon.

748
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,798
A storm is coming and I don't want

749
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,273
to be here when it arrives.

750
00:54:10,203 --> 00:54:13,693
(spurs clinking)

751
00:54:13,695 --> 00:54:15,568
(horse whinnying)

752
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:16,520
- [Deputy] Sheriff?

753
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,353
- Deputy.

754
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:23,903
- Why are we out here in this back water

755
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:27,691
huntin' down some man who killed

756
00:54:27,693 --> 00:54:32,023
some other man who gave
our family a bad name?

757
00:54:32,025 --> 00:54:33,328
(horse whinnying)

758
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:37,498
- Hm, precisely because it would be worse

759
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,188
for the Sykes family
name if we didn't pursue

760
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:42,838
the man who killed the man

761
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,790
who sullied our family name (coughing).

762
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,168
- I don't follow that.

763
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:52,060
- That's 'cause you ain't
figure hard enough, Deputy.

764
00:54:52,062 --> 00:54:53,963
(knives thudding)

765
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:56,373
You know what it takes to form a legacy.

766
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,263
- Children.

767
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:02,880
- Results (coughing).

768
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,988
The Sykes legacy like any other,

769
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,740
is dependent on results (coughing).

770
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,758
What pervasive law will
we be look upon decades

771
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,733
of centuries from now if
we neglected our duty,

772
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,258
and didn't pursue this Maddock

773
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,278
for pluggin' a blood
relations graveyard debt.

774
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,838
- How does a blood feud
secure a favorable legacy?

775
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,168
- The familial obligation is
a peripheral part of the debt,

776
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,118
you don't confuse yourself.

777
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,808
Maddock is one for crimes
against humanity in Coachees

778
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:41,793
or some such county.

779
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:46,438
We are on his trail
because he is a fugitive

780
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,748
and we will bring him to justice

781
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,988
as is our occupational duty.

782
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,673
We will assert that will,

783
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:59,908
it wouldn't reflect well
on the Syke family name

784
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:02,818
in years to come if we
spit in the collective eyes

785
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:06,867
of our daddies and our daddy's
daddies before (coughs).

786
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,113
- But we were the first
lawmen in our family.

787
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:14,505
- Oh, that's another thing about legacy.

788
00:56:15,837 --> 00:56:17,920
It requires a foundation.

789
00:56:19,021 --> 00:56:23,974
(horse whinnying)
(dogs barking)

790
00:56:23,976 --> 00:56:28,976
(birds calling)
(crickets chirping)

791
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:49,895
(henchwoman laughing)

792
00:56:49,897 --> 00:56:54,897
(eerie music)
(music box playing)

793
00:56:59,005 --> 00:57:04,005
(laughing continues)
(music continues)

794
00:57:08,986 --> 00:57:13,986
(laughing continues)
(music continues)

795
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:23,971
(laughing continues)
(music continues)

796
00:57:25,532 --> 00:57:27,949
- Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.

797
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,770
Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.

798
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:35,703
Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.

799
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:40,021
Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.

800
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,856
Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.

801
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:47,015
Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.

802
00:57:55,504 --> 00:57:58,254
(birds chirping)

803
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:11,130
(match strikes)

804
00:58:11,132 --> 00:58:13,799
(pensive music)

805
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,088
- Easy, ya old fart.

806
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,640
You give yourself apoplexia
if you strain too hard.

807
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,755
- Here you are, Jennie.

808
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:31,090
- Nice hardware.

809
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:35,275
(rifle cocks)

810
00:58:35,277 --> 00:58:37,224
(coins clinking)
(glass shattering)

811
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:39,317
- (laughs) Nice shootin', Jennie.

812
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:44,008
(Jennie laughs)
(coins clinking)

813
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:45,238
- Unimpressed, Maddock?

814
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,595
- I expected more from Jasper Jennie.

815
00:58:48,597 --> 00:58:53,597
(upbeat music)
(patrons chattering)

816
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,835
(music continues)

817
00:59:05,945 --> 00:59:10,945
(shots firing)
(guns cocking)

818
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:16,615
(music continues)

819
00:59:16,617 --> 00:59:17,448
- Woo!

820
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,795
Yeah, Jennie!
- Go Jennie!

821
00:59:19,797 --> 00:59:21,364
Faster.

822
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:23,199
Woo! Good job, Jennie!

823
00:59:24,215 --> 00:59:25,132
Yeah!
- Woo!

824
00:59:27,352 --> 00:59:32,352
(music continues)
(onlookers whooping)

825
00:59:35,311 --> 00:59:37,348
(rifle cocks)
(shots firing)

826
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:39,148
- So, you do know me?

827
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:40,413
- I've seen the flyers.

828
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,828
The Eagle-Eyed Jasper Jennie,

829
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,628
rifle maiden of the plains.

830
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:48,178
- Wonderful dead shot of the wing and run.

831
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,893
- Nothing but a bottle shooter.

832
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,838
No wonder Bill Cody ran
you out of his show.

833
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,845
You are not worth a damn.

834
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:59,051
- You assume much, Maddock.

835
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:01,803
(pensive music)

836
01:00:08,851 --> 01:00:13,851
(Annie gasping)
(music continues)

837
01:00:18,493 --> 01:00:21,483
(fist thuds)
(music continues)

838
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:24,068
(Jennie sighs)

839
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:31,774
(music continues)

840
01:00:36,476 --> 01:00:40,588
- No, no, no, no!
(poker sizzling)

841
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:45,590
- No, no, no!
(poker sizzling)

842
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,487
- Why else would such a talent

843
01:00:48,489 --> 01:00:50,745
have to steal from someone like me?

844
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:53,515
- It was never about the money.

845
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:54,838
(pensive music)

846
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,188
When that Junctionville banker

847
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,143
came along offerin' up your bullion,

848
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,343
it was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.

849
01:01:03,816 --> 01:01:07,408
- So, the same bank
foreclosing on the orphanage

850
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,838
is run by the same man who hired you?

851
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,818
- Talkin' don't suit you much, Maddock.

852
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,651
You make no sense.

853
01:01:12,653 --> 01:01:15,688
- You are not stealing from me.

854
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:17,488
You are stealing from orphans.

855
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:21,350
- I already told you it
weren't about the money.

856
01:01:21,352 --> 01:01:22,674
(thunder rumbling)
(horse whinnying)

857
01:01:22,676 --> 01:01:24,567
- [Posse Member] You must catch horses.

858
01:01:28,349 --> 01:01:31,943
(henchwoman member groaning)

859
01:01:31,945 --> 01:01:34,710
- Bastard's still alive!

860
01:01:34,712 --> 01:01:39,568
(thunder rumbling)
(pensive music)

861
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,403
Take off.

862
01:01:42,513 --> 01:01:44,673
I'll see to it he gets a bullet.

863
01:01:47,452 --> 01:01:49,835
(gun cocking)

864
01:01:49,837 --> 01:01:53,627
(shot firing)
(music continues)

865
01:01:53,629 --> 01:01:56,629
(thunder rumbling)

866
01:01:59,085 --> 01:02:00,898
(lid thuds)
(music continues)

867
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:01,948
No, Sir.

868
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:04,798
It weren't about the money.

869
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,568
It was about you.

870
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:09,928
I just used your kilter
as bait to lure you here.

871
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:13,618
I figure killin' you in an aboveboard dual

872
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,841
would do so good for my rep

873
01:02:15,843 --> 01:02:18,898
that that asshole Bill
Cody would have no choice

874
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,915
but to welcome me back
into his Wild West show.

875
01:02:21,917 --> 01:02:24,658
- A duel with my hands tied?

876
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,493
(Jennie chuckles)

877
01:02:29,193 --> 01:02:31,243
- I've been waitin' for this all my life.

878
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:38,668
Finally throwin' down
a real frontier friend.

879
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:41,785
Link Maddock and Jasper
Jennie face to face.

880
01:02:41,787 --> 01:02:42,618
Man to-
(head thuds)

881
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,902
(Jennie screams)

882
01:02:44,904 --> 01:02:49,904
(shots firing)
(Jennie yelling)

883
01:02:52,118 --> 01:02:54,264
Get that cock sucker!

884
01:02:54,266 --> 01:02:55,792
(Jennie screaming indistinctly)

885
01:02:55,794 --> 01:02:59,196
(shots firing)

886
01:02:59,198 --> 01:03:00,496
(rifle cocks)

887
01:03:00,498 --> 01:03:02,246
(shots firing)

888
01:03:02,248 --> 01:03:06,248
(Jennie screaming indistinctly)

889
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:10,775
Link Maddock, I'm gonna kill you!

890
01:03:10,777 --> 01:03:11,610
Fuck you!

891
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:13,917
(shots firing)

892
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:16,927
I'm gonna get that cock sucker!

893
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:18,089
That bitch!

894
01:03:18,091 --> 01:03:23,091
(Jennie wailing)
(shots firing)

895
01:03:23,962 --> 01:03:25,371
(Jennie screaming indistinctly)

896
01:03:25,373 --> 01:03:27,956
(shots firing)

897
01:03:34,642 --> 01:03:36,956
Get that God damn bastard!

898
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:38,754
(shots firing)

899
01:03:38,756 --> 01:03:42,756
(Jennie screaming indistinctly)

900
01:03:45,128 --> 01:03:47,596
(Jennie wailing)

901
01:03:47,598 --> 01:03:49,369
Kill that cock sucker!

902
01:03:49,371 --> 01:03:50,202
- [Masked Henchwoman] Go on, get, get.

903
01:03:50,204 --> 01:03:52,283
I got him, I got him!

904
01:03:52,285 --> 01:03:55,035
(Jennie wailing)

905
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:59,035
(gun cocks)

906
01:03:59,037 --> 01:04:01,408
(shot firing)
(masked henchwoman grunts)

907
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:04,160
(birds chirping)

908
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:15,453
(anticipatory music)

909
01:04:21,986 --> 01:04:24,447
(music continues)

910
01:04:24,449 --> 01:04:26,806
- [Kids] Trick-or-treat?

911
01:04:26,808 --> 01:04:31,808
(light music)
(children chattering)

912
01:04:34,314 --> 01:04:35,763
(Sheriff Sykes snoring)

913
01:04:35,765 --> 01:04:40,765
(children chattering)
(music continues)

914
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:49,167
(deputy snoring)
(music continues)

915
01:04:55,050 --> 01:05:00,050
(bird calling)
(light music)

916
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,888
- [Sanchez] I need to move
the table for Mr. Scott,

917
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:08,940
and then we'll leave.

918
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,653
- Welcome home, Pesos.

919
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:35,488
- Don't know what you mean, stranger.

920
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:37,048
- Funny, that.

921
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:37,883
- What is?

922
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,213
- Your resemblance.

923
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,458
- I guess I should have
changed more than just my name.

924
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,623
- Maybe stop your thieving altogether.

925
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:51,903
- I gave that life up.

926
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:54,273
I'm leaving town.

927
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:57,718
I'm here to let my boss know.

928
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,970
He'll be back any minute.

929
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:01,743
- Somebody told Pesos,

930
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:05,548
said there was Mexican among the bunch.

931
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:07,618
I have been looking for.

932
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,748
Not many of those in Junctionville.

933
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:10,738
Just you.

934
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:14,823
- Maddock, whatever anyone
told you, it's a lie.

935
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,688
- Okay, okay.

936
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:19,587
I was there.

937
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:20,810
(thunder rumbling)

938
01:06:20,812 --> 01:06:21,643
(Sanchez speaking in Spanish)

939
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:23,038
It was blackmail.

940
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,228
That (speaking in
Spanish) banker, Greeves,

941
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:27,118
he found out about my past

942
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,198
and said he would expose me

943
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,508
to the authorities if I didn't pay him.

944
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:31,963
I had no choice.

945
01:06:31,965 --> 01:06:34,465
(rifle cocks)

946
01:06:35,545 --> 01:06:38,212
(pensive music)

947
01:06:45,021 --> 01:06:47,854
(music continues)

948
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:58,007
(music continues)

949
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:05,008
- (sighs) I am going to
give you a last chance.

950
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:06,093
- Maddock, I can't.

951
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:11,098
- Hopefully you are equally
good with your left.

952
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,700
- This is as good as killing me.

953
01:07:14,222 --> 01:07:16,283
- I'll let you duel first, okay?

954
01:07:17,496 --> 01:07:19,913
(soft music)

955
01:07:24,699 --> 01:07:27,782
(anticipatory music)

956
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,843
(music continues)

957
01:07:44,006 --> 01:07:46,839
(music continues)

958
01:07:52,678 --> 01:07:54,095
- [Juanita] Papa!

959
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,423
Mama says to help you with the table.

960
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:03,363
- You've done enough
work for today, Juanita.

961
01:08:03,365 --> 01:08:04,465
Now go to your mother.

962
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:06,270
I'll be over soon.

963
01:08:13,466 --> 01:08:18,133
If I had any of your money
left, you could have it back.

964
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,170
I'm gonna turn around
and get on that wagon

965
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,800
and you'll never see me again.

966
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:28,623
- Hey, amigo?

967
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:34,984
(Link speaking in Spanish)

968
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:40,340
- He keeps the money
in a safe by the desk.

969
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,678
Please take care of yourself.

970
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,423
- You too.
- And thank you.

971
01:08:49,602 --> 01:08:54,430
I, we, owe our new lives to you.

972
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:57,823
- Don't mention it.

973
01:09:04,004 --> 01:09:04,921
Ever again.

974
01:09:06,467 --> 01:09:09,634
(light music playing)

975
01:09:12,099 --> 01:09:13,492
(door opens)

976
01:09:13,494 --> 01:09:15,994
(door closes)

977
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:20,279
(coins thudding)

978
01:09:22,989 --> 01:09:23,822
Hm mm.

979
01:09:27,923 --> 01:09:31,756
When you bury a man, you
better bury him deep.

980
01:09:32,783 --> 01:09:33,766
(coins thudding)

981
01:09:33,768 --> 01:09:35,851
Toss it in with the rest.

982
01:09:37,017 --> 01:09:37,848
Do it.

983
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:40,183
(gun cocks)

984
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:48,048
(pensive music)

985
01:09:49,616 --> 01:09:51,236
(coins clinking)

986
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:53,655
(case thuds)

987
01:09:55,078 --> 01:09:57,013
(music continues)

988
01:09:57,015 --> 01:09:58,641
- Take it all.

989
01:09:58,643 --> 01:10:00,055
Let me be.

990
01:10:00,057 --> 01:10:01,233
- Not a chance.

991
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,008
We are off to make a donation

992
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:07,348
to Mother of our Redeemer.

993
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:09,621
Now, take the chest.

994
01:10:09,623 --> 01:10:10,456
Do it.

995
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:13,282
Go, that way.

996
01:10:17,061 --> 01:10:21,936
(children chattering)
(light music playing)

997
01:10:21,938 --> 01:10:24,688
(spurs clinking)

998
01:10:26,996 --> 01:10:29,829
(music continues)

999
01:10:37,026 --> 01:10:39,859
(music continues)

1000
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:48,210
- God damn it.

1001
01:10:53,311 --> 01:10:54,142
(gun cocks)

1002
01:10:54,144 --> 01:10:55,715
- Trick-or-treat?

1003
01:10:55,717 --> 01:10:57,833
(shots firing)
(candy clattering)

1004
01:10:57,835 --> 01:11:02,835
(children chattering)
(music continues)

1005
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:09,791
(music continues)

1006
01:11:13,295 --> 01:11:18,258
- Sister Marie, bring the
foundlings in from the field.

1007
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:22,427
Mr. Greeves here is about to
put an end to the fundraising.

1008
01:11:22,429 --> 01:11:27,429
- Oh, please, Mr. Maddock,
no guns in here, please.

1009
01:11:28,355 --> 01:11:32,188
- I don't think the Lord will take offense

1010
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:34,750
because this is a very dangerous criminal.

1011
01:11:34,752 --> 01:11:36,688
(coins clinking)

1012
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:40,190
- I, uh...

1013
01:11:41,926 --> 01:11:42,759
I...

1014
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:47,578
(Sister Marie sighs)

1015
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,008
I insist.

1016
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:50,128
(pensive music)

1017
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:51,358
- That's my gun.

1018
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,193
- Yes.

1019
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:55,537
I never sold it and there were never

1020
01:11:55,539 --> 01:11:58,713
any orphans either you dumb peckerhead.

1021
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:01,678
Now listen, you like the candy, right?

1022
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,238
There's candy if you look real sad.

1023
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,128
You have to look real
sad for me, all right?

1024
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:06,538
- And that horse shit story

1025
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:10,948
was all it took to lead
us right to your holdings.

1026
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:11,853
- Now, drop it.

1027
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,589
Now.

1028
01:12:15,591 --> 01:12:18,258
(pensive music)

1029
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:21,953
Kick it over.

1030
01:12:23,348 --> 01:12:25,073
(trunk slides)

1031
01:12:25,075 --> 01:12:28,348
(shot firing)

1032
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:30,028
- [Greeves] We did it, Candace.

1033
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:32,133
Pack your bags for Paris.

1034
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:35,758
- What?

1035
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,948
Where's the rest of it, Henry?

1036
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:41,518
- In the forest somewhere
with that wanton tribe aid

1037
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,618
and her gang of inverts.

1038
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,298
We don't need their share.

1039
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,555
- We don't need their share?

1040
01:12:46,557 --> 01:12:47,518
- No, we don't need their share.

1041
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,351
We got all
- What are you talkin' about?

1042
01:12:48,353 --> 01:12:49,184
- the money we need.

1043
01:12:49,186 --> 01:12:50,218
We got all the money-
- Who did you tell?

1044
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,778
- Look, Candace, you got to believe me.

1045
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:53,458
I don't know how he found out.

1046
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,048
- Oh, you stupid idiot.

1047
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:58,078
I knew this was your dumb
idea from the very start,

1048
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,489
and I knew it'd fail.

1049
01:12:59,491 --> 01:13:04,491
(fire crackling)
(pensive music)

1050
01:13:10,036 --> 01:13:12,869
(music continues)

1051
01:13:15,575 --> 01:13:19,425
(bell tolls)
(fire crackling)

1052
01:13:19,427 --> 01:13:21,238
I knew this was a stupid idea

1053
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,608
from the minute it left your mouth.

1054
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:25,378
- It worked, didn't it?

1055
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:26,578
- It did.

1056
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:27,873
Maybe it has more to do with this getup

1057
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:30,783
than it does with you
and your stupid idea!

1058
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,203
Just the same, I'm glad to be rid of it.

1059
01:13:35,379 --> 01:13:40,379
(bell tolling)
(music continues)

1060
01:13:45,056 --> 01:13:47,889
(music continues)

1061
01:13:55,038 --> 01:13:57,871
(music continues)

1062
01:14:05,463 --> 01:14:09,052
Now, that thing was hotter
than a son of a bitch.

1063
01:14:09,054 --> 01:14:13,143
(sighs) Now, it's time for you to go.

1064
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,898
- Is this a joke?

1065
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:19,558
- Why would I waste a joke
on you, you humorless oaf?

1066
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,258
- You God damned trollop!

1067
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:25,053
- Oh, don't take the
Lord's name in vain, deary.

1068
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,675
- Candace.

1069
01:14:27,677 --> 01:14:30,685
(stammering) Paris!

1070
01:14:30,687 --> 01:14:32,818
- (stammering) "Paris."

1071
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:33,658
Please!

1072
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:35,668
I've had better from both of my uncles.

1073
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:38,290
Now, you need to get out and...

1074
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:40,709
(gun cocks)

1075
01:14:43,674 --> 01:14:46,738
- As a God fearin' man myself,

1076
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:51,740
I hate to be shootin' holes
in a place of worship.

1077
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:54,958
But my heathen associate over
there has no such qualms,

1078
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,288
so you best be handin' us that money

1079
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:59,673
and we'll keep everything all civil like.

1080
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:04,090
- You all put your (coughs)...

1081
01:15:07,285 --> 01:15:10,251
You all put your hands (coughing)...

1082
01:15:10,253 --> 01:15:12,476
(anticipatory music)

1083
01:15:12,478 --> 01:15:14,728
- You all are under arrest.

1084
01:15:15,592 --> 01:15:17,425
Reach for the ceiling,

1085
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:20,948
and face the wall.

1086
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:25,950
(Sheriff Sykes coughing)
(music continues)

1087
01:15:29,254 --> 01:15:31,105
- Hey, Mister?

1088
01:15:31,107 --> 01:15:31,972
