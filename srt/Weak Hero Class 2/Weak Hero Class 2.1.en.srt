<i>What I have to do,</i>

2
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,655
<i>I have to catch everybody…</i>

3
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>if they start to go over the cliff.</i>

4
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:41,041
<i>I mean, if they're running</i>
<i>and don't look where they're going…</i>

5
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,421
<i>I have to come out</i>

6
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,091
<i>from somewhere…</i>

7
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,929
<i>and catch them.</i>

8
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,360
<i>That's all I'd do all day.</i>

WEAK HERO:
CLASS 2

10
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,878
You're a total lunatic.

11
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,759
You should understand me, Si-eun.

12
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,672
<i>Why do you think you can't sleep well?</i>

13
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,136
<i>You said you keep having the same dream.</i>

14
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:46,100
<i>But you still don't want to tell me</i>
<i>what the dream is about?</i>

15
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,107
A dream is just a dream.

16
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,701
Do the sleeping pills help?

17
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,789
Yes.

18
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,459
It doesn't seem like it.

19
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,675
But I'll tell your mother that they do.

20
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,719
Doctor.

21
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,013
Yes?

22
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,518
I think our time is up.

23
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,202
Look, I'll really kick it this time.

24
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,417
Are you okay?

25
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,713
Hey, what is it? This is crazy.

26
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,550
Hey, Yeon Si-eun.

27
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,636
Hey, move out of his way.

28
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,685
What was that?

29
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,023
<i>I heard he transferred here</i>
<i>after killing a kid.</i>

30
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,736
<i>Even Choi Hyo-man chickened out.</i>
<i>He avoids him now.</i>

31
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,449
<i>He must be a fucking psychopath.</i>

32
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,242
Hey, damn.

33
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,370
Yeon Si-eun.

34
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,749
Damn, be quiet!
Someone might get killed again.

35
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,959
Hey, let's go for a smoke.

36
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,213
Fuck this. It's too scary.

37
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:26,302
"I'D JUST BE
THE CATCHER IN THE RYE AND ALL."

38
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,639
THE CATCHER IN THE RYE
BY J.D. SALINGER

39
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,232
Jun-tae is totally fucked now.

40
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,319
I'm sorry.

41
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,657
I wasn't paying attention.
It was an accident.

42
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,386
Another delivery, Jun-tae? You're busy.

43
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,500
Fuck! Seo Jun-Tae!

44
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:40,918
Yes?

45
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,174
I asked for strawberry milk.

46
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,009
What?

47
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:49,886
You bitch.

48
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,890
I told you last week to switch it up!

49
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,808
Right.

50
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,272
Strawberry.

51
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,776
What's with that look?

52
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,031
Is it that hard?

53
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,785
Sorry, I got confused for a second.

54
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,497
I'll let it go just this once.

55
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,749
Got it?

56
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,460
Bring it in.

57
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,506
Sorry. I'll pay more attention next time.

58
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,548
That's it.

59
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,800
Bring me the goods later.

60
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:32,887
iPhones.

61
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,847
iPhones.

62
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,349
Beat it.

63
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,228
Go, fast delivery!

64
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,354
Go, Jun-tae!

Yeon Si-eun.

70
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,504
Hey…

71
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,967
What kind of phone do you have?

72
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,553
What?

73
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,472
Well, I mean…

74
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:04,145
I was wondering if you could tell me
the model of your phone.

75
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:06,939
Why?

76
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,027
I'm just curious…

77
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,538
WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF GO
EUNJANG BOARDROOM

78
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,583
Fuck, is that all?

79
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,965
The supply keeps shrinking, doesn't it?

80
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,596
Fuck.

81
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:48,230
Gentlemen, it seems that
there is a misunderstanding.

82
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,109
Okay? We're running a business here.

83
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,569
A business, yeah?

84
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:58,074
You all need to work your asses off
so I can protect your asses

85
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,868
here at Eunjang High.

86
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,287
However,

87
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,500
if your performance
keeps fucking dropping,

88
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,419
I can't protect you guys
from being bullied.

89
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,383
Team Leader, sir, can we have a look
at the ledger for today?

90
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,220
If you missed even one,
I'll beat you all to death today.

91
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,682
- The ledger.
- Five. Four.

92
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,101
Three. Two.

93
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,270
Well,

94
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,316
Team Leader, sir,
this looks very significant.

95
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,776
What does?

96
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,028
I mean, look here.

97
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,823
"Class 4, Yeon Si-eun. Don't touch."

98
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,366
Don't touch?

99
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,119
Why is that?

100
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,664
Well, the thing is,

101
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,501
when he transferred here,

102
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,295
you two almost got into a fight,

103
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,548
but the teacher walked in,
and that was it.

104
00:11:55,631 --> 00:12:00,511
Then you said you'd handle him yourself,
and we shouldn't touch him.

105
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,554
Get to the point.

106
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,222
Yes, well, so…

107
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,393
You haven't taken
any action against him yet.

108
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:11,063
I thought if I took action myself,
it could cause a problem--

109
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,106
A problem?

110
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,942
- A problem, he says?
- Crazy asshole.

111
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,485
A problem?

112
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,281
That dumbass is really pushing
the wrong buttons.

113
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,494
- What kind of problem?
- It's not that.

114
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,621
When you say "problem" like that,

115
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,125
you mean you think
that prick would beat me?

116
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,334
- Is that it?
- No.

117
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,878
Don't fucking deny it!

118
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,588
You can guard?

119
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,841
Fuck, that was cool. Do it again.

120
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,054
Hold still.

121
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,561
That's what you thought this whole time?

122
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,688
That I'd lose? You fucking asshole.

123
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,441
Is that right? Huh?

124
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,236
Get up.

125
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,613
Yeah?

126
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,329
Look at this fucking kid.
He looks like a beggar.

127
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,248
You need to look sharp.
Fuck. Who did this to you?

128
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,212
Hi-yah!

129
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,841
Oh shit!

130
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,347
Team Leader.

131
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,020
I know you'll have Si-eun's phone
by the end of the day.

132
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,647
I will.

133
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,857
Good. Thank you.

134
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,869
Sir, the phones.

135
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,122
No announcements today,
so you can take them.

136
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,874
See you tomorrow.

137
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,042
Yes, see you.

138
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,589
It can't be helped.

139
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,346
This can't be helped.

140
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:30,995
12 - YEON SI-EUN

141
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,505
Get your phones. No announcements today.

142
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:03,986
Hey.

143
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,614
Yeah?

144
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,449
Have you seen my phone?

145
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,745
It's not there?

146
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,289
It's not.

147
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,251
Oh? Really?

148
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,962
That's really weird.

149
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,757
I mean,

150
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,300
how could this happen?

151
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,801
It's really gone.

152
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,888
Well, that's…

153
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,892
I just got them from the office.

154
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,895
I don't hand them out. You saw.
Everyone just takes theirs.

155
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,065
I don't touch
or go through anyone's phones.

156
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,609
There's no way I would steal one.

157
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,111
I'm not a thief or anything.

158
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,614
Yeah.

159
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,908
You know what I'm saying?

160
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,163
I don't know what you're saying.

161
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,419
Anyway, I really don't know.

162
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,504
Okay.

163
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,517
Here's Yeon Si-eun's phone.

164
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,352
As expected, Team Leader.

165
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:22,606
Why did you wait to get told off?
You should've done this first.

166
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,567
You can clock out.
I'll pass the phone to Hyo-man.

167
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,404
- Okay.
- Get home safe, Jun-tae.

168
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,321
Thanks.

169
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,699
Take care.

170
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,493
I love you, Jun-tae.

171
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,093
Si-eun, did you find your phone?

172
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,318
Hey.

173
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,529
About your phone.

174
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,072
I thought about it.

175
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,826
I feel bad

176
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:20,122
because I'm partly responsible
for not looking after them well.

177
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,292
So if you plan on buying a new phone,

178
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,627
I'll pitch in some money.

179
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,214
This is the time to remain positive.

180
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,425
You just need to push forward.

181
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,595
In life, there are always things
that can't be helped.

182
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,055
What can't be helped?

183
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,893
Do you think I don't know?

184
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,148
You're just trying
to make yourself feel better.

185
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,322
That's really cowardly.

186
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,923
Cowardly?

187
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,177
<i>Si-eun.</i>

188
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,597
You didn't lose your phone on purpose
just to get a new one?

189
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,103
It's nice anyway.

190
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,980
I get to hang out with my son.

191
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:33,946
When you study abroad next semester,
we won't have much time together.

192
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:40,035
It could be tough at first,
but you'll soon get used to it.

193
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,053
<i>Su-ho.</i>

194
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,100
<i>I still can't sleep.</i>

195
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,563
<i>I take sleeping pills,</i>

196
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,774
<i>but I still can't sleep.</i>

197
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,406
<i>While I can't sleep…</i>

198
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,536
<i>I wonder when you'll wake up.</i>

199
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,875
<i>A few days ago,</i>

200
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,087
<i>I called one of my classmates cowardly.</i>

201
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,424
<i>However…</i>

202
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,555
<i>I actually might be the cowardly one.</i>

203
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,018
<i>I wish…</i>

204
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,355
<i>everyone would leave me alone.</i>

205
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,443
<i>As if…</i>

206
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,321
<i>I wasn't there.</i>

207
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,454
Let's just go.

208
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:10,584
- Why's he doing that on the stairs?
- You did a good job.

209
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,045
You're a real cutie, aren't you?

210
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,088
That's it. Hug me tightly.

211
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,758
My dear Jun-tae, how about a blind date?

212
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,719
Yeah, why don't you drink with us?

213
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,889
Good idea. Jun-tae has
a fucking huge one, you know.

214
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:24,932
Is that so?

215
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,310
Goodness! Our Jun-tae has a big one?

216
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,353
No way.

217
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,104
Let me feel that dick, okay?

218
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,481
Come here.

219
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,066
- Come on, man!
- Stop it!

220
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,192
Aren't we friends?

221
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,361
- Damn.
- Don't do that!

222
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,074
Hey, don't move!

223
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,492
<i>Hey, don't try too hard.</i>

224
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,369
Fucker, stay still!

225
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,871
Hold still. Look at this punk!

226
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,040
<i>- He's blocking him quite well!</i>
<i>- Stop it!</i>

227
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,960
This punk!

228
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,003
- It's gigantic!
- Don't!

229
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,591
- Jun-tae, what are you doing?
- Stop it!

230
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,612
Hey, wait!

231
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,366
<i>Hey, Si-eun.</i>

232
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,036
Hey.

233
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,497
Hey, punk!

234
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,044
Fuck, what are you doing standing there?
You're fucking scary.

235
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,050
Hey, I heard you lost your phone.

236
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,887
Phones go missing a lot these days.
Take good care of yours. Right, Jun-tae?

237
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,764
Yeah.

238
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,017
I have a lot of extras. Do you want one?

239
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,060
Say "please."

240
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,150
Move it. Get out of my way.

241
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,034
I don't want to.

242
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,837
His eyes might pop out.

243
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,422
Man, go on.

244
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,841
Hey, move over for him. Go.

245
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,436
Wow, look at that fucker's eyes.

246
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,897
You're letting him go?

247
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,232
Man, just leave the fucking loser alone.

248
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:53,914
Sorry.

249
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,834
I didn't mean to wake you.

250
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,088
I'm sorry.

251
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:07,969
Well…

252
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,472
Those are for you

253
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,517
because you sleep through lunch every day.

254
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,352
Take them. I don't need them.

255
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,939
Hey, I just…

256
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,862
I'm sorry.

257
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,408
I took your phone and gave it to Hyo-man.

258
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,830
I'm sorry,

259
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,291
but I really couldn't help it.

260
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,587
Yeon Si-eun.

261
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,435
Last time, you said…

262
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,355
that I was being cowardly.

263
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,901
I've thought a lot about it since then.

264
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,199
But I really don't know what I should do.

265
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,161
So?

266
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,333
Can you tell me?

267
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,217
How can I stop being a coward?

268
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,222
Why me?

269
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,352
There's no one else I can ask.

270
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:43,857
Please.

271
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,699
Do you know Newton's third law?

272
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,287
Without an action,

273
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,956
there won't be a reaction.

274
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:28,985
NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION

275
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,033
VICE PRESIDENT

276
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,589
Cheers!

277
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,175
Let's drink!

278
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,515
Hey, Hyo-man. Jun-tae isn't answering.

279
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,434
I heard he left early or something.

280
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,519
No fucking idea.

281
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,605
If Jun-tae doesn't answer, who's paying?

282
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,941
Fuck, and you call yourself men?

283
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,985
What's that?

284
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,195
What's what?

285
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:15,907
Fucking cool!

286
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,325
What a man!

287
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,662
I need to step out for a minute,
but keep partying.

288
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,621
I'm off.

289
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,583
- Where are you going?
- It's business.

290
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,418
- Isn't this great?
- Have fun.

291
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,878
- I'll take care of your girl.
- Fuck you.

292
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,088
Where's he going?

293
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,759
We're trying to join the Union.

294
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,679
If we do, we'll make a shitload of money.

295
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,230
Fuck! Why don't you fucking get it?

296
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,650
You go to Eunjang High,
so know your place and listen up.

297
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,027
Stop looking like that.

298
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,154
You fucking morons.

299
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,325
- Wow, he's loaded.
- A rich kid?

300
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,326
So fucking loaded.

301
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,411
Hey.

302
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,580
Does this suck?

303
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,915
If it fucking sucks, join the Union.

304
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,211
You fucking idiots live like this
because you go to Eunjang.

305
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,421
Get it together.

306
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,798
Fuck, I'd have transferred if I was you.

307
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,759
Don't look like that.

308
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,472
What is it?

309
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,307
Is Seong-je inside?

310
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,684
What?

311
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,270
I'm Choi Hyo-man from Eunjang.

312
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,939
I have a meeting with Seong-je.
Is he around?

313
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,108
- Right.
- He's here.

314
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,611
Yes, Seong-je is inside.

315
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,779
Thank you!

316
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,697
Hey.

317
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,701
Enjoy it while you can.

318
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,375
What? Is Eunjang really joining the Union?

319
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,710
Isn't Baku the top dog at Eunjang?

320
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,295
What's that punk up to?

321
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,430
Okay, I'll bring more next month.

322
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,307
Okay, beat it.

323
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,900
DAEHYEON HIGH, GANGHAK HIGH

324
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,235
Man, that's a lot.

325
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,657
Seong-je. It's me, Hyo-man.

326
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,576
Are you gaming?

327
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,120
Fucking idiots.

328
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,914
I said to just draw aggro.

329
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,333
Sorry, my bad.

330
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,587
This is why
I don't go on raids with newbies.

331
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,550
Speak.

332
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,803
It's about the phones.

333
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,848
I need until next week to get some more.

334
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:49,728
But if you can overlook that,
I think I can really bring in some profit.

335
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,855
And as we said,

336
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:56,234
if you could take care of Park Hu-min
when he's off suspension…

337
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:57,986
Next week?

338
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,322
Yeah, I'll definitely have
100 phones by next week.

339
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,118
I usually don't make mistakes like this.

340
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,327
Man!

341
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,163
Have the goods by next week.

342
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,040
Of course! You know I'm loyal.

343
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,668
These brats are playing gangsters.

344
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,378
How fucking scary.

345
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,048
These little shits deserve a beating.

346
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,136
What, is he a Gen Z gangster?

347
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:24,637
Fucking Gen Z.

348
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,019
What the hell? What the fuck do you want?

349
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,410
Fuck.

350
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,878
Seong-je. You're very busy. Sorry.

351
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,005
I'll get going.

352
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,385
Who the hell was that?

00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:16,523

Let me see your phone.
You said you got it back.

00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,770
Look here. Is this your phone?

377
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,480
It's mine, you fucking idiot.

378
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,607
- You're right.
- Jun-tae has gone crazy!

379
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,777
Why's that traitor acting
like he's on our side?

380
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,406
What's important is
he gave everyone's phones back.

Hey.

401
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,711
Is it true?

402
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,589
You took the phones?

403
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:37,718
Yeah.

00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,930
Aren't you cool?

Your guard is fucking tough!

Hey, you're looking good. Give it to me.

407
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,862
Fuck. Let it go.

408
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,156
Are you a dancing machine or what?

409
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,327
Block this, too, will you?

410
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,329
Nice shot!

411
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,586
A pancake mouth guard!

412
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,180
You should be obeying me like a dog.

413
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,225
Thanks to me,
you had an easy time at school.

414
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,936
Should I make you kill yourself, fucker?

415
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,065
You son of a bitch!

416
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:37,778
Hey, you piece of shit! Fucking asshole!

00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,701
No matter what you fucking do,
nothing will fucking change, asshole!

You son of a bitch!

419
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,582
Hey, should we stop him?

420
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,667
Team Leader, sir?

421
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,460
- Stay out of it.
- We're almost done.

422
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,805
You're too loud.

423
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,142
What?

424
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,941
Don't cross the line.
