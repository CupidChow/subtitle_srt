1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:10,635
<i>Fucking hell!</i>

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,595
- Stop, you bastards!
- Run!

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,972
- Asshole!
- Jun-tae, run!

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,558
Hey, motherfuckers!

5
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,518
- Stop, you fuckers!
- Assholes!

6
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,769
Come here, assholes!

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,896
- Fuckers, get back here! Fuck!
- Assholes!

8
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,025
- Run fast!
- Hey!

9
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,568
- Fuck!
- Stop right there!

10
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,737
- Stop right there!
- Get them!

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,615
What the fuck?

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,825
Where did they go?

13
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,036
- Shit!
- Goddamn those fuckers.

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,621
You three go that way.
We'll go this way. Hurry!

15
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,582
- Let's go quickly.
- Hurry up! Shit!

16
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,625
- Man, those fuckers.
- You're dead! Fuck!

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,798
- Jun-tae.
- Yeah?

18
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,717
Hiding here was a good idea.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,930
This has always been the best place
to hide from bullies.

20
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:56,848
Nice one.

21
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,063
The document. Did you get it?

22
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,397
Yeah.

23
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,569
Don't lose it, okay?

24
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,280
Good. Nice. Freaking nice.

25
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,617
Hey, Jun-tae!

26
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,787
Fucking asshole. Little fucker!

27
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:21,831
Shit.

28
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,302
Stop right there, punk!

29
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,014
Damn!

30
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,266
What's this?

31
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,104
Let it go, punk. Let go.

32
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,608
Shit!

33
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,360
I let down my guard before.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,170
Hey, you fucking little prick. Fuck!

35
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,922
What can you do with this?

36
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,885
Damn!

37
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,722
Shit!

38
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,308
- He got him.
- Get up.

39
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,435
Those fucking assholes.

40
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,521
We finally caught those fuckers.

41
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,481
Hey.

42
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,860
What the fuck do you want?

43
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,226
What are you doing?

44
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,979
You crazy punk.

45
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,273
You're part of the Union.

46
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,570
You have to die.

47
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,219
Son of a bitch.

48
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,894
Hey, Park Hu-min!

49
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,479
Baku!

50
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,316
Hey, that's enough, you punk. Stop!

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,651
I said that's enough!

52
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,196
Hey, Jun-tae, help me stop him!

53
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,243
That's enough!
Fucking come to your senses, asshole!

54
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,036
Come to your senses, please!

55
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,874
Come on! Shit!

56
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,752
Let go of me, asshole!

57
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,212
Hu-min, please stop!

58
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,720
- Please! Damn it!
- Baku.

59
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,556
Hu-min.

60
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,479
It's Si-eun.

61
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,529
Si-eun is…

62
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,135
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 2

63
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,866
<i>Hey, don't spit it out!</i>

64
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,534
<i>Hey, Hu-min.</i>

65
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,744
<i>When was this, Baku?</i>

66
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,661
<i>What was that?</i>

67
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,747
Hey!

68
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,333
When did you film it?

69
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,922
Hey, it's so hot! Water!

70
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,256
Water!

71
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,509
- I can't hear you!
- It's fucking hot!

72
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,260
We also had

73
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,180
good times together.

74
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,143
But you know what?

75
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,524
It's all pointless anyway.

76
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,739
In the end…

77
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,660
they'll all end up like us.

78
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,540
Eventually…

79
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,543
they'll get hurt

80
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,379
and be ruined…

81
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,382
in the same way.

82
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,266
I'm sorry.

83
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,070
I wasn't looking for an apology from you.

84
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,078
How's Si-eun?

85
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,126
He's in stable condition.

86
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,462
So don't worry. Go home.

87
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,422
Your parents must be waiting.

88
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:35,718
It's fine.

89
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,054
We're all Si-eun's friends.

90
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,014
No.

91
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,351
That isn't what I meant.

92
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,688
Please stop…

93
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,442
being friends with Si-eun.

94
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,906
Please.

95
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,423
One page

96
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,176
is missing.

97
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,472
I'll bring it right away.

98
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:31,857
By the way…

99
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,153
how did Hu-min end up coming to Daesung?

100
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,869
Do I have to explain that?

101
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,344
Get out, you fucking assholes.

102
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,393
Hey, find those assholes quickly.

103
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,811
Okay.

104
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,063
Hurry up!

105
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,106
Sons of bitches.

106
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:36,881
Come eat.

107
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,097
You're home, so you need to eat, you punk.

108
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,732
Here.

109
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,000
USE THIS

110
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,252
I won't ask
where or how you got this money.

111
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,170
Just give it back.

112
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,215
Stop pretending to be an adult.

113
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,055
And

114
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,141
did you know your friends came by?

115
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,732
One of them gave me a hard time.

116
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,567
That punk

117
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,611
seemed rather clever.

118
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,075
Still, you've been living better
than I ever did.

119
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,788
You have friends who look for you
when you can't be reached.

120
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,585
Be good to them, kid.
They'll last forever.

121
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,674
Guilt.

122
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:04,927
What?

123
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,598
He…

124
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,356
Because of me, he…

125
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,949
Because of me…

126
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,030
<i>Si-eun, if you were me</i>…

127
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,992
<i>what would you have done?</i>

128
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,294
You're saying this is a record
of stolen motorcycles?

129
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,174
Do you have a record
of this person's transactions?

130
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,635
I don't have anything like that.

131
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,014
In that case,

132
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,183
I can't investigate it.

133
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,770
For now,

134
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,189
we'll keep this document safe.

135
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,816
You can head home.
If we decide to investigate later--

136
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,486
In that case, never mind.

137
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,546
Man, fuck this. Seriously.

138
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:08,926
Hello, friend.

139
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,263
Did you go to the police?

140
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,353
I heard you took the list of buyers.

141
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,539
Hey, Baek-jin.

142
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,582
I burned the list.

143
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,670
Take it.

144
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,430
<i>You didn't take a photo, did you?</i>

145
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,768
How did you know?

146
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,314
I don't understand.

147
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,904
What do you think a loser like you can do?

148
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,033
<i>And the list?</i>

149
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,245
<i>It's no use on its own.</i>

150
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,292
Then why are you so nervous?

151
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,296
What?

152
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,797
<i>Park Hu-min.</i>

153
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,591
<i>Yeon Si-eun.</i>

154
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:32,968
<i>Go Hyun-tak.</i>

155
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,347
<i>Don't mess with my friends.</i>

156
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,394
Then I'll delete the photo.

157
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:48,984
I don't care.

158
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,404
Then just die there.

159
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,287
You son of a bitch.

160
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,039
What the fuck are you doing?

161
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,543
Come here, fucker.

162
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,586
Son of a bitch.

163
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,963
Bitch. Fucking asshole.

164
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,965
Try being a smart-ass again, asswipe!

165
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:12,883
Hey!

166
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,636
- Fucker!
- Smash his head in, then he'll die!

167
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:16,970
Motherfucker.

168
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,514
Kill him.

169
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,895
- I said kick his head in!
- He's hanging in better than I thought.

170
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,856
Just smash his head.

171
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,317
- Do a headbutt.
- Headbutt, my ass.

172
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,903
You guys are fucking loud.

173
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,198
I was trying to sleep.

174
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,783
What's going on?

175
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,703
Didn't he leave the Union?

176
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,997
Fuck.

177
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,874
What do you want?

178
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,213
It's nice to meet you.

179
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,093
I'm Geum Seong-je, you fucker.

180
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,264
Hey, Eunjang.

181
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,893
Just do as these guys say,

182
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,271
or else you really will die.

183
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,816
No.

184
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,443
What?

185
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,573
No!

186
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,917
These Eunjang bastards.

187
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,794
They're so fucking fun.

188
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,422
Okay.

189
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,466
Hats off to the romantic.

190
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,017
What the fuck is this?

191
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,019
Fuck!

192
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,312
Hey, are you okay?

193
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,439
That fucking asshole.

194
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,416
What happened here?

195
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,753
You got here quick.

196
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,176
Say hi to each other.

197
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,225
Hey, Jun-tae.

198
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,102
Hey, can you walk?

199
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,521
Get on my back.

200
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,369
I never thought I'd say this to you.

201
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,371
Thank you.

202
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,708
Fucking bullshit.

203
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,422
Are you really the top dog at Eunjang?

204
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,136
That fucking loser seemed
more of a top dog than you.

205
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,641
Same with the newbie,
Si-eun, from earlier.

206
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,603
I know.

207
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,315
You're right.

208
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,651
Thank you.

209
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,447
Let's go.

210
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,291
Fuck.

211
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,710
Seong-je did that?

212
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,213
Yes, okay.

213
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,558
You're here, Baek-jin.

214
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,352
Have you been well?

215
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,983
What are you doing here?

216
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,818
What am I doing here?

217
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,821
I'm teaching them some manners.

218
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,949
When I asked these bastards
to bring you here,

219
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,784
they protested and asked why.

220
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,078
Man!

221
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,248
They said you were busy,
and I should talk to them!

222
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,377
I took care of everything.

223
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,129
Don't worry.

224
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,297
Took care of it?!

225
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,219
No.

226
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,389
You failed to be in control.

227
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,602
How much longer do I have
to deal with calls from the cops?

228
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,232
I'll handle it
so they won't trace it back--

229
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,317
You fucking asshole.

230
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,086
My boy.

231
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,464
You've become a real boss.

232
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,176
You're putting on a brave face
for the boys.

233
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,597
If I have to return…

234
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,267
I'll kill you.

235
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,747
Baek-jin, that son of a bitch.

236
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,625
He seriously crossed a line.

237
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,091
Tak, I'm fine. Put me down.

238
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,930
Jun-tae, are you okay?

239
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,434
- Yeah.
- Hey, what was all that about?

240
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,060
Why were you there?

241
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,395
The other day,

242
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,066
I ripped a page
out of Baek-jin's document.

243
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,821
I… took it to the police today.

244
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,157
Some Union guys caught me and took it.

245
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,369
Sorry.

246
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,331
You're also…

247
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,169
a total lunatic at times.

248
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,005
We're all total lunatics.

249
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,677
Si-eun is a total lunatic too.

250
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,516
What are you talking about?

251
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,228
Anyway, let's get you to a doctor.

252
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:41,813
- Okay?
- Okay.

253
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:44,858
But

254
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,402
I'm fine, seriously.

255
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,238
Let's visit Si-eun first.

256
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,285
Hey, Baku!

257
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,167
What are you doing? Let's go.

258
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,587
Yeah, let's go.

259
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,362
Hey! Na Baek-jin!

260
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,823
What's going on?

261
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,867
Does he mean Baek-jin in Class 2?

262
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,494
Baek-jin!

263
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,371
- What's that?
- No idea.

264
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:22,956
Na Baek-jin?

265
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,088
Let's keep it simple.

266
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,174
Come fight me, motherfucker!

267
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,720
Pick the day!

268
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,558
If Eunjang wins,

269
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,520
you have to disband that shitty Union!

270
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,063
You got it?

271
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,941
Let's put an end to it!

272
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,335
Gotak.

273
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,129
Eunjang

274
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,715
will fight the Union.

275
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,639
Hey, we're seriously fucked!

276
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,433
- What?
- What is it now?

277
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,310
Baku is going to fight the Union.

278
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,062
He's looking for people.

279
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:31,358
- But the Union is quite tough.
- Sounds like trouble.

280
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,984
Those guys must be crazy.

281
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,027
They set a date.

282
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,820
What the heck are you on about?

283
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,697
It's all over the school.

284
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:42,118
<i>Baku went to Yeoil High</i>
<i>and freaking called Na Baek-jin out.</i>

285
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,621
<i>Testing.</i>

286
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,705
It's me, Gotak.

287
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,249
<i>You've all heard the news, right?</i>

288
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,543
<i>Aren't you fucking tired</i>

289
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:54,798
<i>of those Union assholes picking fights</i>
<i>with anyone wearing our uniform?</i>

290
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,385
Welcome back, brother.

291
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,136
<i>I might not be smart,</i>

292
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,889
<i>but I heard this from someone.</i>

293
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,476
<i>Newton's whatever says</i>

294
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,312
<i>that action is followed by reaction.</i>

295
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,732
<i>Let's show them what we've got!</i>

296
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,861
So please help us just this once.

297
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,574
<i>What?</i>

298
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,536
Do you think I'll lose?

299
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,807
- EUNJANG HIGH, LET'S GO
- BAKU-

300
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,645
YEON SI-EUN

301
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,318
We talked about guilt before.

302
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,114
I want to apologize.

303
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:04,951
To you.

304
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,247
To Gotak and Jun-tae.

305
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,378
And maybe even…

306
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,383
to Baek-jin.

307
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:26,890
Hey.

308
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,106
I'm sorry.

309
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,112
Hey.

310
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,453
I'm sorry about before.

311
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,040
You should…

312
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,210
say hi to Si-eun.

313
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,558
He's going to be fine.

314
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,062
The doctor said

315
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,773
he's just sleeping.

316
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,984
What?

317
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:24,113
He wasn't hit too hard by the truck.

318
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,617
He fainted because of a shock
to his nervous system.

319
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,620
So Si-eun's body

320
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,165
went into a deep sleep

321
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,835
in order to recover.

322
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,839
Actually,

323
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,968
he's been unable to sleep for a while.

324
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,016
But as to when he wakes up…

325
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,854
that depends on Si-eun's will.

326
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,362
<i>Beom-seok.</i>

327
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,117
I have to go.

328
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,418
To your friends?

329
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,714
You'll get hurt again.

330
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,049
Have you forgotten?

331
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,801
- Beom-seok!
- Si-eun.

332
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,438
Are they more important to you than me?

333
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,401
Well?

334
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,905
Tell me.

335
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,418
Beom-seok.

336
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,339
I have to go…

337
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,218
to my friends…

338
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,305
and to Su-ho.

339
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,101
Si-eun!

340
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,727
Si-eun.

341
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:01,562
My goodness.

342
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,982
Wait here. I'll get the doctor.

343
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,734
Don't move. You can't move yet.

344
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,319
I have to go.

345
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,532
I have to go to Su-ho.

346
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:17,954
I have to go.

347
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,583
I have to go to Su-ho.

348
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,921
Si-eun.

349
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,131
I have to go.

350
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,799
Si-eun.

351
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,302
Yeon Si-eun.

352
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,149
He's fine.

353
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,195
Your friend.

354
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,074
I heard he's okay.

355
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,791
<i>Su-ho's grandmother.</i>

356
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,421
<i>She kept calling your phone.</i>

357
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,131
<i>So I answered.</i>

358
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,343
<i>Your friend Su-ho</i>

359
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,597
<i>had an unstable pulse.</i>

360
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,018
<i>His grandmother couldn't answer the phone,</i>

361
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,145
<i>so the hospital called you.</i>

362
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,608
<i>She said she was sorry</i>

363
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,402
<i>and everything is fine now,</i>

364
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,447
<i>so you don't have to worry.</i>

365
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,530
Su-ho.

366
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,627
I'm sorry I'm late.

367
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,346
<i>I had forgotten…</i>

368
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,351
<i>everything you taught me.</i>

369
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,774
<i>That it is great to have friends.</i>

370
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,194
<i>That it is great to laugh.</i>

371
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,872
<i>What you did for me…</i>

372
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,590
<i>I'll try to do for others.</i>

373
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,043
Si-eun.

374
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,794
Hey, how do you feel?

375
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,421
Are you okay?

376
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,217
Yeah.

377
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,010
Probably.

378
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,730
I thought that…

379
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,442
something serious would happen.

380
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,197
So I'm really glad.

381
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,493
Hey, Jun-tae.

382
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,788
A man shouldn't cry
over something like this.

383
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,456
Si-eun woke up.

384
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,458
- It's all good now, right?
- Yeah.

385
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,877
There's nothing to cry about.
No more tears!

386
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,339
Didn't you cry yesterday?

387
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,468
Me?

388
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,513
I did?

389
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,061
I haven't cried since the second grade.

390
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:55,940
I just have really dry eyes.
My eyes were open too long. That's all.

391
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,859
Man, you crybaby. Did you cry again?

392
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,654
- I didn't.
- Si-eun, don't worry.

393
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,699
- He cries all the time.
- I didn't cry, jerk.

394
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:05,616
So…

395
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,328
what happened?

396
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,582
With what?

397
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,090
Na Baek-jin.

398
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:22,289
