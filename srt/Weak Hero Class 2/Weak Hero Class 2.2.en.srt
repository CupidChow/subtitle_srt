1
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,052
You're too loud.

2
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,141
What?

3
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,311
Don't cross the line.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,234
He's crazy.

5
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:31,948
Today's the day.

6
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,117
Hey, today's the day!

7
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,536
Yeon Si-eun, you asshole.

8
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,455
I've been fucking easy on you.

9
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,665
Did you know that? You had no idea, right?

10
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,024
That must have hurt!

11
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,508
Hey, you can take a punch. You really can.

12
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,010
Fuck you!

13
00:01:56,199 --> 00:02:01,371
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 2

14
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,595
MAKE IT TO THE TOP, BAKSAL

15
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,013
Tell me about it.

16
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,516
He's only suspended.
Why can't he be in the tournament?

17
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,393
It's not like he was expelled.

18
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,439
Baku's the captain.
Captains shouldn't get into fights.

19
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,356
Hey.

20
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,860
Didn't I tell you
that he didn't get into fights?

21
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,195
That's right.

22
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,906
I doubt it was a fight.

23
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,742
Probably more like a massacre.

24
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,493
Yeah, I bet he beat their asses.

25
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,329
Probably hurt like hell.

26
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,206
Are they still alive?

27
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,708
Are you fucking serious?

28
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,085
- Seriously?
- Come on. Damn.

29
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,462
- Hey.
- Such a short fuse.

30
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,838
I can't take this.

31
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,256
I'll speak to the teacher.

32
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,217
We have to play in that tournament.

33
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,843
Hey, don't do it!

34
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,345
Hey, Hyun-tak!

35
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,556
Let go of me!

36
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,558
Hey! Choi Hyo-man has fucking lost it!

37
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,893
They're fighting now!

38
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,228
Hey, come on. Hurry!

39
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,896
This is gonna be fucking fun!

40
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,481
What the fuck is going on?

41
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,691
Choi Hyo-man?

42
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,610
That son of a bitch.

43
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,696
He must be bullying someone
since Baku's not here.

44
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,532
I thought it was a bit quiet.

45
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,121
This is driving me nuts. Shit.

46
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,581
Fight! There's a fight!

47
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,166
I can't see!

48
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,252
I can't see anything. Move.

49
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:13,878
Hey, move it.

50
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,172
- Why?
- Out of the way. Move.

51
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,652
Hey, you can take a punch. You really can.

52
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,115
<i>Wait for his shoulder to open up.</i>

53
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,165
Fuck!

54
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:55,753
Fuck!

55
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,089
Fuck!

56
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,345
Hey. Are you kidding me?

57
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,889
Fucking asshole.

58
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,224
Hey.

59
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,603
What the fuck are you looking at, asshole?

60
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,605
What the hell are you trying to do?

61
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:16,858
Hey.

62
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,195
- What are you doing, fucker?
- Hey!

63
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,955
Hyo-man, you fucking moron.

64
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,041
Is this fun for you?

65
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,627
Yeah, really fucking fun.
So just beat it. I'm busy right now.

66
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,714
Busy, my fucking ass. You don't look busy.

67
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,343
Do I have to beat it when you say so?

68
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,721
You look worn out.
Take a breath before you speak, loser.

69
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,722
"Loser"?

70
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,850
You're the loser. Baku's lackey.

71
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,102
Are you cosplaying as Baku or what?

72
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,439
What the fuck?

73
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,443
What did you just say?

74
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,697
Say it again.

75
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,700
Fuck.

76
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,330
You're Baku's lackey. Happy now, asshole?

77
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,415
If Baku didn't have your back--

78
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,009
Hyo-man.

79
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,346
I can take you down in one second, fucker.

80
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,847
So now what?

81
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,183
Should we go to the gym?

82
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,147
The fucking gym?

83
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,733
The floor's slippery there.

84
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,819
I'll take you down soon, fucking idiot.

85
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,821
You too, motherfucker!

86
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,989
Move, damn it.

87
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,410
He said move it, damn.

88
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,327
Don't laugh.

89
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,831
- Gotak's second toughest after Baku!
- Shut your mouth.

90
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,418
That was cool, Gotak! Nice job!

91
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,377
Hey, look.

92
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,171
Don't thank me. That'd be cringe.
But next time, you…

93
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,857
Let's go to the nurse's office.

94
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,206
Hey.

95
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,001
Well,

96
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,171
it wasn't like I had to hear a thank-you.

97
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,131
But this?

98
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,718
Are you ungrateful or just a jerk?

99
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:50,928
Yeah.

100
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,472
Thanks.

101
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,232
What's with that punk?

102
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,665
What are you doing?

103
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,543
We're going to see the nurse.

104
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,839
We can't go to the nurse's office.

105
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,981
Whenever we…

106
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,610
go there,

107
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,364
the nurse realizes what's happened,

108
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,368
so Hyo-man gets called
to the teachers' office all the time.

109
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,288
And we just get beaten up again.

110
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,166
It's an endless cycle.

111
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:10,716
Fucidin cream is
pretty much an antibiotic.

112
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,678
If you think you could get an infection,

113
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,181
you have to use… Fucidin.

114
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,059
Because

115
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,398
Hyo-man's fists are like balls of germs.

116
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,943
Why did you do it?

117
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,239
What?

118
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,034
Why did you return all the phones?

119
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,583
Newton's third law.

120
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,962
"For every good action,
a good reaction follows."

121
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,010
That's not what it means.

122
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,640
Jun-tae, are you okay?

123
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,434
Jun-tae-<i>kun, </i>are you all right?

124
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,977
Jun-tae-<i>kun.</i>

125
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,564
It was a close call for me today.

126
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,526
My vision went dark, then back to normal.

127
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,778
However,

128
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,365
I think the pancake mouth guard saved me.

129
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,035
I see.

130
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:24,624
One day, Hyo-man, I shall claim your life
with my Nichirin Sword.

131
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,042
It's not the time yet.

132
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:26,959
He's right.

133
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,170
Is it?

134
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,178
Fuck, man.

135
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,138
- NO FIGHTING
- BAKU-

136
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,474
It was a blast to finally see
a fight at Eunjang.

137
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,475
A fucking blast!

138
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,517
- Right.
- Seriously.

139
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,727
You know what?

140
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,438
- You can't really call that a fight.
- Why not?

141
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,858
Si-eun didn't even throw a punch.
You call that a fight?

142
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,152
But he could really take a beating!

143
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,153
Yeah!

144
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,780
And that Si-eun asshole,

145
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,615
his eyes are weird.

146
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,368
- He looks like a fucking lunatic!
- Totally!

147
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,205
After seeing that,
I reckon the rumors about him are true.

148
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,625
Now I know why Hyo-man was avoiding him.

149
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,585
- Seriously, man.
- Man, I love that dude.

150
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,045
Love him? I can fight too.

151
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:11,962
Bullshit.

152
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,547
I'm a fucking good fighter.

153
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,384
No, seriously, I can dodge every hit.

154
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,343
Hey, guys.

155
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,887
What are you on about?

156
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,931
Why did Hyo-man avoid Si-eun?

157
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,891
Well,

158
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,227
have you been living under a rock?

159
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,645
Hey, tell me about it.

160
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:35,152
Remember how Si-eun had beef with Hyo-man
right after he transferred here last year?

161
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,237
Yeah.

162
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,449
So Hyo-man called
all around Si-eun's old neighborhood.

163
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,369
You know, to find out about him.

164
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,538
And?

165
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,789
And fuck, man!

166
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,208
He seriously injured some kids!

167
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,712
He hit them on the head with a dumbbell
and stabbed them in the neck!

168
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,590
It's a fucking legend there.

169
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,593
Explains why Hyo-man's all talk
but won't lay a finger on Si-eun,

170
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,637
even though that makes
him look like a wimp.

171
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,222
<i>- That's right.</i>
- Fuck!

172
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,477
That's ridiculous.

173
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,563
What a bunch of bullshit.

174
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,689
It's true!

175
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,774
Si-eun's grades are fucking good.

176
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,151
So why's he at Eunjang?

177
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:19,238
After that nasty-ass incident,
no other schools would take him.

178
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,285
<i>Let's go to the nurse's office.</i>

179
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,246
Hey.

180
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,502
Yeah.

181
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:34,837
Thanks.

182
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,507
Hey, guys.

183
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,635
Let's not talk shit about him
when we don't know the facts.

184
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,471
Okay?

185
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,515
You guys reek of smoke.

186
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,684
Man, I'm cool.

187
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,187
- Fucking ridiculous.
- Is he triggered or something?

188
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,271
Cut it out.

189
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,908
What's your deal?

190
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,577
What?

191
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,953
I said, what's your deal?

192
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,041
Just get going.

193
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,635
Hyo-man must be fucking humiliated.

194
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,887
Wait, maybe I could beat him up.

195
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,971
Bullshit, you punk.

196
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,681
- I might seriously win!
- No way.

197
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,599
Hey.

198
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,984
What did that asshole Gotak say?

199
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,364
Oh, not too much.

200
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,951
He just said that Si-eun

201
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,621
didn't seem to be a psychopath
like all the rumors said.

202
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,542
He told us not to talk shit
behind his back.

203
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,587
- Gotak took his fucking side.
- Yeah.

204
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,548
That fucker, acting all nice.

205
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:12,977
<i>Ungrated? Ungreat? Ungrate?</i>
<i>What was that fucking word again?</i>

206
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,520
Hey.

207
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,481
- Yeah?
- Do you know what this feels like?

208
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,191
- What?
- What?

209
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,404
When you cover for someone,
and they stab you in the back.

210
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,242
That's real fucking annoying.

211
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,160
Right?

212
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,207
Si-eun!

213
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,672
Well…

214
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,176
Here's some lutein and magnesium.

215
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,138
Lutein is good for your eyes
when you study.

216
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,391
Magnesium can help you sleep better.

217
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,314
You seem to sleep a lot at school.

218
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,989
Thanks for today.

219
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,368
See you tomorrow at school.

220
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,334
<i>What's your first hot tip?</i>

221
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,462
<i>Well, above all, sleep is very important.</i>

222
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:25,799
<i>If you don't get enough sleep,</i>
<i>you'll have trouble thinking,</i>

223
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,053
<i>even with things you normally know well.</i>

224
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,971
<i>You need to get a good night's sleep.</i>

225
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,723
<i>That's the most important thing.</i>

226
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:39,355
<i>That's right. I remember trying</i>
<i>to force myself to sleep before the CSAT.</i>

227
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,233
<i>But forcing it</i>
<i>just made it harder to sleep.</i>

228
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,069
<i>Any tips for falling asleep?</i>

229
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:49,281
<i>In my case,</i>
<i>it was before the mock test in June.</i>

230
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,492
<i>- I really couldn't sleep.</i>
<i>- I see.</i>

231
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,411
<i>I was so sleepy the next day</i>
<i>when I took the mock test.</i>

232
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,041
<i>After that, any time I couldn't sleep,</i>
<i>I took a nice warm bath…</i>

233
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,693
Aren't you tired today?

234
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,445
You're not sleeping through lunch.

235
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,785
What you gave me seemed to work.

236
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,329
What?

237
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,415
The magnesium?

238
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,292
Thanks.

239
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,629
Don't mention it.

240
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,592
Right, Si-eun. Do you take multivitamins?

241
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,138
I have a great one. You should try it
when we go back to class.

242
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,391
It's important to take vitamins every day.

243
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,477
It's good to take them
30 minutes after a meal,

244
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,022
then it won't strain your stomach.

245
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,356
If you keep taking it--

246
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,649
Your mouth is full.

247
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,403
Why don't you swallow first?

248
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,073
Right. Yes, sir.

249
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,290
Ungrateful.

250
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,209
Ungrateful.

251
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,343
It's strange.

252
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:41,935
I've never had such a peaceful lunch.

253
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,520
I'm a little anxious.

254
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,072
Hey, friends!

255
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,657
You're here!

256
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,951
I looked for you guys for ages.

257
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,746
My goodness!

258
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,705
Hello there.

259
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,751
Si-eun, sorry about yesterday.

260
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:09,088
I have some
serious anger management issues.

261
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,839
Hey, I'm sorry. Seriously.

262
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,258
Mr. Jun-tae. I'm really sorry, okay?

263
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,135
Okay.

264
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,848
Hey, get your hand off me.

265
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,685
Okay, I get it.

266
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,897
But really? I came to apologize,
and you're like that?

267
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,275
Well, there is something else.

268
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,611
See that punk in blue there?

269
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,531
The one who butted in yesterday?

270
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,283
That's Go Hyun-tak.

271
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,995
He thinks he's something,
being part of the basketball club and all.

272
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,374
But that's all for show.
He's actually a total scumbag.

273
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,876
Having said that…

274
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,421
be careful.

275
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,967
That jerk is planning to beat you up.

276
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,809
Hey. Nice job, Ju-seong!

277
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,647
You're this tall, man.

278
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,232
You could have blocked it!

279
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,150
Hey, take it.

280
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,362
What's that?

281
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,489
Why is Hyo-man with Si-eun?

282
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,241
Are they making up?

283
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,701
No way.

284
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,373
That son of a bitch keeps glaring.

285
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,584
You stay out of it.

286
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,348
Hey, just piss off. Don't come over here.

287
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,728
You were the one glaring at me.

288
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,065
Do you have something to say?

289
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,779
What are you doing with Si-eun?

290
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,365
I heard Si-eun was a big deal
at his last school,

291
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,410
so I thought I'd try being his friend.

292
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,120
Who knows?

293
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,665
Maybe he'll be a huge help
with killing you and Baku.

294
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,835
I should have done that
a long fucking time ago.

295
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,212
What did you say, fucker?

296
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,423
Oh no! It's school violence!

297
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,507
Let go of me.

298
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,142
Hey, Si-eun! I'll meet you
at the intersection later.

299
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,060
I'll call you.

300
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,897
Keep practicing your shots, guys.

301
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,961
Si-eun, I'm going to the restroom.

302
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,346
Jun-tae, come with us.

303
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,472
It's a new mission.

304
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,016
Yeah. Let's help Hyo-man a little. Okay?

305
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,521
You need to practice!

306
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,399
- You jerk.
- Height is all that matters!

307
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,776
- You never pass, dude.
- Ju-seong, you really suck!

308
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,819
Why didn't you pass?

309
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,112
Are you going?

310
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,571
You need practice.

311
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,740
I'm better at dribbling.

312
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,450

00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,763
What the fuck is wrong with him?

364
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:12,881
Now focus.

365
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,050
I'll tell you one last time.

366
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,887
Once they get worn down from the fight,
we swoop in. Got it?

367
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,097
- Gotak is our priority.
- Okay.

368
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,558
If we have time, kick Si-eun's ass too.

369
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,561
Now, repeat after me.
First Gotak, then Si-eun.

370
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,313
First Gotak, then Si-eun!

371
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,773
Yes, that's it. Good.

372
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,197
Si-eun, do you usually take this route?

373
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,285
Yes, why?

374
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,414
Well, this is the shortcut,

375
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,918
but you should go around it if possible

376
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:55,298
because thugs take money from other kids
and get into fights around here.

377
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,927
This is where I first met Hyo-man.

378
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,432
Thanks to Baku, things are quieter now,

379
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,434
but you never know.

380
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,314
The other way is a waste of time.

381
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,734
Well, that's true.

382
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:20,615
- EUNJANG HIGH, NO FIGHTING
- BAKU-

383
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,036
Hey!

384
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:29,958
Go Hyun-tak?

385
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,044
Fuck.

386
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,556
What the hell?

387
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,437
Who do you think you are,
messing up our clubroom, motherfucker?

388
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:51,896
Well,

389
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,150
there's been a misunderstanding--

390
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,985
Stay the fuck out of this,

391
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,071
or I swear I'll kill you.

392
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,580
Beat me up.

393
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,666
What?

394
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,252
You won't listen to us anyway,

395
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,504
so just beat me up.

396
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,090
You can do it too.

397
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,720
Fucking lunatic.

398
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,973
Hey, drop the fucking act, asshole.

399
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,644
I heard you killed a guy
at your old school.

400
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,646
Am I wrong?

401
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,442
Right.

402
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,112
You didn't kill him. You just crippled him

403
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:42,947
to a vegetative state.

404
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,619
Fuck, man.

405
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,664
You ruined someone's life.
Don't pretend you're a nice guy.

406
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,128
You fucking hypocrite.

407
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,983
Son of a bitch! Damn it!

408
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,807
Son of a bitch. Goddamn it!

409
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,610
Fuck!

410
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,530
Sneaky little asshole.

411
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,949
You bastard.

412
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,330
Gentlemen!

413
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,709
A while it's been since…

414
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,920
It's been a while, you bastards.

415
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,048
Were you two having fun?

416
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,718
Motherfuckers.

417
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,347
Mess them up!

418
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,403
Fucking asshole!

419
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,908
You fucker. What?
Are you going to stab me with that?

420
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,056
- Kick him! Bitch! Fucking asshole!
- Fuck!

421
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,102
Fucking asshole! Son of a bitch! Fucker!

422
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,938
Fucker!

423
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,026
Fuck, man.

424
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,113
You ain't shit, okay?

425
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,745
Everyone, freeze!

426
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,385
- Who is that punk?
- What the fuck?

427
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,595
- Isn't that Baku?
- That's Baku?

428
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,640
THE WAY TO YOU (SLAM DUNK OPENING)

429
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,754
Hey, Gotak.

430
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,757
Don't I look like Sakuragi?

431
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,095
Bullshit. Hey.

432
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,723
Is that hot sauce in your hair?

433
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,312
Hyo-mans!

434
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,149
What do you think, pal?

435
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,942
I'm like Sakuragi, right?

436
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,446
Well, I haven't read that manga yet.

437
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,450
Hey, anyway, about this situation?

438
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,745
It's definitely easy to misunderstand it.

439
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,707
Why?

440
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,682
<i>Projectile motion?</i>

441
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:24,437
<i>Horizontal distance is proportional</i>
<i>to the square of the velocity.</i>

442
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:57,929
And who are you?

443
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,431
I've never seen you before.

444
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,310
You've got a lot of guts.

445
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,254
