1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,387
Hey, move! Out of the way!

2
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:15,598
Hey, Yeon Si-eun!

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,645
Is it true that you're staying?

4
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:23,732
Yeah.

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,655
I heard Hu-min joined the Union.

6
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,366
And he's not answering his phone.

7
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,291
It's because of us, isn't it?

8
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,376
He felt bad for us.

9
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,214
He thought we were suffering
because of him.

10
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,636
But still,

11
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,848
we should bring Hu-min back.

12
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,064
Hey, Baku, Baek-jin told you
to make it quick and simple.

13
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,444
Is that him? From Hyeongshin?
He's a fucking poser.

14
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,779
This is gonna be fun.

15
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,198
Fuck, he's tall.

16
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,367
What the hell is up with his eyes?

17
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,994
He's acting tough.

18
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,163
Do you have a smoke?

19
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,338
- Hey, he hit Baku.
- It's a clean hit.

20
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:35,845
All done?

21
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,768
Fuck.

22
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,030
Shit, we're fucked.

23
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,448
Hey, what do we do?

24
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,750
Hey! Wait!

25
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,627
It's over.

26
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,093
Why?

27
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,347
What's over?

28
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,835
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 2

29
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:50,688
Great job.

30
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,634
What's this?

31
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,805
Give it to your father.

32
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,935
Are you a fucking charity?

33
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,062
I told you before.

34
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,356
He'll have to pay a fine.

35
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,861
You give me this…

36
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,783
to make me do more fucked-up stuff?

37
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,620
You'll take it anyway.

38
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,000
Does it feel better
when you talk like that?

39
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,379
How on earth…

40
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,301
did you end up like this?

41
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,564
Baku, where are you going?

42
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,735
What's with that punk?

43
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,306
Hey! Baek-jin!

44
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,183
Enough! That's enough!

45
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,352
You'll kill him, man!

46
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,938
Why did you stop me?

47
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,150
I learned it all from you.

48
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,888
It must be tough for Baku

49
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,432
to climb this every day.

50
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:37,730
That's why Baku's stamina
is so fucking high.

51
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,903
Hey, Baku!

52
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,574
Hey, Park Hu-min!

53
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,704
I told you he wouldn't be here.

54
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,417
Seriously, where is Baku?

55
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,378
Hey, brats.

56
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,631
What the hell?

57
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,758
Hello.

58
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,475
Mr. Park, how have you been?

59
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,187
How do you think?

60
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,610
Why are you here?

61
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,446
Oh, well--

62
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,658
When did Hu-min stop coming home?

63
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,580
Goodness, that senseless fool.

64
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,624
He didn't get enough beatings as a kid.

65
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,962
He's just like his mom,
so I never know what he's thinking.

66
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,464
Hey.

67
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,882
If you see him,

68
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:50,344
tell him to die out there
or come back and learn how to fry chicken.

69
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,598
Damn, that fucking imbecile.

70
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,977
Did Hu-min do something to you?

71
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,647
What?

72
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,777
Hu-min isn't a senseless fool at school,

73
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,113
nor a fucking imbecile.

74
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,366
He really cares about his friends,

75
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,702
and they like him a lot.

76
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,580
I don't think that

77
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,541
Hu-min is the problem.

78
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,169
I think you're the problem.

79
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,089
Hey, you little punk.

80
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,261
Get out.

81
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,723
Get out, you damn punks!

82
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,351
Yes, sir.

83
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,310
Get out now!

84
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,228
Let's go.

85
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,063
Please excuse us.

86
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,481
<i>See?</i>

87
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,566
I told you we shouldn't have come.

88
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,863
Baku used to stay at my place
whenever his dad got drunk.

89
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,449
Mr. Park was scary.

90
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,078
Na Baek-jin.

91
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,206
Why does he need Hu-min?

92
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,044
Didn't they used to be friends?

93
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,214
Yeah, they were fucking BFFs.

94
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,135
Back in middle school,
Baek-jin did nothing but study.

95
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,680
He couldn't even look kids in the eye.

96
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:19,809
And?

97
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,398
Baku taught Baek-jin

98
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,567
how to fight.

99
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,700
<i>I no longer teach anybody</i>

100
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,785
how to fight.

101
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,051
Yeah, it's lunchtime!

102
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,387
EUNJANG HIGH SCHOOL

103
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,145
You know Hu-min joined the Union, right?

104
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,439
So what?

105
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,068
I can't reach him.
Do you know where he is?

106
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,737
How should I know?

107
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,906
Even if I knew, why would I tell you?

108
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,743
I don't like the way you fucking talk.

109
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,787
Answer him while he's still asking nicely.

110
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,624
Goddamn it! You're just Baku's lackey.

111
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,334
You want to go? Now?

112
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,758
Okay.

113
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,010
Sorry.

114
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,139
So just tell us where Baku is.

115
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,977
You're nothing.

116
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,608
Well, he's probably polishing balls
at the bowling alley.

117
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,902
If not, he might be
at Daesung Motorcycles.

118
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,112
"Daesung Motorcycles"?

119
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,740
Man, you don't even know that?

120
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,954
Now…

121
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,957
First off, the bowling alley.

122
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,090
- Who's next?
- It's me!

123
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,594
<i>Na Baek-jin is a manager</i>
<i>at the bowling alley.</i>

124
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,513
<i>But it's just to launder money.</i>

125
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,139
<i>Launder money?</i>

126
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,224
<i>Money laundering.</i>

127
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,812
<i>The owner is some kind of gangster,</i>
<i>so he uses it to launder money.</i>

128
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,064
<i>He manipulates the sales</i>

129
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,567
<i>and hires Union boys</i>
<i>so he can inflate their pay.</i>

130
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,324
<i>The money from Daesung is also illegal,</i>
<i>so he launders that money there too.</i>

131
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,078
Daesung Motorcycles. What do they do?

132
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,206
Those crazy punks…

133
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,252
<i>They steal motorcycles, scooters,</i>

134
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,879
<i>basically any type of bike.</i>

135
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,842
<i>They repaint them, change the plates,</i>

136
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,927
<i>change the parts to make them untraceable,</i>

137
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,138
<i>and then sell them, yeah.</i>

138
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,643
<i>They also keep a list of everything…</i>

139
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,068
<i>make copies of the keys,</i>
<i>then steal the bikes back later.</i>

140
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,363
<i>Wait. That doesn't make sense.</i>

141
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,198
Won't it get reported?

142
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,992
Reported? You're nuts.

143
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,494
Hey, there's no use reporting it.

144
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,997
<i>They only use cash or burner accounts.</i>

145
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,540
<i>The gangsters might be</i>

146
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,624
in on it as well.

147
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,460
And the police?

148
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,920
I hear they turn a blind eye to it all.

149
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,383
Why do the Union boys work for Baek-jin?

150
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,260
That's so simple.

151
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,304
The pay is fucking good.

152
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,430
Just think about it.

153
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,807
Fuck, they do a few errands
for a few million won.

154
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,393
That's why those punks lose their minds.

155
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,313
And you know Baku is fucking poor too.

156
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,608
Fucking asshole!
What do you know? I'll kill you. Shit.

157
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,652
Let's go.

158
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,281
Hey.

159
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,619
What are you up to?
Are you going after Baek-jin?

160
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,045
I mean, you know,

161
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,673
I have some unfinished business
with that son of a bitch.

162
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,384
We could fucking join forces, yeah?

163
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,553
Get him when he's alone, yeah?

164
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,472
Gang up. Gang up on him, yeah?

165
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,017
Let's find and kill him.
Hey, should I make some calls?

166
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,605
Hey, Si-eun! Seriously, man.
Fuck, should I round up the boys?

167
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,484
We don't need your help.

168
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,070
What?

169
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,950
What a fucking idiot.

170
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,086
What?

171
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,631
What?

172
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,601
Hey, should we get a Union guy
and find out where Daesung Motorcycles is?

173
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,396
I think that's where Baku would be.

174
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,866
So… we can fight again and get hurt?

175
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:29,910
No.

176
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,248
Don't do anything yet.

177
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,209
I have a plan.

178
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,670
Please.

179
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,927
Hey, what's your plan?

180
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,847
Am I supposed to just sit around?

181
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,142
Who knows what
Baku might be up to right now?

182
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,023
Whatever.

183
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:27,051

What is this?

187
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,963
Go to that address and pick it up.

188
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,217
What?

189
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,052

<i>childhood friends.</i>

194
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,024
Damn, so close! Fuck!

195
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,068
You can't organize those, fucking idiot.

196
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,904
- Why not?
- Because we'll get in trouble.

197
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,197
It's fine.

198
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,658
Hey, isn't he that punk?

199
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,410
- What?
- Who is he?

200
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,953
Just a minute.

201
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,330
Hey.

202
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,124
What do you want?

203
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,918
Where's Na Baek-jin?

204
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,048
Hey!

205
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,182
- That punk is looking for Baek-jin.
- Why?

206
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,019
He's the guy that beat up
Geum Seong-je last time.

207
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:44,980
That guy?

208
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,986
Hey, are you the fucking lunatic
that beat up Seong-je?

209
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,365
I've been fucking curious about you.

210
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,494
Nice to meet you. Put it there.

211
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,621
Where's Baek-jin?

212
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,252
Why do you want him?

213
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,422
I have something to say to him

214
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,633
but nothing to say to you.

215
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,559
This guy really is a fucking lunatic.

216
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,396
Well, Baek-jin is coming soon.

217
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,606
Just wait a bit.

218
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,275
You can play a round if you're bored.

219
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,445
Hey, turn off the signs.

220
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,738
- Sure.
- We aren't open.

Tak, should we really be doing this?

223
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,165
Hey, let's just find it first.

224
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,128
I think this is the right place.

225
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,840
Is it that way?

226
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,634
No, I think this is it.
Daesung Corporation.

YEONGJIN INDUSTRIES

228
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,138
Then we can just go in.

229
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,973
- Come on.
- Hey, wait.

230
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,016
Is this right?

231
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,937
There is no Daesung Motorcycles.
This was the only place I found.

232
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,984
Don't you think
we should listen to Si-eun?

233
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:16,196
Hey, if we wait around like this,
will Baku return on his own?

234
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,701
We have to do something.

235
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:29,751
Hey.

236
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,089
Just a minute. Hey. Slowly.

237
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,261
Motorcycles!

238
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,929
- Motorcycles?
- Tons of them!

239
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,347
Just a second.

240
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,518
Hey. Shit, why are you so heavy?

241
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,604
You're so heavy, man.

243
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,315
This is it! The Daesung Corporation sign!

244
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,317
- Is this the right place?
- I think so.

245
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:58,989
Are you okay?

246
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,617
Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, did you see it?

247
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,037
- Yes, the sign said "Daesung Corporation."
- Good job.

248
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,955
Then let's wait nearby.

249
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm sure if we wait long enough,
we'll see Baku.

250
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,252
Good job. Okay.

251
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,378
- Okay.
- Nice job.

Nope.

What is it?

261
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,562
Hey.

262
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,940
What's gotten into you?

263
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,239
Hey.

264
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,493
Hey, Park Hu-min! I know you're in there.

265
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,954
Come out, you punk!

266
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,414
Union guys might be inside.

267
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,958
No way. We haven't seen anyone for hours.

268
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,586
Hey, Baku!

269
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,505
Park Hu-min! Hey, Baku!

270
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,384
I don't think he's here.
Let's get out of here and rethink this.

271
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,387
Let's go in.

272
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,891
Go in here?

273
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,812
No, Tak! What are you going to do?

274
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,232
Hey, this guy has some freaking balls.

275
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,942
He fucking came here alone.

276
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,611
Hey, Baek-jin.

277
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,822
Yeah. All right.

278
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,079
Okay. Understood.

279
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,582
Let's go.

280
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,336
Hey, let's go.

281
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,297
- Keep an eye on the place.
- Yes, brother!

282
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,511
Just wait a bit.
Baek-jin will be here soon.

283
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,769
You really need to lose weight.

284
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,521
- You got it?
- Wait.

285
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,899
Hey, I did it!

286
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,442
I did it!

287
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,820
Hey, are you okay?

288
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,781
- I'm coming.
- Okay.

289
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,916
What's all this?

290
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,049
- Go see what's up there.
- What?

291
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,011
Hey, Baku.

292
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:51,930
Park Hu-min!

293
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,520
Tak, he's not over here.

294
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,232
- That's Baku's underwear!
- What?

295
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,692
The tiger briefs. There!

296
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,027
- What?
- Baku's briefs.

297
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,988
- Those are Baku's?
- Yeah, they are.

298
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,322
Shit.

299
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,579
- So he really was here.
- Tak.

300
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,247
- Tak.
- What is it?

301
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,707
Those papers there.

302
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,376
Isn't that what Hyo-man was talking about?

303
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,796
Evidence of Na Baek-jin's crimes
or something?

304
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,175
Yeah, I think you're right.

305
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,095
- Hey, Jun-tae.
- Yes?

306
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,513
I can't let this go.

307
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,980
What are you doing?

308
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,274
Move over a bit.

309
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,443
- No, don't do it!
- We have to look.

310
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,527
- It's fine.
- Hey!

311
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,045
- Hello, brother.
- Hello.

312
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,297
- Go outside.
- Yes, brother.

313
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,444
I didn't expect to see you again.

314
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,367
There's one thing I don't get.

315
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,538
I don't know why
a top student with scholarships

316
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,414
is caught up in Union stuff

317
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,168
and commits crimes to earn money.

318
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,463
There must be a reason.

319
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,885
I don't know the reason.

320
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,014
But Hu-min does, doesn't he?

321
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,064
Do you think I'm doing this
because Baku knows everything,

322
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,192
and I'm scared of him talking?

323
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:11,861
No.

324
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,657
Hu-min knows everything about you…

325
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,078
so you think of him as your only friend.

326
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,334
However…

327
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,506
would Baku consider you his friend too?

328
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,157
My boys… will get there soon.

329
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,999
You said I had to separate
the variables, right?

330
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,754
But I realized there's an even better way.

331
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,303
If you remove the variables,

332
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:20,972
it's much faster.

333
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,905
Last time, Baku left here
to go save all of you.

334
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,658
Can you do the same?

335
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,504
Why?

336
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,423
Are you scared?

337
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,900
What are you doing?

338
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,570
I said, what are you doing?

339
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:22,951
Come on.

340
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,422
What the hell are you doing here?!

341
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,264
Hyun-tak and Jun-tae are
at Daesung Motorcycles.

342
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,058
Union members are on their way.

343
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,935
We need to hurry.

344
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:55,900
Fuck!

345
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:02,991
Park Hu-min.

346
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,337
Si-eun, you should go.

347
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,929
I'll be fine, so go.

348
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,493
And the goods?

349
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:49,996
"The goods"?

350
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:53,833
The bike?

351
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,253
I didn't steal it.

352
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,592
Do what you want…
to the people in my life.

353
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,260
What?

354
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,389
Do whatever shitty things you want.

355
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,019
This time, I realized that…

356
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,273
you and I will never get along.

357
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,734
So…

358
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,031
don't contact me again.

359
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,661
Let's go our separate ways.

360
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,556
Have a nice life.

361
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,076
- Find something, Jun-tae!
- Okay.

362
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,579
Do you really think we'll find anything?

363
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,746
Shit.

364
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:31,890
BIKE PURCHASE RECORD

365
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,808
DATE, PLATE NUMBER, BUYER
NUMBER OF TIMES SOLD

366
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,934
- I found it.
- What?

367
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,269
- You did?
- Yeah.

368
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,645
Let me see.

369
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,775
This looks like
a list of the stolen bikes they sold.

370
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,070
Won't the Union collapse
if we take this to the police?

371
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,865
Then all of Baku's problems
will be solved.

372
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,702
Hot damn, Jun!

373
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,790
Nice. Hey, take it. Let's get out of here.

374
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,335
- We aren't missing anything, are we?
- No.

375
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,341
- Hey.
- What's going on?

376
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,384
These punks got in through the window.

377
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,602
Hey, close the back door.

378
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,148
Hey, little rats. Did you have fun?

379
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,529
Jun-tae, stay back.

380
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,783
Come on, guys.

381
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:34,953
Get them.

382
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,330
You fucker!

383
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,635
Shit.

384
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,117
Damn it.

385
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,420
Hey, that's him, right? Baku's lackey.

386
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:27,922
Go Hyun-tak.

387
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,676
Jun-tae, are you okay?

388
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,744
Man, this punk.

389
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,450
Hey, move it. Move.

390
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,041
This fucking piece of shit.

391
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,752
Look at this fucker's eyes.

392
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:00,890
Are you okay?

393
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,524
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

394
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,694
Fuck.

395
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,074
- Jun-tae.
- Yeah?

396
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,451
- Stay right behind me.
- Okay.

397
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:21,869
Let's go.

398
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,124
Run, Jun-tae! Open the door!

399
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,917
- Okay!
- This fucking lunatic!

400
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,876
Get him!

401
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,711
Hey, hurry!

402
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,505
- Get them.
- Get the door open!

403
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,966
- Come here, crazy fucker!
- It's open!

404
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,219
- Gotak!
- Jun-tae, run!

405
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,679
- Run!
- You son of a bitch!

406
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,431
- Come here, asshole!
- Hey, you son of a bitch!

407
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,105
Hey, stop right there!

408
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,024
Hey! You fuckers! Son of a bitch!
I'll kill you once I get you!

409
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,527
- Come here, asshole!
- Hey, Jun-tae, run!

410
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,698
Those fuckers are fast.

411
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,824
What are you doing?

412
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,410
- Hurry up! Go over it!
- Fuck!

413
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,764
Hello?

414
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,267
<i>Hello? Is this Mr. Yeon Si-eun's phone?</i>

415
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,977
Yes, that's me.

416
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,813
<i>I'm calling</i>

<i>or any other family?</i>

421
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,537
