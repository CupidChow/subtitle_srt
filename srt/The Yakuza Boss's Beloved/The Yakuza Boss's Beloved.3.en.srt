Hmm... what do you think?

If I try dating

194
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:03,693
The specs were lower than I thought.

195

I guess so ➡

196
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:10,330

Actually, I've been in front of me ➡

219
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,528
I liked Director Odagiri.

220
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:32,495
Makoto-senpai is also me and the club manager ➡
