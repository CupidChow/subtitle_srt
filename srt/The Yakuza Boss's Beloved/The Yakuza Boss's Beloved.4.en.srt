Yeah~? Are you alone with us?

(Aina) The promised week ➡

194
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:04,000
I thought I had forgotten about it.

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,198
The manager

196
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,198
It's so as usual ➡

197
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:08,858
Conversely, I'm in too much despair

198
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:08,858
Maybe you're escaping reality?

199
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:10,891
I was thinking that.

200
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,726
If you continue like this, you will be fired.

201
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:21,429
Huh?

202
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:21,429
We're now beginning a full-scale investigation.

203
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:24,429
From the company directly to you

204
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:24,429
There will probably be a request for heirling...

205
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:26,495
wait a minute!

206
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,000
What is it? Suddenly.

207
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,000
That's so easy now➡

208
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,429
What about being fired?

209
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,429
There's no way it can be done.

210
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:34,693
That's right.

211
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:34,693
(Aina) That's right.

212
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:38,099
Unless there's a very serious reason.

213
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:42,000
This is that

214
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:42,000
It's a "very reason."

217
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:50,660
It's proof of information leakage.

Human resources will be contacted officially.

229
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:17,528
Until then, I'll be staying at home.

Hehe, as expected ➡

253
00:14:22,231 --> 00:14:24,660
Yakuza are not that easy.

262
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:44,627
It's probably synthetic anyway?

263
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:48,693
(Aina) No... This is true...

264
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:48,693
(Ishizaki) A shitty woman full of lies.
