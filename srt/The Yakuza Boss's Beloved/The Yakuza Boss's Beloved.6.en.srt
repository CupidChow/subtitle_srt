Nothing in particular.

191
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,561
You are

192
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,561
When you say you want to join the group ➡

193
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:35,462
I took you in

194
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:35,462
I regretted it.

195
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:39,594
In this world

196
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:39,594
It seems like it's dragged in.

197
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:43,594
But I watched your movements in the group.

198
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:48,231
on second thoughts

199
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:48,231
My own judgment was not wrong.

200
00:12:48,231 --> 00:12:51,066
I'll take over after me

201
00:12:48,231 --> 00:12:51,066
You're the only one ➡

202
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:53,099
That's what I thought.

203
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:57,594
What do you think?

204
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:04,396
My own judgment

205
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:04,396
Do you think it was right?

213
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:48,363
The police found out about your true identity.

214
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:51,825
Thoroughly

215
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:51,825
I'll probably mark it ➡

216
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:55,429
Also called Asaba Rengo

217
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:55,429
I'm aiming for us.

218
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:01,726
I don't have time anymore.

219
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:06,858
Whether or not to take over

220
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:06,858
Decide by 35.

221
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:08,924
That must have been a promise.

222
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:10,957
(Ryusei) Who is it?

223
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:15,660

It's okay now.

228
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,000
Just as the tiger said

229
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,000
I told Ren.

00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:55,297
I thought I might dislike him but ➡

234
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:58,231
I'm glad I believed it.

235
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,264
believe?

236
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:07,198
That's about him

237
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:07,198
How much do you know?

238
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,231
Huh?

239
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:11,561
Is it really a trustworthy person?

240
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:15,561
Ah... what's wrong?

241
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:18,792
Makoto is easy to believe.

242
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,231
Until I'm more confident

243
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,231
Maybe it takes time...

244
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:27,099
why?

245
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,594
I finally found it, finally...

About me

247
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:36,297
Someone who really cared for me.

248
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:38,396
Because Makoto doesn't know anything.

249
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:46,231
(Senzaki) Sorry... different.

250
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:48,264

I don't intend to give him any kindness.

It's not kindness.

284
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,594
Because I love Makoto.

285
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,528
(Senzaki) It's still today... and in the past...

286

Always give the answer.

287
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:11,264
Take responsibility too. So...➡

288
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:14,000
I just need a little more time.

289
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:33,528

00:18:36,858 --> 00:18:38,924
No, I'm pretty sure ➡

292
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:41,264
Ren married Makoto-chan ➡

293
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:43,528
I thought I was going to take over the group.

294
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:51,165
Hmm...

295
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:53,594
I wish they had said that.

296
00:18:56,231 --> 00:18:59,396
Because it's about lotus

297
00:18:56,231 --> 00:18:59,396
Let's protect the group together➡

298
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:03,429
Something like a promise?

299
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:03,429
You're probably worried about it.

300
