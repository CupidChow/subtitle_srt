00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:33,066
Ah, did you hear it?

377
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:33,066
Fudokai's coming and going ➡

378
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:35,099
It's been intense lately.

379
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:38,033
(Senzaki) Last few years

380
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:38,033
He was always quiet?

381
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:41,858
That's

382
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:41,858
Apparently he's been moving again recently.

383
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:46,198
(Senzaki) Whew...

384
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:46,198
Shall I check the list at the police station? ➡

385
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:50,924
Someone who came out of prison

386
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:50,924
It seems there are a few people there.

387
00:21:50,924 --> 00:21:52,957
I got it.

388
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,297
It's Fudokai...

389
00:21:58,297 --> 00:22:05,000

390
00:22:18,363 --> 00:22:23,627
Is it okay? Really. Even the cooking.

391
00:22:23,627 --> 00:22:27,396
Um... I'll stay with you ➡

392
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:30,363
at least

393
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:30,363
Let me do this much.

394
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:36,330
From now on

395
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:36,330
I think I'll be looking forward to the meal.

396
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:45,429
♬〜

397
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:49,264
Even at the deep bottom of the ocean ➡

398
00:22:49,264 --> 00:22:51,297
There's light coming in.

399
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:55,528

400
00:22:55,528 --> 00:23:08,231

402
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:17,792
<<Light like that ➡

403
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:20,330
Maybe I found it≫

406
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:43,000
Is there anything I can help?

407
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,594
Look at reality. Even what I say

408
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,594
It's fine to listen.

409
00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:49,594
Maybe

410
00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:49,594
You might know what it is.

411
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,396
This is

412
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,396
If you feel like you shouldn't be born ➡

413
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:55,297
I wish I hadn't figured it out.

414
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:58,693
Original manga

415
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:58,693
"If your yakuza boss loves you"...

416
00:23:58,693 --> 00:24:01,759
In Mecha Comic

417
00:23:58,693 --> 00:24:01,759
It is currently being streamed well.

418
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm sure you'll also be using the original...

419
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,000
(2 people) Please enjoy.
