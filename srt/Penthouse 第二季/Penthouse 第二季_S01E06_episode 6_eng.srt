1
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,900
And now, to announce the results of the judges' decisions,

2
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,500
I'd ike to welcone Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin on to the center stage.
 Episode 6 

3
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,700
Let's welcome her with a round of applause.

4
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,690
Where on earth is Eun Byeol?

5
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,690
I saw her taking a bunch of pills earlier. What if she fainted somewhere?

6
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,640
- I don't see Bae Ro Na either.
 - The bronze award for vocal music goes to 

7
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,540
 Cheong Ah Arts   senior students, No Ji Ah and Cho Bo Mi. 

8
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,770
Why isn't Ro Na picking up her phone?

9
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,030
- The winners are being announced. 
 - Hey, be quiet.

10
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,640
The award ceremony goes on just fine without her. So will you pipe down already?

11
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,380
You did really great today.

12
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,200
You were totally cool.

13
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,310
Here.

14
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,110
Thanks.

15
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,610
Do you want to grab some pasta tomorrow?

16
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,710
I'll wait by the gate after school.

17
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,540
I'm busy tomorrow.

18
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,760
Then I'll wait until you come.

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,100
I missed you too, Ro Na.

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,740
The highlight of the 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

21
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,910
Given to the most divine voice

22
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,020
in vocal music.

23
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,040
The grand prize goes to...

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,100
 What I want is the trophy for the grand prize. 

25
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,740
 So, it doesn't matter whose name is in the envelope. 
   

26
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,540
 You just need to say my name. 

27
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,890
Student Bae Ro Na.

28
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,760
Excuse me! There, there, there!

29
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,800
Someone!

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,030
Someone is dead!

31
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,590
I'm telling you someone is dead!

32
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,700
 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival 

33
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,440
 Min Seol Ah. 

34
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,310
 I'm sorry. 

35
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,530
 That I took your place. 

36
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,270
 Forgive my mom. 

37
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,950
 You don't need to be sorry. 

38
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,270
Here, this, this way!

39
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,860
Down there! There!

40
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,080
- What's going on? 
 - Oh, my.

41
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,510
What's going on?

42
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,850
Oh my!

43
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,290
What happened?

44
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,010
What's that?

45
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,020
Oh, Ro Na! What happened to you?

46
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,120
Ro Na!

47
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,400
Ro Na, Ro Na, please open your eyes! Why are you like this?

48
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,560
You're scaring me. Please open your eyes! What's wrong, Sweetie?

49
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,070
Put her down, down, huh?

50
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,700
Do something! Please!

51
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,610
Please help my child!

52
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,230
Ro Na!

53
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,750
Hey, Ro Na! Can you hear me?

54
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,390
You've got to stay awake!

55
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,850
Ambulance! Ambulance, quickly!

56
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,490
Hurry, hurry!

57
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,420
Hello? Yes.

58
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,010
Send an ambulance immediately. Please hurry!

59
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,740
We're at Cheong Ah Arts School.

60
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,630
A child is hurt. A child

61
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,140
is losing a lot of blood—

62
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,450
Ro Na!

63
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,560
Oh my, Ro Na!

64
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,300
Min Hyeok. Min Hyeok!

65
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,090
No, no!

66
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,660
Don't worry. She's going to be okay.

67
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,800
Don't look.

68
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,980
She has no pulse, and she isn't breathing.

69
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,000
Step back, back!

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,120
- Someone  killed her. 
 - Ro Na

71
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,130
Ro Na, please!

72
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,500
This- a homicide. Isn't this murder?

73
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,440
Shut up! My daughter isn't dead.

74
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,070
Why should my Ro Na be dead?

75
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,060
Ro Na is still warm!

76
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,860
She's still warm!

77
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,120
Close the school gate right now!

78
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,220
Stop anyone from leaving  until the police gets here!

79
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,140
None of you will take even a single step until the police arrives!

80
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,980
What are you doing, not closing the school gate?

81
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,260
Yes!

82
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,270
What's this noise?

83
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,750
Fire! Fire!

84
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,980
Teacher, Students!

85
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,380
There's a person down here!

86
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,760
No, my baby!

87
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,460
No!

88
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,710
What about Eun Byeol? Didn't she go with you to the back?

89
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,950
I said not to leave!

90
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,000
Where did the fire break out?

91
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,900
No!

92
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,120
No!

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,020
Will she be okay?

94
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,750
I'll meet you up as soon as I can bring some order to the scene.

95
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,390
You'll be okay, right?

96
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,950
Hurry and go!

97
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,110
 911 Emergency Vehicle  

98
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,050
Be careful not to touch a thing.

99
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,700
Anything can be evidence.

100
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,400
Who is it there?

101
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,930
Aren't you hungry?

102
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,190
Can I get you anything?

103
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,730
No, I don't want anything.

104
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,610
How come did you lock the door?

105
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,190
Are you in a bad mood?

106
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,130
I said I didn't need anything! I'm fine!

107
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,370
I just need to rest a little.

108
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,220
I'm just exhausted.

109
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,970
Okay. Get some rest then.

110
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,670
No, no.

111
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,480
- Check the blood!
 - Here we go.

112
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,200
Get the defibrillator ready. Charge it to 120 joule.

113
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,920
Shot!

114
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,010
No.

115
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,700
Get the operating room open immediately and get a hold of the Neurosurgery Unit!

116
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,980
Quick, get her to the operating room!

117
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,750
Mommy is sorry. I was wrong, Ro Na!

118
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,810
Don't leave me!

119
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,480
Did anything come up?

120
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,450
So many people rushed out all at once.

121
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,580
In fact, it's going to be difficult to locate unique footprints and other evidence.

122
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,790
How long are they going to keep us in here?

123
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,370
We're busy people, you know!

124
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,200
If she were your daughter, would you say the same?

125
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,140
Someone would think she's your biological daughter.

126
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,920
What makes you feel so guilty that you want to run away without getting questioned? You're hiding something, right?

127
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,970
What did you just say?

128
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,180
Seriously!

129
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,140
Come on, you're an assemblyman. Do something!

130
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,670
Hey! Let go!

131
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,630
How dare you two treat an assemblyman in this way?

132
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,350
Chairman Ha, do you know what time it is now?

133
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,980
Let us go home already!

134
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:47,170
All the people in here are well known enough to be recognized simply by their names.

135
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,720
You shouldn't worry about any of us running away. And we're happy to answer any—

136
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,100
A child!

137
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,760
A child was hurt.

138
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,490
She is on the brink of death right at this moment.

139
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,910
I'm going to catch the culprit myself.

140
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,150
Whoever that may be, I'll pursue them till the end.

141
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,020
I'll bring them to the justice they deserve.

142
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:16,150
Not even a single ant can take one foot out of this room without an alibi.

143
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,420
So I advise you all to cooperate as best as you can.

144
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,070
I'd been in my seat in the auditorium since the moment the Festival began.

145
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,380
I only went to the bathroom once. You can verify that with the people here.

146
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,440
I, too, was seated  in the same row as my husband the whole time.

147
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,980
I heard you arrived first at the scene, Chairman Ju.

148
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,410
Is being fast a crime too?

149
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,530
And strictly speaking, it was the security guard who first came to the scene.

150
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,850
I ran there after I heard Security Guard Park screaming.

151
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,380
Every single one of us

152
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,300
saw each other in the auditorium. Am I right or what?

153
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,400
- Yes, that's true. 
- We even drank coffee together while the judges made their decisions, right?

154
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,180
- Yes. 
- We were together to the end.

155
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,320
Je Ni said Eun Byeol was nowhere to be seen in the waiting room.

156
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,840
Shouldn't you be looking into that first?

157
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,470
Now that I think about it, why haven't we seen Eun Byeol since earlier?

158
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,990
I didn't see her in the athletic field, either.

159
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,790
Eun Byeol wasn't feeling well, so she went home early.

160
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,310
Did you say she went home?

161
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,380
Did she go home without hearing who the grand prize winner was?

162
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,510
That doesn't sound like Eun Byeol.

163
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,460
She was a strong contender for the grand prize. She wouldn't have left even if she fainted.

164
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,690
I sure hope Eun Byeol didn't take her medicine on a day like today.

165
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,650
You all know Eun Byeol depends on the power of her medicine every time she performs, right?

166
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,640
She wasn't feeling well because of her nerves.

167
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,610
Don't tell me. Are you suspecting my  Eun Byeol?

168
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,640
No one should be ruled out.

169
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,740
Neither you, Ms. Cheon nor Eun Byeol.

170
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,440
Don't worry.

171
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,670
I'll check on Eun Byeol the moment I get home and have her undergo the questioning herself.

172
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,970
Your daughter, Eun Byeol, too.

173
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,190
Are you happy now?

174
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,640
Let's get the people with clean alibis go home first.

175
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,130
 No Entry 

176
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,520
It's the wing that came off the trophy which is the suspected weapon of the crime.

177
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,880
Did you say a trophy?

178
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,700
The victim had the marks of getting hit by a trophy once each on her shoulder and head.

179
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,320
Most of the blood loss occurred especially in her head wound.

180
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,130
Where is the rest of the trophy?

181
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,550
We were unable to find the rest of the trophy at the crime scene.

182
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,210
As a priority, we'll zero in on locating the crime weapon that's missing for now.

183
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,050
And I suggest closing the school for the time being.

184
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,100
With the authority I have as a chairperson, I'll do my best to cooperate.

185
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,490
Do you happen to know if anyone in school was on bad terms with the victim?

186
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,150
Seeing they deliberately set off a false fire alarm to remove the evidence,

187
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,290
I suspect it was someone who knew the school fairly well.

188
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,650
Is there anyone that comes to your mind?

189
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,230
How little do you think of  the great  Cheong Ah Arts School to say a thing like that?

190
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,900
Are you implying we might have tampered with the crime scene?

191
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,970
Nothing like that necessarily.

192
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,190
At any event, I ask for your cooperation.

193
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,080
We will.

194
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,820
Why are you being so sharp?

195
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,020
Do you really keep this up? Are you a cop or something?

196
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,820
Or are you Bae Ro Na's real dad?

197
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,840
Fine, make sure you find the culprit for Bae Ro Na's sake.

198
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,380
Spend all night searching high and low.

199
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,340
 Restricted Entry 

200
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,320
It belongs to Ro Na.

201
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,980
How is she? Did she wake up?

202
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,170
Are you  Bae Ro Na's guardian? The patient just woke up.

203
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,420
Ro Na?

204
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,620
Ro Na, it's Mom.

205
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,920
Come on, open your eyes.

206
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,830
Ro Na? Ro Na, Mom's here.

207
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,150
It's me, your mom. Can you recognize me?

208
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,630
Ro Na?

209
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,550
Who did this to you? Just who on earth did this to you?

210
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,480
Ro Na.

211
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,520
This is yours. You won the grand prize, Ro Na.

212
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,320
Hurry, you should get up soon and celebrate with me.

213
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,530
Be strong, Sweetheart. Okay?

214
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,290
Be strong. You can do this.

215
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,880
 It belongs to Min Seol Ah. 

216
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,300
 Give that trophy to Seol Ah. 

217
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:54,120
 I was so mean to you this whole time. 

218
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,990
 For that, I'm sorry. 

219
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,250
Ro Na?

220
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,620
Ro Na? Ro Na, wake up!

221
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,990
Ro Na! Ro Na! Ro Na! Ro Na!

222
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,630
Hello? Hello!

223
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,250
Somebody! Somebody, come quick!

224
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,300
Ro Na! Please wake up. Please don't die!

225
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,110
Ro Na! Mommy's here, Ro Na, please!

226
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,730
Ro Na, don't die!

227
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,640
Don't die! No, no!

228
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,530
- Ro Na! Don't leave me behind!
 -  I'm going to work on her.

229
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:32,050
It's my fault.  I must have been crazy.  I don't want anything.

230
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,440
Doctor!

231
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,190
- Yun Hui! 
- No! No!

232
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,070
Madam!

233
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,940
Ro Na! Ro Na! Don't die!

234
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,210
 Ro Na! Don't go! Mommy's sorry! 

235
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,240
200 joules, charge!

236
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,860
Ro Na! It's my fault.

237
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,000
No! Ro Na! No!

238
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,360
Why are you still up?

239
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,560
I had something to ask you.

240
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,210
About Ro Na,

241
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,860
did you do that to her?

242
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,900
What are you talking about now?

243
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,940
Why would I do such a thing?

244
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,950
Don't lie to me.

245
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,880
You had something to do with it, I'm sure.

246
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,980
When Min Seol Ah died, and even when Mom died, you acted as though nothing happened just as you do now.

247
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,150
Nevertheless, I know.

248
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,890
That both Mom and Min Seol Ah,

249
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,430
you killed them.

250
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,540
My mom!

251
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,030
Why did you kill her? Why?

252
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,420
Because you wanted to marry someone like her?

253
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,040
Or because she was Min Seol Ah's real mom?

254
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,220
By any chance, if you're doing something bad to harm Ro Na—

255
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,220
I never would've thought my son created such a ridiculous fantasy in his head.

256
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,860
How dare you speak that kind of bullshit to me?

257
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,350
Take your hands off of him!

258
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,600
Neither my brother, nor am I a thing for you. You have no business beating us!

259
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,350
Good timing. I had something to ask you.

260
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,890
Do you know whose necklace this is?

261
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,890
It's Eun Byeol's.

262
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,630
She had it on earlier when she was singing.

263
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,090
Why on earth do you have that with you?

264
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,680
It was on the floor in the auditorium.

265
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,890
You two, go to bed.

266
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,100
 Don't touch a thing. 

267
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,760
 Anything can be evidence. 

268
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,560
 - Assemblyman— 
- When you know I'm an assemblyman, do your job right! 

269
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,320
 Hey, do you know how much a bundle of spinach is? 

270
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,710
So, this belongs to Ha Eun Byeol, huh?

271
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,000
Where is it? I'm sure I put it in here.

272
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,850
Where did I lose it?

273
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,560
Are you in?

274
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,290
You're home late.

275
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,400
Something came up. Did Eun Byeol eat dinner?

276
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,880
She didn't eat. She washed up and went to sleep as soon as she came home.

277
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,010
Probably she didn't have an appetite because she was too tired. It's late, go to bed.

278
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:08,190
Anyhow, I don't see Eun Byeol's dress.

279
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,790
I'm sure she had it on when she came home, but it's not in her closet.

280
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:17,170
She must've put it somewhere! How's that important this late in the night?

281
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,330
Right. Get some rest.

282
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,130
No way.

283
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,830
It can't be my Eun Byeol.

284
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,290
It can never be her.

285
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,720
Director Do, how is Bae Ro Na?

286
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,580
What?

287
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,950
Are you sure there is no chance of her waking up?

288
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,720
Really...

289
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,470
Did you do that?

290
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:13,970
What are you saying? I was throwing it away because I was mad that I didn't get the grand prize.

291
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,130
Then what is this? The blood on the dress?

292
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:25,220
Tell me everything. Don't leave a single thing out. What did you do to Ro Na?

293
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,250
Is Ro Na... dead?

294
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,320
No, right? There's no way she would die.

295
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,940
She's such a tenacious person!

296
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,930
No, no. No. No.

297
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,970
Get it together and answer my question!

298
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,320
Did you do it?

299
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,740
Tell me, Ha Eun Byeol!

300
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,030
She kept taking my things.

301
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,920
She was always in my sight, and worse, she badmouthed you, Mom.

302
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,790
She said that you slashed her mom's throat.

303
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:04,640
That you lost to her mom.

304
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,340
But, honestly, I wasn't planning on killing her!

305
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,640
That's the truth. Please believe me!

306
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,650
It's ok. Just pull yourself together.

307
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,410
You've got to get it together, Eun Byeol!

308
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,310
Calm down.

309
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,640
It's all over.

310
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,560
I'm a criminal.

311
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,780
Probably the police will soon come for me, right?

312
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:42,630
No. I want to go to the police station myself and tell them everything.

313
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,640
That I did it.

314
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,100
College or singing, it's all over for me now!

315
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,380
Hey, I won't let your life messed up. Never!

316
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,500
I won't allow it! I, your mother will protect you.

317
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,240
Whether Bae Ro Na lives or dies,

318
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,060
that's not important. You just need to keep yourself not connected to the incident.

319
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,700
If anyone asks, just say you don't know anything. Understand me?

320
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,800
What if someone saw me?

321
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,800
The CCTVs are all over the school!

322
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:21,610
I'll take care of it. You don't have to worry about anything.

323
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,560
I'll get rid of this dress too.

324
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,800
Then all is fine. There will be no evidence.

325
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,530
The trophy.

326
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,880
Trophy?

327
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,210
Your trophy for the Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

328
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,430
Where did you put it?

329
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,230
In my locker.

330
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,870
What?

331
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,270
 Do Not Enter-POLICE LINE-Under Investigation 

332
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:38,320
 Another unfortunate incident occurred yesterday at a profit organization, Cheong Ah Arts School. 

333
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,400
  At the CAA Festival which is regarded as the most grand tradition of the school, 

334
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,670
  the female senior student who won the  grand prize 

335
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:49,210
  fell into a coma before she could even hold her trophy. 

336
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,670
  The police are focusing on the possibility of someone committing the crime out of hatred. 

337
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,880
  They'll narrow down to a suspect out of those who were present at school. 

338
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,730
  Cheong Ah's chairperson Cheon Seo Jin switched all classes to virtual learning, 

339
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,780
  and she expressed her wishes to cooperate fully with the investigation. 

340
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,400
There is significant damage to her brain. It doesn't look good.

341
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,240
You should prepare yourselves for the worst.

342
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,960
Yun Hui.

343
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,030
This won't do. I'll get you a hospital room, go lie down even for a moment.

344
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,470
I'm fine.

345
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,840
I've got to find the person who did that to my daughter first.

346
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,590
What did the police say? Have they not found any evidence at all?

347
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,320
They're still investigating. But not yet.

348
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,250
The culprit had to be at the school.

349
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,560
How is it that they can't find any evidence? That makes no sense.

350
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,950
It's strange that the fire alarm was falsely activated too.

351
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,490
I  can't trust the police now.

352
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,900
I need to go to the school myself.

353
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,010
What are you going to do when you're in this condition?

354
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,370
Let's trust the police and wait for now.

355
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,970
I asked someone I know to put in a word to the police.

356
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,610
They'll contact us as soon as they find evidence.

357
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,370
I really can't trust anyone.

358
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,200
I'll catch him myself.

359
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,340
Do you think I'll let the people alone who hurt my daughter like that?

360
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,870
Yun Cheol, what am I going to do if Ro Na dies?

361
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,010
What am I going to do if she dies?

362
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,800
I feel like I'm going crazy. What do I do, Yun Cheol?

363
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,920
No, no. My Ro Na.

364
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,840
Please save my Ro Na, Yun Cheol. Please.

365
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,150
Yun Hui, Yun Hui.

366
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,290
Yun Hui! Yun Hui, Yun Hui!

367
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,970
What are you doing? Call Doctor Jeong!

368
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,000
Bring a respirator!

369
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,730
  Su Ryeon, don't take my Ro Na. 

370
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,770
  Kill me, but let my Ro Na live. Please. 

371
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,270
  - Please. 
  - Breathe.  

372
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:59,090
 Don Giovanni a cenar teco by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 

373
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,440
 Stilnox (Sleeping medication)  
 M'invitasti e son venuto!

374
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,140
Don't think about anything and sleep.

375
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,990
Have you seen my cell phone?

376
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:02,180
I got rid of it, just in case. I'll get you a new one.

377
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,030
Don't answer the calls from your  friends for the time being.

378
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:15,410
Keep in mind. You're going to forget everything in the past.

379
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,060
When you wake up from your sleep, it'll all have gone out of you.

380
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,740
  Eun Byeol had it. 

381
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,560
  The evidence that you killed Eun Byeol's grandfather. 

382
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,700
  Did you like my video present? 

383
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,190
  Chairwoman, Cheon Seo Jin? 

384
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,460
  Which bastard is it? 

385
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,920
  Don't hide like a coward and show yourself!  

386
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,960
  So did you forget about it? 

387
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,990
 I mean my grandfather's accident. 

388
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,240
  What are you talking about? 

389
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,760
  I took the medicine because I missed my grandfather so much. 

390
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,650
 Explain to me in a way I can understand! 

391
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,830
  Authorized Personnel Only 

392
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,730
When did you get here?

393
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,320
Today.

394
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,260
How is Ro Na?

395
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,630
Is she still unconcious?

396
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,510
Cheon Seo Jin and Eun Byeol's movements are suspicious.

397
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,180
Tell me everything you know.

398
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,940
I took this picture at 5 a.m. this morning.

399
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,260
Where is she going that early in the morning?

400
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,110
With a bag in her hand.

401
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,700
The stranger thing is, she didn't have anything when she came back.

402
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,440
Furthermore, she came back with Cheon Seo Jin.

403
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,460
Then by chance...

404
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:10,050
The trophy... I need to get that trophy back.

405
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,560
It will be the end when that gets discovered.

406
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,590
The police just finished their investigation at the crime scene.

407
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,780
Are you sure?

408
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,750
Apparently, they came to a dead end in finding evidence since their initial investigation failed.

409
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,110
They are withdrawing from the scene, leaving only a minimum number of officers.

410
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,750
Cheon Seo Jin?

411
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,260
  Ha Eun Byeol 

412
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,280
Did you see that?

413
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,710
Ms. Cheon.

414
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,920
What are you doing here?

415
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:46,490
Well, what are  you  doing here at this hour?

416
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:51,680
Were you looking for something in the dark classroom with the lights off?

417
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,070
I'll say. I smell somthing fishy here.

418
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,320
What were you ransacking in there, like a thief?

419
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,420
What do you mean ransacking? Me?

420
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,500
What?

421
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,160
The locker behind you

422
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,970
seems like a perfect place to hide something.

423
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,550
Move aside.

424
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,560
There you go.

425
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,040
Hurry and open them. You start with the ones on the left.

426
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,210
I'll break open the ones from the right.

427
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,340
Wait!

428
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,570
I'll open Ha Eun Byeol's.

429
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:04,780
What the heck? There's nothing in here.

430
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,410
There's only a few  left.

431
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,920
It's here!

432
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,170
Whose locker is it?

433
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:47,480
Ju Seok Gyeong! I knew it.

434
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,480
Let's go grab this wrench.

435
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,910
Let's go. Hurry.

436
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,700
What are you doing here?

437
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,030
Let go! I said let go of me!

438
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,050
Do you know who my dad is?

439
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,920
I'm not going!

440
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,420
Dad, where are you? Seok Gyeong is...

441
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,010
Seok Gyeong is being dragged away!

442
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,300
What happened to your hand?

443
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,990
I was in a rush opening the lockers.

444
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,890
How did you know?

445
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,180
Eun Byeol called me.

446
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,420
Were you the one who rang the fire alarm?

447
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,090
No.

448
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,490
I couldn't even imagine then.

449
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,570
Is it really Eun Byeol?

450
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:02,340
Did our Eun Byeol really do that to Ro Na?

451
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,780
She didn't, right?

452
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,890
I don't want to believe it either.

453
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,820
Why didn't you tell me sooner? You should've told me first!

454
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,950
How could I?

455
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:17,020
You're Oh Yun Hui's husband now.

456
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,670
I can't believe it. How could she?

457
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,640
How could my Eun Byeol do something like that?

458
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,180
It's already happened.

459
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,690
Even if you don't want to believe it, you have to accept it.

460
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,240
No, no way.

461
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,550
This can't be happening.

462
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,880
You were the one who put the trophy in Seok Gyeong's locker.

463
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,580
That means you don't want Eun Byeol to be arrested either.

464
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,050
As her dad, all you did was disappoint her all the time.

465
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,940
Will you just watch as your daughter's life is getting ruined?

466
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,770
They'll find out Seok Gyeong isn't the true culprit soon enough!

467
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,250
So get it together!

468
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,760
Yun Hui is never going to give up.

469
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,220
She's going to keep searching until she finds the real culprit.

470
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:10,250
In the end, she's going to find out it's Eun Byeol.

471
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,040
When that happenes, our child's life is over.

472
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:21,800
Save her. The only person who can save our Eun Byeol

473
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,640
is you.

474
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,760
Eun Byeol's dad, please.

475
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,590
What do you want me to do?

476
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,690
I can't do it anymore.

477
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,210
I feel sorry for Yun Hui.

478
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,940
Seeing Ro Na  in the hospital bed like that is driving me crazy!

479
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:54,510
I heard there's no hope for Ro Na anyway.

480
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:57,090
I heard it from Doctor Jeong.

481
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,980
That they'll declare her brain dead tomorrow.

482
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:04,140
If that's the case, shouldn't the living go on living?

483
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,670
What are you trying to say now?

484
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,030
There's only one way to make Yun Hui give up.

485
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,880
Making someone else the culprit while Seok Gyeong is buying time for us.

486
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,570
Cheon Seo Jin!

487
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,860
For me, right now,

488
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,830
Eun Byeol is the only thing I can see.

489
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:26,090
I'm only going to think about Eun Byeol. I'm her mom.

490
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,930
And a mom has the responsibility of protecting her child.

491
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:35,970
If something goes wrong with Eun Byeol, my life is over, too.

492
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,570
Damn it!

493
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,580
Why did you do that to my Ro Na?

494
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,680
Did you hate Ro Na that much?

495
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,100
Just hate me then! Why did you do that to Ro Na when she is innocent?! Why?! Why?!

496
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,070
Ajumma, are you crazy?

497
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:11,380
Why would I do such a thing?

498
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,610
- Why did you do that? 
 - What do you think you're doing?

499
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,790
Who are you to accuse my daughter of a crime?

500
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,480
You stay out of this.

501
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,340
Seok Gyeong tried to kill Ro Na.

502
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,300
A trophy with blood on it was found in Student Ju Seok Gyeong's locker.

503
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,670
It can be presumed to be the instrument of this crime, so investigating your daughter was inevitable.

504
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,590
A trophy?

505
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:36,590
We heard your recent relationship with Bae Ro Na wasn't good, because of the incidents of school violence.

506
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:41,410
You threw paint on her and even locked her in the bathroom.

507
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:45,040
- About that— 
 - That incident is completely different from this.

508
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,440
Seok Gyeong really isn't  the culprit. I can prove it.

509
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,180
Detective, the analysis of the fingerprints on  the trophy just came out.

510
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,500
There were many different fingerprints on the trophy,

511
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,190
but Ju Seok Gyeong's fingerprints were not found.
   No Match  

512
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,290
I told you. I said it wasn't me!

513
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,910
Someone put it in my locker to mess with me.

514
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,430
Who? Why?

515
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:16,880
It must be someone holding a grudge against me.

516
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,360
Seok Gyeong is not the culprit.

517
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,820
This is a photo taken in the waiting room right before the announcement of the grand prize.

518
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,940
Here, Seok Gyeong is clearly in the photo.

519
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,090
Will this be enough as conclusive evidence?

520
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:32,530
And who's missing in the photo?

521
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,630
They are Ro Na and Eun Byeol.

522
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:39,840
We estimate the time of the incident to be right before the announcement of the grand prize.

523
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,080
So it can't be Ju Seok Gyeong.

524
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,200
How dare you people tarnish our family's good name?

525
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,640
This is defamation.

526
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,240
I won't let this incident go unaddressed.

527
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,690
Let's go.

528
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:05,420
So Eun Byeol wasn't there.

529
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:11,910
I just remembered Ms. Cheon picking up a necklace at the crime scene.

530
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,650
A necklace? What did it look like?

531
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,220
It was very elaborate with a large gem.

532
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,350
I think it was a sapphire.

533
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,790
I can't remember it well.

534
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,790
Sapphire?

535
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,170
Didn't you know?

536
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:36,490
I thought she would've given it to the police as evidence, for sure.

537
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,600
Oh, gosh.

538
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,690
Yun Hui.

539
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:48,840
Why are you so surprised?

540
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,330
I thought no one was home. Didn't you go to the hospital?

541
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,860
I came to pack a few things.

542
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:00,020
Where did you go?

543
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:04,660
To the company. I had a lot of work stacked up because I couldn't go to work for a while.

544
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,640
How was your visit to the police station?

545
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,470
Seok Gyeong's fingerprints were not found on the trophy.

546
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:18,220
I see. No other evidence was found?

547
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,780
Seok Gyeong didn't do it.

548
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:26,760
Apparently, someone was trying to frame Seok Gyeong.

549
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,580
Who would do such a thing?

550
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,160
I know, right?

551
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,160
I'll go to be with Ro Na now.

552
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,800
You should rest at home tonight.

553
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,330
Sure.

554
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:01,630
Yun Hui, tell me if you get too tired. I'll take over at any time.

555
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:12,340
 It's not true, is it, Ha Yun Cheol? 

556
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:17,730
 You must never do that to Ro Na. You absolutely mustn't.  

557
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:26,250
 Ha Eun Byeol, why did you do that? 

558
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:29,990
 Why did you do that to me, Ha Eun Byeol? 

559
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,730
 Ha Eun Byeol? Why did you do that to me? 

560
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:37,630
 Come with me. 

561
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,300
Chairwoman isn't home yet.

562
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,290
It doesn't matter. I'm here to see Eun Byeol.

563
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:09,690
Eun Byeol isn't feeling well right now—

564
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,280
How are you feeling?

565
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,310
I heard you were sick. You really don't look well.

566
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,700
I'm alright.

567
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,980
But... what brings you here?

568
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:29,490
You heard what happened to my Ro Na, didn't you?

569
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:31,400
Yes.

570
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,740
I have something to ask you about.

571
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,500
Did you meet Ro Na just before the awards ceremony that night?

572
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,200
No.

573
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:46,290
I heard you and Ro Na were the only people who weren't in the waiting room.

574
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:49,480
So where were you then?

575
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,550
I didn't feel well, so I was in the nurse's office.

576
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,180
Really?

577
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,030
You did meet my Ro Na that night, didn't you?

578
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,820
Tell me the truth.

579
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,540
What happened between you two? Hurry and tell me the truth!

580
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,680
What do you think you are doing right now?

581
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,910
How dare you do that to a sick child?

582
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,630
Why is Eun Byeol sick, anyway?

583
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:25,910
- What? 
 - Eun Byeol is the only one who avoided the police station with the excuse of being sick.

584
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:29,100
So I came to ask her directly.

585
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,330
Ha Eun Byeol, answer me. You met with Ro Na that night, didn't you?

586
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:38,570
Tell me the truth. What did you do to my Ro Na? Hurry and tell me!

587
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,460
I don't know. I don't know.

588
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,460
Stop! Stop tormenting my daughter and get out right now.

589
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,880
Get out! Get out!

590
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,790
You better say what you did to Ro Na!

591
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:54,550
Come out! Come out!

592
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,990
Are you going around suspecting every kid in Hera Palace?

593
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,550
Seok Gyeong first, and now Eun Byeol?

594
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,260
Seok Gyeong has a firm alibi.

595
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,600
The only one whose alibi hasn't been confirmed is your daughter.

596
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,740
I'm sure the police will confirm it.

597
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:15,880
Ah, why haven't you returned Eun Byeol's dress yet?

598
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,190
What?

599
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:23,270
I went to the dress shop earlier, and they told me Eun Byeol's dress was the only one not returned yet.

600
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:25,350
Can I see her dress?

601
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,890
You've gone insane. Do I have to show even a thing  like that to you?

602
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:31,970
Yes, I've gone insane.

603
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,550
How could I be in my right mind when my child is lying in that state?

604
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:40,260
I will have to see that dress. You still have it, don't you?

605
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,840
Why? Do you think there may be blood on that dress?

606
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,370
You like things to be precise, too.

607
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,650
Where is the dress?

608
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,130
Teacher Jin.

609
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,580
Bring Eun Byeol's dress.

610
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,380
Yes, Chairwoman.

611
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:07,230
Here it is.

612
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:12,430
Delusional and suspicious.

613
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:16,840
If you have time for this nonsense, why not spend it nursing your child properly, instead?

614
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,450
Teacher Jin, see the guest out.

615
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,020
 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival 

616
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,610
 Make another one just like it and make sure I can pick it up tonight, no matter what. 

617
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,570
Yes, I understand.

618
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:17,000
Yun Hui even came into my house and demanded to see Eun Byeol's dress.

619
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,440
She's suspecting our Eun Byeol.

620
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,870
What will we do if everything is found out?

621
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,660
Please, please do something.

622
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,890
Find a solution, please.

623
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:02,080
 Gangnam Police, currently investigating the incident of Miss Bae of Cheong Ah Arts School, 

624
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,920
Noona!  Noona! 
 are focusing on Park who has just turned himself in. 

625
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,710
- Noona! 
 - What, what, what?

626
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,050
For goodness sake, stop yelling.
 ...was repeatedly humiliated  

627
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,580
I can't even go to the bathroom and pee at night.
 so became vengeful and on the day of the incident, impulsively... 

628
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,920
They're saying the real culprit turned himself in.

629
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,020
I'm talking about the culprit responsible for Ro Na's case.

630
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,640
What! Who is it?
  Park, the security guard for 20 years at CAA School 

631
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,780
The security guard with the sharp, smiling face. 
 On the day of the incident, an in-school festival took place. Looking for witnesses.  

632
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,210
You mean, Mr. Park?

633
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:29,230
That makes no sense. He's the nicest man I know. Why would he?

634
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:33,590
This is why you can't know what's in a man's heart.

635
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,730
Multiple Personality Disorder, something like that.

636
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,020
Though it took a while, it's a relief that the culprit is captured.
 Pretended to be the first witness in fear of people's suspicion 

637
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:46,040
If they didn't get the culprit, Oh Yun Hi and Ha Yun Cheol would've gone crazy

638
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,750
and pestered everyone at Hera Palace with their questioning.

639
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:53,730
Such a damned school. It shows no consideration for its seniors with their college entrance exams ahead.

640
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:58,570
Still, Mr. Park as the culprit  makes little sense.
  The life of the student victim is in danger. Police will reinvestigate  the crime scene. 

641
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:04,970
How could a man too scared to clean up a dead bird do such a thing to a person?

642
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:09,340
 What was your motive? A grudge or financial gain?
  

643
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:14,390
 I was repeatedly ignored and verbally abused by the child.
  

644
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:15,560
So I did it in a moment of anger.

645
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,050
 Are you claiming you committed the crime in the heat of passion? 

646
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:19,050
What happened?

647
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,280
How can the security guard be the culprit?

648
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,090
It's okay, Eun Beol. Don't think about anything.

649
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:26,270
Of all people, why does it have to be Mr. Park?

650
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:30,970
He was so nice to us.

651
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,350
When I'm this sorry for the man,

652
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:41,120
how am I supposed to live on?

653
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:46,590
 The Gangnam police investigating the case stated the culprit provided the evidence and the motive of the crime. 

654
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,510
 In the very near future, the police added 

655
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:52,120
Oh, Mister.
  that it'll make the results of its investigation public.  

656
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:17,730
Stop drinking.

657
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:22,980
Leave me alone. I can't go on like this without getting drunk.

658
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:28,100
Why didn't you tell me it was Mr. Park?

659
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:32,730
He was closer to me than my own father.

660
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:35,430
I know. That's why I'm doing my best.

661
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:38,460
His sentence will be reduced as much as possible.

662
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,270
I can't bear this feeling of being a monster.

663
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:47,200
I'm going crazy because I feel like this is all my fault.

664
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:55,230
You can mock me all you want. When this is how I'd end up,

665
00:56:55,230 --> 00:57:00,090
you probably want to curse me for having hidden Eun Byeol from you.

666
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:07,090
Yeah. You might have been right.

667
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:11,850
I can't stand myself either.

668
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:16,160
Stop drinking. Nothing's going to change with you being like this.

669
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:25,470
Every night, I dream of Ro Na waking up.

670
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,730
I'm so anxious I'm going insane.

671
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:34,690
If Bae Ro Na wakes up, everything will have been in vain.

672
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:39,190
Our Eun Byeol will get arrested by the police.

673
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,530
I'm scared. I'm so scared.

674
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:46,140
I'm so scared I'm going to die.

675
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:49,720
Eun Byeol and I will die because either of us can endure this.

676
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:02,360
Pull yourself together.

677
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,450
That's the only way we can protect our Eun Byeol.

678
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,250
What are you doing?

679
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:16,620
Can you really protect Eun Byeol?

680
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,940
I'm going to protect her with my own life.

681
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,190
Our Eun Byeol.

682
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:41,360
Even if that means you have to kill Bae Ro Na?

683
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,510
Answer me and say that you'll protect her.

684
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:53,430
Say that you'll never let Eun Byeol's life be ruined, no matter what.

685
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:57,000
If you can't do it, I will.

686
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,100
Even if I have to kill Bae Ro Na with my own hands,

687
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,560
I'll save my Eun Byeol.

688
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,290
Cheon Seo Jin!

689
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:07,830
It's because we lived our lives all wrong.

690
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:11,340
Both of us are responsible.

691
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,010
Even if there's one chance out of ten million of Ro Na's waking up,

692
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:17,180
because of that one ten millionth chance

693
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:23,050
not only Oh Yun Hui but we, too, can be made miserable.

694
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,960
Is that what you want?

695
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:39,220
 Yun Hui 

696
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,770
 Felony and Homicide Team 2 

697
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:59,180
Mr. Park, as it is,  we're completing our report of your case. Do you have any objections?

698
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,250
No, I don't.

699
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,440
Is it you?

700
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,460
Is it really you?

701
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:15,280
Did you really do that to my daughter?

702
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,200
I'm sorry. I committed a grave sin.

703
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,060
Why did you do it?

704
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:26,760
Why the hell did you do it? What did my daughter ever do to you?

705
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,050
Why the hell did you do it? Why? Why?

706
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,080
Why!

707
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,130
Tell me! Tell me!

708
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,690
Please calm down.

709
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:36,620
If something happens to Ro Na, I'll never forgive you.

710
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:39,820
I'll kill you!

711
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:42,590
I'll kill you!

712
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,450
I swear I'll kill you.

713
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:55,370
 I'm sorry, Yun Hui. 

714
01:00:55,370 --> 01:01:00,470
 I guess our fate ends here. 

715
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:05,300
 I thought I'd never betray you again. 

716
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,630
 Please never forgive an asshole like me. 

717
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,070
 Restricted Area
 Authorized Personnel Only 

718
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,590
No way, look, look!

719
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,010
Take a look.

720
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:58,290
There are so many comments about Bae Ro Na.
 Miss A of Cheong Ah Arts School: Who Is She Really? 

721
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:02,440
Everyone sides with Mr. Park, saying how bad it must've been for him to kill her.

722
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,000
Even so, public opinion is so harsh toward a dead person.

723
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,930
Do you know what I hate seeing the most?  A powerless person abusing power.

724
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:13,910
Being a piece of scrap metal, how dare did she act as though she were gold?

725
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:18,100
She let it get to her head. While she had nothing, she got to live in a place like Hera Palace.

726
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,260
Even in her death, she gets badmouthed.

727
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:25,260
Son, you just need to get ready for your SAT.

728
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,280
You're doing everything I tell you to, right?

729
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,150
Of course.

730
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:35,670
The number of people who follow me is already fifty thousand. Fifty thousand!

731
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,640
Isn't that awesome?

732
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:41,770
Can he really make it to SNU's (Seoul National University) School of Music, if he does what you tell him to?

733
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,400
Don't you believe me?

734
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,680
Do you think I, Gyu Jin became an assemblyman  now  of all times for no reason?

735
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,860
I've worked so hard with Assemblyman Kang for the past year to introduce this bill.

736
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,910
Special admission for an influencer.

737
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,720
This may go away at the end of the year.

738
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,900
Min Hyuk, you must make it to college by way of this.

739
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:03,900
My aide is doing a good job of maintaining your followers. You just need to follow around your mom and do volunteer work.

740
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,470
Just take pictures to the best of your ability.

741
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:07,620
Okay.

742
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,210
All the other kids are in a state of loss because of Ro Na's incident.

743
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:15,190
It'd be great if Min Hyeok used this chance to climb to the top.

744
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:18,580
This is why they say a crisis is an opportunity.

745
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,820
Of course, of course.

746
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:36,540
Mommy's here.

747
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:42,580
My Ro Na, you must be cold.

748
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:46,590
 Bae Ro Na 

749
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:51,280
It took a while sorting out your belongings.

750
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:56,850
I did everything I need to.

751
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,490
I'll be there soon, to where you are.

752
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:30,080
Is dying that urgent?

753
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,210
Let go.

754
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:39,010
I'm going to my Ro Na. I can't send her off alone.

755
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,730
Do you think I let you live so you can be like this?

756
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:52,660
I said I'll punish myself with my own hands.

757
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:55,670
I'm saying I'll go for the crime of killing Min Seol Ah!

758
01:04:55,670 --> 01:05:01,410
Even if you die, you should reveal the person you made Ro Na like this first!

759
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:05,590
The real culprit is someone else.

760
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:11,260
Real culprit? And who would that be?

761
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:14,260
Ha Eun Byeol.

762
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:32,660
Everyone, do what you need to do and come back by 3 p.m.

763
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,830
Who are you?

764
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,840
Sim Su Ryeon?

765
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,790
How have you been?

766
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:19,610
It's been a while, Ju Dan Tae.

767
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:33,830


768
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:50,490
 War in Life Penthouse II 

769
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:52,530
 There's nothing stopping me right now. 

770
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:53,820
 Can't we start over again? 

771
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,930
 No! 

772
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:58,100
 I've got something really juicy on Cheon Seo Jin. 

773
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,550
 That's the only way. 

774
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:01,240
 I think I'm really liking you now. 

775
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,700
 Who dared to ask you to do that? 

776
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,590
 You've got to have a character.  

777
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:06,990
 Hello, I'm Sim Su Ryeon. 

778
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:09,080
 That person knows all of Ju Dan Tae's secrets. 

779
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,000
 Is it Logan Lee, that bastard? 

780
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,300
 Plead, plead again. 

781
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,210
 On your knees!
