 Episode 10 

2
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000


3
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,260
Our  Seo Jin is so beautiful.

4
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,000
She is the perfect new bride.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,720
How much did that dress cost?

6
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,760
Pink is truly your color.

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,240
For a marriage that may dissolve anytime, why would anyone spend so much on a dress?

8
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,760
- Are you happy? 
  - Very happy.

9
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,560
I wish you that happiness forever.

10
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,500
Thank you for coming, Oh Yun Hui. We have a special connection, right?

11
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,770
We worked together,  and you are a Hera Club member.

12
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,750
On top of that, you are my beloved wife's high school friend.

13
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,890
And Ro Na was our children's friend.

14
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,720
Why mention Ro Na on a day like today?

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,780
I made a mistake. I beg your pardon.

16
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,880
You probably haven't gotten over the sorrow of losing your precious child.

17
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,460
I am okay.  Congratulations.

18
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,850
 Seoul Gangnam Police Station 

19
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,600
Mr. Ha Yun Cheol, did you really cover up the crime?

20
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Did you really? What was the reason?

21
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,960
Well.  Thank you to everyone from Hera Club who came to celebrate our wedding.

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,920
We will live well, loving, respecting and cherishing each other.

23
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,190
Teacher Cheon, please say something.

24
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,090
What's wrong with your expression from earlier?  You look like you're being dragged to a forced labor camp.

25
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,370
I'll say.  Your face is pale and drained of blood.

26
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,890
Are you feeling sick?

27
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,360
- That's— 
 - She must have been so nervous she couldn't sleep a wink last night.

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,000
She's very sensitive.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,650
Are you all right?  It will be over soon.

30
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,040
Still, we've got to have a toast, shall we?

31
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,260
Assemblyman, would you make the toast?

32
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,450
- Awesome. 
 - Shall I?

33
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,670
In truth, my wedding toast has a way of getting couples divorced and making them enemies.

34
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,320
It's amazing that their marriages imploded within a year.

35
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,010
However, these two people will be different.

36
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,290
Shall we toast?

37
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,510
Beautiful and—

38
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,350
It's my mom.

39
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,130
Miss Mi Ja, Oppa Gyu Jin is in the middle of doing something now.

40
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,740
Huh? Doctor Ha?

41
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,420
Are they saying that he is the real murderer of Bae Ro Na?

42
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,040
What did you say? Who is the real murderer?

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,460
He says Dr. Ha is the real killer of Bae Ro Na.

44
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,680
The real killer is Dr. Ha? Dr. Ha, the gentleman we all know?

45
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,140
Hey, turn the TV on right now. Hurry up!

46
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,450
What is this?

47
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,390
 A new suspect is arrested in the murder of Bae Ro Na at Chong Ah Arts School. 

48
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,690
  The identity of the suspect arrested  

49
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,690
  is shockingly the victim's stepfather. 
 "Mr. Ha", suspect in Bae Ro Na murder case, is arrested. 

50
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,790
 Mr. Ha is a CEO at the Korean branch of a well-known foreign pharmaceutical company. 

51
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,210
No. 
  He's also suspected to have paid off a fake culprit to cover his crime.  

52
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,580
No! 
 According to Gangnam police, Mr. Park who was arrested. . . 

53
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,760
Why are you shocked?
   was identified as the real murderer. 

54
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,070
He is a person for whom you have no concern now. 
   The police arrested Ha where  he attempted to flee. 

55
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,480
You. . .
  the detailed motive for his crime  is still unknown. 

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,250
How do you like my wedding present?  I arranged it as a surprise for you.

57
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,240
 So far, Ha has neither acknowledged nor denied his crime.  

58
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,960
Eun Byeol.  Eun Byeol. Ha Eun Byeol!

59
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,230
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm fine.

60
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,530
Take me quickly to the police station.  Hurry.

61
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,520
What about Mom?  Where is she?

62
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,830
You know she's having a wedding ceremony. It's almost over.

63
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,700
What wedding ceremony? With whom?

64
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,990
What do you mean whom? It's Seok Hun's dad, of course.

65
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,210
Are the two really getting married? After she kicked me off  to America?

66
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,000
Didn't you know? I guess I shouldn't have said it.

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,870
Eun Byeol, don't cry.

68
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,350
You know I am here.  I will never desert you.

69
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,980
It's Seok Hun.

70
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,260
Don't open the door.

71
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,690
I don't want to see him. Don't let him into the house ever again.

72
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,080
Student Seok Hun is here.

73
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,120
Get out. I don't have anything to say to you.

74
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,800
What's the matter?  Did something happen, you two?

75
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,560
Your memory has returned, hasn't it? You remember, don't you?

76
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,360
Jerk! Was it all a lie?

77
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,290
That we should date and you liked me?

78
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,170
What the heck were you trying to get out of me by telling lies?

79
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,010
I want to hear the truth.

80
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,160
What did you do to Ro Na? Tell me.

81
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,330
Tell me. Tell me now!

82
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,220
I don't know. I didn't do anything.

83
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,160
Stop talking about Ro Na! I'm sick of it!

84
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,430
Teacher Jean, get him out of here now. Right this minute!

85
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,730
You should leave now. Eun Byeol can't get worked up like this.

86
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,970
Over here! Help!

87
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,010
Ha Eun Byeol, I'm going to find out.

88
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,160
I'm going to get to the bottom of why Ro Na died!

89
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,470
Ha Eun Byeol!

90
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,690
Eun Byeol.

91
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,290
What am I going to do? I remember everything.

92
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,990
On the day of the Cheong Ah Arts Festival. What I did.

93
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,320
How could he kill his stepdaughter? Then he demanded a divorce and left you!

94
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,810
What a rotten jerk.  Worse off than a dog. Are you alright, Yun Hui?

95
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,060
Ha Yun Cheol has always had bad luck.

96
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,730
How did you end up getting tangled with that piece of shit?
  Gangnam Police Station  

97
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,390
Yun Hui! Let's get you divorced immediately!

98
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,550
I can get you about 100 million in alimony.

99
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,770
I still can't believe it. How could he do such a thing even for Eun Byeol's sake?

100
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,420
He must've done it because of Eun Byeol. She and Ro Na were no ordinary rivals.

101
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,870
No way. Did he harm Ro Na to get Eun Byeol the grand prize?

102
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,720
The day Ro Na became that way was the day of the Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

103
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,320
That's why he's scary. How unfortunate for Eun Byeol.

104
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,130
A murderer for a dad, and a con artist for a mom.

105
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,210
Chairman Ju, did you really have no idea?

106
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,780
Not at all. This is all very shocking to me as well.

107
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,670
Is it true that Ha Yun Cheol put you up to make a false confession?

108
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:40,700
Yes, with five million in cash and on the condition that he'll treat my sick daughter.

109
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,620
You aren't the killer, are you? Who put you up to this?

110
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,620
 - Was it Ha Yun Cheol? 
 - No. Nothing like that ever happened. 

111
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,250
 I- I'm the murderer. 

112
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,620
 You're not going to tell the truth till the end. 

113
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,510
Everything..

114
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,520
he made me do it.

115
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,140
He said he'll provide for my family for the rest of their lives.

116
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,260
So I had no choice. I'm sorry.

117
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,380
Yun Cheol, do you admit to the murder of Bae Ro Na?

118
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,070
I do.

119
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,810
Bae Ro Na..

120
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,200
I killed her.

121
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,070
The reporters are watching. So I can't give you a lot of time.

122
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,590
I understand.

123
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,400
Thank you so much, Captain.

124
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,590
Eun Byeol's dad.

125
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,020
What happened?

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,790
Why are you here? People will get suspicious.  Leave quickly.

127
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,770
Ju Dan Tae must have threatened Mr. Park. I thought marrying him would take care of everything.

128
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,040
I never would've thought he would do something like this.

129
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,950
I thought he might.  What about Eun Byeol? Did she leave?

130
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,200
She came home. Teacher Jean said she's with her.

131
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,760
- It's dangerous for her to be here! Hurry and send her to the States. 
 - You worry about yourself!

132
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,330
Just hold your ground and say no.

133
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,010
I'll see Mr. Park and persuade him to reverse himself somehow.

134
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,200
I already admitted to the crime.

135
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,490
Are you crazy? Are you really trying to be a murderer?

136
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,570
It's true that I wanted to kill her.

137
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,330
I thought about doing it a few times and went to her hosptial room.

138
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,630
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

139
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,610
But it drove me crazy because I felt it was my fault that Ro Na died.

140
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,500
In a way, I'm glad that things turned out this way.

141
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,530
Do you think I married Ju Dan Tae only to see you like this?

142
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,030
Don't worry about me. Just get your head straight.

143
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,790
Ju Dan Tae won't stop here. He'll drag Eun Byeol into this anytime.

144
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,880
That jerk. I'm going to kill him.

145
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,480
I'm willing to take on this burden.

146
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,160
You just protect Eun Byeol. You can do that, right?

147
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,050
  Seoul Gangnam Police Station 

148
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,670
How do you feel?

149
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,020
Now that your ex-husband is a criminal.

150
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,980
I wondered. While falling for Ha Yun Cheol again,

151
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,780
why would you still go through with the wedding with Ju Dan Te?

152
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,630
Who says I was falling for him?

153
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,170
I wasn't.

154
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,700
I suppose I no longer have the reason to dirty my own  hands with blood.

155
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,520
Since Ju Dan Te will give your family a nice send-off to Hell.

156
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,020
What?

157
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,180
With Ha Yun Cheol sitting in prison, do you think your daughter will be safe?

158
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,040
That'll only ruin you. The truth won't change.

159
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,840
What are you saying?

160
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,850
Well then, I'm off to see a detective.

161
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,890
He's offering a briefing on Ro Na's real killer.

162
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,890
Just how many more times will the real killer change?

163
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,960
Don't tell me . . .

164
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,350
Does she know?

165
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,570
Are you back? I hear Dr. Ha is at the police station.

166
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,280
What's Eun Byeol doing?

167
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,170
She won't come out of her room. Clearly, she's more shocked knowing her mother is married.

168
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,820
Why did you tell her that? She has enough to deal with already. What was the hurry?

169
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,850
Apparently, Eun Byeol has her memory back.

170
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,350
What was that again?

171
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:06,930
Eun Byeol remembers the day of the Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

172
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,370
She came back home alone early in her blood-stained dress.

173
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,760
How did you know that, Teacher Jean?

174
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,510
There's no secret between Eun Byeol and me.

175
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,390
Didn't you know? She's much closer to me than to you, her mom.

176
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,260
But relax.

177
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,060
I'm on Eun Byeol's side. Whatever I saw, I didn't see it.

178
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,330
Hi, Eun Byeol.

179
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,170
Sorry I didn't tell you about the wedding in advance.

180
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,880
- Mom—
 - I don't want to hear it.

181
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,810
I should study and go to Seoul National University like you want me to.

182
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,880
Look at me when you talk to me.

183
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,050
Why aren't you asking about your dad? Aren't you curious?

184
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:17,080
I heard he killed Ro Na. He committed a crime, so he should be punished.

185
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,260
What?

186
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,250
What did you just say?

187
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,830
It was all over on the news. That Dad confessed.

188
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:34,010
Isn't this what Mom and Dad wanted? That's why you erased all my memories.

189
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,140
Do you really?

190
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,830
Do you really have your memories back?

191
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,220
Did you think you could wipe out my memories?

192
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,760
You should've done a clean job and erased them all for real!

193
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,070
Did you expect a thank-you from me since Dad turned himself in, instead of me?

194
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,020
Is that really the way you should talk?

195
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,250
Do you have any idea of the things your mom and dad did for you?

196
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,110
When did I ever ask you to do them? I never wanted you to.

197
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,200
You and Dad did what you did on your own. So why hit me?

198
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,530
I'm much tougher than you think.

199
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,000
Why bother feeding me the medicine? I would've gladly forget it if you'd asked me to.

200
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,710
- Ha Eun Byeol!
 - What!

201
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,580
Didn't you know that I'm a monster?

202
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,830
On the day you left my grandpa and ran away, I was the one who fled from him as he was dying in the rain.

203
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,990
I was memorizing English words even at his funeral!

204
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,930
How could I not go crazy and be sane? It's you who made me this way.

205
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,270
Still, I didn't tell a soul,

206
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,230
regardless how I hated you for killing my grandpa.

207
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,370
Because you're my mom.

208
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,440
Because I had to protect you, I kept my mouth shut!

209
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:01,240
How could you marry Seok Hun's dad?

210
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,610
Didn't you know that I'm fond of Seok Hun?

211
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,330
What? What do you mean you're fond of Seok Hun?

212
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,930
Mom, what the hell do you know about me?

213
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:18,230
Apart from my grades, academic performance and demerits, you know nothing about me.

214
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,200
Get out. Out!

215
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,090
Out already!

216
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,230
Get out! Get out!

217
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,840
Eun Byeol, no!

218
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,250
No!

219
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,000
Let go!

220
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,760
Eun Byeol! No!

221
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,660
Mom's wrong!

222
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,190
Mom did wrong. Please don't do this, Eun Byeol!

223
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,990
- Mom did wrong. 
 -  Mommy!

224
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,070
The truth is I'm so scared.

225
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,290
Now I'm going to be taken to the police station.

226
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,940
My life is all over now.

227
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,060
No. There's got to be a way. Do I look like someone who can't keep you safe?

228
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,770
I won't ever let you and your dad get hurt. Trust me.

229
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,040
I really didn't mean to kill her.

230
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,910
I mean it. I remember it clearly now.

231
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,820
I picked up the trophy in rage.

232
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,470
The next thing I knew Bae Ro Na rolled down the stairs.

233
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,440
I heard the ringtone of a cell phone somewhere,

234
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,030
and that woke me up.

235
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,200
Did you hear a ringtone of a cell phone?

236
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,860
I keep hearing the ringtone in my ears, and it drives me crazy.

237
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:48,000
Mi, re, sol, fa, mi, mi, mi, re, si.

238
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,960
Then . . .

239
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,460
- Are you saying there was someone else?
 - I don't know.

240
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,960
I got so scared I ran away.

241
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,570
If I'd moved Ba Ro Na to the hospital quickly, she wouldn't have died, right?

242
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,740
I can't believe she died when she was hit on her shoulder.

243
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,660
Shoulder? Was it her shoulder? Not her head?

244
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,490
I'm positive it was her shoulder.

245
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,210
Ro Na died from her head wound after being hit with 
 the trophy.

246
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,450
No, I didn't hit her head.

247
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,450
- I'm positive. 
 - Are you sure you remember it correctly?

248
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,270
I remember it so clearly now it gives me the creeps!

249
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,600
Why don't you believe me?

250
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,710
Tell me everything. All the details.

251
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,370
About what happened on that day. From the beginning.

252
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,310
Slowly. And everything.

253
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,570
Na Ae Gyo's relationship with  CEO Jeong Du Man was more than a casual business relationship.

254
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,050
There's something else.

255
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,570
What is this key for?

256
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,110
- Have you been waiting for long? 
 - Are you coming in only now?

257
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,050
Heavy traffic on the roads.

258
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,370
So did you get Oh Yun Hui's land?

259
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,040
In fact, I'm going to start negotiating tomorrow.

260
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,140
I'm curious about something.

261
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,100
When did you quit smoking?

262
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,390
Didn't I tell you?

263
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,210
I couldn't stop coughing for a long time. So I quit.

264
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,660
Did you?

265
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,470
Good for you.

266
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,550
Perhaps, it's because I am seeing you after a long time,

267
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,000
something about you is not quite familiar.

268
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,800
When you hold your wine glasses,

269
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,130
you always use your left hand. Now I see you're using your right.

270
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:04,100
You used to get mad at me, saying I made you use your right hand like Sim Su Ryeon.

271
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,850
I've lived all my life imitating Sim Su Ryeon. I guess I've grown used to using my right.

272
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,060
Right.

273
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,060
When you confirm things, does that make you feel better?

274
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,510
It's not like that. I was standing the entire time at the wedding.

275
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:35,550
You know about my suspicions. I have the habit of confirming and yet confirming again.

276
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,050
You're even more appealing to me today, Na Ae Gyo.

277
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,000
Should I stay the night here?

278
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,900
It's your wedding night. Don't give your wife a reason to get at you.

279
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,450
You should learn self-control to get Cheong Ah Group in your hands.

280
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,780
Staying out on your wedding night?  How inconsiderate.

281
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,060
Isn't this a marriage in form only anyway?

282
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,390
What nonsense.

283
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,180
I'm fully ready to be happy with you.

284
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,660
Don't touch me.

285
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,350
Owing to your suprise gift, Eun Byeol couldn't go to America.

286
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,890
For the time being, I'll stay in my place with Eun Byeol.

287
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,860
I came to tell you that.

288
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,630
Your place? I'm quite hurt.

289
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,110
Our marriage's registered, so we're officially a couple. And this is your home.

290
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,660
When your home is here, where do you say you're going?

291
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,480
As you want, I'll give you Cheong Ah Construction.

292
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,830
I'll just think I got struck out by a fradulent marriage and a big chunk of alimony.

293
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,660
In return, give back to me Eun Byeol's necklace.

294
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:16,350
Cheon Seo Jin, clearly, you got it wrong big time. I have the winning streak here.

295
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,520
It isn't time for you to be barking like a dog.

296
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,860
You crazy bastard, just give me the necklace!

297
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,370
This is the manual of our marital arrangements.

298
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,900
Read and follow them carefully.

299
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,380
 Manual of Marital Arrangements:  
 Handle my children's college admission while I handle their discipline. Send Ha Eun Byeol abroad. 

300
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,640
I'll have you handle all the household affairs in the penthouse.
  Use separate rooms. Detailed daily report.  

301
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,030
I dismissed  the helpers already.
 Impeccable public appearances. No helpers. Daily rising at 5 a.m. 

302
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,770
- What?
 - To play the role of my children's new stepmom faithfully,

303
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,450
I figured it'd be better for you to not have helpers around.

304
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,840
Oh, naturally, you can't see Eun Byeol without my permission.

305
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,920
Are you crazy?

306
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,510
Eun Byeol is my daughter, and now she has only me to take care of her.

307
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,500
See if I care!

308
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,930
Why should I concern myself with Ha Yun Cheol's kid?

309
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,580
Did you already forget what happened to Sim Su Ryeon when she tried to protect her girl?

310
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:19,610
So sorry. I lost it again.

311
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,200
This is why you should listen to me.

312
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,010
I've been thinking.

313
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,260
The Cheong Ah Medical has quite substantial business potential.

314
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,170
Why don't you hand that over to me as well?

315
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,830
What are you? A gangster?

316
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,470
Hands off on Cheong Ah Medical and its Foundation!

317
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,690
Why are you getting mad?

318
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,190
I'm too scared to even talk to you, Ahjumma.

319
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,480
Who the hell are you really?

320
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,620
You eyed on my wealth from the beginning. Didn't you?

321
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,780
Obviously, you see me as some pushover.

322
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,250
I'm the eldest daughter of Cheong Ah, Cheon Seo Jin.

323
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,340
I won't give you a dime more than Cheong Ah Construction!

324
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,280
Be grateful for my generosity and get lost.

325
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,340
Mind your manners.

326
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,820
I'm warning you, Ahjumma.

327
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:14,210
I want a divorce at once. I can't live even a day with you. Proceed with the paperwork now!

328
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,190
 I  decide when to meet and separate. How many times must I remind you, stupid woman!

329
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,920
It's you, stupid!

330
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,410
Did you think I'll go down alone?

331
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:28,770
I'll tell the world you killed Sim Su Ryeon. You trash, murderer!

332
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,330
Ahjumma, you've got to learn some manners.

333
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,520
Let go!

334
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,700
Let go! You damn trash! Let go!

335
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,430
Let go! Let go!

336
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,240
What?

337
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,940
Are you scared?

338
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,800
Hence you've got to watch your mouth.

339
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,690
Sim Su Ryeon, too, died acting up crazy. She didn't know better just like you.

340
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,140
But I say my fun with you will be different from what I had with Sim Su Ryeon.

341
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,390
 Golden Real Estate  
  Specializing in Cheonsu District Investment Consulting 

342
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,730
I'm Hwang Geum Bong.
  You become rich when you're with Golden Real Estate.  

343
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,310
I want to buy the real estate at Number 27 in Cheonsu District.

344
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:16,600
A number of people have  already expressed their interest in the property.

345
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,580
About fifteen people have already put down their down payments.

346
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,340
Can I interest you in another property?

347
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,100
No need.

348
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,710
It must be the one at Number 27.

349
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,500
I've come from here.

350
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,230
You know him, our chairman? 
  Cheong Ah Group Chair: Ju Dan Te 

351
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,010
Oh, Chairman Ju Dan Te.

352
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,450
You already know we have seventy percent of the land in Cheonsu District.

353
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,100
There's a way we can help each other out.

354
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,190
What do you think?

355
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,760
Are you in?

356
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,640
Go and check what the circumstance is.

357
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,130
Understood.

358
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,030
Let me make this clear for you.

359
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,950
I have no intention of turning my back on Ju Dan Te. So stop stalking.

360
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,780
If I see you ever again, I'm taking you to Ju Dan Te.

361
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,130
You will never.

362
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,250
If that was your intention, you would've already exposed my identity to Ju Dan Te.

363
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,890
Do you want me to?

364
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,210
Should I live up to your expectation?

365
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,520
Be honest. The truth is you can't trust Ju Dan Te either.

366
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,180
He's a man who mistreates his children and killed his wife. Do you want to die like Sim Su Ryeon?

367
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,930
Quit butting in. If I live or die, what do you care?

368
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,260
Why do you want to buy Number 27 in Cheonsu District?

369
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,880
Use me for whatever the reason is.

370
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,750
You won't be able to buy the land without me.

371
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,250
Because I own it.

372
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,640
I have no business joining forces with someone like you.

373
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,560
I put my life on the line for money.

374
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,540
I'll wipe out anyone in the way of what I'm trying to do.

375
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,050
 I put my life on the line for this. 

376
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,220
 The wrongful death of my daughter.  I will avenge her blood.  

377
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,570
 I'll wipe out anyone who gets in the way of this.  

378
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,770
Na Ae Gyo suggested auctioning Number 27 in Cheonsu for the highest price.

379
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,360
Auction?

380
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,720
Why bother with an auction?

381
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,900
Let go!

382
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,310
Come!

383
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,870
- Come down!
 - Let go! Let go!

384
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,510
Let go!

385
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,240
Let go!

386
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,090
I said let go!

387
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:18,880
This is the only place you deserve in the penthouse.

388
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,020
This is for the transfer of the ownership of Cheong Ah Group.

389
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,280
You won't take one step out of here until you sign it. Got it?

390
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,020
Say hello to her.

391
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,800
Ju Dan Te! Open the door!

392
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,000
Ju Dan Te!

393
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,930
Did you think you'd be okay when you betrayed me?

394
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,520
For what you did to me,

395
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,700
I'll pay you back.

396
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,790
You can look forward to it.

397
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,760
Ju Dan Te! Open the door! Ju Dan Te!

398
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,240
Ju Dan Te!

399
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,670
Sim Su Ryeon.

400
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,690
Is this your revenge?

401
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,140
By handing over to me a rotten trash like Ju Dan Tae?

402
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,430
 Seoul Gangnam Police Station 

403
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,870
I won't be long.

404
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,480
We're still married on paper,

405
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,970
so I thought I should come and see you for once at least.

406
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,630
Did you hate my Ro Na that much?

407
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,830
To the point of wanting to kill her?

408
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,290
I don't plan on making excuses.

409
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,410
I did it all for Eun Byeol.

410
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:21,470
What's so wrong about wanting to protect my child?

411
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,210
You would've done the same.

412
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,910
You're right. I was like that, too.

413
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,510
I did anything  as long as it was for Ro Na.

414
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,290
But with the passage of time, I realized.

415
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,060
That if you commit a sin, you'll somehow be punished.

416
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,920
No matter how much you deny or run from it, it'll catch up with you in the end.

417
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:52,810
Don't fool yourself into thinking you made the best choice for Eun Byeol.

418
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,360
What about my Eun Byeol?

419
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,790
She didn't do anything wrong.

420
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,810
See? Our divorce paper. I'm going to turn it in today.

421
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,400
Now really,

422
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,730
we have to part ways.

423
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,880
Even if it was for a short time, you and Ro Na

424
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,030
I wished happiness for you two.

425
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,360
I was foolish.

426
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,200
My Ro Na

427
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,200
is just like you.

428
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,040
That's why she was so affectionate.

429
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,770
What?

430
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:51,130
To make certain you get the most severe sentence,

431
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,670
I'm going to do whatever I can starting now.

432
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,510
I'll make you regret to the point where you tear at your own heart.

433
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,680
You  must.

434
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,100
Because you sent your own child to death.

435
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:14,390
Wh- what are you saying now?

436
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,930
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this sooner.

437
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,290
But still, I'm much relieved.

438
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:26,840
Since Ro Na left without knowing anything.

439
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,700
If she'd known the person who killed her was her own birth father,

440
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,700
how much would her heart have been torn into shreds.

441
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,980
Oh Yun Hui, what are you doing?

442
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,150
I have one last favor to ask of you.

443
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,050
Go to our Ro Na and

444
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:59,350
tell her just once with all your sincerity that you're sorry.

445
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,650
Your daughter's gone not ever being cared for as a child should've been.

446
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,210
I feel so sorry for her.

447
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,020
At least, you can do that much, right?

448
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,890
Oh Yun Hui, tell me so I can understand.

449
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:15,290
You're lying, right? You're lying to make me miserable!

450
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,120
I ask that of you.

451
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,410
Oh Yun Hui, don't go!

452
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,450
What are you saying right now?

453
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,780
Yun Hui, Yun Hui, it's not true.

454
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,060
Yun Hui, stop it now. What are you saying?!

455
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,770
Yun Hui, don't go! Don't go, Oh Yun Hui!

456
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,920
What are you saying!

457
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,250
Oh Yun Hui! Don't go!

458
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,460
What are you saying now!

459
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,160
What are you saying now!

460
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,140
Get the smartest kids from the law firm.

461
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,480
Make sure they're on standby to go straight into Ha Yun Cheol's defense.

462
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,250
They say you really don't know what's in the heart of a man.

463
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,550
How could Doctor Ha do that?

464
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:05,200
Did he want to divorce Oh Yun Hui because of his guilt of having killed her daughter?

465
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,000
Seriously, he gives me the creeps.

466
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,250
Do you really think a nerd like him could kill a person?

467
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,680
He hardly has what it takes.

468
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,270
Why are you suddenly saying something different now?

469
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,220
Earlier, you were the loudest calling Ha Yun Cheol a rotten bastard.

470
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,510
Well, that's because

471
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,970
Oh Yun Hui was next to me, but in any case,

472
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,710
he's not the type to kill someone.

473
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm building a team of defense lawyers for Ha Yun Cheol.

474
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,090
Only the top-notch lawyers from my father's firm.

475
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,590
Are you crazy?

476
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,720
What if the word gets out that you helped such a shameless man?

477
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,140
Your re-election will be off the table!

478
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,670
Didn't you see yesterday?

479
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,290
Cheon Seo Jin ran out of her own wedding seeing the news. What could that mean?

480
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,780
She's willing to risk her entire wealth if it's for Ha Yun Cheol.

481
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,640
It's exactly that. This great opportunity

482
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,630
should be seized by our law firm.

483
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,610
Do you think Teacher Cheon was shot in the head or something?

484
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,340
Why would she risk everything she has for her ex-husband?

485
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,220
I have a feeling.

486
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,520
That with this one chance, I, Gyu Jin

487
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,210
will be filthy rich. That kind of feeling.

488
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,090
Feeling, my ass.

489
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:04,000
Just drink this.

490
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,940
We're the only people who don't use helpers in Hera Palace.

491
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,620
That's why I'm trying to figure out ways to make money.

492
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,080
Once Cheonsu District explodes in value, we'll also move up to the 130th floor

493
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,900
and into the penthouse.

494
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,830
The penthouse? Really?

495
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,610
Say, we get about five apartments.

496
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,980
The monthly rent alone there is about two or three million.

497
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,970
Gyu Jin!

498
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,040
Cheers!

499
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,360
That's why we need to go all in on this.

500
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,850
Noona. I need money.  Every day the price of land is going up,

501
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,230
but I am dying without a down payment.

502
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,360
Why are you so lovable?

503
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:53,280
Is this  the trend these days?

504
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,570
Is this the furniture company that Sim Su Ryeon used to run?

505
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:01,580
The famous Number 27 Cheonsu District.

506
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,990
It's pretty big.

507
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,050
I've always wanted to come here once.

508
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,520
I'm starting to want it.

509
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,290
I want to try running it.

510
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:16,160
The sales are respectable. It's a business place everyone wants.

511
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,500
Did something good happen today?

512
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,840
You even brought me to a place like this.

513
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,040
This is my apology for jumping down your throat yesterday.

514
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:32,310
Everything is going perfectly according to my plan.

515
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,630
I've already got Cheong Ah Construction in my hand.

516
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,490
I think I'll easily have Cheong Ah Medical, too.

517
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,360
How are you doing with the purchase of the land? Going well?

518
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,830
-  I'm thinking to raise the price.
 - How?

519
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,470
To make people flock with the smell of money,

520
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,530
I pulled a little prank.

521
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:54,110
The price of land isn't decided but made.

522
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,630
Something we've been doing all this time.

523
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,770
This is Na Ae Gyo I know.

524
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,500
Congratulations, Darling.

525
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,010
You're on the verge of realizing the business of your life time, Ju Dan Te Village.

526
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,630
You also won't need to live in hiding any longer,

527
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,600
and live as Na Ae Gyo with confidence.

528
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,310
This.

529
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,240
Here.

530
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,730
What is this?

531
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,760
A gift?

532
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,960
What the-, you startled me. What is this?

533
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,100
Cheon Seo Jin's lifeline.

534
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,280
Until the house is settled, I want you to have it.

535
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,630
Cheon Seo Jin is feverishly looking everywhere for this.

536
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,990
Is this necklace the evidence?

537
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,470
Does Cheon Seo Jin also know?

538
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,960
Knows what?

539
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:55,430
That her daughter isn't the killer.

540
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,560
What are you talking about?

541
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,700
Why are you so surprised?

542
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,050
Who are you trying to fool?

543
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:06,590
Cheon Seo Jin is more naive than I thought.

544
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:10,860
As if on cue, when you lusted after Cheong Ah Group the most,

545
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,960
Cheon Seo Jin's daughter killed someone.

546
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,090
Was that really a coincidence, you think?

547
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,870
Who most benefited from that incident?

548
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:23,440
It's you.

549
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,590
Did you kill her?

550
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,670
Na Ae Gyo!

551
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,650
 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival 

552
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,190
 Teacher Ma Du Gi 

553
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,930
 Teacher Ma, how did it go? 

554
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:56,120
 I'm sorry. The judges were so involved I couldn't do anything.  

555
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,350
 Get to the point. To the point first.  

556
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,860
 Who gets the grand prize? 

557
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,770
 The grand prize winner is Bae Ro Na. 

558
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,670
 Bae Ro Na? Why to a bitch like her— 

559
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,250
  Hey, Ma Du Gi, you. Are you doing things right? 

560
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,870
  Seok Gyeong can still win the gold trophy— 

561
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:15,370
 She can easily get the stupid gold trophy without your help. 

562
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:18,950
 Our deal ends here. Got it? 

563
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:25,880
 She bothers me just like her mother. Bae Ro Na, that annoying little bitch.  

564
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,490
 Na Ae Gyo? 

565
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:35,690
 Ringtone: Dvořák: Symphony No. 9 ‘From the New World’, IV. Allegro con fuoco 

566
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,950
 Ha Eun Byeol? 

567
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,520
 What is that? 

568
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,740
 Mister. 

569
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:08,130
 Mister, please call my mom.  

570
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:12,160
 I'm hurt right now. 

571
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,250
 Of all people, why is it you? 

572
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:22,160
 Out of all people, why do you win the grand prize? 

573
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:29,710
 If it weren't for you, the free pass to Seoul National University could be my Seok Gyeong's. 

574
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,250
 Why are you being like this? 

575
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:40,540
 I'm wondering if you can concede a little for Seok Gyeong's sake. 

576
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:45,080
 You see, I love my daughter 

577
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,580
 very much. 

578
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:58,390
 Please save me. Please.  

579
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,900
 Please save me. 

580
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,570
 At the sight of you, I always felt unlucky.  

581
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:25,470
 But still, this is because you've conceded. 

582
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:38,940
 Ha Eun Byeol. Who knew?  You would help me out like this.  

583
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:44,650
 If this works out right, I can get rid of the two annoying bitches at once. 

584
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:50,470
 I'm indeed a lucky guy. 

585
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,910
 I brought the most similar looking suit from the car. 

586
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,550
 Good. 

587
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:21,310
 Delete CCTV files? 

588
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,030
 Where have you been? You've gone a while.  

589
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:30,780
 Why are there so many people at the bathroom? 

590
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:37,580
 Now, I'll welcome Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin  onto the center of the stage to announce the judges' decisions.  

591
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:43,220
 Someone is dead! 

592
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,810
 Je Ni! 
 Fire Alarm 

593
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,160
 There is a person here! 

594
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,980
 No, no, not here! 

595
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,840
 Don't go over here! 

596
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,810
Do you think I killed her?

597
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:15,350
Bae Ro Na? Why such an erroneous assumption?

598
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,090
Am I really wrong thinking that?

599
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,960
Is there anyone who knows Ju Dan Tae better than I do?

600
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,580
Try fooling a ghost.

601
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:35,280
Either way, Bae Ro Na proved to be a pretty useful child.

602
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,520
As much as Min Seol Ah.

603
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,010
Because those children who were nobody died at a time they did,

604
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:48,040
I could so easily get my hands on Sim Su Ryeon and Cheon Seo Jin's assets.

605
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,610
 Are you listening, Oh Yun Hui?  
 Voice Spy 

606
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,260
Ju Dan Tae, was it you, who killed my Ro Na?

607
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,170
Who on earth did it? What did all of you do to such a young child?

608
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:42,150
Welcome to hell!

609
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,530
Do you see now what kind of a man my father is?

610
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:50,320
That's why I warned you all along  not to go through with the damn wedding.

611
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,370
You better be careful.

612
00:47:56,370 --> 00:48:01,390
You might not be able to come out of here alive.

613
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,970
Like my mom.

614
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:44,510
 I keep hearing that sound in my ears I feel like I'm going crazy.  

615
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:50,300
 Mi, fa, sol, fa, mi, mi, mi, re, si.  
    

616
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,130
 Na Ae Gyo 

617
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:13,250
Na Ae Gyo?

618
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:58,790
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol, Wake up. Quick.

619
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,180
Wake up! Quick!

620
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,170
Mom, when did you get here?

621
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,780
Sing the ringtone you said you heard  that day.

622
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:08,670
You said you heard a ringtone on the stone stairs. Sing it as you remember it, quick.

623
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,510
Why?

624
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:11,740
Just sing, quick!

625
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:17,980
Mi, fa, sol, fa, mi, mi, mi, si, re, mi.

626
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,350
What are you doing? What's wrong?

627
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:29,230
 That bastard was there. I'm certain of that ringtone. 

628
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,410
You aren't allowed to come to the 85th floor without the Chairman's permission.

629
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:42,120
Take her back to the penthouse immediately.

630
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,080
It's okay, Eun Byeol. It'll be okay.

631
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,550
Let go! I'll go on my own two feet!

632
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:50,640
Mom. Let go!

633
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,110
Let go! Let go!

634
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:06,510
If you show up before my daughter one more time, I'll kill you then with my own hands.

635
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:09,830
You need to be up by 5 a.m. tomorrow.

636
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:14,720
You won't be able to get much sleep. But you'll still be making my favorite soup, right?

637
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:32,080
I hate Teacher Cheon, but what I hate even more is seeing Dad happy.

638
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:37,720
If you're happy after killing someone, that's cheating.

639
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:47,500
 Auction: Number 27 Cheonsu District 

640
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:01,070
 You're making it look too obvious. 

641
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,320
How much cash did you prepare?

642
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:16,380
Why would I tell you that? Everyone here is my competitors.

643
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,650
Do you even know who the owner of this land is?

644
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:26,310
Of course, it's Chairman Ju. This is the furniture company Su Ryeon used to run.

645
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:30,690
My goodness, your information is still way down there.

646
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:34,700
The owner of this place is no other than Oh Yun Hui.

647
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,530
Yun Hui?

648
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:43,590
Why didn't she tell me? We're the next-door neighbors.

649
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,650
When it comes to money and land, there can be no best friends.

650
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:51,490
The rumor is that you're awfully close to Oh Yun Hui. I guess not.

651
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:54,300
I thought it was the friendship of the century!

652
00:53:55,370 --> 00:54:00,480
Mind your business. You two stick together because you have no friends.

653
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,400
That's not true.

654
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,910
-That's not true. 
-You're jealous.

655
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:12,960
Mother,  how much did we bring?

656
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,880
This much.

657
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,390
Only 3 million in won?

658
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,480
Try adding another zero.

659
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,840
- Then thirty  million? 
 - Hey!

660
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,130
How thoughtless are you? You might as well sing it through an amplifier.

661
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:27,560
Is this property worth as much as thirty million?

662
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,800
According to Gyu Jin, it's worth more than thirty million,

663
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,220
so I borrowed money by putting up my Gangnam building as collateral.

664
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,430
Don't be so obvious, okay?

665
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,940
All Gangnam speculators with money have gathered themselves.
 Dash to 2nd Gangnam 

666
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:51,540
Since Ju Dan Te raised the stakes of the auction, sell it at the highest price.

667
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:58,470
I wonder how much Ju Dan Tae is willing to bet. He'll try not to lose the land.

668
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,200
Just wait, Ju Dan Tae.

669
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,120
Even if I have to twist your neck, I'll take back what you took from me.

670
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,850
 He has a different necktie and a collar. 

671
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:40,230
He changed his clothes.

672
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,400
Why?

673
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:00,870
Secretary Do, I need you to find someone for me.

674
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:04,440
Her name is Na Ae Gyo. She's probably someone close to Ju Dan Tae.

675
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,400
Find out what their relationship is. Quickly.

676
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:17,700
So many of you expressed your interest in the property at Number 27 Cheonsu District.

677
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,270
Therefore, I invited all of you at one place like this.

678
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:24,800
Only to one of the super VIPs especially invited here,

679
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,600
I'm going to sell the property at  Number 27.

680
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,830
On behalf of the owner of the property, I'll begin the auction.

681
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:35,340
Starting bid is 10 billion won.

682
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,010
- Eleven billion! 
 - Eleven billion!

683
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,600
- Twelve billion! 
 - Twelve billion!

684
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,830
Thirteen billion!

685
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:43,690
- Fifteen billion! 
 - Here is 15 billion!

686
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,940
- Twenty billion! 
 - Here is 20 billion!

687
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,480
Twenty billion and one hundred million!

688
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,550
- Twenty-three billion. 
 - Twenty-three billion!

689
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,820
- Twenty-five billion! 
 - Here is 25 billion!

690
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:56,210
Has Je Ni's mom earned that much? Darn it.

691
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:58,370
- Thirty billion! 
 -  Thirty billion was the bid!

692
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:00,630
Why won't you give in already?

693
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,420
For whose sake?

694
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,080
Thirty-three billion!

695
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,990
Is that woman insane?

696
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:09,460
Mother-in-law, let's give up. We're already beyond our limit.

697
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,480
Please let go of our greed.

698
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,700
Thirty-three billion. No more bidding?

699
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,270
Shall we close the bid? It's sold at 33 billion.

700
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:20,300
If I give up at this point, I'm not Lee Gyu Jin anymore.

701
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,560
It'll be okay if we sell it to Chairman Ju and double the price.

702
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:26,670
Forty billion!

703
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:27,860
Forty billion?

704
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,770
Honey!

705
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:32,090
He has some gall.

706
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:35,550
I'll buy it at 40 billion.

707
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,870
Forty billion was the bid!

708
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:40,250
Would everybody else give up?

709
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:43,190
Well, well, alright.  At 40 billion,

710
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:45,630
I'm going to say it's sol—

711
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,690
Fifty billion.

712
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,250
Fifty billion?

713
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:57,400
Come on, there is a standard market price.

714
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,140
Ten billion in difference?  It's too big a gap.

715
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,230
However good the location is, that's absurd!

716
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,680
You'll lose money when you sell it later.  Are you an amateur?

717
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,800
Even if I lose money, it's my money I lose.  So worry about yourselves.

718
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:16,390
How about it?  If no one else is going to bid, let's stop here.

719
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:21,110
The remaining balance is supposed to be paid right away. Where could I borrow 50 billion?

720
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,370
I give up.

721
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:24,550
Come on, Mom!

722
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,440
By the way, who are you?

723
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,840
Are you an individual investor?

724
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,950
I'm from Cheong Ah Group's Investment and Development Team.

725
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:38,830
Cheong Ah Group?  Are you sent by Chairman Ju?

726
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:44,380
What is this? Are you playing us now with money?

727
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,220
It's 5 billion in won for the down payment.

728
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,840
We'll draw up the actual contract with the owner present tomorrow.

729
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:57,110
I'll pay off 45 billion, the remaining balance tomorrow as well.

730
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,360
The property is sold at 50 billion!

731
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,530
Who on earth is she?

732
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:07,660
She said she was from Cheong Ah Group.

733
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:11,520
In the end, Chairman Ju is going to get all, even the golden land.

734
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,600
He sucks.

735
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,750
Ju Dan Tae, that lowlife.

736
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:18,540
I hated seeing him on his high horse, and I wanted to stomp him good.

737
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,660
I'm so upset.

738
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:24,600
But doesn't she seem quite familiar somehow?

739
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:28,410
She has a cold air about her and looks very familiar.

740
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:32,360
I can't quite put my finger on where I've seen her.

741
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,390
I know, right?

742
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,170
Yeah.

743
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:04,340
Finally, we got the property at Number 27.

744
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:10,350
No matter how I think, 50 billion is too expensive. Fifty million would've been a windfall.

745
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:14,260
All the land we own will skyrocket in price like crazy starting tomorrow.

746
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:19,430
Cheonsu District will be hit by a storm.  I guarantee it.

747
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:27,770
My car's here. Hanging up now.

748
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:37,400
Do you still have something to say?

749
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:43,720
I keep thinking you don't seem a bad person.

750
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:48,920
But seeing how crazy you are about money, I can tell you really are Ju Dan Tae's person.

751
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,020
I no longer expect anything of you, nor will I come looking for you anymore.

752
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:57,880
I hope you never get in my way again.

753
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,550
What a pity for Su Ryeon's sake.

754
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:08,050
She was too gentle a person to have been used and killed by a person like you.

755
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:13,420
I hope you live the rest of your life filled with guilt towards her.

756
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:24,940
What is this?

757
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,900
You said you wanted to see her.

758
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,810
Follow me.

759
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,250
Hurry and get in, Cheon Seo Jin!

760
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,960
Will you be okay?

761
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,300
I have a secret place that even Father doesn't know about. Don't worry about me.

762
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,410
I'm helping you because of Ro Na's mom.

763
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,880
What are you doing? Hurry, get in!

764
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,860
Get in quick!

765
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,050
Why did you want to see me?

766
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,400
Oh Yun Hui, save me.

767
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,600
Please save me, Yun Hui.

768
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,280
What are you saying? Explain so I can understand.

769
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,400
The person who caused Ro Na's death is indeed Eun Byeol.

770
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,280
Eun Byeol did it.

771
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,120
I've committed a grave sin to you and Ro Na, too.

772
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,490
But there's a trap.

773
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:16,730
Ju Dan Tae is somehow involved in all this.

774
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:21,290
I need you if I want to catch Ro Na's real killer.

775
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:26,030
Help me, Yun Hui.

776
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:58,310
 Advanced Mathematics 

777
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:02,640
 Seok Hun. 

778
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,500
 It's me. 

779
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:13,720
These are the pictures of Na Ae Gyo's whereabouts for the past few days.

780
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:19,700
She's made no special outings other than to a restaurant.

781
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:25,890
You don't need to keep an eye on her anymore.

782
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:28,030
Understood.

783
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:38,890
Wait.

784
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,030
 I feel so sorry for  Sim Su Ryeon. 

785
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:10,180
 She was too gentle a person to have been used and killed by someone like you. 

786
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,420
Thank you.

787
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:19,690
For still remembering me.

788
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,060
What are you doing?

789
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,130
You're Su Ryeon!

790
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:58,420
You're indeed Su Ryeon!

791
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:02,990
Don't think about running away anymore.

792
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:10,220
I'm sorry for recognizing you so late.

793
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,960


794
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,310
 War in Life: Penthouse II 

795
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:57,490
 How beautiful now that you acknolwedged you've lost. 

796
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,720
 Sim Su Ryeon is dead. 

797
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,860
 I couldn't forgive myself for leaving for the airport ahead of you. 

798
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,430
 I'll never forgive you. 

799
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:04,650
 I can't guarantee Eun Byeol's safety. 

800
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,390
 Please let me kill him myself. 

801
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,230
 Didn't Sim Su Ryeon also know before she died? 

802
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:09,700
 The game's over. 

803
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,420
 Use the penthouse as a collateral and get a loan. 

804
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,660
 Did Na Ae Gyo deceive the Chairman? 

805
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,750
 I'm going to kill Na Ae Gyo! 

806
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,940
 Na Ae Gyo died last night.
