00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,300
 Episode 7 

2
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,370
Did you complete the analysis of the necklace?

3
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,460
Yes.  It has Bae Ro Na's blood on it.

4
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,850
It was an exact match with Bae Ro Na's DNA found at her house.

5
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,070
There is Bae Ro Na's blood on Ha Eun Byeol's necklace.

6
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,960
This is a funny twist of events.

7
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,370
- When did you say Bae Ro Na's funeral was?  
 - Today.

8
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,830
Who's going?

9
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,690
Oh Yun Hui didn't publish an obituary. So far as I know, only she and her husband CEO Ha.

10
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,680
Apparently, her parents haven't been able to build up loyal friends around them.

11
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,620
It's going to be a very lonesome funeral.

12
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,970
 Cheon Seo Jin 

13
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,260
 Cheon Seo Jin 

14
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,510
I told you today was Ro Na's funeral and for you to not contact me.

15
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,750
Eun Byeol's Dad! Eun Byeol! Our Eun Byeol! Come hom quickly!

16
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,570
What? What about Eun Byeol?

17
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,580
Mom!

18
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,540
 Hurry and come over right now! 

19
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,990
 Hey! Eun Byeol! 

20
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,150
 Eun Byeol! Stop! Eun Byeol! 

21
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,960
 Sorry, Yun Hui. There's an emergency at work. 

22
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,980
 I can't leave here. 

23
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,600
 Bae Ro Na 

24
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,550
Are you in such a hurry to die?

25
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,510
Let go!

26
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,590
I'm going to go to my Ro Na. I can't send her away alone like this.

27
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,770
Do you think this is why I let you live?

28
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,040
I'm going to get punished myself.

29
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,300
You can die whenever you want to, but shouldn't you find out first who did this to Ro Na?

30
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,370
The real culprit...is out there.

31
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,430
What do you mean, the real culprit? Who is it?

32
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,590
Ha Eun Byeol.

33
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,680
Behind her, there is Cheon Seo Jin.

34
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,970
Eun Byeol! No, Eun Byeol!

35
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,290
Eun Byeol!

36
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,140
- Why are you being like this?
 - I told you to go away!

37
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,280
Eun Byeol! Stop! Eun Byeol!

38
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,790
Go away!

39
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,220
Eun Byeol!

40
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,770
Eun Byeol, Mom's right here. Get it together! Please!

41
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:17,480
Over there, Ro Na has come. Over there!

42
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,190
No. Ro Na is dead.

43
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,580
She can't come back ever again! How many times do I have to tell you!

44
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,890
No! Over there!

45
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,170
There! Ro Na is right there!

46
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,240
Eun Byeol!

47
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,850
Eun Byeol.

48
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,730
Eun Byeol!

49
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,890
Dad.

50
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,970
Eun Byeol, it's okay. There, my girl, it's okay.

51
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,300
Please save me, Dad!

52
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,900
I'm so scared I'm going crazy.

53
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,890
Ro Na keeps showing up.

54
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,250
She keeps telling me to die.

55
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,060
That laughter.

56
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,200
Eun Byeol!

57
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,530
What can I do for you? Please.

58
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,580
Dad, cut my brain out with a knife.

59
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,590
You're a doctor.

60
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,350
Please take Ro Na out of my head!

61
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,060
No, Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol!

62
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,890
Dad, please do something for me!

63
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,920
I so want to  get some sleep.

64
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,670
I'm going to protect you. Trust your dad.

65
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,850
I'll do whatever I can to erase this memory from you.

66
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,510
Dad!

67
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,250
Dad!

68
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,580
Pull yourself together, Oh Yun Hui! Are you going to cave in like this?

69
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,270
Are you sure it was Ha Eun Byeol who did it?

70
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,250
- Stay alive and confirm it yourself.
 - No.

71
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,920
I don't want to know.

72
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,580
What can I do at this point?

73
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:52,960
If I hadn't come back for revenge, Ro Na wouldn't have died. What's the point of payback?

74
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,230
Why did you let my daughter come back?

75
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,120
You should've somehow stopped her.

76
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,880
Don't you really know why Ro Na came back?

77
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,150
Ro Na asked for a favor. To me.

78
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,120
 - Please let me go back to Korea. 
 - You can't. It's too dangerous over there. 

79
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,500
 I want to realize Seol Ah's dream on her behalf. 

80
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,790
 I'll make sure to win the grand-prize trophy at the Cheong Ah Arts Festival. 

81
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:29,780
 If I do, wouldn't Seol Ah forgive my mom at least a little? 

82
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,610
Ro Na, why did you do that? Why, because of me?

83
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,980
Why did you, because of me?  Why, because of me, Ro Na!

84
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,980
- Do you still want to die?
 - My one and only daughter, how, how!

85
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,970
If it's your wish to die,

86
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,920
go ahead and die then.

87
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,620
If you want to stay broken, despair, and give up as you are now,

88
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,860
it would be better to die just as they want you to.

89
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,750
But remember this one thing,

90
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,140
Ha Yun Cheol is involved in Ro Na's death, too.

91
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,600
Wait!

92
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,570
What did you just say? Did you say Ha Yun Cheol?

93
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,570
No way. You must be mistaken. Ha Yun Cheol would never.

94
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,340
Ha Yun Cheol is with Ha Eun Byeol right now.

95
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,240
Ha Yun Cheol, too, is aware that his daughter is the culprit.

96
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,130
If you're okay with your daughter's murderer living happily,

97
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,090
do as you please.

98
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,890
That can't be.

99
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,390
Yun Cheol would never. He would never. That can't be.

100
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,550
No! I'm telling you that can't be!

101
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,670
Yun Cheol would never!

102
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,870
That's the only way now.

103
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,760
Eun Byeol wants it too.

104
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,440
There could be side effects.

105
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,750
On the other hand, there could be  no side effects.

106
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,850
Our Eun Byeol is barely 19 years old now.

107
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,990
The days in front of her are as numerous as the stars in the sky.

108
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,750
We can't tell her to live in hell.

109
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,630
How can we?

110
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,370
Right, nothing will happen.

111
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,870
Nothing.

112
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:56,130
 Be here with us so that Ro Na won't be lonely on her way. Please.  
   

113
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,480
 I'll be waiting for you.  

114
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,260
Who are you?

115
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,430
Sim Su Ryeon?

116
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,260
Have you been well?

117
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,910
It's been a while, Ju Dan Tae.

118
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,010
Hey, what are you doing?

119
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,430
You have that aggressive way about you when you say hello.

120
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,100
- Na Ae Gyo? 
 - Zip it  back up.

121
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,720
Why? Did you think Sim Su Ryeon came back from the dead?

122
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,960
Did I surprise you, Dan Tae?

123
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,500
Wow, you really were surprised!

124
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,650
How cute!

125
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,150
What happenend? When did you come back?

126
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,190
I came here straight from the airport.

127
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,060
Did you like it? My surprise gift for you.

128
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,410
You're talented in scaring people.

129
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,450
You should've told me in advance that you were coming.

130
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,220
That way, I would've met you up at the airport.

131
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,970
How tacky. Coming out to meet me? Don't you know how I hate anything like that?

132
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,830
I lived locked away in a country for two years.

133
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,980
How hot and humid the place was, and that wretched weather!

134
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,840
I thought I was going utterly crazy.

135
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,090
Then you should have come back sooner.

136
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,580
Why did you aggravate me refusing to come?

137
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,230
If you held out this month too, I was going to get you myself.

138
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,920
Sim Su Ryeon is dead.

139
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,380
I felt a little weird.

140
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,750
It was as if...

141
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,880
I had died.

142
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,260
It's understandable how you could feel that way.

143
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,470
Since you lived half of your life as Sim Su Ryeon.

144
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,650
You didn't run into anyone, did you?

145
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,280
I saw the helpers going out.

146
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,650
I hear they're supposed to come back after 3 p.m.

147
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,940
Penthouse?

148
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,850
This place is crazy.

149
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,990
How much is all  this worth?

150
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,150
I'm roughly guessing what's in this room alone,

151
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,380
wow, could come up to be about a million.

152
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,710
Sim Su Ryeon was very lucky.

153
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,760
She lived her whole life in all this glittering luxury.

154
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,110
But then, what's the point?  It's all over once you're dead.

155
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,560
You can't be here. The kids will be here soon.

156
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,450
Besides, nothing good will come out of you  running into the Hera Palace residents.

157
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,150
Let's go out and talk.

158
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,430
So what?

159
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,100
Weren't they all going to find out one way or another?

160
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,920
That I'm Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong's real mother.

161
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,600
Then why did you call me back?

162
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,150
I couldn't tell the kids yet. It's a sensitive time for them, and they need some time to process.

163
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,140
What the hell do you mean more time?

164
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,950
It's not like I'm going to raise them.

165
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,060
What I want is this penthouse, not the place of being their mother.

166
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,870
Wearing long dresses that I don't even like,

167
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,010
sipping the expensive wine that aren't my taste,

168
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,580
wearing that mask of Sim Su Ryeon,

169
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,090
I've lived twenty years of my life!

170
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,120
Doesn't that give me the right to enjoy myself?

171
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,800
Hello, this is Sim Su Ryeon.

172
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,870
I heard a lot about you from my late father.

173
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,070
That you have a long relationship with us, Simwoon Construction.

174
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,790
I'm sick of this!

175
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,790
You promised that you'd let me live  as Na Ae Gyo in this penthouse!

176
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,180
I'll make that happen. I will. Just be patient a little longer until the things get settled.

177
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,290
How do I trust you?

178
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,530
This is a drug that's still in clinical trials.

179
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,850
It can erase a recent traumatic memory.

180
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,950
What are the side effects?

181
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,550
When injecting this drug, she could undergo seizures,

182
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,110
or her memories may get distorted after she wakes up.

183
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,260
In a worst-case scenario,

184
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,510
she could lose all of her memories.

185
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,620
My Eun Byeol

186
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,770
has always been lucky.

187
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,460
Please begin.

188
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,630
  Yun Hui  

189
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,990
  The person you are trying to call cannot be reached...  

190
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,820
  Ro Na! Walk out with me!  

191
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,990
 - No, wait. 
-  Ro Na! Ro Na!  

192
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,640
  Get your hands off of my daughter!  

193
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,400
  Ro Na!  

194
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,550
  If you lay your hands on my Ro Na once again,  

195
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,050
  I will go to the law.  

196
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,300
No.

197
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,310
I'm sure it's not.

198
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,350
Yun Cheol isn't as bad a person as that.

199
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,090
I'm sure Logan has his facts wrong.

200
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,320
Yun Cheol will come. He will come, for sure.

201
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,350
Eun Byeol!

202
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,340
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol! What's going on?

203
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,700
  Inducing REM sleep  

204
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,130
Is something wrong? Is she okay?

205
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,070
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol!

206
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,410
Eun Byeol! Mom is right here! Eun Byeol!

207
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,130
Eun Byeol! What do we do?

208
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,080
The drug went in too fast.

209
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,490
She had a shock. I injected some sedative.

210
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,460
She's okay now.

211
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,290
  Yun Hui  

212
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,380
Were we aiming for the 100th story of Hera Palace?

213
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,950
A penthouse that's much higher and more elegant will soon be built in Cheonsuji-gu.

214
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,550
Did you get the development rights?

215
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,500
Compensating the land owners there will be no joke.

216
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,560
No problem there. I know Cheon Seo Jin's fatal weakness.

217
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,370
Weakness?

218
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,500
Does a woman like Cheon Seo Jin have a weakness?

219
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,920
That's quite interesting.

220
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,820
What is it?

221
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,380
Cheon Seo Jin's daughter killed a kid.

222
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,980
Worse, the kid is the daughter of the woman who hates Cheon Seo Jin's guts, and

223
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,350
vice versa, she's also the woman Cheon Seo Jin hates.

224
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,740
Killed?

225
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,900
No matter how ruthless Cheon Seo Jin is,

226
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,220
do you think she'll be able to handle  her daughter going to prison?

227
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,400
The whole Cheong Ah Group,

228
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,190
may fall into our lap with this opportunity. It can be ours.

229
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,460
Really?

230
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,410
Is Ju Dan Tae Village going to finally be completed?

231
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,110
Just be careful not to get caught till then.

232
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,350
If who you are is disclosed, our plan will come to nothing.

233
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,300
I'm so looking forward to this.

234
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,470
The penthouse that'll come into Cheonsuji-gu.

235
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,500
Just thinking about it makes me...oh my!

236
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,440
You know that's my share, right?

237
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,610
So stop working yourself up, and just do what I tell you to.

238
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,060
You've been waiting all your life.

239
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,060
The day you can live in the penthouse with our Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong.

240
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,500
How nice! To feel your breath again. It's been so long.

241
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,340
I think the kids are home. Do you want to see them though from afar?

242
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,350
No need. What's the point?

243
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,500
I've lived this long just fine without seeing them.

244
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,370
It's not like I feel attached to the kids.

245
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,670
This way.

246
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,400
Oppa, aren't you not going to the tutoring today? Did you skip it again?

247
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,820
Why?

248
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,420
Whatever.

249
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,670
I can't believe you.

250
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,650
Ladies first.

251
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,130
Do you like it?

252
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,890
  Bae Ro Na 
 2004.4.8 ~ 2022.4.3 

253
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,400
   A flower that died too early.  We hope you become a star that shines brightly in the night sky.  

254
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,330
Ro Na's mother!

255
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,510
Who was it? Who was the person that bribed you that day?

256
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,070
Please don't be like this!

257
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,980
Please spare me! I did wrong!

258
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,200
Who is it? Tell me who it is!

259
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,080
Well...

260
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,140
  Ha Yun Cheol  
 010 0865 3210 

261
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,140
Ha Yun Cheol.

262
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,010
  Logan Lee  

263
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,660
Ha Yun Cheol. Where is that bastard?

264
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,680
Go get some sleep. You  didn't get any.

265
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,650
Our Eun Byeol

266
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,270
will wake up no problem, right?

267
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,370
With all the bad memories forgotten?

268
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,900
Yes, that's how she will be.

269
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,270
If it weren't for you,  I wouldn't have been able to go through this.

270
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:48,820
I realize this as  I saw you truly caring about Eun Byeol and showing no concern for yourself.

271
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,000
That both Eun Byeol

272
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,400
and I ...

273
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,640
need you.

274
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:35,150
  But remember this one thing, Ha Yun Cheol is involved in Ro Na's death, too.  

275
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,140
While my daughter has died,

276
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,420
are you so busy trying not to make your daughter the murderer?

277
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,850
My kid died because of your daughter!

278
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,730
Do you have more sympathy for your killer daughter than my dead daughter?

279
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,330
What right does your daughter have to be happy?

280
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,870
Your daughter doesn't have the right to be happy either!

281
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,150
- No! 
 - Yun Hui! No!

282
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,300
No!

283
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,000
Oppa, are you being like this because of Bae Ro Na?

284
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,300
Not eating, not talking, and not going to the tutoring.

285
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,000
How many days has it been? Isn't this going overboard?

286
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,460
Shut your trap.

287
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,070
If you are the least bit sorry to Ro Na ...

288
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,360
Why should I be sorry?

289
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,360
When there's someone else who committed the crime.

290
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,150
I know the real killer of Bae Ro Na.

291
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,180
Someone should be happy! That thorn in her eye, Bae Ro Na is gone.

292
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,790
Right. The one you're thinking of.

293
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,000
Ha Eun Byeol. Ha Eun Byeol is the culprit.

294
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,790
On what basis are you saying that?

295
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,770
I played a prank on her.

296
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,260
I told her you were terribly fond of Bae Ro Na.

297
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,090
That bitch's eyes were spinning!

298
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,960
Even so, how can you kill someone just because of what was said?

299
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,400
I would never have imagined it.

300
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Seok Gyeong, you! What did you do? Why did you do that?!

301
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:44,420
What did Ro Na ever do to you?

302
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,220
Don't go.

303
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,340
Don't go to Yun Hui.

304
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,660
I must go.

305
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,290
I couldn't even go to Ro Na's funeral.   It must be so difficult for her to be alone.

306
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,130
Don't you think that's being more cruel to Yun Hui?

307
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,500
Your daughter killed Oh Yun Hui's daughter.

308
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,970
But to be with that woman, you're deceiving her!

309
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,990
Indeed, isn't that sheer lunacy?

310
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,710
What will she say  if Oh Yun Hui finds out?

311
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,670
She'll say you're shameless and make her skin crawl. So much so she'll tear our family apart.

312
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,870
What can we do?

313
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,760
If Oh Yun Hui tells us to die, we should.

314
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,000
Both you and I.

315
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,310
Can't we

316
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,980
start over again?

317
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,250
- Are you nuts? 
 - I know!

318
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,250
What pain I've caused you.

319
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,500
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry I could die.

320
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,190
Please forgive me. Please give me just one more chance.

321
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,590
I'll be good to you forever.

322
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,500
Don't get me wrong. I'm not here because I like you or feel sorry for you.

323
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,680
It's because I am Eun Byeol's dad.

324
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,600
I can't help it because of Eun Byeol.

325
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,300
I'm no longer your man.  The only person in my head is Oh Yun Hui.

326
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,400
You and she are already finished.  Don't you know that yet?

327
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,200
I'm not doing this for me alone.   It's for our Eun Byeol's sake.

328
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,720
If you only change your mind, our family can return to what we used to be.

329
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,930
We can be happy.

330
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,760
Happiness?

331
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:15,590
Will such a thing even be possible for us?

332
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,140
Don't leave.

333
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,260
Stop right there.

334
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,410
Don't go to Oh Yun Hui!

335
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,140
Don't go to her.

336
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,160
CEO Ha.

337
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,840
You must be very sad because Bae Ro Na whom you regarded as your real daughter is dead.

338
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:09,000
When is the funeral? You have to let me know.

339
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,390
I may not know much about anything,

340
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,980
but I am going to send the most expensive wreath.

341
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,840
Getting a  sympathy floral offering from an assemblyman will make the funeral house look right.

342
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,290
How does Yun Hui get the strength to go on?

343
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:31,040
I think you're drunk.  Hurry home.

344
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,470
But, you know?

345
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:38,950
No matter how hard I think about it, the culprit who killed Ro Na

346
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,250
can't be Mr. Park.

347
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:49,350
My Min Hyeok told me Mr. Park especially liked Ro Na.

348
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,200
The case was already concluded. And the culprit confessed too.

349
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,300
Right. The culprit did confess.

350
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,990
But then again,

351
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:08,940
in the past too, when Min Seol Ah died, everyone said it was suicide.

352
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,810
But I was the only one who said it was a murder.

353
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:20,610
This time, too, maybe there's a killer in our Hera Palace.

354
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,470
Cheon Seo Jin.  There's no way it's her, is there?

355
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,160
She got angry at you and Oh Yun Hui for marrying and

356
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,090
took it out on Bae Ro Na.

357
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,410
You son of a bitch! Really!

358
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,970
If you're drunk, go home quietly and sleep it off.

359
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,700
Don't go running off at the mouth.

360
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,100
 The person you are calling has turned off the  phone. 

361
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,860
Are you awake?

362
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,400
Are you okay?

363
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,130
All night long you were sick and kept talking nonsense.

364
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:59,200
Can you handle Cheon Seo Jin and Ju Dan Tae when you are so out of it?

365
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,950
From now on, you need to face Ha Yun Cheol too.

366
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:07,360
How much do you know about my Ro Na's death?

367
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,490
Tell me what I don't know.

368
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:20,530
This is what Ha Eun Byeol and Cheon Seo Jin did on the day of the incident.

369
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:26,900
Presumably, Ha Eun Byeol's dress was in that bag.

370
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,580
I checked the dress with my own eyes.

371
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,980
There was nothing on it.

372
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,030
I had a hard time finding this.

373
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,220
I searched every dress shop in Seoul.

374
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:49,470
She replicated the  dress of the same design at another shop.

375
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:00,000
Then who set off the fire alarm?

376
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,930
Was that also Cheon Seo Jin?

377
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,640
Or...

378
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,920
Ha Yun Cheol?

379
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,670
From what we know so far, it's neither.

380
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,750
The time and their movement don't match.

381
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:19,120
Do you mean it really malfunctioned? Of all times, why at that time?

382
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,500
They could have ordered someone else to do it. Secretary Do or whomever.

383
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,940
I'm sure they were trying to destroy the evidence.

384
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,780
Up to now it's all circumstantial.  There's nothing conclusive.

385
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm going to kill Cheon Seo Jin. Ha Yun Cheol and Ha Eun Byeol. I'm going to kill them all!

386
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,220
Oh Yun Hui. It's still too premature to make a move.

387
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,980
I don't give a damn.

388
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,680
I'll kill them and if I die too, so be it.

389
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,530
I don't want to live another minute, another second!

390
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,150
Having my eyes open right now disgusts me.

391
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:55,340
Even you caused the death of someone's child.

392
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,460
If you're going to die, don't forget your debt to Su Ryeon and Seol Ah.

393
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,880
Pay that up before you die.

394
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,620
That way when you meet Ro Na later, don't you think you can be a little less ashamed?

395
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,050
Then what makes you so proud?

396
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,490
Who took her bone marrow and then voided her adoption?

397
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:15,850
If you're that sorry to Seol Ah, go take it up with your parents!

398
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,000
Ms. Oh Yun Hui!

399
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,120
Please leave us for a moment.

400
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,880
I have to go back to America soon.

401
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,680
Once I leave here, you alone can pay back Seol Ah and Su Ryeon's enemies.

402
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,210
I killed Min Seol Ah.

403
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,640
With what right, can I get revenge on her enemies?

404
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,530
What on earth can I do?

405
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,430
Find Na Ae Gyo. The twin's birth mother.

406
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,720
She knows all of Ju Dan Tae's secrets.

407
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,480
 It's Na Ae Gyo. 

408
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,810
 There's something I need to tell you before I leave. 

409
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:15,070
 Whatever that bastard Ju Dan Tae did to Sim Su Ryeon, 

410
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,550
 and what kind of bastard he is. 

411
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,600
 If I don't tell you today, I may not be able to tell you forever. 

412
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,500
After that day, she disappeared.

413
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,790
This is—

414
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,260
It's Na Ae Gyo.

415
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,170
She looks exactly like Sim Su Ryeon.

416
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,420
That makes no sense.

417
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,410
You've got to find this woman.

418
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:49,180
For the last two years, although I've monitored Ju Dan Tae's every single move,

419
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,020
I couldn't find her.  But she recently surfaced.

420
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,850
This is the information of her entering Korea from Thailand last week.

421
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,630
I'm sure she'll come in contact with Ju Dan Tae.

422
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,430
What's going on?

423
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,710
Someone like you who never wakes up at this hour is having breakfast.

424
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:23,250
Is it because I changed where I sleep? I woke up early.

425
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,300
I was hungry too.

426
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,050
What's up so early in the morning?

427
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,950
I have some things to take care of right away.

428
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,780
I need to sell the buildings under your name in Gangnam quickly.  I need cash.

429
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,470
There are fire sales in Cheonsuji-gu.

430
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,680
Before the development is announced, I must buy the real estate at cheap prices.

431
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:46,220
Is that why you made such a fuss, telling me to come back to Korea quickly?

432
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,680
To sell and get rid of some buildings?

433
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,130
Of course not.

434
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,280
I missed you more than anything.

435
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:07,110
Now that I see you, you look a lot better.

436
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,710
- Are you happy to be dating Cheon Seo Jin? 
 - You know that it's all an act.

437
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,550
You're the only woman for me  for the rest of my life.

438
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,840
Your acting skills improved a lot.

439
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,410
It's been a while. Shall we play a game, cool?

440
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,040
You improved a lot. I guess all you did in Thailand was playing pocket billiards.

441
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,670
You weren't even competition for me, to begin with.

442
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,650
Hurry and hit.

443
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,260
Mom.

444
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,450
- Mom. 
 - Eun Byeol!

445
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,780
It's Mom. Are you awake?

446
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,930
Why did I sleep so much? Am I not late for school?

447
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:11,030
- We're at the hospital. 
 - Hospital?

448
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,790
Why am I at the hospital?

449
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,740
I think you weren't sleeping enough and overexerted yourself.

450
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,630
You fainted all of a sudden.

451
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,290
I fainted? Did I?

452
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:29,390
What date is it today? I have to get ready for the CAA Festival.

453
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,700
- That is already finished. 
 - What?

454
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,060
Finished? What do you mean?

455
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't remember anything!

456
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:46,080
Then what about the grand prize? Who won the prize?

457
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,150
Oh, the grand prize,

458
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:52,350
Ro Na got it.

459
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,950
Ro Na?

460
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,870
Did she really get it?

461
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,100
I'm sorry, Mom.

462
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,150
You're really mad, right?

463
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,570
Don't you really remember a thing?

464
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,720
That Ro Na is dead even?

465
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,560
Why did Ro Na die? Why all of a sudden?

466
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,510
Oh that,

467
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:32,390
there was an accident. I'll tell you everything later.

468
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,190
There's no need for you to force yourself to remember.

469
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,760
Why don't I remember anything?

470
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,200
Am I sick somewhere? I still need to take my midterm,

471
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,600
and I have a mock test coming up too.

472
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,630
What if I ruin the tests?

473
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,000
I want to go home fast now. I have to study.

474
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,410
No,  you're not  sick. You're fine, Eun Byeol.

475
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,860
You just need to rest at home!

476
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,270
They're all in the past.

477
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,370
Nothing ever happened.

478
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,350
It's all okay!

479
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,810
  She doesn't remember anything, and even singing at the CAA Festival,   

480
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,930
or that Ro Na has died. She doesn't remember a thing.

481
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,880
There seemed to be no side effects.

482
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,530
It's too early to let down your guard. Monitor her carefully.

483
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:32,950
I'll have her discharged right away. At home, she'll feel more secure anyway.

484
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,220
Eun Byeol,

485
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,430
you're going to come and see her, right?

486
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,770
I'll get in touch with you.

487
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,550
Where are you, Yun Hui?

488
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,150
This is the lobby of our Hera Palace!

489
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,970
Doesn't it look like a luxurious hotel in some foreign place?

490
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,510
And this fountain is the landmark of our Hera Palace.

491
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:26,000
You should take a picture here to commemorate your visit.

492
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,940
Of all the assemblymen, the only one who lives in Hera Palace

493
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,300
is Assemblyman Lee Gyu Jin, right?

494
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,530
Because of the many eyes watching us, we just live in an apartment with a lease.

495
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:39,430
That makes no sense! Is it wrong having money?

496
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:43,270
To be an assemblyman, you need to be good at making money

497
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,240
and know how to scam to a certain point.

498
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,450
How can a man poor himself manage the nation's money?

499
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,140
Exactly!

500
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,000
No one feeds you just because you're clean and honorable.

501
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,320
Right? Let's take that photo of commemoration! Stand right over there.

502
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,830
Say, "Kimchi, cheese."  Smile!

503
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,180
Sorry!

504
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,960
What are you doing? I almost fell over!

505
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,120
Do they know that a person died right here?

506
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,600
Are you out of your mind? What if they find out?

507
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,070
How come are you getting so shameless every day?

508
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,840
Ro Na died not long ago, and here you're, bringing people,

509
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,940
saying "Kimchi, Cheese!" and laughing?

510
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:38,280
When you're the wife of an assemblyman, you should build your character.

511
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,100
T- That woman, really!

512
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,800
- Mrs., Number three! 
 - Coming!

513
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,530
It's so nice to see you  in here!

514
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:06,660
I heard that you're so good at giving body scrubs!

515
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,670
Whether you're just full of talk, or you're good with your hands,

516
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,110
I came to see with my own eyes, Lady from Jincheon.

517
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,160
Lie down, Madam.

518
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:26,200
Ouch! You're scrubbing me to the point where it hurts!

519
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,460
Ahjumma! Are you trying to damage my tender skin?

520
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,880
I'm sorry, Madam. I'll be gentle.

521
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:43,830
You can't even get the water temperature right! How can you make a living like that?

522
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,030
Ah, that feels nice!

523
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:52,660
Lady from Jincheon, trim my nails too.

524
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,430
Do those of the ladies next to me as well.

525
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:59,730
That's not a service included in the package.

526
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,750
I'll give you five dollars more! Why, don't you want it?

527
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,540
Are you saying five dollars isn't even money for you?

528
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,210
What, you've earned enough, is that it?

529
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,020
Hey, where is the owner?

530
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,940
What kind of a scrub lady works like this? Where is the owner?

531
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,510
Out of you three grandmas, who is the owner?

532
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,510
I'm asking who? Who?

533
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:36,370
Is this how you train your scrub lady?

534
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,990
Oh, Chairwoman, what brought you here?

535
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:44,070
- Chairwoman? 
 - She is Chairwoman Song Hui Su of Hae Yeon Group.

536
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:47,570
This is Chairwoman Byeon, and that is Chairwoman Choi.

537
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:52,350
Hurry up and introduce yourself!

538
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,720
Chairwoman S- Song.

539
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,140
- Mrs. Kang. 
 - Yes, Madam.

540
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,270
Why did you take in a rag like her?  My ears are hurting, listening to her crap.

541
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:08,430
This is my job. It's okay, Madam.

542
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:12,100
I'm not okay. You're my people.

543
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,060
I alone can address you as Lady from Jincheon.

544
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,290
How dare someone talks down to Lady from Jincheon?

545
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:20,650
Who is it?

546
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,720
Plus, I don't get into the water where politicians have been in.

547
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,200
Throw away the tub water, and fill it again.

548
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,130
Yes, Madam.

549
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:32,970
- Drain the tub! 
 - Yes!

550
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:37,990
- Is our niece Je Ni doing well? 
 - Yes, of course.

551
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:40,920
She is very busy preparing to enter college.

552
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,320
If anyone messes with you or annoys you, contact me at any time.

553
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,820
We'll go and tell them off.

554
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:53,430
You're refreshingly tight-mouthed. You never ask for help.

555
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:57,000
I'll get some refreshing ice coffee for you all.

556
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,040
- Let's go. 
 - Yes. All right.

557
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,860
What's happening here?

558
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,630
Darn it!

559
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:27,920
Honey! It's me, Gyu JIn.

560
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,390
You must've had many customers today.  You're all swollen from water.

561
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,560
This is still—

562
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:48,070
Je Ni's Mom. He's basically a loser.

563
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,900
Please understand with an open mind.

564
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,240
I can knock him out with one punch.  Just let him have it!

565
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:00,440
Is that woman crazy? Now, you—

566
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,630
- "You?" Who are you referring to?  Madame Kang?
 - Did you just say, Madame Kang? Are you crazy?

567
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,390
Let me go.

568
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:11,960
Hold it in. Just hold it in for the rest of your life!

569
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,550
I said hold it in!

570
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:22,400
She's been the real thing. Je Ni's Mom is the scrub lady for the famous Three Madams.

571
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,000
What?

572
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,640
How are you feeling?

573
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,680
I haven't seen you, Eun Byeol since the Arts Festival.

574
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,320
What are you doing here without letting me know in advance?

575
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,720
I came to see you. And Eun Byeol too.

576
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,260
Eun Byeol, go to your room.

577
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,730
You weren't answering your phone.

578
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,570
Is something wrong?

579
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:10,320
Eun Byeol wasn't feeling too well, so I got her some intravenous injection at the hospital.

580
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,960
So you went to the hosptial.

581
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:24,420
Remember that we're going to have lunch with Assemblyman Lee and his wife tomorrow.

582
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,580
Are we?

583
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,070
I forgot about it.

584
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,860
Can't we move it to another day?

585
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,380
If we move it to another day, what will that big mouth say to us?

586
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:38,920
He bragged so much about getting the approval on completing Cheong Ah Arts Center.

587
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,600
I've got scabs in my ears.

588
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,760
It's just for lunch, so we'll finish early and get up, okay?

589
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:07,400
  This is the song I will sing at the CAA Festival. What do you think?  
    

590
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,770
  This song would suit 

591
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,720
  your voice well.  

592
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:21,470
 At the graduation ceremony, I want to sing solo on behalf of all the graduates. 

593
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:24,310
 Will you be my accompanist then? 

594
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,950
  I've never thought about doing that.  

595
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,060
  I really need you to do that. For me.   

596
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,480
  You're going to do it, right?  

597
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,880
I'll think about it.

598
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:52,110
 Cheong Ah Arts School  

599
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:15,590
Have you been here?

600
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,920
I can't believe that Rona is dead.

601
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,090
 I know the one who killed Bae Ro Na. 

602
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,660
 Ha Eun Byeol. 

603
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,200
 Ha Eun Byeol is the one. 

604
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:39,460
How's your condition? Are you feeling okay?

605
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:43,210
Since you were absent, I figured you were very sick.

606
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:46,570
Yeah, I was hospitalized.

607
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:50,640
Where were you when the CAA Festival was over?

608
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,530
You mean that day?

609
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,780
I heard I fainted at school because I took so many sedative pills.

610
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,800
Apparently, Secretary Do carried me home.

611
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,800
After that, I don't remember a thing.

612
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,220
Did you say you were carried out?

613
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,490
Yeah.

614
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:14,830
Didn't you meet Ro Na before the award ceremony?

615
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:17,280
No, I didn't.

616
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,550
As far as I can remember.

617
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:28,880
I bet you're going through a tough time because of Ro Na.

618
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,710
It's true that I hated Ro Na, but I don't want to stay jealous of someone who's dead.

619
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:37,720
So you can grieve over her death as much as you like.

620
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,670
Seok Hun.

621
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,870
What's wrong?

622
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:18,570
Ha Eun Byeol, let's go steady.

623
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,800
What?

624
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,070
I said we should go steady.

625
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,810
I think I'm beginning to really like you.

626
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,170
Do you really mean it?

627
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,120
What you said?

628
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,470
Alright, shall we toast?

629
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,200
- Cheers!
 - Cheers!

630
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,770
I must say the best time to drink is during the day. Don't you think so, Chairman Ju?

631
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:56,490
You seem getting emboldened every day with how you care less about the affairs of state.

632
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,620
You purposely chose the midday to see us.

633
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,270
This evening, I have three appointments already.

634
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:04,360
I eat three dinners. Korean, Chinese, and Japanese.

635
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,420
I'm getting tired of being an assemblyman.

636
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,580
Why does this country have so many weddings and funerals?

637
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,960
Just saying hellos to people keeps me busy.

638
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,040
It's been a while we, two couples get together like this.

639
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,460
The times we get together like this have been few and far between.

640
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,640
So many things have happened at Hera Palace.

641
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,620
Since we're at it, why don't we make a separate meeting of our own?

642
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,440
We don't see ourselves on a par with the other couples.

643
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,920
Just us, a few people. Isn't this perfect?

644
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:31,290
Ms. Cheon, is something going on with you?

645
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,630
I see you aren't touching any of the precious caviar.

646
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,610
Nothing's going on.

647
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:42,550
Well, why don't we take a photo of us?

648
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,820
For my new SNS channel.

649
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:50,900
If I show off my connection with Seo Jin, won't it increase the number of my followers?

650
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,430
- Alright, look here.
 - Ms. Cheon.

651
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,570
Smile, smile, smile.

652
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:58,610
Wow, that's a good one.

653
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:59,910
It came out well, right?

654
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,610
Now shall I upload it?

655
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,540
Here, here we go.

656
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:07,850
Whoa!
 Kyuginie: Today, I'm having a delicious lunch with Soprano Cheon Seo Jin. 

657
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:10,900
You're amazingly popular, Ms. Seo Jin!
 And I'm enjoying my conversation with her too. I'm so happy! 

658
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,250
Look at the responses I get, the moment I uploaded the picture.

659
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,960
What's all this?

660
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,410
Chairman Ju, did Seo Jin do something wrong?

661
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:25,740
Pardon? Let me see.

662
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:30,210
 Fake Soprano, Cheon Seo Jin / Fraud, Cheon Seo Jin  / A surprising about-face. 

663
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:35,310
Let me see. What is it?

664
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:38,870
I see something in the comments.

665
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:42,760
You fake Soprano, Cheon Seo Jin. You fraud, Cheon Seo Jin.

666
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,620
A perverted tale?

667
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,920
What does all this mean?

668
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,690
 Korea's superstar prima donna, Cheon Seo Jin  

669
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:05,280
 is causing shock waves after she was discovered to have hired a ghost singer at the 20th anniversary concert of her debut.   

670
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,450
There's no truth in hiring a ghost singer.

671
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,460
We'll soon make an official statement.

672
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,670
When?

673
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,370
 Today, the proof that an amateur soprano and Cheon Seo Jin  

674
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,460
 made a transaction worth a substantial sum  of money has been obtained.  

675
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:20,070
 Cheon Seo Jin and her people haven't made any comments yet.  

676
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:25,120
 The cowardly fleeing of the prima donna is making the public's criticism become harsher.  
    

677
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,200
 This has been Lee Mun Hee for Reporter Kim that's after the truths.  

678
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,100
Police investigation? What do you mean?

679
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,330
The media is on high alert, and we can't keep avoiding them.

680
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:36,080
The stockholders of Cheong Ah Group are calling in incessantly.

681
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,360
They demand her immediate resignation from the chairperson's position.

682
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,440
Is that what's important now?

683
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,330
Whatever you do, put off the police investigation as long as you can.

684
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:44,920
Contact Counsel Park and ask him to hurry and come up with an action plan.

685
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,690
- You two may leave. 
 - Yes, Sir.

686
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:57,130
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

687
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:02,690
It may be good for you to take your hands off of the company matters for a while.

688
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:05,860
It's important to calm down the stockholders for now.

689
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:14,560
When something like this happened, you should've consulted me right away.

690
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,360
Why have you been hogging it to yourself like a fool?

691
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,400
It's Oh Yun Hui.

692
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,380
Sorry?

693
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,070
The person who sang for me

694
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:26,450
was Oh Yun Hui.

695
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:32,130
Are you saying it really was Oh Yun Hui?

696
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:35,190
What on earth happened between you two?

697
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:38,870
Tell me everything, and that way, I can help you.

698
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:46,820
 Oh Yun Hui 

699
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:47,890
I'll get it.

700
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:49,590
No.

701
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:57,500
 We should meet. 

702
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,710
I bet you have a lot to say.

703
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:40,870
What about this stage made us want to stand on it so much?

704
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:43,710
Both you and I.

705
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:45,880
And our kids, too.

706
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:52,530
In spite of my ardent objection, Ro Na came back.

707
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,430
She did because of this stage.

708
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:59,220
She wanted to compete in the Arts Festival and win the trophy.

709
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,730
All because of me.

710
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,380
Why are you telling me this now?

711
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:09,070
Do you want to blame me for Ro Na's death too?

712
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:13,300
Ro Na died because of your useless greed.

713
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:19,170
You're right. And that makes me even angrier.

714
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:23,800
My daughter ended up like that because of a no-good mother like me.

715
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,300
So,

716
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,530
I see nothing now except my fury.

717
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,360
Don't try so hard to cover up the fact you hired a ghost singer.

718
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:35,500
The more you do, the more you provoke me.

719
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,250
Why does it have to be  now  of all times?

720
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:41,370
My Eun Byeol isn't in a good condition.

721
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,130
Because my daughter ...

722
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,170
is dead.

723
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,220
 She kept taking my things.  

724
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:56,240
 She was always in my sight and badmouthed you, Mom.  

725
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,010
 That you slashed her mom's throat.  

726
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:04,750
 That you lost to her mom.  

727
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,350
What is it that you want?

728
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,090
I'll do anything.

729
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:18,160
Just don't tell the world that it was you who sang for me.

730
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,260
When you do, you, too, will have to face punishment.

731
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,600
It's better for you to keep quiet for your sake as well.

732
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:29,020
You lost, and yet, you want to keep your pride. Is that it?

733
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:33,760
Why? Are you afraid that the world will know Cheon Seo Jin is below  Oh Yun Hui?

734
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,530
Are you afraid that your daughter will know it too?

735
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:38,060
That's it! And I don't want that!

736
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:41,170
Even if I hit rock bottom,

737
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,420
I do not want to acknowledge that I borrowed your voice!

738
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:46,700
So,

739
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:52,680
please,

740
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,690
I beg of you.

741
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:03,070
  Cheong Ah 

742
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,500
Then kneel before me.

743
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,060
What?

744
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:16,120
Get on your knees and apologize for having slit my throat back then.

745
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,360
Beg and beg again for mercy! Acknowledge that you lost to me 25 years ago already.

746
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,450
Kneel!

747
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,270
I'm sorry.

748
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:56,440
I lost.

749
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,390
For having taken away the grand prize from you,

750
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:08,290
I apologize.

751
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:20,250
 Cheong Ah Arts Festival 1996 

752
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,860
 I will turn myself in. 

753
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:04,850
 Soprano Cheon Seo Jin's Retirement Press Conference 

754
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:16,040
 Soprano Cheon Seo Jin's Retirement Press Conference 

755
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:28,420
To all the fans and people who have showed me your love all this time,

756
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,510
I am here to apologize.

757
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:42,650
Starting today, Soprano Cheon Seo Jin will no longer exist.

758
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:51,460
I will never stand on a stage or sing ever again.

759
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:58,690
 Until the name Cheon Seo Jin became the emblem of all Korean sopranos, 

760
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:01,950
 many of the fans' and the citizens' 

761
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:05,490
 - love and trust made it possible. 
 - No way. 

762
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:10,130
  I thought giving you  good music 

763
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,780
  was how I should express my gratitude. 

764
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:17,150
This is really shocking.

765
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:20,780
How could she completely con the whole nation like that?

766
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:24,470
Dad, you didn't know Ms. Cheon was someone like that either, right?

767
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:28,130
I'm worried we'll also  get dragged in and humiliated along with her.

768
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:31,710
Stop your nonsense and just study hard for college.

769
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:35,320
Are you really going to marry Ms. Cheon?

770
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:40,030
We're already engaged. Should I call it off just because she can't sing anymore?

771
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:42,560
It's not even that big of a deal.

772
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:45,500
You'll regret it.

773
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:50,790
What?

774
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:58,730
 I'm going to  ruin Cheon Seo Jin. 

775
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,920
Ju Seok Hun.

776
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,540
Ju Seok Hun!

777
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:12,420
Are you officially announcing your retirement?

778
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,160
Yes, I am.

779
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,350
Then will you also step down as Chairwoman of Cheong Ah Foundation?

780
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:20,500
To take responsibility as an educator,

781
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,680
I'll follow the decision of the board members of the Foundation.

782
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:30,210
Moreover, I will do my best to refund and compensate for the concert.

783
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:33,730
People are curious about the singer behind that most amazing voice.

784
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:37,380
Could you please reveal who she was?

785
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:43,070
I will take full responsibility for this.

786
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:46,660
I hope no one else will get hurt from my actions.

787
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:52,230
Also I'll earnestly cooperate with the police investigation.

788
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:23,530
Who was the ghost singer?

789
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:26,830
By any chance, was it Ro Na's mom?

790
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,470
It's not.

791
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:33,170
It is. So freaking embarrassing.

792
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:34,130
What?

793
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:36,820
It's so freaking embarrassing that you're my mom.

794
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,520
Don't you have any pride at all?

795
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,820
How could you use Ro Na's mom as your shadow singer?

796
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:46,460
You lost to her in high school, didn't you? That's why you slit her throat.

797
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,400
Eun Byeol, You!

798
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,330
How could you dare to push me so hard to beat Bae Ro Na when you had no right?

799
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:54,230
Why are you taking out your inferiority complex on me?

800
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,430
From now on, don't tell me what to do.

801
01:06:56,430 --> 01:07:01,460
Don't try to teach me or act all high and mighty. You disgust me.

802
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,840
♫  The vengeance of hell boils in my heart  ♫

803
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,160
Cheon Seo Jin, you fake! You liar!

804
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,590
You stole someone else's voice. You're at rock bottom!

805
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:34,440
You acted like you were the best. You cheater. You're nothing but a mutt.

806
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:43,050
♫  If Sarastro does not through you feel  ♫

807
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:44,260
♫  The pain of death  ♫

808
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,960
Isn't  Eun Byeol a fake, too?

809
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,260
I knew something  was off when she was accepted into Cheong Ah Arts with no talent!

810
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:54,870
Like mother, like daughter!

811
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,700
You should resign for the sake of the school!

812
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,930
It's not fair for our children to be treated like dish water because of a piece of trash.

813
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:21,900
♫  My daughter nevermore  ♫

814
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,620
That's enough.

815
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:31,570
I'm fine.

816
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,710
It's all going to pass.

817
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,180
This kind of embarrassment,

818
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:39,480
I can disregard.

819
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,030
As long as Eun Byeol is fine.

820
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:46,700
I can do anything for Eun Byeol.

821
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,300
Because I'm her mother.

822
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,700
I'm fine.

823
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,920
I'm really okay.

824
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,100
I'm so scared.

825
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:07,310
Can I really live my life without singing ever again?

826
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,160
Can I still live like that?

827
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,660
I don't think I can.

828
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:51,660
 Yun Hui, 

829
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:57,440
 now I don't think I can ever go back to you again. 

830
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:03,250
Cheong Ah Foundation is blocking any articles, but the criticism from the public is harsh.

831
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:07,020
Keep pushing the press, so the articles keep coming out.

832
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:10,160
Even harsher and more provocative.

833
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:14,420
So that everyone in Korea can see those articles.

834
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:20,680
Cheon Seo Jin is going to get quite aggravated.

835
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:23,810
Did you figure out why Ha Eun Byeol went to the hospital?

836
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:28,660
I hear she got the sleep EEG (Electroencephalogram),  a treatment being tested privately in the medical field.

837
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:31,880
Sleep EEG?

838
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:38,110
Do they mean to alter her memories of killing someone?

839
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:42,160
So she'd do anything to save her child, I guess.

840
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,360
But there's something odd.

841
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,040
Tell me.

842
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:50,080
When I checked today, the owner for the land that belonged to Ju Hye In changed.

843
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:54,460
To whom? Was it Logan Lee, that bastard?

844
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,850
Oh Yun Hui?
 Shared Ownership of Real Estate  

845
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:02,250
This is ridiculous. How the hell could Oh Yun Hui get that land?

846
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:12,570
I understand. I'll see you tomorrow night.

847
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:14,910
Chairman Ju Dan Tae.

848
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:29,880
- You're early. 
- I'm right on time for our 6 o'clock meeting.

849
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:34,530
The Chairman said it would be at seven.

850
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:37,160
Then I must've been mistaken.

851
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,360
You can wait here. He's not home yet from work.

852
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,690
He told me to wait in his study.

853
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:44,330
I'm sorry?

854
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:48,500
Well then, it's that way.

855
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,930
I'll have the tea when Chairman Ju gets here.

856
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:53,560
Alright.

857
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:19,710
Su Ryeon?

858
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:32,600
 If you go into his study, you'll see a bookcase with an unusual structure. 

859
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:37,130
 If you push it open, there's a door that leads to the secret space. 

860
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:40,900
 There, you'll need Ju Dan Tae's fingerprints. 

861
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:54,620
Welcome back, Chairman.

862
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,870
Are you back?

863
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:57,350
Bring Oh Yun Hui to my study when she arrives.

864
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:00,330
She's already waiting inside for you.

865
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:02,950
What?

866
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:09,320
 When you open the door, you'll see a bust. 

867
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:13,920
 Lift up its head, and you'll see the buttons. 

868
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,800
 Open 

869
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:54,560

 The Penthouse II: War in  Life 

871
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,210
 Anyone who betrays me will die. 

872
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,030
 This is where our relationship ends. 

873
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,100
 Get out! 

874
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,840
 I only realized this now. That I'm falling for Seo Jin again. 

875
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,020
 You are Su Ryeon! 

876
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,640
 I'm sorry, I was too late. 

877
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,660
 The night Ro Na died — 

878
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,220
 Do you remember anything? 

879
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,620
 You killed Bae Ro Na on the stairs that night, didn't you? 

880
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,390
 Aren't you cold? I'll come back again tomorrow. 

881
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:33,460
 If I ever open my mouth, your name, Ju Dan Te will disappear. 

882
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:34,570
 This is all crazy! 

883
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:38,600
 Can you really do everything I tell you to? 

884
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,970
