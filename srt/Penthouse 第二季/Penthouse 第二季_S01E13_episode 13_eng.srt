1
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,360
 Final Episode 

2
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,520


3
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,270
 I committed a sin to you that can't be washed away. 

4
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,570
 No word or action of mine will absolve me for what I did. 

5
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,280
 I missed you a lot, Su Ryeon, 

6
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,800
 and I liked you very much.   

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,900
 Which was why I hated you all the more. I'm sorry 

8
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,730
 I'll receive my punishment. 

9
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,950
 This is the last atonement I can make to you.  

10
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,150
Yes, this is Gangnam Police Station.

11
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,220
 Homicide and Felony Team 1 

12
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,290
No, it wasn't me. Seriously.

13
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,050
Hear me out here.

14
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,130
-Excuse me.
-Yes, how may I help you?

15
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,650
I'm here to turn myself in.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,550
I ...

17
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,800
killed a person.

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,600
Power, RS, sunlights

19
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,830
Z, Z P?

20
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,240
Zeus' Palace? How's that?

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,080
As the name of the apartment complex we'll be building?

22
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,580
That's perfect. It sounds luxurious and affluent.

23
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,590
Now that I'm the head of the Hera Palace homeowners' association,

24
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,820
what do you think? Should we go ahead and buy the penthouse?

25
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,880
Forget it.  Why enter a house where people die and come back alive?

26
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,000
Besides, we'll move into Cheonsu District in a few years.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,100
Still, you better look the part way better than the previous association head.

28
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,400
Hey, hey, who are you comparing to Ju Dan Tae, the idiot?

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,730
I wouldn't change you even with a truck load of Ju Dan Taes.

30
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,940
Since we're here, with the best fabric from Italy and by color,

31
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,570
let's get a couple of suits tailored for you.

32
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:24,030
For your cute face, we should go with bright colors.

33
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,090
To be more precise, I'm virtually a flower boy.

34
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,580
Why not buy all of them?  I'm loaded!

35
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,900
For you, Assemblyman, that color isn't quite it.

36
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,900
You're still an assemblyman.

37
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,090
How about something classy and elegant?

38
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,500
Especially when you have a face like that of a twerp.

39
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,100
Come on, Je Ni's mom.

40
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,200
My Gyu Jin exudes an air of a nobleman in whatever he wears.

41
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,920
Honestly, I'm really curious.

42
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,620
Do you live or die over me? Are you a fan of mine?

43
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,920
Why do you follow me all the way here where I'm just buying some clothes?

44
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,260
Come on, I'm almost hurt by your reaction.

45
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,200
I thought Cheonsu District put us in the same boat. No?

46
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,900
We, the noblesse of different leagues

47
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,760
ought to have at least one best friend.

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,570
I'm here to get some quality outfits, too.

49
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,140
- Men's suits?
 - Oh, I guess you didn't know.

50
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,320
My husband is returning to Korea soon.

51
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,070
Is Chairman Yu coming back?

52
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,500
Has it been already five years?

53
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,770
Did he wrap up his business in Dubai?

54
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,860
Soon I'll have big money in my hands, too.

55
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,730
No reason for him to slave by himself in that far away land.

56
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,310
I'll tell you what my husband's size is.

57
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,450
Get me the best quality, no, get me the most expensive suits.

58
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,870
Say, about ten of them.

59
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,730
Did you say ten, Ma'am?

60
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,130
Come this way, please.

61
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,000
Hey, you kids.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
Hey, here.

63
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,000
Assemblyman, Assemblyman!

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,110
Assemblyman! Why aren't you picking up the phone?

65
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,040
What's the matter?

66
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,150
Chairman Ju called? Will he cough up the three hundred billion?

67
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,530
No, not that. It's about Cheonsu District.

68
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,370
-What, what, what?
 -What, what about Cheonsu District?

69
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,080
Cheonsu District has totally flipped upside down.

70
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,840
- Hurray!
 - Money's rolling in!

71
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,830
 Breaking news.  

72
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,360
 Cheonsu District, which caused a sensation as the largest-scale new town development in Korean history, 

73
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,970
 is in the eye of a storm of allegations of quid pro quo trading in political and financial circles.    

74
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:40,310
 Chairman Jeong Du Man of the Happy Future Party voluntarily resigned from his leadership role and surrendered himself to the prosecution. 

75
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,370
 Jeong is accused of colluding with Cheong Ah Group's Ju Dan Tae, 

76
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,720
 who is currently being investigated for the murder of his ex-wife Na, 

77
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,260
 to arrange re-zoning of Cheonsu District as a redevelopment area 

78
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,510
 and fostered an environment of speculative investments.  

79
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,630
 Attention is also focused on the cause of the death of Ms. Na, his ex-wife, 

80
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,970
to whom Ju Dan Tae delegated the responsibility for his development investing.

81
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,320
 According to an insider of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, 

82
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,890
 Cheonsu District was to be designated as a landfill.  

83
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,120
 But it became overnight a redevelopment area designed for the affluent. 

84
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,710
Open the door, President Hwang. Mr. Hwang!

85
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,620
What? A landfill?

86
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,090
Did you scam us?

87
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,740
Open the door at once, you son of a bitch!

88
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,540
Mr. Hwang, will you sell my junk car?

89
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,120
Without that money, I can't even get married!

90
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,880
Mr. Hwang! Please open the door for me!

91
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,420
Do you want to see me die?

92
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,780
You idiot, didn't you even bother to check? I put everything in this!

93
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,610
I even sold your building, too. We're ruined!

94
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,430
Who asked you to do that?

95
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,920
Why is it my fault? You were more enthusiastic than I was!

96
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,490
If your father divorces me, I'll crash with you and you'll look after me, okay?

97
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,940
Okay, Mom.

98
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,260
- Open the damn door! 
 - Mother!

99
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,380
I'd rather have you tell me to die.

100
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,160
I'm more scared of that than us going poor.

101
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,350
What are you talking about?

102
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,220
Oh, no, no.

103
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,480
 Golden Realty 
 Specializing in Cheonsu District  

104
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,350
What are you bothering me for?

105
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,300
There's Lee Gyu Jin, a member of the Korean National Assembly!

106
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,100
Assemblyman Lee Gyu Jin!

107
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,010
Will you answer some questions?

108
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,010
Look here, Assemblyman!

109
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,760
I know nothing. Really nothing.

110
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,160
This isn't fair!

111
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,780
Move! I'm an assemblyman!

112
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,030
No pictures!

113
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,920
- Gyu Jin!
 - No!

114
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,800
Wait up for me. Hey, Lee Gyu Jin!

115
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,420
 It's confirmed that Assemblyman  Lee Gyu Jin of the Happy Future Party 

116
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,400
 is also involved in the speculative investment surrounding Cheonsu District. 

117
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,510
 Assemblyman Lee used the names of his parents, his son, and even his cousins 

118
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,780
 to buy 30 billion worth of land, which sends shock waves everywhere.  

119
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,210
Ah, yes, hello? Yes, ma'am.

120
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,340
Cheonsu District  isâ€”

121
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,020
Hello? What's wrong with this damn phone?

122
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,420
Lee Gyu Jin, Go Sang Ah, and Kang Ma Ri, come with us to the station.

123
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,280
Oh, no. I'm ruined.

124
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,730
Already?

125
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,040
Hey, don't you know an assemblyman has immunity from getting arrested?

126
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,220
Besides, we're the victims of the Cheonsu District scam.

127
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,050
This is concerning the death of Min Seol Ah.

128
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,870
What did you just say?

129
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,100
Min Seol Ahâ€”

130
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,150
Her case was concluded a long time ago.

131
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,180
We've been fooled enough by Sim Su Ryeon.

132
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,260
With the surrender of the real muderer, the case is just reopened.

133
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,210
Are you saying the real murderer surrendered?

134
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,050
Who- who is that?

135
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,230
Oh, oh, wait, wait.

136
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,820
What are you doing?

137
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,560
Wait, wait.

138
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,980
I just did what I had to do.

139
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,160
I came here with someone who wants to see you.

140
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,590
Would you like to see who that is?

141
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,750
Ro Na.

142
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,930
Ro Na.

143
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,930
She is my Ro Na, right?

144
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,390
Ro Na.

145
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,070
Apparently, the police didn't say anything out of concern that it might affect your statement.

146
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,870
Ro Na has been alive.

147
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,000
What happened?

148
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,490
Su Ryeon kept her alive.

149
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,610
We monitored her closely believing that the perpetrator would target her again.

150
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,290
If we hadn't secured the doctor's help in advance, something horrible would've happened.

151
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,680
Keeping Ro Na alive meant our chance to prove Ju Dan Tae's guilt.

152
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,260
We made her look dead and transported her to the hospital.
 Funeral Home  

153
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,340
 Bae Ro Na - Homicide 

154
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,630
Ro Na.

155
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,990
We can't resuscitate her. It looks like we may be too late.

156
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,130
No, no. You must revive her.

157
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,650
Excuse me.

158
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,750
Ro Na, please you've got to live. Open your eyes.

159
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,170
Even if it is for your mother's sake, you can't die.

160
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,560
We're getting her breathing back.

161
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,050
Ro Na.

162
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,660
Ro Na.

163
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,980
Hi, Ro Na. Can you see who I am?

164
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,630
Ahjumma.

165
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,630
Good job, Ro Na.

166
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,850
You really did a good job.

167
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,260
Su Ryeon risked her life to keep Ro Na alive.

168
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,080
Ro Na is waiting. She's also recovered a lot since.

169
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,700
- I'll bring her here. 
 -  No. Don't.

170
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,870
It's enough to know she's alive.

171
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:33,400
When I can see my Ro Na with a clean conscience, then I'll see her.

172
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,490
For now, it's enough to see her alive.

173
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,500
I'm so, so thankful. Thank you. Really, thank you.

174
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,830
Speculative investment can be seen that way when viewed with your political bias.

175
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,830
It isn't speculative at all when we see it as a way to fulfil our social responsibilities.

176
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,760
Besides, I became an assemblyman for social justice.

177
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,730
Desecration of a dead body? Sheer lunacy!

178
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,810
Assemblyman, have you known me?

179
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,440
Why do you keep talking down to me since before?

180
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,870
Me, Gyu Jin?

181
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,860
Have I been condescending to him with my speech?

182
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,310
Come on, that's misunderstanding.

183
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,690
Sir, Detective. Think about it.

184
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,100
We're people with high social status, wealth, and fame.

185
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:38,500
How could we possibly move a corpse of an orphant with no one and no place to turn to?

186
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,310
Then we hid the evidence? That's a crime.

187
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,450
We're the living embodiment of honesty and integrity.

188
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,290
Honesty and integrity? You must be joking.

189
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,950
In any case, how much longer will you talk to us about this damn Min Seol Ah?

190
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,370
Who is it this time?

191
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,180
Who the hell is it that keeps pulling us into this absurd scenario?

192
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,860
Who is it? Tell me! Who is it?

193
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,590
I warned you. Stop talking down to me, you jerk!

194
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,320
Je Ni's mom.

195
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,290
Who says I cleaned up the fountain that day?

196
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,190
I scrub people's backs for a living.

197
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,120
But I'm not the type who cleans.

198
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,430
I'm told that day the water in the Hera Palace fountain was urgently drained.

199
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,680
The residents already testified to the fact.

200
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,860
Using that time, didn't you move the dead body of Min Seol Ah?

201
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,430
What the heck are you talking about? I have no idea.

202
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,920
There is a witness. The witness who saw you folks.

203
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,490
Well, who- who the heck is it?

204
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,990
Two years have already gone by. What lunatic tells you they saw us?

205
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,170
Let me see just who that is.

206
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,990
It's Ms. Oh Yun Hui.

207
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,560
She testified that she saw you folks that day.

208
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,200
Did Oh Yun Hui?

209
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,540
What a crazyâ€”

210
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,400
Is she really bent on getting on the wrong side of me?

211
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,050
Hey, Je Ni's mom.

212
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,410
Heck, stop calling me!

213
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,540
Is it you who falsely accused us?

214
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,170
That day, I saw it clearly with my own eyes.

215
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,860
What you and the others were doing by the fountain.

216
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,920
You know this, too. I was also at Hera Palace that day.

217
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,400
Didn't you say you couldn't remember a thing because you were drunk that day?

218
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,940
No, on the contrary, I remembered everything.

219
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,140
Everything that happened that day. Very clearly.

220
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,800
Now are you even fabricating things in order to implicate me?

221
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,940
What the hell did you see?

222
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,980
Min Seol Ah committed a suicide.

223
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,050
Her mom abandoned her and in despair,  she killed herself.

224
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,190
Min Seol Ah didn't kill herself.

225
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,690
I...killed her.

226
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,550
The culprit who killed Min Seol Ah at Hera Palace is me.

227
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,750
What did you just say?

228
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,570
Did you just say you killed Min Seol Ah?

229
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,040
Is that true?

230
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,870
Does Sim Su Ryeon know this, too?

231
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,580
She does.

232
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,750
Sorry to interrupt your mealtime.

233
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,260
How do you feel having killed Na Ae Gyo with your own hands?

234
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,830
Sim Su Ryeon!

235
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,200
Really,

236
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,980
are you Sim Su Ryeon? You?

237
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,460
You sure hoped I'd remain forever ignorant of Na Ae Gyo's existence.

238
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,490
What a shame.

239
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,310
I already knew about her two years ago.

240
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,150
The reason why you insisted I wear only the clothes you bought,

241
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,520
I came to know then.

242
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,940
Na Ae Gyo with the identical clothes like mine

243
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,230
became your wife and lobbied, according to your plan.

244
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,750
In any case, I was already busy looking after Hye In.

245
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,360
So I didn't do anything to show my face in public at all.

246
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,380
That meant you ran no risk of getting found out.

247
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,470
You freely sold the name of the daughter of Sim Won Construction.

248
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,000
And you lived scamming political and financial figures.

249
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,600
How the hell didn't I see that it's been you all along?

250
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,430
How the hell were you able to fool me so thoroughly?

251
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,720
Lucky for me, there was plenty of information about Na Ae Gyo in Thailand.

252
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,340
For two years, I became better at living as Na Ae Gyo than Na Ae Gyo herself.

253
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,660
I grit my teeth getting ready for my comeback.

254
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,430
I had to, in order to kill you.

255
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,450
Did a thing like you dare to deceive me?

256
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,250
My skin crawls when I think of you as the start of all my misery.

257
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,510
You killed Seol Ah's father, drove her out to a foreign land, and killed Na Ae Gyo, too.

258
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,000
On top of that, innocent Ro Na.

259
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,230
I survived each day by imagining ripping you into shreds.

260
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,510
How is it that a man like you is still breathing?

261
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,120
I resent the god above.

262
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,980
Shut up then and keep resenting that god above.

263
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,740
Do you know this?

264
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,480
That Na Ae Gyo had already betrayed you a long time ago.

265
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,910
The woman was in love with  Chairman Jeong Du Man.

266
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,100
That's why she tried to leave you.

267
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,090
That's absurd.

268
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,030
What the heck do you know about her to be yakking away like that?

269
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,470
For her, I was the only man. All her life.

270
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,090
She went above and beyond to do things for me.

271
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:52,080
Why did you kill a woman like that? Ju Dan Tae!

272
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,180
Chairman Jeong.

273
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,580
What the hell is going on?

274
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,120
What did you tell the police?

275
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,200
Any idea what humiliation I've been subject to here?

276
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,800
Get me out of here at once.

277
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,120
Why should I do that?

278
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:27,090
It'll be no fun for you if you go down that road.

279
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,100
What about your presidential aspiration?

280
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,700
If I tell the world about your relationship with Na Ae Gyo,

281
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,670
will you be okay with it?

282
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,210
What Na Ae Gyo and I had

283
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,600
wasn't the kind of lascivious relationship you fancy in your head.

284
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,600
How would a man with no class like you know a thing like that?

285
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,020
You've never been loved all your life.

286
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,920
A scumbag like you.

287
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,010
Don't tell me.

288
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,320
Did you dare have a love affair with my woman, you bastard?

289
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,740
Despite the despicable thing you did, look at you.

290
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:28,360
Shoving food to your mouth,  taking care of  yourself and trembling in fear.

291
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,800
Despite all that,  the only person who pitied a disgusting guy like you

292
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,340
was Na Ae Gyo.

293
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,740
Yet you killed a woman like her.

294
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:58,170
That's the most horrendous, cursed act of your life.

295
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,880
Now there's nothing you can do.

296
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,480
Your massive wealth, both Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong,

297
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,370
and even your penthouse are all in my hands.

298
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,220
Until your dying day, in prison

299
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,550
I do hope you suffer a miserable death, Ju Dan Tae.

300
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,250
Till your misery becomes complete,

301
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:34,080
I'll do all that I can.

302
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,620
That's how I'm going to show my regard for Na Ae Gyo.

303
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,950
Brace yourself, Ju Dan Tae.

304
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,040
Jeong Du Man!

305
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,130
Sim Su Ryeon!

306
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,140
Mr. Baek.

307
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,910
Who the hell are you?

308
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,300
Na Ae Gyo was correct. She said you had a real name.

309
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,360
Is it Mr. Baek?

310
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,710
Come out, come out, you bastard!

311
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,390
Who the hell are you?

312
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,060
No time for that.

313
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,080
I'm returning back to the States today.

314
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,790
My parents are cooperating with the law enforcement there.

315
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,800
So, don't get your hopes up.

316
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,180
There won't be any more deals with you.

317
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,650
I'll show the world how far down you've fallen.

318
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,710
I'll show you this is barely the end of your ordeal, Mr. Ju Dan Tae.

319
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,150
No, no.

320
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,830
Mr. Baek.

321
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,090
 Doesn't it hurt? 
25 Years Ago 

322
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,620
 It's not that bad. 

323
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,700
 I need some kind of mark so that you won't confuse me with Sim Su Ryeon. 

324
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,530
 Why would I get confused? I can find you even with my eyes closed. You're my woman. 

325
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,390
 Why, of all things, a butterfly? A mole would be enough. 

326
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,300
 To be born again as a beautiful butterfly. 

327
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,700
 What do you think? Isn't it pretty? 

328
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,640
 It's pretty. 

329
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,160
 I'm going to make it so that you can live like Sim Su Ryeon. 

330
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,200
 As the happiest woman in the world. 

331
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,050
 You can wait a little longer till then, right? 

332
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,820
 How long do I have to wait, Oppa? 

333
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,730
 It won't take long. 

334
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,100
 As long as we make the most of using Sim Su Ryeon's name, 

335
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,690
 we'll go crazy making so much money that we'll be smothered by it. 

336
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,520
 We'll buy a house in Gangnam and build a building, too. 

337
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,550
 I'm going to build Ju Dan Tae Village on the land where my mom passed away. 

338
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,430
 I'll make all the people in the world kneel before me. 

339
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,210
 Will we have children, too? 

340
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,220
 Of course. A son and a daughter. 

341
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,960
 Our children will grow up in the most expensive  

342
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,600
 and the tallest home in our country.  

343
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,310
 The home closest to Heaven. In a penthouse. 

344
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,210
 Just thinking about it makes me so happy. 

345
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:25,610
Is Na Ae Gyo really dead?

346
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,100
By my own two hands,

347
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,460
Did I ... Na Ae Gyo?

348
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,320
Mom would never do such a thing.

349
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,350
How could she not want to see me? She's my mom.

350
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,050
I'm going to ask her myself.

351
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,070
Ha Eun Byeol.

352
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,200
What? Did you just see a ghost?

353
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,480
What happened?

354
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,220
Why are youâ€”

355
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,290
I bet you wanted me to die.

356
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,920
I'm sorry that I'm alive like this.

357
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,670
Why did you do that to me, Ha Eun Byeol?

358
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,320
Why did you try to kill me? Did you hate me that much?

359
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,670
No, I didn't do anything.

360
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,470
It wasn't me who did that!

361
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,050
I didn't think you would admit it.

362
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,600
I feel bad for your dad.

363
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,470
Just to protect a kid like you, he took your crime upon himself.

364
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,750
However, that won't make what you did go away.

365
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,080
You, too, will be punished, Ha Eun Byeol.

366
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,480
Go away!

367
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,030
You're dead. You have no place to return to now.

368
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,330
I beg you. Get out of my sight!

369
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,800
Are you okay?

370
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,020
You shouldn't overexert yourself yet. Let's go back to the hospital.

371
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,230
No, no, no.

372
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,200
Ha Eun Byeol!  Where did you go without saying anything?

373
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,850
I told you not to go anywhere! It's dangerous outside!

374
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,700
Teacher Jin.  I don't like it here.

375
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,080
I'm scared. I'm scared to death.

376
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,110
Take me somewhere, anywhere.

377
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,030
It doesn't matter where.

378
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:35,380
Somewhere far, where no one can find me, okay?

379
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,100
Please, Teacher Jin!

380
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,690
Does it really not matter where?

381
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,320
Yes, as long as Bae Ro Na isn't there.

382
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
You poor thing.

383
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,420
Let's be rid of this place and go away.

384
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,730
Call me Mom from now on.

385
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,700
Call me Mom.

386
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,080
It's been a while, Sim Su Ryeon.

387
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,060
We're finally meeting. I guess?

388
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,760
Will you leave us alone for a moment?

389
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,860
Will you be okay?

390
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,900
The handcuffs suit you quite well.

391
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,650
Shut up.

392
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,640
What wrong did I ever do to you?

393
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,800
The one who killed Min Seol Ah was Oh Yun Hui. The woman you were so fond of.

394
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,220
Compared to that beastly act of Oh Yun Hui, I was nothing but an innocent baby.

395
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,090
Do you really think what you did to Seol Ah is your only crime?

396
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:09,690
Oh, stealing your husband? Take him back immediately.

397
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,140
I loathe myself for having liked the man even for a fleeting moment.

398
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,140
Are you incapable of self-reflection even in a moment like this?

399
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,070
I've been punished enough.

400
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,680
Besides the despicable things to which Ju Dan Tae subjected my family,

401
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,180
what more do you want?

402
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,420
Do you expect me to bow down and ask for your forgiveness?

403
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:35,030
No.  Don't do anything. I'll do the rest from now on.

404
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,990
I'll make you regret to your bones everything you've ever done.

405
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,210
All you need to do is shut up and wait.

406
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,740
Who are you to say? Are you a god, a judge?

407
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,030
What makes you think you can say things like that to me?

408
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,760
My only crime is living my life to the best of my ability.

409
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,630
All I did was do my best for my daughter.

410
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:03,080
How is it that a mother loving her child  is a crime? I committed no crime.

411
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,090
I won't leave you alone, Sim Su Ryeon.

412
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:10,030
You'll have back all the humiliation you subjected me to just now.

413
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,360
 Mari Bathhouse  

414
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,290
 Two Months Later 

415
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,640
 Mari Bathhouse on Short Sale 

416
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,900
 Must Go. Urgent Sale. 

417
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,020
 Office of the Chair / Office of the Principal 

418
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,060
She looks exactly the same.

419
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,270
What are you guys doing over there?

420
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,480
Why the hell are you going into the Chairwoman's office?

421
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,840
 Cheong Ah Foundation Chair Cheon Seo Jin 

422
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,800
 CEO Ju Dan Tae 

423
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,050
 Assemblyman Lee Gyu Jin's Pledge 
 Assemblyman Lee Gyu Jin's Right Politics - Stupid! 

424
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,250
 He's getting off! 

425
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,150
Do you admit to the murder of Na Ae Gyo?

426
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,060
No. I am innocent.

427
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,470
Do you acknowledge abducting and using force against Sim Su Ryeon and Bae Ro Na?

428
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,430
I have never done such a thing.

429
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:37,030
Do you acknowledge that you lobbied for the Cheonsu District development?

430
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,500
It's been known that you have the list of the names of the politicians you bribed. Are you willing to make it public?

431
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,250
I've had my money taken from me, but I've never used it to bribe others.

432
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,390
When I have no need to bribe them, why would I?

433
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:48,680
Will you plea not guilty in today's trial over Min Seol Ah's murder?

434
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,780
I swear to god I never did anything wrong. I am innocent!

435
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,400
 Move. 

436
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,410
 Seoul District Court  

437
00:34:56,410 --> 00:35:01,120
Sim Su Ryeon, I'll prove myself. I've done nothing wrong.

438
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,400
 Seoul District Court  
 Executive Division / Bankruptcy Court 

439
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,940
Come on, I'm not going anywhere.

440
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,140
Thanks.

441
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,820
 Let go, it hurts. 

442
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,080
I'll go on my own.

443
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,610
Mom!

444
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,780
Oh, there you are.

445
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,910
Son! Did you eat?

446
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,590
Don't worry about me. Everything is fine.

447
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,480
Look at you. Your face is half of what it used to be.

448
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,400
Lawyer Kim, what year did the judge become a judge?

449
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,210
Eun Byeol.

450
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,050
 Defendants' Bench  

451
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,150
All rise!

452
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,210
Be seated. 
  Judge's Bench 

453
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:35,280
Your Honor, we call Sim Su Ryeon to the witness stand.

454
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,310
That- that-

455
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,990
Where are you going?

456
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,890
Is this how it's going to be, huh?

457
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,340
Everyone, be quiet!

458
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,390
Continue.

459
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,830
 Witness Stand 

460
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,490
On the day of the incident, as you were coming down in an elevator,

461
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,070
you saw the one who pushed Min Seol Ah from behind, correct?

462
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,340
Was that person Oh Yun Hui? Correct?

463
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,220
Yun Hui asked me to pass this onto you.

464
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,060
 Eonni, I have a favor to ask. 

465
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:35,250
 Please come to the court as the only witness who saw Seol Ah for the last time.  

466
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,010
 So I'll be properly punished. 

467
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,900
 That way, the others will also be punished for their crimes. 

468
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,680
 Please. 

469
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,380
Please testify.

470
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,990
Yes, that's correct.

471
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,360
- Oh, my gosh! 
- She's crazy!

472
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,570
What in the world!

473
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:04,700
Oh Yun Hui pushed my Seol Ah from the 47th floor.

474
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,880
I saw it with my own two eyes.

475
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,660
My goodness. Did you really do that? Impossible!

476
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,500
It is possible. It's totally possible.

477
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,530
I knew it all along.

478
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,210
It's not fair for us to be lumped in with her, the evil murderer.

479
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:26,400
You can't compare us to this wicked woman who killed someone like a daughter to her!

480
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,740
Your Honor! If you'll strike us with a lightening rod, you'll strike that woman.

481
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,900
What crime did we commit, huh?

482
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,120
I was going to sit!

483
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,670
After she killed the girl, in her place, she put her own daughter in the school.

484
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,170
She even crawled her way into the victim, Min Seol Ah's old home in Bosong Village.

485
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,270
She then even tried to sell it at a price many times more than its original price.

486
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:49,160
She deserves the heaviest punishment that there is.

487
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,450
If you have a conscience, please say something, Oh Yun Hui.

488
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,810
You even pretended to be the best friend of Min Seol Ah's mother.

489
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:59,520
Do you have any truth in you?

490
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,150
Be quiet, please!

491
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,390
If anyone speaks out of turn again, they will be removed.

492
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,040
First...
 Court in Session  

493
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,760
Mr. Ju Dan Tae, do you admit to these charges?

494
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,190
I have never desecrated the victim's body or

495
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,960
set the fire on the victim's home.

496
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,910
Can you treat us like criminals solely based on the words of the murderer?

497
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,440
Do you have any proof?

498
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,960
Do you have the proof of our involvement in Min Seol Ah's case?

499
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,450
The judicial integrity of the Republic of Korea relies on evidence.

500
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,630
That much is stated in the Constitution.

501
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,910
I have nothing to do with the crime either.

502
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,060
I'm certain it was the sole crime of Oh Yun Hui.

503
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,380
I also think that way! I swear it on my daughter's name.

504
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,680
I'm also innocent!

505
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,140
Your Honor,

506
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:02,190
there is a video of the defendants admitting to their crimes two years ago.

507
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,410
I submit this as evidence.

508
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,620
This evidence had not been submitted in advance! Please deny its admission.

509
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,180
I will accept it as evidence.

510
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,930
Hey, Lawyer! I put so much money into you!

511
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:17,220
Do your work properly, you bastard!

512
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,890
Quiet! This is your last warning!

513
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,180
 No! No! Listen to me. 
 Video Evidence 1 

514
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:40,050
 That night, all I did was clean the blood in the fountain! 

515
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,790
 It's the same for me as well! 

516
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:46,560
 I only cleaned up the blood because Je Ni's mom told me to! 

517
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,640
 This is all a trap! She's putting on a show to find evidence! 

518
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,850
 Hey! Stop talking. 

519
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,740
 Die by yourself! I can't die. 

520
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,580
 That thing, Ju Dan Tae told us to move  the corpse quickly! Really. 

521
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,780
 - I swear I only did what Ju Dan Tae told me to do! 
-This crazyâ€” 

522
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,610
 Don't joke around, Lee Gyu Jin, you bastard! 

523
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:13,730
 The golf bag. Your family brought the golf bag to move the corpse! 

524
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:17,690
 That golf bag was transported in your car! 

525
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,220
 - And your ex- wife, this oneâ€” 
- This one? 

526
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,740
 You're the one who forged the suicide note! 

527
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,580
 This couple.  The two of you were the ones who made it look like a suicide. 

528
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:32,660
We were cornered with a ticking bomb.

529
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,010
We made the false confessions in order to live.

530
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,610
That woman, Sim Su Ryeon pointed a gun at us and threatened us!

531
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:42,000
That's right! If anyone was going to move the corpse,

532
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,070
it was probably Oh Yun Hui who killed Min Seol Ah.

533
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,490
We really didn't do anything!

534
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:51,840
This is so unfair! It's so unfair it's killing me!

535
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,700
Our only crime that day was enjoying the party!

536
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,410
Those aren't false confessions.

537
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,020
They're all true.

538
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,960
What the hell are you saying, Ha Yun Cheol?

539
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,050
Doctor Ha, stop. Hey!

540
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:19,470
Think of Eun Byeol. Do you want both of us to go to jail?

541
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,810
That night, we moved Min Seol Ah's body to Bosong Village

542
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:32,110
and fabricated the cause of her death.

543
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:37,670
We were afraid Min Seol Ah might expose the truth about our children bullying her.

544
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,570
We all knew she was locked up in the mechanical room,

545
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,290
but none of us did anything about it.

546
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,340
We...

547
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,380
were all crazy.

548
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,780
It's you who're crazy. You lunatic!

549
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,050
This is all bullshit! Don't believe him!

550
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:03,310
I've never done that! I have no memory of that!

551
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,970
- Let go! 
- What the hell are you doing?

552
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,170
- Let go of me! 
- He's lying!

553
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,170
Guards, guards!

554
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,760
I've never done any of those things! You're lying!

555
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,190
You bastard!

556
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:21,030
Are you bent on pushing me over the cliff to kill me?

557
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:30,740
 Ha Yun Cheol. In the end, your heart is with Oh Yun Hui. 

558
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,740
Do you support her so much to be even willing to go down the sewer together?

559
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,380
 Don't you care at all what happens to me? 

560
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,960
That's all a lie!

561
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,940
I have nothing to do with this!

562
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,510
 Ms. Cheon, why are your hands so slow? Do it like this. 

563
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:50,530
 It's not like I've done this before. 

564
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,660
 Sang Ah, you're doing great. You pass! 

565
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,380
 Defendant Kang Ma Ri.  

566
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,500
 Guilty on the count of abandoning a human corpse. 

567
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,610
 Guilty on the count of tampering with evidence. 

568
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,390
 Guilty on the count of violating the Housing Act. 

569
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,340
 I hereby sentence the defendant to one year and six months in prison. 

570
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,770
 It helps to use your head! 

571
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,550
 Defendant Go Sang Ah.   Guilty on the count of tampering with evidence.  

572
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,840
  This should be enough, right? 

573
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,600
 Guilty on the count of abandoning a human corpse. 

574
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,300
 Guilty on the count of violating the Housing Act.  

575
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,870
 I hereby sentence the defendant to one year and six months in prison. 

576
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,630
 Defendant Cheon Seo Jin. 

577
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,300
 I know all about the unlawful admission 

578
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,110
 of students into Cheong Ah Arts School. 

579
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:35,320
 Guilty on the counts of drugging and abducting a minor and false imprisonment. 

580
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,730
 Guilty on the counts of evidence tampering and abandoning a human corpse. 

581
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,720
 This is Min Seol Ah's bag. I put a suicide note in there. Make sure it's found on her. 

582
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,860
 I hereby sentence the defendant  to seven years in prison.  

583
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,310
 Defendant Ha Yun Cheol. 

584
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,650
 Guilty on the counts of evidence tampering and abandoning a human corpse. 

585
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:02,240
 Guilty on the counts of fleeing a crime scene and aiding a crime. 

586
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,430
 I hereby sentence the defendant to two years in prison. 

587
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:09,320
 Jeez, oh, oh, she's damn heavy. 

588
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,470
 Now Defendant Lee Gyu Jin.   

589
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:15,410
 Come on, lift, lift it! 

590
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,670
 Guilty on the counts of evidence tampering, abandoning a human corpse,  

591
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:21,110
 invading a private residence, and violating the Housing Act. 

592
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:23,560
 I hereby sentence the defendant to two years in prison. 

593
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,700
Doesn't it count that I have been self-reflective?

594
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,730
 Defendant Ju Dan Tae, guilty on the count of violating the Housing Act.  

595
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,600

598
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,300
 Guilty on the counts of invading a private residence and tampering with evidence.  

599
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:44,370
 Guilty on the counts of arson. 

600
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,420
 Guilty on the counts of attempted murder and first-degree murder! 

601
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,540
 I hereby sentence the defendant to life imprisonment. 

602
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,570
Why am I getting a life sentence?

603
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,590
I would've given you the death penalty!

604
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,650
Please be quiet!

605
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,660
To these defendants Ju Dan Tae, Cheon Seo Jin, Lee Gyu Jin, Go Sang Ah, and Kang Ma Ri,

606
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,620
I add contempt of court.

607
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,800
 Contempt of Court 

608
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,260
All rise.

609
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,820
Be seated.

610
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,080
I should've stayed away from you.

611
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,570
Why did you have to drag us into your mess, too?

612
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,410
Hey, Cheon Seo Jin, can't you shut the mouth of this spineless jerk?

613
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,630
Wasn't he once your oh-so-great husband?

614
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,590
Shut up, Ju Dan Tae! This is all because of you!

615
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,320
- What? 
 - You said that you'd take responsibility for everything!

616
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,720
What responsibility, damn it?

617
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,100
Ju Dan Tae!

618
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,230
He also tried to kill Bae Ro Na!

619
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:47,860
You're the devil himself!

620
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:51,110
- You bastard! 
- Let go of me!

621
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:55,010
- You devil! 
- Bastard! Devil!

622
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,250
- You devil!

623
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:01,040
- Stop it! 
- Let go of me!

624
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,160
My son!

625
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:26,330
Lee Min Hyeok! My son, Min Hyeok!

626
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,700
- Mom! 
- Ma'am!

627
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:33,430
Please help me. I can't go to jail and leave my Je Ni alone. Please help me.

628
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:38,510
What do you mean you can't survive there?

629
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,490
If you're so scared of prison, you shouldn't have committed a crime in the first place!

630
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:46,360
Even if you are my person, I won't stand anyone who messes with little kids.

631
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,890
I would've been willing to put up a hundred billion for your bail.

632
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,850
But, according to our rule, the Three Madams, I won't spend a dime.

633
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:55,840
It's an ugly sight to see you using your child as an excuse.

634
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,730
I will take care of Je Ni.

635
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:02,400
No, no, come on, ladies!

636
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,310
- No! Je Ni! 
- Mom!

637
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,750
Do you know who I am? How dare you give me a jail sentence?

638
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:11,170
Don't you have any regard for those who upheld the laws of this great nation?

639
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:14,390
You can't disgrace them like you do. Let go of me!

640
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,870
Do you know who my father is?

641
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:20,240
Lee Min Hyeok! My son! Mommy will be fine, don't worry!

642
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,580
So freaking embarrassing. Stop calling my name!

643
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,520
What about Eun Byeol? How is she doing?

644
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,280
How would I know?

645
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,570
I've never been humiliated like this in all my life. You smeared mud all over your father's name.

646
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,390
Don't you have any shame? How dare you utter Eun Byeol's name?

647
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:38,630
You see, she'll probably think she's better off without her mom, too.

648
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:42,330
Mom! So Yeong! Please bring me Eun Byeol!

649
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:46,430
Tell Eun Byeol that I want to see her and I miss her!

650
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:49,390
Tell her! Tell Eun Byeol! Momâ€”

651
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,290
Mom!

652
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,650
Mom!

653
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,280
Mom! Mom! Mom!

654
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,990
Mom! Mom!

655
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,670
Mom!

656
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,570
Mom! Mom!

657
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,280
Mom!

658
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,830
Ju Dan Tae, you're the worst human being I've met in my life.

659
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,120
What did you say?

660
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:35,470
I want to gouge out my eyes for not seeing a devil like you. I want to curse my heart.

661
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:37,880
Speak for yourself.

662
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,880
You said you loved me. It was you who threw yourself at me!

663
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,930
I never once gave you my heart. From the start, you were simply my prey.

664
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,750
Don't say my name with that filthy mouth of yours.

665
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:50,640
Cheon Seo Jin.

666
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,590
-Cheon Seo Jin. Cheon Seo Jin. Cheon Seo Jin. 
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

667
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,250
-What are you going to do about it? 
-Shut up!

668
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,280
You two are truly a match made in heaven.

669
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,840
What?

670
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,760
It's a shame I won't be able to see you like this anymore.

671
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,140
You littleâ€”

672
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:08,340
You came to see me only now? Is that how I taught you?

673
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,780
I gave you two everything I had. Is this all you can do?

674
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,170
You're no longer our father.

675
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:20,300
We can't forgive you for killing our birth mother and the mother who raised us, too.

676
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,660
So, from now on, don't talk to us in the rude way you do now.

677
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,670
Since when did my dear son grow up so much?

678
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:30,410
Even with all your arrogance, do you think you can go against the will of heaven?

679
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:36,110
Even if the heavens split in two, you're still my children. If I'm a devil, you're the devil's, and if I'm a snake, you're the snake's.

680
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,780
Give up your parental rights.

681
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,100
What? Give up my parental rights?

682
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:47,250
From now on, our sole guardian is our mother. We came to the court to request you forfeit your parental rights.

683
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,920
The rest, you may discuss with our lawyer.

684
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,030
Says who? Without me, who will treat you like decent humans?

685
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:57,380
I won't give you a dime of my money!

686
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,500
Do you even have money to give?

687
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:06,380
You're a beggar now, Dad. The penthouse was given to Mom as well.

688
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,490
Oh, no one told you that yet?

689
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:13,930
You dare  treat me like some stray? You rotten brats!

690
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:16,520
Ju Seok Hun. Ju Seok Gyeong!

691
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:22,300
Is this how I taught you? You get to go to Seoul National University, thanks to me. How can you call yourselves humans?

692
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:27,150
You're in no position to gloat. You got fired from the Cheong Ah Arts' Chair position.

693
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,290
So? You and I are strangers now. So get lost.

694
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:34,140
I take it then I don't need to keep that secret anymore, right?

695
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:49,110
Still, Eun Byeol alone knows it right? That her grandfather died because of you.

696
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,790
This is too big of a secret for me to keep to myself, right?

697
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:59,360
I need to tell someone.

698
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,540
I'm thinking I can post it on the Blue House petition page.

699
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,650
Seok Gyeong.

700
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:14,490
Ju Seok Gyeong. Don't.

701
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,770
Don't do it.

702
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:19,510
Are you clear on your situation now?

703
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,260
Seok Gyeong, no. Seok Gyeong.

704
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,140
Seok Gyeong, talk to me for a second. Seok Gyeong!

705
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,330
Don't! Don't!

706
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:32,180
 Ms. Oh Yun Hui, can I ask you to clarify the situation? 

707
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,360
Oh Yun Hee, you confessed your sin.

708
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,860
Please give a comment.

709
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,850
 I admit to all the charges. 

710
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:51,710
 I can't be forgiven, but I'll beg Seol Ah  for her forgiveness until the day I die.  

711
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:01,360
Before your ruling, I'd like to say something, Your Honor.

712
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,590
 Go ahead. 

713
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:08,510
Oh Yun Hui committed a grave sin that can never be erased.

714
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,730
However, when my daughter had no one to turn to,

715
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:16,370
Oh Yun Hui was the only person who came to her side.

716
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,860
 Sir, don't.  I need the money. 

717
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,460
 You haven't even paid me for the last month. 

718
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,800
 Are you crazy? 

719
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,320
 Do you know how much all the plates you broke cost? 

720
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,230
 Hurry and clean this up!! 

721
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,970
 What are you doing? 

722
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:37,550
 Isn't it wrong to have her carry such heavy grills in the first place? 

723
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:41,350
 This is child abuse. I'm going to report you! 

724
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:42,350
 Who the hell are you? 

725
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,860
 I'm her parent, why? 

726
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:49,780
 Get up right this instant.  There are a lot of other places you can earn money. 

727
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,550
 Is that ajumma crazy?   Stop right there! 

728
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:54,020
 Hey! 

729
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,590
 Get away before I call the police!. 

730
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:00,850
 You got fired from your job because of me. 

731
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:03,200
 I can find another. 

732
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,980
 Take this and buy yourself some food. 

733
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,850
 No, it's okay. I have money. 

734
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:13,760
 It's because I feel bad. Take it. 

735
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:20,750
My daughter remembered her as a warm and giving person who expected nothing in return.

736
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:27,440
What's more, she served her partial sentence when she was framed for murder.

737
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,270
She also underwent the great pain of losing her daughter.

738
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,990
The law may have to judge her,

739
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:40,890
but I already forgave Oh Yun Hui.

740
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:04,250
 Seol Ah, you also agree with Mom, right? 

741
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,680
Defendants, please stand.

742
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,180
I will make my ruling.

743
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:40,670
Considering that Defendant Oh Yun Hui admitted to all the charges and turned herself in,

744
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,480
and that in her fragile emotional and physical state, she consistenly showed the signs of her remorse and contrition,

745
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:52,430
and that the victim's family eagerly wishes for leniency, I hereby sentence the defendant three years in prison.

746
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:54,070
Three years?

747
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,110
Mom!

748
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,790
Please say something!

749
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:10,030
Did you admit to all the charges?

750
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:11,150
Please say something!

751
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:13,610
This is a political intrigue.

752
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:16,460
It's a conspiracy, I say! My party will not

753
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,220
stand for it!

754
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:22,380
- I will pursue this matter further!
- Jeni! Jeni, where's the Three Madams?

755
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,520
Mom! Don't leave me!

756
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,430
Listen to me!

757
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,670
Mom!

758
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:30,530
- My son! 
 - Wait, let me just talk to her!

759
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:35,120
Fellow Koreans! This assemblyman is not at fault!

760
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:40,350
As my predecessors withstood and thrive through their suffering, I will be back!

761
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:42,760
The law of the Republic of Korea has just collapsed!

762
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,700
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol!

763
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:50,590
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol! Mom didn't do it!

764
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,570
Eun Byeol!

765
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,070
I love you a lot, my son.

766
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,350
Make sure to eat, okay?

767
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:01,890
Eun Byeol!

768
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,650
Eun Byeol? My Eun Byeol.

769
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:08,630
Over here! Please give us  a statement!

770
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:11,960
What are you staring at?

771
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,790
So annoying.

772
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:27,280
Mom!

773
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,250
I can do it by myself.

774
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:46,160
How? You just came home after a long while.

775
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,040
I bet you will see many places you need to fix up.

776
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,330
Seok Gyeong came here to help you, too.

777
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:58,350
When did I?

778
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:07,040
Did you hear about Ha Eun Byeol? She's completely vanished.

779
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,760
She probably got scared and fled after seeing you back. I hope she never returns.

780
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,670
That shameless brat. She creeps me out.

781
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:22,270
Hey! Bae Ro Na! Come out!

782
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,830
What the hell are you doing?

783
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:33,520
How childish, what are you two doing?

784
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,330
Have you losers regrouped or something?

785
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:40,400
You two, get a hold of yourselves. This is no time to wait on Bae Ro Na hand and foot.

786
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,650
Who do you think is to blame for my parents going to prison?

787
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:46,150
- Je Ni. 
 - Don't come close!

788
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:50,920
If your mom hadn't killed Min Seol Ah, my mom would've had no reason to be arrested.

789
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,460
Not knowing a thing, any idea how I liked your mom?

790
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:59,910
Any idea how heartbroken I was thinking you were dead? Why did you have to mess up things like this?

791
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:06,610
You say you're a friend, yet you keep giving me a hard time. I can't even like you. Why?

792
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:11,200
I won't let you get away with this, Bae Ro Na. Do you have any idea who our family is?

793
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,090
My grandpa said he would avenge my dad losing his seat in the Assembly for as long as he could.

794
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:20,130
Right, my mom did something unforgivable. I won't make any excuses.

795
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:24,510
But for once, you all should take responsibility for your actions.

796
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:27,890
I'm also ready to face my punishment for causing you hardships.

797
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:33,840
I won't forgive anyone who gives my pitiful mother misery.

798
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:39,600
Any idea how precious my mom is to me? A warning, my father won't leave you alone.

799
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:46,640
Right. Her father is a really scary person. You're dead now, Bae Ro Na.

800
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:51,220
You idiot. Worry about your own life.

801
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:56,000
If Je Ni's father comes back, it'll be you or me who dies first.

802
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,760
Don't worry about them. Go back in and unpack your stuff.

803
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:11,550
What are you looking at?

804
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:15,150
I can't be motivated to be a good person because of the kids like you.

805
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:19,090
Let's go, Bro. We have plans with Mom.

806
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:21,810
Mom must be waiting for us.

807
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:42,880
She's the one who gave birth to you.

808
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,120
Have you met this lady before?

809
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,000
Yes.

810
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:52,290
What kind of person was she?

811
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,520
 Na Ae Gyo:  03/08/1978 ~ 05/19/2020 
 The brightest one, 

812
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,780
She was a cool person.
 May you soar in the sky as a butterfly. 

813
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:03,110
She was decisive about everything and loyal, too.

814
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:08,660
She loved and cared a lot about you two.

815
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:13,660
That's a lie.  Yet she never bothered to come and see us?

816
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,440
There were circumstances.

817
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,820
I'll tell you what they are at a later time.

818
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:27,920
Where is Min Seol Ah?

819
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:34,550
I want to visit her.

820
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,470
 Min Seol Ah: 11/3/2005 - 11/14/2019 

821
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:00,100
This trophy is yours.

822
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,420
Congratulations on winning the grand prize.

823
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:11,250
 Min Seol Ah. Be the beautiful song that gently comes down from the painless heaven.  

824
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,330
 Seoul Choong Moo Penitentiary 

825
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:34,060
Chairman, take it easy.

826
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:38,470
Eat this.

827
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:45,600
There's an interesting article in today's newspaper.

828
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,250
He who laughs when things get tough is the winner.

829
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,090
Shakespeare said it.

830
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,930
 Logan Lee. Out!

01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:19,200

 My Princess

01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,430
 Dad! 

840
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:26,420
My daughter! How have you been? I'm back in Korea!

841
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:29,990
 Dad, are you really back in Korea? Come quickly! 

842
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:34,620
My Princess, I'll be home soon so I'll see you then.

843
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,480
Congratulations on your release, Sir.

844
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,170
What about that bastard? Where is he now?

845
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,650
 Dear passengers, the flight that departed from JFK Airport in New York 

846
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:58,800
 will soon arrive at Incheon Int'l Airport. 

847
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,290
 Please fasten your seatbelts. 

848
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:02,560
Are you about to propose?

849
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:05,150
The ring.

850
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:11,780
Excellent choice. It looks elegant.

851
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:15,280
Is that so? Thank you.

852
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,880
Korea must have changed a lot, right?

853
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:23,340
Of course.

854
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:27,410
It's been so long so I'm quite excited.

855
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:32,040
Especially at the thought of seeing my friend whom I miss so much.

856
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,380
Good thing, I'm alive.

857
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,590
I finally get to see him.

858
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,970
Mr. Baek.

859
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:55,780
Su Ryeon, where are you? I just got back.

860
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,990
Already?

861
01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:01,690
My heart was in a rush so I couldn't wait any longer.

862
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:07,000
I also came back to the Penthouse. It's been hectic with unpacking.

863
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,320
I'm sure the kids like it.

864
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:15,310
I want to see you. We should meet soon.

865
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:18,190
I also have something I want to say to you, Logan.

866
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:22,160
I'm headed to the shop. Do you want to meet met there?

867
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,320
Okay, let's do that.

868
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:28,430
â™«  I know it's becoming obvious.  â™«

869
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:33,640
â™«  Because I can't leave you like this,  â™«

870
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:40,320
â™«  I had to even tell a lie.  â™«

871
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:48,860
â™«  Please get away from here.  Like we don't care  â™«

872
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:52,340
Yes, I'm here already.

873
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:57,110
Me too. I just got here. I'm in the parking lot. 
  JAKOMO 

874
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,700
Can you come out for a second?

875
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:02,140
I'll be right there.

876
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:06,020
â™«  You keep repeating just the words that you love me  â™«

877
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:12,880
â™«  Still saying it's okay even it if becomes so.  â™«

878
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:19,710
â™«  To me who abandoned you everyday.  â™«

879
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:24,560
I'm going to have a quick cigarette. I guess I'm a little nervous.

880
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,600
Okay, go ahead.

881
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:52,800
 Bulgari 

882
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,910
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

883
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:21,970
Yes, I'm fine.

884
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:09,200
 Thank you to the Channel Manager, miss_rochester. 

885
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:15,300
 Thank you to the segmenters:pilar_velasquz, bhohnsonwong, hana_860, leogregory, kawaii_2017 

886
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:21,100
 Thank you to the segmenters, cont.: cgwm808, dasfl49, henrii_1, plc_958, chemellelott 

887
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:27,100

888
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:33,100

889
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:39,330

890
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:45,180


891
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:56,870


892
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:59,260
 I'm going to relieve my Seol Ah of her unjust death! 

893
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,850
 Let's avenge Seol Ah's death together. 

894
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:03,770
 Do you think I have the right to live a new life? 

895
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:05,710
 I couldn't forgive myself for leaving for the airport without you. 

896
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:07,310
 I don't know anyone like you. 

897
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:08,530
 It is you, for sure! 

898
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:10,380
 I'm sorry for recognizing you so late. 

899
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,310
 Why are you here? What if you get caught? 

900
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:13,910
 My last promise with Seol Ah. 

901
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:16,230
 I want you to be happy, Mom. 

902
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,920
 I'm going to make you happy. 

903
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,100
 The Penthouse 2: War in Life 

904
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:25,160
 The highlight of Cheon Ah Arts Festival, the grand prize goes to... 

905
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:29,100
  I'm wondering if you can concede a little for Seok Gyeong's sake.  

906
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,610
 You see, I love my daughter a lot 

907
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:32,700
 You don't love Chairman Ju! 

908
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,850
 I'll do everything you tell me to! 

909
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:35,610
 So leave Eun Byeol alone. 

910
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:37,890
 Have you already forgotten what happened to Sim Su Ryeon while trying to protect her daughter?! 

911
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:40,070
 Are you going to train that housewife (Ajumma) in such a crappy way? 

912
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:42,260
 How dare someone talk down to Lady from Jincheon? 

913
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,680
 I'm sorry Ro Na! Just please stay alive! 

914
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:47,130
 In order to find the real culprit who killed Ro Na.. 

915
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:50,770
 I have a plan to end Ju Dan Tae in one go. 

916
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:52,810
 Na Ae Gyo died last night. 

917
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:54,540
 What in the world! No way! 

918
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,500
 She wasn't Na Ae Gyo. She was Sim Su Ryeon. 

919
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,980
 Su Ryeon helped Ro Na stay alive. 

920
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,650
 I'm here to turn myself in. 

921
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:02,510
 ...whether I peak this way or that way... 

922
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:05,530
 Whoever tries to betray me dies. 

923
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:08,390
 That way I can kill you.
