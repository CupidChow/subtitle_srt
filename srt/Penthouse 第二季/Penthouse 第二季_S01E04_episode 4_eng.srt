00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,400
  Episode 4 

2
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,870
Are you here?

3
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,680
What are you doing?

4
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,850
Why are you here?

5
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,940
What are you doing?

6
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,400
Why did you turn off all the lights? Is Teacher Jin not here?

7
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
Don't turn them on.

8
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,360
I can't wait anymore.

9
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,980
Confirm your feelings with me today, Seok Hun.

10
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,460
What are you doing?

11
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,080
Ju Seok Hun! You can't just leave like this!

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,960
Seriously, what on earth are you doing?

13
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,160
The conditions of our agreement are that we study and share a tutor together. That's it.

14
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,370
If you're going to keep acting like this,

15
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,780
I'm going to quit the tutoring and everything else.

16
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,050
Don't call me again.

17
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,060
Just promise me one thing.

18
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,960
Promise you'll never fall for Bae Ro Na.

19
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,700
Ro Na and I are nothing now.

20
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,620
I erased her from my mind a long time ago.

21
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,760
♫  L'amour est un oiseau rebelle  ♫

22
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,120
♫  Que nul ne peut apprivoiser  ♫

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,530
♫  Et c'est bien en vain qu'on l'appelle  ♫

24
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,170
♫  S'il lui convient de refuser  ♫

25
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,110
♫  Rien n'y fait, menaces ou prières  ♫

26
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,640
♫  L'un parle bien, l'autre se tait   ♫

27
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,010
♫  Et c'est l'autre que je préfère  ♫

28
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,500
- Hope I didn't keep you waiting for long.
 - No, I got here in a little rush.

29
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,330
It's a recommended wine. Do you want the same?

30
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,020
I would love that.

31
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,670
How do you like this hotel? I rented it long term.

32
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,910
Use it whenever you want to rest by yourself.

33
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,440
It'll be even better if we come together.

34
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,670
Thank you. I didn't even think of a thing like this.

35
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,220
The view is wonderful, and the place feels cozy. I like it very much.

36
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,050
Oh, there's one more thing. A surprise.

37
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:38,760
♫  Si tu ne m’aimes pas, je t’aime ! Mais, si je t’aime  ♫

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,380
Come quick.

39
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:49,770
♫  Si je t’aime, prends garde à toi !  ♫

40
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,090
What is it?

41
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,760
I noticed you enjoy wearing Designer Baek's dresses, so I requested a few.

42
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,690
Wear them as much as you want for the concerts this year.

43
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,000
And next year, I'll get you different dresses.

44
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,160
What are you doing not checking them out?

45
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,690
What do you think? Do you like them?

46
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,320
Yes, they're so pretty.

47
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,700
This one.

48
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,370
How about wearing it for the dinner party at the Blue House?

49
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,810
I got this dress specially altered for you.

50
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,140
I'm so touched.

51
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,930
When did you get all these?

52
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,450
I am happy, too, because you like them.

53
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,960
Shall we toast? Let's relax and drink till tomorrow.

54
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,210
But there's a little problem.

55
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,260
I have to get going now.

56
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,720
What are you talking about?

57
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,900
I got a call from my mom, and she said she wasn't feeling well.

58
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,530
I'm concerned for her.

59
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,660
Is she very sick?

60
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,630
That's why you looked nervous.

61
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,740
You're trembling right now.

62
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,140
It isn't anything too serious with her.

63
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,700
- I think I need to go in a hurry. 
 - Okay.

64
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,300
Let's go.

65
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,910


66
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,910
You don't look well. Let me take you there.

67
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,730
No, I can go on my own.

68
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,310
I'm off now.

69
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,750
Let me know how your mother is doing.

70
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,640
Wow, did you come back to see me?

71
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,960
What are you doing? What are you really planning?

72
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,560
How did you know I was here? Did you follow me?

73
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,330
Calm down.

74
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,450
I've been wondering why you came back all this time.

75
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,490
Obviously, Oh Yun Hui, that wrench is using you to upset me.

76
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,760
Do you really not know? Or do you pretend not to know?

77
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,690
- Listen to me first. 
 - You!

78
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,020
You still have feelings for me, don't you?

79
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,690
That's why you brought Oh Yun Hui and her daughter as well to aggravate me.

80
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,560
Did you think I would waver if you did?

81
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,740
Do you really think I'd throw away everything I have and come back to you?

82
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,910
That's really something Ha Yun Cheol is apt to think.

83
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,530
Are you laughing?

84
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,490
Sure, that would be fun.

85
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,720
If I'm really putting on a show to win you back.

86
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,690
But what should I do?

87
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,260
Although I feel sorry for you as you let your imagination go wild,

88
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,540
but I love Yun Hui.

89
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,680
My returning has obviously upset you a lot.

90
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
I thought you were quite happy with Ju Dan Tae.

91
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,160
Looks like that isn't it, either.

92
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,870
Just tell me why you came to this hotel.

93
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,660
Why did you do that to me in New York?

94
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,860
What are you talking about?

95
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,410
I don't remember a thing.

96
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,870
- Even if I do this? 
 - What the heck are you doing?

97
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,200
I came to the hotel for a meeting,

98
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,930
and I happened to see you in the lobby.

99
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,190
I wanted to see

100
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,790
if what we did in New York was a mistake.

101
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,550
In the end, I came to see what we did was a mistake. That's all.

102
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,240
Do you want me to believe that your feelings for Oh Yun Hui are real?

103
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,470
I don't care if you don't.

104
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,280
The one thing that I'm certain is

105
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,960
you're not in my heart anymore.

106
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,420
So, going forward, be careful.

107
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,410
Bastard.

108
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,690
Don't appear in front of me again unless you want to die.

109
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,030
That's what I want, too.

110
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,060
  M-u-r-d-e-r-e-r 

111
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,600
 G-e-t L-o-s-t 

112
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,420
You're a murderer's daughter,

113
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,970
I won't leave you alone, Bae Ro Na.

114
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,770
Hey! What are you doing here?

115
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,220
Did you do all this? 
   Murderer Get Lost 

116
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,640
Just act like you don't know anything.

117
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,130
Unless you're on the same side as the murderer.

118
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,990
That rude wrench, look at how she talks to adults.

119
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,920
Why are you getting home just now?

120
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,290
Do you have some hidden gold at Min Hyeok's house?

121
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,400
I have something similar to that.

122
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,480
But why aren't you sleeping yet?

123
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,660
I was waiting because I have something to say to you.

124
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,110
Can you tell me tomorrow?

125
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,340
I drank a little, and now I'm really sleepy.

126
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,580
What do you have to tell me?

127
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,700
Never mind. I'll tell you next time.

128
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,400
Ok, I'm sorry.

129
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,100
Then I'm going to go to sleep.

130
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,170
- I love you, my princess. 
 - Me, too.

131
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,290
- What are you doing! 
-  Bae Ro Na came back to school.

132
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,040
Teacher Cheon admitted Bae Ro Na back into school.

133
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,230
So she approved Bae Ro Na to come back to school.

134
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,470
Ro Na is the daughter of a murderer.

135
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,000
It's driving me crazy living in the same building as her, but now I have to go to school with her?

136
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,380
If you have time to get yourself worked up like this,

137
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,430
wouldn't it be better to get ready for Cheong Ah Arts Festival?

138
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,960
Other kids may be able to get in with their skills,

139
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,980
but, without a recommendation from the head of the school, not  even SNU's (Seoul National Universty) School of Music,

140
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,780
you can't even get into a decent college in Seoul.

141
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,500
You're an idiot who can't even take her midterms without the answers I steal for her.

142
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,100
Do you expect me to buy you the answer keys for your SAT? I hope not.

143
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,390
If I win the grand prize trophy, what will you do for me?

144
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,350
I'll do whatever you want.

145
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,770
- Let me move out. 
 - Move out?

146
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,700
It gives me the creeps living with Eun Byeol in the same house.

147
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,710
I want to move out when I get into college.

148
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,500
There's an apartment in my name, too.

149
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,050
Moving out...

150
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,130
Okay.

151
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,530
If you bring that trophy to me, I'll think about it.

152
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,440
I promise you.

153
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,530
The trophy for Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

154
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,880
I'll bring it to you no matter what it takes.

155
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,300
Is this how you've been living?

156
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,500
Is this why you came back?

157
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,440
My mind hasn't changed.

158
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,770
Go back to America quickly.

159
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,890
Don't think about stepping  foot into this house.

160
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm going to live here.

161
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,840
According to whom?

162
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,070
I called her here.

163
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,380
What are you doing?

164
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,210
Ro Na, come in.

165
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,480
I bet it was hard for you to get here. I cleaned your room already.

166
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,960
Come on in.

167
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,910
 Let's get on well with each other. Never forget when you look back, you'll always find someone on your side. 

168
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,930
 I'm rooting for you. From Mister 

169
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,860
 From Cheong Ah Arts School: Student Bae Ro Na has just been accepted back into school. 

170
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,270
  Did you ever meet Seol Ah? 

171
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,910
No, not once.

172
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,830
Mister, my mom

173
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,980
did what she did to Min Seol Ah all because of me.

174
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,100
I threw a fit in front of  Mom  over wanting to go to Cheong Ah Arts School,

175
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,970
and I pestered her every day.

176
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,310
So you can hate me.

177
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,800
But I don't want you to hate my mom too much.

178
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,140
Every time I saw you at Cheong Ah Arts School,

179
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,700
I was reminded of my Seol Ah.

180
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,720
She sang as well as you do.

181
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,820
Singing was that child's dream.

182
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,240
She called me on the day she met Cheon Seo Jin for the first time.

183
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,680
  Anna Lee, correct? 

184
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,320
 Yes. Just call me Anna, if you'd like.  

185
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,000
 I met with Ms. Cheon Seo Jin for the first time. I was so nervous my mind went blank.  

186
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,270
 I didn't get to tell her what I prepared to say.  That I was a huge fan of hers.   

187
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,960
 I must've been in shock seeing how much more beautiful she was than I thought in person.  

188
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,310
 My heart was pounding like crazy as I looked at those pictures of her singing.  

189
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,760
 I was gripped by the sudden desire to sing.  

190
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:06,570
 Going to Cheong Ah Arts School, becoming her pupil, standing on the stage singing 

191
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,670
 and winning the trophy for the grand prize for Cheong Ah Arts Festival,  

192
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,430
 I went wild in my head imagening these things. And I was happy even for a brief moment.  

193
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,550
 Could I sing if I had my mom with me? 

194
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,370
 CA (Cheong Ah): Bae Ro Na 

195
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,600
Min Seol Ah,

196
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,590
I'm going to make the dream which you couldn't realize happen.

197
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,940
I swear I'll get the grand prize trophy at Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

198
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,580
After that,

199
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,130
I will never sing again.

200
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,970
Nonsense. Of course, she should come home to us. Why should a child like her live in the States all by herself?

201
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,730
Is that why, without consulting me, did you sign the parental agreement form?

202
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,100
How could I have said no when Ro Na called and asked me personally?

203
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,130
Yun Hui, why are you against this? You being like this is what I don't understand.

204
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,280
Ro Na can't be here.

205
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,180
You know very well what kind of place Cheong Ah Arts School is.

206
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,530
Do you think Cheon Seo Jin will leave Ro Na alone?

207
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,510
You shouldn't worry about that.

208
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,120
Ro Na, you—

209
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,270
I just got a text that said I was readmitted to school.

210
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,810
So I'm going to school. See you later.

211
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,120
Ro Na, wait. I'll walk out with you.

212
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,770
I'm going to work. Make sure you eat your breakfast.

213
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,210
- No, wait.
 - Ro Na. Ro Na!

214
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,100
Wait for me.  Let's go together.

215
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,680
Ro Na. Here. You skipped your breakfast.

216
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,180
Thank you.

217
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,640
I got your necklace. I like it very much.

218
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,240
- Sir.
 - Yes?

219
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,670
Be good to my mom.

220
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,570
You should be good to my mom, though others are not.

221
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,400
Ro Na, walk out with me, okay?

222
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,050
Seriously, I'm getting ticked off.

223
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,410
 I need you to come see me at the company. This is urgent.
  JKING HOLDINGS 

224
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,790
What is it? What's so urgent?

225
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,610
You know this reporter, right? Son Hyeong Jin with  People's Daily.  

226
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,710
He's famous. A reporter who's  anti  everything about me. Why, did he write another odd story about me?

227
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,210
He got in touch with me.

228
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,190
 Cheon Seo Jin is rumored to be on bad terms with Chairman Ju! Talk of breakup! Is marriage scrapped? 

229
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,300
This is the story Reporter Son is going to run today.
 Prima Donna Cheon Seo Jin's rumored love affair with the other man. 

230
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,040
What's going on?

231
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,060
Didn't you say you were on your way to your mom's last night?

232
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,980
What happened was I left my purse in the room. So I came back to grab it quick.

233
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,110
On my way out, I ran into someone. He was a total stranger.

234
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,910
He was drunk and hitting on me. So I just ran out of the place. That's all.

235
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,250
The story is  full of non-sense and false.

236
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,050
Do you dare expect me to believe what you're telling me now?

237
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,460
Since when did you begin to keep secrets from me?

238
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,970
Can I take it that you deceived me and went out to see another man?

239
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,110
Who is he? Who's the guy you hooked up with last night? Tell me!

240
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,360
I already told you  he was someone I didn't know.

241
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,790
Why do I have to explain to you a drunken man I bumped into by accident?

242
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,530
So he's a guy you don't know.

243
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,940
Chauffer Cho, come in.

244
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,480
Who was that guy?

245
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,640
The pictures are blurry. So I'm still looking for him.

246
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,780
- The hotel?
 - I requested the CCTV footage, but they refused in order to protect personal information.

247
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,870
If you have time to rattle off your flimsy answers, go and find that bastard!

248
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,640
Probably because the pictures are already out there, my stocks took a nosedive today.

249
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,410
I'll give you an hour. Find that bastard and bring him before my face at once!

250
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,520
Stop it!

251
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,120
Chauffer Cho, you can leave.

252
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,660
Aren't you supposed to believe me blindly when I say something's not?

253
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,920
Only if I know the truth, can I clean up the mess.

254
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,180
Being the leech that he is, he'll do everything he can to get the story printed.

255
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,870
Even if I have to pay him, I've got to try to stop him.

256
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,270
You don't have to. I'm going to take care of this on my end.

257
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,960
This is no time for you to get puffed up with confidence.

258
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,080
I'm telling you  I  will take care of it.

259
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,250
Working yourself up and cornering me with your accusation without letting me explain

260
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,490
is quite offensive.

261
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,870
I need to go back to school.

262
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,240
Pick up the phone Ha Yun Cheol. Pick it up, you bastard.

263
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,990
 The call cannot be connected... 

264
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,580
Hey, Ha Eun Byeol.

265
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,470
Have you known this? I see how little your mom is capable of.

266
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,570
Doesn't she have enough power to counter punch little Bae Ro Na?

267
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,040
Watch what you say. I'm pissed as much as you are.

268
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,180
We just got one more competitor in our midst, you fool.

269
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,840
Are you willing to do whatever I ask you to?

270
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,620
I'm going to stop that little bitch from coming to our school.

271
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,490
Going forward, you and I are on the same team.

272
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,130
It won't be bad to unite our forces against our common enemy for a time.

273
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,940
 JohnBIO: POWER UP 

274
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,240
Why aren't you picking up-
 JohnBio: Innovation &amp; Development 

275
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,020
Are you here? Why are you out of breath?

276
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,450
Do you have something urgent?

277
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,950
What are you doing here?

278
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,820
Let's pick up where we left off. It was your turn to answer.

279
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,120
Whom did I see last night?

280
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,070
Why would you be curious about that?

281
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,610
Just go ahead and answer my question.

282
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,360
The man in the pictures is you, correct?

283
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,170
The way you phrased the question is funny. It's as if you know the answer in advance.

284
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,480
Right. I met Seo Jin.

285
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,440
But am I obliged to report even a thing like that to her fiancé?

286
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,130
At that late hour of the day and in front of a hotel, of all places?

287
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:55,230
I ran into her by chance.

288
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,910
The angles in the pictures are quite suggestive.

289
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,990
Don't tell me you're suspecting Seo Jin. Do you two have any problem?

290
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,010
Talk no more.

291
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,950
Now that you confirmed, stop embarrassing me and just go.

292
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,810
Should I have pretended not to know her when she's my ex-wife?

293
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:18,570
Looks like I made a faux pas. You must be exhausted, though,

294
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,630
when you have to deal with a fiancé who's hyper-sensitive to every move you make.

295
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,790
In this world, a mindless scandal like this can make my company stocks go volatile.

296
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,100
Are you sure it's because of a scandal, not any problem you have in your company?

297
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,950
Ha Yun Cheol.

298
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,530
I apologize if I offended you. I just said it out of concern.

299
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,270
I couldn't tell him because I didn't want to be misunderstood.

300
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,550
Anyway, thanks.

301
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:05,470
Did you say Reporter Son Hyeong Jin at  People's Daily?  I'll explain to him myself.

302
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,280
I will, not for your sake, but for Eun Byeol's.

303
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,950
We can't let her be hurt again because of us.

304
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,550
Sir, everyone is waiting. Shall I cancel the meeting?

305
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,570
No, let them in.

306
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,590
I hope we won't see each other again for personal matters in the future. I feel sorry for Yun Hui.

307
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,340
Well then.

308
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,590
Don't you trust me? Do I have to apologize to Ha Yun Cheol for what you do as well?

309
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,730
Is this all our relationship amounts to?

310
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,650
You should've told me from the start that it was Ha Yun Cheol! Why would you lie and complicate things?

311
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:03,170
Because you're always sensitive, and I didn't want to argue with you!

312
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,060
It was for you.

313
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,720
Because I had to stop such a ridiculous romantic scandal.

314
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,930
Legally, we're not bound yet in any way.

315
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,760
If you disappoint me again,

316
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,110
I'm going to have to seriously reconsider our relationship.

317
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,680
Both the merging of our companies and our marriage.

318
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,480
Cheon Seo Jin.

319
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,520
This is the last time you'll do a sly thing like this.

320
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,900
Has your daughter gotten back safely? 
( Bun Hong, "Pink", Logan Lee's assistant )

321
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:07,700
You knew my daughter returned to Korea, didn't you? But why didn't you say anything?

322
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,270
It was Logan's instruction not to tell you.

323
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:16,790
He promised to protect Ro Na and keep her away from Korea.

324
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,600
When it comes to breaking promises, are you any different?

325
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,890
What's  that supposed to mean?

326
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:28,810
Logan must have told you to find Seok Gyeong's biological mother, Na Ae Gyo.

327
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:34,340
How on earth do you expect me to find someone you yourselves haven't found yet?

328
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,390
You should've approached Ju Dan Tae.

329
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,720
He would know the whereabouts of Na Ae Gyo.

330
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,070
Why does Logan want to find Seok Gyeong's birth mother?

331
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,810
That

332
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,630
will  naturally come to light when she's found.

333
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,110
 JKing Holdings 

334
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:19,060
Seeing that his stocks are stuck helplessly, people must've quite bought into what the scandal says.

335
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,410
Don't you think, Reporter Son?

336
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:36,280
Considering it was a fabrication of my own, I think I made it quite believable.

337
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,800
Well then...

338
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,510
You won't be disappointed.

339
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,300
Right.

340
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:08,080
 Cheon Seo Jin, Ju Dan Tae. I'm going to break you apart with my own hands. 

341
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,150
 I'm going to make you loathe each other to the point you want the other dead. 

342
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,530
Quiet. Quiet!

343
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,310
As announced, today, there's going to be a preliminary audition for the Cheong Ah Arts Festival today.

344
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:24,440
Since this is an in-school event that reflects the school's reputation,

345
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:32,100
the entire selection process will be done with transparency and fairness.

346
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,830
Two people will make up a team and compete in a tournament for the preliminaries.

347
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,230
Now, I'll draw the names for the teams.

348
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,000
For the most coveted Team 1,

349
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,240
- Ahn Eun Hu. 
- Why am I in the first team?

350
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,750
Moving right away to Team 2, we have Ju Seok Gyeong.

351
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:58,050
The player who will go against Ju Seok Gyeong is
 Yu Je Ni, Bae Ro Na 

352
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,330
 Yu Je Ni 

353
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,090
Yu Je Ni.

354
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,130
We're in the same team.

355
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,920
Now, next is Team 3.

356
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,460
Ha Eun Byeol. And the opponent who goes against her is

357
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,610
Bae Ro Na.

358
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,250
Wow, how did they end up going against each other?

359
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,520
For real. This is like a preview of the grand final.

360
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,440
So these are the teams. The preliminary song which  I'm sure you're most curious about is

361
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,340
Schubert's Serenade.
 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival : Preliminary Song 

362
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,140
The preliminaries will start in two hours.

363
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,980
Make sure you get some individual practice time. That's all.

364
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,370
Hello, Chairman Ju? This is Ma Du Gi. I just finished drawing the teams.

365
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,640
You took care of everything well, right?

366
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,160
 As you requested, I placed Eun Byeol and Ro Na in one team. 

367
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,580
One of the two won't make it, so Seok Gyeong has one less competitor to worry about.

368
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,160
Do you think Eun Byeol might be the one to lose?

369
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,540
Yes, of course! I also let the judges for the preliminary  rounds know in advnance.

370
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,130
Good work, Department Head Ma. While you're at it, you make sure all goes well till the final.

371
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,600
If Seok Gyeong wins the Grand Prize,

372
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,960
your reward will be something entirely different from anything up to now.

373
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,860
It's not like I was expecting anything, but thank you still.

374
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:51,760
I'll do my absolute best to get the result you want.

375
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,370
Yu Je Ni, bring it here now.

376
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,080
Head shot!

377
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,770
What do you think you're doing?

378
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,610
Red definitely suits you since you're the daughter of a murderer.

379
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,410
That case has been wrapped up already.

380
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,460
My mom was proven innocent and the real perpetrator was exposed.

381
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,240
Why are you being stubborn like this?

382
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,340
Shut up!

383
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,990
It's your mom who killed my mom. You'll forever be the daughter of a murderer.

384
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:52,290
Is this because you feel sorry toward your mom?

385
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,680
What?

386
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,170
You're sorry about how you wronged your mom, so you torment me?

387
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,530
Does that make you feel better?

388
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,290
What's going on here?

389
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,310
Bae Ro Na! What happened to you?

390
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:16,890
The preliminaries are about to start! Do you think this is the time to fool around?

391
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,160
No, Seok Gyeong —

392
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,030
Go to the bathroom and get yourself cleaned up. Or else, you'll ruin your uniform with stains.

393
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:28,370
There's no time, so make it quick. The rest of you, head to the auditorium.

394
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,030
Goodness.

395
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,980
I'll help you, so hurry up here.
  Cheong Ah Arts School 

396
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,780
Hurry!

397
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,060
What are you two doing here?

398
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,320
You startled me. Are you still here?

399
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,660
We're headed to our preliminary round.

400
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,610
The piano rounds are tomorrow, right? Did you practice a lot?

401
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah, I'm about to go to my lesson.

402
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,300
Good luck.

403
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,390
Thanks.

404
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,470
Take your blouse off. I'll wash it for you.

405
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,040
No thanks, I'll do it.

406
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,840
There's no time for that. The preliminaries are starting soon.

407
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,860
You wash your skirt.

408
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,590
Thanks.

409
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,530
I should just go. I'll make you late, too.

410
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,360
Je Ni, what are you doing?

411
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:59,230
Hello? Can someone open the door? It's locked!

412
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,530
There's no point you doing that.

413
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,950
No one's coming. You and I are the school outcasts.

414
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,470
Did you know this from the start?

415
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:15,200
This is the rule of Cheong Ah Arts. The rule that Seok Gyeong and Eun Byeol came up with.

416
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,600
If you help an outcast, you'll be an even bigger one.

417
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,600
Didn't you know?

418
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:30,320
♫  In den stillen Hain herneider  ♫

419
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,560
♫  Liebchen komm zu mir  ♫

420
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,750
Next is Team 2. Ju Seok Gyeong.

421
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:53,000
And Yu Je Ni. Where is Yu Je Ni?

422
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,910
Teacher, Je Ni and Ro Na aren't present.

423
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,740
What? Are they still not here?

424
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,480
What should we do, Chairwoman? Should we wait a little longer?

425
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,980
Let's start with the other teams first. We should give them a chance at least.

426
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,650
What are you doing?

427
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:21,810
Move! I'm never going to give in and give up!

428
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,210
Give up! It's no use!

429
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,010
Let go.

430
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,020
Yu Je Ni.

431
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,690
 CA
Cheong Ah Arts School 

432
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,680
Come out quickly. We're running out of time.

433
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,010
What are you doing?

434
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,840
We're done with the last team.

435
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,010
I don't think it's fair to wait for them any longer.

436
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:07,950
How about we advance Seok Gyeong and Eun Byeol by default?

437
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,780
We have no other choice.

438
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,720
Then, Yu Je Ni and Bae Ro Na will be treated as disqualified,

439
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,870
Ju Seok Gyeong and Ha Eun Byeol will advance to the final—

440
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,260
I- I'm here.

441
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,580
I'm not late, am I?

442
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:37,310
Too bad. Time's up already, and we just disqualified you.

443
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,650
Please let me try. It's not over yet.
 Music Department - Preliminaries 

444
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,350
The most important thing when taking any test is punctuality.

445
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,370
This is an obvious outcome of not keeping time. Accept it.

446
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,620
Someone locked me in the bathroom.

447
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,790
On purpose.

448
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,750
Who would do such a thing?

449
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,440
Ju Seok Gyeong, Ha Eun Byeol, why did you do that?

450
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,980
Tell it straight. Did you have no confidence at all?

451
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,920
Were you that scared that I'd make it to the finals?

452
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,400
Bae Ro Na! What nonsense do you insist on this time?

453
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,310
I won't give you another chance just because you act this way.

454
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,800
I'm telling the truth. Please believe me.

455
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,070
How are you going to prove it?

456
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,260
Je Ni was with me.

457
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,620
Je Ni is a witness.

458
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,980
She's lying!

459
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,000
Bae Ro Na told me to lie and say we pretended to be locked in the bathroom.

460
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,880
And that we'd need to accuse Seok Gyeong and Eun Byeol of bullying us since we can't beat them with our skills anyway.

461
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,520
That way,

462
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,790
she said we could move on to the finals.

463
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:44,620
She locked me in the bathroom and wouldn't let me out.

464
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,820
Do you mean you did all that to yourself?

465
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,270
Bae Ro Na, are you crazy?

466
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,550
Yu Je Ni, why are you acting like this?

467
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,740
 Are you done? 

468
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,900
 Yu Je Ni, you're in the same team with me, right? 

469
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,050
 How do you have such a rotten luck? 

470
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:19,200
 Is your chance for the finals already busted? 

471
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,870
 You can't possibly practice hard thinking you can beat me, can you? 

472
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,490
 You don't have to be so scared. We're here because we want to help. 

473
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,820
 There's one way you can make it to the finals. 

474
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,790
 What is it? 

475
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:40,930
 You just need to prove to us that you're our friends, and not Bae Ro Na's. 

476
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:46,020
 Then, you can make it to the finals, and won't be bullied anymore. 

477
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,990
 I can get you back into our SNU (Seoul National University) study group.  

478
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,600
What do you think?

479
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,960
Bae Ro Na, were you always this mean?

480
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,680
No matter how important Cheong Ah Arts Festival might be, how could you do such a thing?

481
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,070
You really have no class.

482
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:07,830
Yu Je Ni, are you telling the truth? Can you take responsibility for what you're saying?

483
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:12,890
Yes. I can take the responsibility.

484
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,170
No, she's lying.

485
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,800
I never did such a thing.

486
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,740
I'm the one that was locked in. I'm the victim!

487
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:25,720
Department Head, Ma, as the chairperson of the school, I'll refer Bae Ro Na to the Displinary Committee.

488
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,550
I can't overlook an action that mars the purity of the intention of Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

489
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:36,500
Show no mercy. Treat her with the strict observance of the regulations.

490
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:43,850
Go tell them it wasn't me, and that they made you say all that.

491
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,920
By chance, were you in on scheming the whole thing with them, too?

492
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,630
Are you really just like them?

493
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,150
Why? Am I not allowed to?

494
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,950
Do you know what I had to go through because of you?

495
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,750
I was treated like an outcast because of you!

496
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:05,570
All because I bought you food once and take pity on you and talk to you!

497
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,320
Shouldn't you do something for me for once?

498
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:17,810
For all the things I had to put up with, I have to make it to SNU.

499
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,740
The only way to escape this hell is going to college.

500
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:26,210
So it's okay for me to get expelled again?

501
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,970
I was never a nice kid.

502
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:59,000
Get up.

503
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,010
When did you get here?

504
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,290
I saw everything between you and Je Ni.

505
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,900
I know you hate me,

506
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,460
but for now, let me help you.

507
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,500
I'll help you so that you can continue attending this school.

508
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,520
Bullying? What on earth!

509
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,280
It's my Min Hyeok who got his arm broken. Seriously,  who stabbed whom? No way.

510
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,850
Ro Na's mother has such a thick skin.

511
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,100
That's not the problem right now.

512
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,760
Je Ni was disqualified from the preliminary because of Ro Na.

513
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,850
Does that make sense?

514
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,020
The PTA must intervene and teach her a good lesson.

515
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,560
What, bullying?

516
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,650
You, horrible kid.

517
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,380
If you weren't confident, you should've dropped out by yourself.

518
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,840
Why did you have to bring Je Ni into this?

519
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,090
Je Ni will be dropped because of you. What are you goind to do about that?

520
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,920
Why did you crawl back in here? Did you think you'd be welcomed?

521
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,210
Stop interfering with my child's future!

522
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,500
It really wasn't me, Ahjumma!

523
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,950
Je Ni's mom, calm down. Or else, we'll get fingers pointed at us, instead.

524
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,700
How can I calm down at a time like this?

525
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:26,800
The single line, "A Finalist in Cheong Ah Arts Festival"  in your student record is enormously valuable.

526
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,180
The chance to earn such precious achievement was completely ruined by this kid.

527
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,000
Je Ni has a good brain.

528
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
She can take the SAT well and go to college through the traditional route.

529
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,270
Ms. Cheon, please help my daughter.

530
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,590
She unjustly got robbed of her chance to apply. Shouldn't she be helped out a little?

531
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,160
Do you even care about your daughter?

532
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,430
What did she just say?

533
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,890
Have you not come to your senses yet?

534
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,260
Tell the truth!

535
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,680
Keep you hands off my daughter!

536
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,860
Ro Na! Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

537
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,910
Are you hurt anywhere?

538
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,810
Can an adult treat a kid like this?

539
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,180
Don't you know this, too, is violence?

540
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:14,420
Why is it that no one steps in to intervene?

541
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:20,300
If any of you lay your hands on Ro Na again, I'm going to resort to the law.

542
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,350
I see that you're a big fan of law.

543
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:25,090
But, as they say, where you sow a bean, a bean sprouts.

544
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:29,080
Out of a criminal's household comes a school bully. This is a matter of genetics. Great!

545
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,620
It's good. This is why I care so much about family background.

546
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,020
You people have no roots.

547
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,190
You people have no roots. Shut that mouth of yours!

548
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:42,060
Hit me if you want to go to prison. That'll  look good on you.

549
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,830
Enough already!

550
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,950
Everyone, act in the way that suits the reputation of Hera Palace.

551
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,100
All of you,  take your seats.

552
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,110
Seriously.

553
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:04,440
Bae Ro Na, tell us. Who is the school bully?

554
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,890
Ju Seok Gyeong. Lee Min Hyeok.

555
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,140
And Ha Eun Byeol.

556
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,910
What?

557
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,370
Do you have the evidence that you were attacked?

558
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:22,940
What evidence? She probably made the whole thing up not to get expelled.

559
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,230
You call that false accusation.

560
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:30,120
You. Do you know what a serious crime it is to accuse someone falsely?

561
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,160
My daughter isn't the assailant, but the victim.

562
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,700
Aren't we supposed to listen to what the victim has to say first?

563
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,910
Ro Na, go on. Tell them.

564
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:46,540
Today, Ju Seok Gyeong filled a bucket of water with paint and poured it on me.

565
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:51,100
She then intentionally locked Je Ni and me in the bathroom while I was washing up.

566
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,910
Bae Ro Na, your dream must be to be a novelist.

567
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:00,120
Ha Eun Byeol and Lee Min Hyeok just watched  and didn't do anything to intervene.

568
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,080
When no one saw what happened or said they did it, how can I believe you?

569
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,050
It's just you and your alleged claim.

570
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,770
The kids are lying.

571
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,880
Just because the assailant denys what they did, does that mean there's no victim?

572
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,260
Bae Ro Na's mother. Believing only your daughter's words,

573
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,360
you uploaded such a huge lie on the homepage of the Office of Education. How does that make sense?

574
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,130
Upload a revised post and make an official apology promptly.

575
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,410
Or you'll have to face the possibility of a criminal charge.

576
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:32,410
The school isn't interested  in revealing the truth anyway.

577
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,070
In addition,

578
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,720
the disciplinary committee already decided that Bae Ro Na who tarnished Cheong Ah Arts Festival

579
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,670
and put a wedge among her classmates must be forced to transfer.

580
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:49,750
Since all the teachers are in agreement, we'll speed up the transfer process.

581
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:55,360
I understand. If you're going to deny your responsibilities till the end, I  have no choice.

582
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,880
I'll officially file a complaint with  the Ministry of Education.

583
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,830
Are you crazy? Who do you think you're calling?

584
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,870
Do you want to stop our kids from going to college?

585
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,600
- Let go! 
 - When an apology isn't enough, you really have no shame!

586
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,990
- What are you doing?! 
 - You came back to do this?

587
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:16,500
Honey, sue her!

588
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,000
Okay! I'll report her to the Ministry of Education.

589
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,740
I'm also going to tell about this to the reporters and file a national petition.

590
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,770
How dare you threaten a government official without any fear!

591
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,650
Please. Stop it, Mom!

592
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:32,560
Je Ni! Good, you are here.

593
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,410
You tell us everything she did to you so that we can stop her from lying.

594
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:38,950
She's not lying.

595
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,860
What Ro Na said

596
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,380
is all true.

597
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,950
What?

598
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:53,000
What? Are you saying, then, my Min Hyeok is a school bully?

599
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,680
You  better tell us the truth.

600
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,980
Did you get blackmailed by Ro Na?

601
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:04,060
This conniving brat. What have you done to my innocent daughter?

602
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,820
I said stop!

603
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,940
I'm the outcast!

604
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,090
For two years, I was cursed and bullied by the kids at Hera Palace.

605
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,160
I'm the one who was bullied.

606
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,430
I'm an outcast just like Ro Na.

607
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,710
Mom, when you don't know anything, why are you causing a scene like this?

608
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:33,110
An outcast? What are you talking about? Why would you be?

609
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,430
Why, how are you lacking?

610
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,590
Oh my.

611
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,570
What- What's wrong here? How long has it been like this?

612
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,590
Since when?

613
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,400
Who is it?

614
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,160
Who did this to you? Huh?

615
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:24,480
Who did it?

616
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,130
Who did this to my daughter!

617
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:29,390
Tell me now!

618
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,150
This is Je Ni's diagnosis from the hospital today.

619
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:43,650
Hair loss from stress and esophagitis have been progressing for quite some time.

620
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,320
 Don't you think Je Ni will say something different later? 

621
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:09,140
 Never. If she wants to compete in Cheong Ah Arts Festival, she must do what we tell her to. 

622
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:12,690
 What's the point of advancing to the finals? It's not like she'll get a prize. 

623
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:16,050
 Wouldn't it be better if we lump her together with Bae Ro Na and make them partners in crime? 

624
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,500
 Funny, how can someone like her think about going  to SNU's (Seoul National University) School of Music? 

625
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,860
 Darn, this was supposed to be a secret. 

626
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:26,330
 Did you know Je Ni's mom didn't graduate from Ehwa Women's University? 

627
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,740
 Wait, really?  

628
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,200
 My mom is the head of the alumni association of the School of Communication at Ehwa.  

629
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,070
 My mom found out, of all those graduated from the School of Home Economics 

630
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:35,780
 that Je Ni's mom wasn't there. 

631
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,360
 Does that mean she fabricated her education? 

632
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,890
 No wonder. You can tell  she's so ignorant.  

633
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:44,470
 You can tell from the crude way she talks.  

634
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,370
 She sure doesn't fit in with the rest of Hera Palace people. 

635
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:50,330
 Is that why she got along so well with Bae Ro Na? Like two peas in a pod. 

636
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,730
 Yeah, they're the same. 

637
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,510
 Does that mean all the designer bags she carries are fakes, too? 

638
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,220
 It must've been hard for her to pretend she has everything when she didn't. 

639
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,460
 Will you keep letting the kids harass you like this? 

640
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,410
 Let go.  

641
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:24,110
 I reported to the Office of Education that some students were bullied at school.  

642
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,330
 So you should let everything out now too.  

643
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,840
 Why did you do that? 

644
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,430
 Who said you could? I didn't ask for it. I don't want that! 

645
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:36,460
 Your mom should know at least. 

646
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:41,450
 If she finds out later, she'll be even more sad and miserable.  

647
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,850
I filmed this myself today.

648
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,970
What the?

649
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:20,000
Ro Na did nothing wrong.

650
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,470
I lied.

651
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,220
Ah, really.

652
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:38,970
I'm going to submit this video as the evidence of school violence,

653
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:42,170
to the Office of Education homepage.

654
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:53,810
Seok Gyeong, what on earth were you thinking doing something like this?

655
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:58,520
A school bully at Cheong Ah Arts School? Do you know how big of a deal this is?

656
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:05,460
Sorry.

657
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,100
I got too emotional.

658
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:11,200
It's okay. It's true Seok Gyeong's at fault here.

659
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,610
Bae Ro Na's side seems fully prepared for this.

660
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:17,990
The report was already submitted to the Office of Education and there'll be an investigation tomorrow.

661
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:21,220
If Je Ni's case blows up, then things will get even bigger.

662
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:25,130
I'm sorry. It looks like you'll have to pull some strings.

663
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:27,060
What are you doing without apologizing?

664
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,770
I just did what Eun Byeol told me to.

665
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:33,630
I was the only one shown in the video, but all the while, Eun Byeol was next to me

666
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:38,370
Pouring the bucket of water with the paint, and locking them in the bathroom were all Eun Byeol's ideas.

667
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,730
I'm telling the truth.

668
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,650
Isn't it too much for you to drag Eun Byeol into this, too?

669
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:44,060
I'm disappointed.

670
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:48,630
I heard even when Eun Byeol tried to stop you, you insisted on continuing.

671
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:50,030
Did Eun Byeol say that to you?

672
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:51,380
That she tried to stop me?

673
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,610
All the kids testified.

674
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,240
That you were the one who initiated the bullying against Je Ni.

675
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,470
All the food we forced Je Ni to eat

676
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:01,040
was brought by Eun Byeol.

677
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,550
Why are you protecting Eun Byeol alone?

678
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,490
Oh, are you playing favoritism?

679
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,290
You said we were a family. Was that all a lie?

680
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:10,570
Enough!

681
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:14,090
When you should be reflecting on what you did, who are you trying to blame?

682
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,970
Why don't you believe me, Dad!

683
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:25,570
Is she weaseling out by herself, Ha Eun Byeol?

684
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:31,320
You should stay out of any trouble until you get into SNU! This is the most important time for you!

685
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,620
If you're recorded as a school bully on your school record, you'll be eliminated from the early admission to college.

686
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,850
You should behave yourself.

687
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,750
It'll be a hassle if the son of an assemblyman is caught up in a school violence scandal.

688
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:44,890
Don't ever step up but just blame Seok Gyeong no matter what. Draw the line.

689
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,750
Say okay.

690
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,040
I have that much sense as well.

691
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:53,180
Who is it at this hour?

692
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,280
Who is it?

693
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,220
What's this?

694
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,590
- Ahjumma, what are you doing?  
 - Stay put!

695
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,220
What are you doing? Why are you taking my son's phone?

696
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,150
 Start! 

697
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,680
 Drink quickly. Hurry up. 

698
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,500
 Je Ni looks the prettiest when drinking Coke like that. 

699
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,780
 Hurry. Bottoms up 

700
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:32,830
Je Ni's mother, why are you being like this?

701
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,160
Don't touch me.

702
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:38,650
Je Ni's mother.

703
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:43,370
We have a special relationship.

704
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:47,310
For now, let's calm down. At this age, all kids fool around.

705
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:50,010
That's how they grow up.

706
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:54,310
Shut up, you son of a b****.

707
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,920
My phone.

708
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,660
She's crazy.

709
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,460
I was just about conquering the castle.

710
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,290
This isn't it.

711
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:20,230
That lady crossed the line.

712
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,100
Seok Gyeong! Open the door!

713
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,280
- Open the door! 
 - What's the matter, ma'am?

714
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,750
Get away! Where's Ju Seok Gyeong?

715
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,130
What's going on, ma'am?

716
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:33,580
Ju Seok Gyeong! Where are you, Ju Seok Gyeong?

717
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,390
- Ma'am! 
 - I said move!

718
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:40,500
What's going on during the early hours of the morning?

719
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,380
How can you sleep? Go apologize to Je Ni right now.

720
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,950
Why should I? I did nothing wrong.

721
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:53,890
Je Ni was the one who betrayed me and went to Bae Ro Na. That stupid b****.

722
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,050
Shut your trap, Ju Seok Gyeong!

723
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,320
Are you insane, Ahjumma?

724
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,940
Who are you to hit me? How dare you!

725
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,330
Does it hurt now that you got hit? Stop messing around.

726
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:07,310
There's limit to letting things go.

727
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:11,740
Before I blow up this Penthouse, you should pretend to reflect on yourself!

728
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,390
What are you doing right now!

729
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:25,200
You better educate your daughter properly, Chairman Ju.

730
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,140
Are you trying to lecture me, Je Ni's mother?

731
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,620
Do you think you have that right?

732
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,250
I will not let this incident slide.

733
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:35,340
I'm going to stop your daughter from participating in the Cheong Ah Arts festival.

734
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,500
And I'll also make her get punished for sure, whether by getting her expelled from school or forcefully transferred.

735
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,440
You're going to make the daughter of the chairman of the Steering Committee get forcefully transferred?

736
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,790
You won't be able to do that.

737
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:52,070
Our contract is over as of today.

738
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:57,290
I have nothing to lose nor owe anything to you.

739
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:59,740
You just gave us a single apartment.

740
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,860
Should I just reveal everything that you did to my husband?

741
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,840
It'll be best if you don't bring that up, Ms. Kang Ma Ri.

742
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,700
The reason my husband went to prison in your place

743
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,400
was because of our Je Ni.

744
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,060
To make sure our daughter lived and ate well.

745
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:19,630
But you dared to tear my child's heart into pieces?

746
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:22,130
There's nothing stopping me right now.

747
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,670
I don't know how far I'll go.

748
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,720
Be prepared. Your daughter Ju Seok Gyeong,

749
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:32,060
might die in my hands.

750
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,240
You've grown some guts.

751
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:48,130
Why? Do you think I got what I deserved?

752
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:51,170
You're secretly pleased to see me like this, aren't you?

753
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:54,340
In fact, you're ecstatic, aren't you?

754
00:56:54,340 --> 00:57:00,280
I am. I guess you know a little how I feel by now.

755
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,750
Pardon?

756
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:06,790
You get bitter and resentful when you see your child getting mistreated.

757
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:11,400
Your hands and legs shake, and you feel as  though your blood will gush up out of you.

758
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,990
You can't sleep or eat.

759
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:21,060
You wish everything to get ruined.

760
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,240
Unless you go through what I'm talking about, you don't know what that's like.

761
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,300
You'll never. I was like that, too.

762
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:32,420
I'm getting punished by the heavens, right?

763
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:36,440
Because of me, Ro Na had to be dragged before the Committee against school violence.

764
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:41,960
I hit, slandered, bullied that innocent child.

765
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:48,480
I'm getting paid the wages of every unspeakable thing I did to her.

766
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,490
I didn't raise my child properly.

767
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:59,700
I deserve to die, Ro Na's Mom.

768
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:16,290
Save your strength, Je Ni's Mom.

769
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:22,390
You need to be strong and focus on protecting Je Ni for now.

770
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:27,050
Let me know if I can help you in any way.

771
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,980
When a mom gives in, that's the end.

772
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,190
Her mom is all that Je Ni has.

773
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:47,130
Sorry, I'm sorry, Ro Na's mother.

774
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,820
So sorry.

775
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:56,970
 School Bully Agenda 
 Cheong Ah Arts School 

776
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,400
 Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin 

777
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,620
Je Ni's mother put in her formal request for the hearing with the Committee against school violence.

778
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:18,160
If the Office of Education sends its people out to investigate, Ro Na's incident on top of Je Ni's getting bullied

779
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,180
will complicate things for us.

780
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:34,130
There's no choice except someone must take the blame to safeguard the school. 
 CA Cheong Ah Arts School 

781
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,200
Put up the announcement.

782
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,420
 Notice of Announcement:   Decision by the Disciplinary Committee 

783
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,270
Move aside.

784
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,680
 Announcement 1. Ju Seok Gyeong / Senior in Music Dept./ Probation and disallowed from competing in CAA Festival Final 

785
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,200
 Announcement 2. Yu Je Ni, Bae Ro Na / Seniors in Music Dept. / Will compete in CAA Festival Final 

786
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,690
What crazy—

787
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,700
This is the work of your mom, right?

788
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:20,190
Ha Eun Byeol, you weaseled out of it.

789
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:55,570
 Cheong Ah Arts School 

790
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,950
 It was you who saved me out of the restroom, right? 
  CA (Cheong Ah): Ju Seok Hun 

791
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:08,090
Why didn't you reply to me?

792
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,780
I sent my messages to you every day.

793
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,770
I was busy.

794
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:19,140
I know things are hard for you, but that doesn't mean things have to be awkward between us.

795
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:22,380
I was wondering about you,

796
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:26,920
when I went to the States as well as  when I came back.

797
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,890
What about you?

798
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:42,050
Didn't you think about me?

799
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,490
What are you doing there?

800
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:02,080
Nothing. Nothing, really.

801
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,710
Hey, Ha Eun Byeol!

802
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:20,870
What was her pattern?

803
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:23,020
Did she change it?

804
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:27,040
Bingo.

805
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:32,240
Did she think I'll  get punished all by myself? No way.

806
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:37,120
Ha Eun Byeol, I'll tell all about your boyfriend.

807
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:47,210
 I can't give in it to anyone! 

808
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,820
 Let go! I said let go! 

809
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,680
 Seo Jin. 

810
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:57,030
What is this?

811
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:06,050
Hey, Ju Seok Gyeong! It's you who took my cellphone, right?

812
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:12,110
Why would you steal my cellphone?

813
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:19,380
Stole you phone? You dropped it, and I picked it up to get it back to you.

814
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,050
Did you get into my phone?

815
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:27,010
How would I know your password?

816
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:31,860
Why, do you have something great stored in your phone?

817
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:47,290
I hope she didn't see that. Did she?

818
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:01,160
What are you doing here?

819
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:06,760
You did say I was your daughter, too.

820
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:10,740
Can't a daughter just visit her mom for no reason?

821
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,670
I'm busy. Why don't you just tell me what you need and leave?

822
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:17,510
I have a lot of paperwork to go through.

823
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:23,230
Cheong Ah Arts Festival is coming up in a few days.

824
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:26,310
I've been waiting for it for a real long time.

825
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:32,730
I'm getting excited just thinking about what dress I should wear.

826
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:35,190
I'm sure the announcement was posted.

827
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:40,180
At today's faculty meeting, it was decided you should be disallowed entry into the competition.

828
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:44,740
I couldn't do anything on your behalf because the trouble you caused was quite outlandish.

829
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:54,120
You shouldn't mess with me, especially when my dad's asking as a personal favor.

830
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:59,040
Just let me enter the Festival. When you're the Chairperson, you have more than enough power to do that.

831
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:07,660
Did I startle you?

832
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,620
I was just imitating Eun Byeol.

833
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:12,440
I hope I don't have to answer you anymore.

834
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:22,240
Oh, since you're already doing things for me, can you go all out and might as well give me the grand prize?

835
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,030
What?

836
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:27,090
If you really love my dad, shouldn't you do that much for me?

837
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,000
Are you joking with me now?

838
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,620
You're not talented enough to get that grand prize.

839
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:37,600
You know already I can't beat Eun Byeol talent-wise.

840
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,950
Hence I came, having putting away my shame, and I'm now begging of you like this.

841
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:45,080
Will calling your dad shut your mouth?

842
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:49,010
Get out! At once.

843
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:54,720
If you want to go about that way, you'll only put yourself at a disadvantage.

844
01:05:55,870 --> 01:06:00,940
I know something quite grand, Ahjumma.

845
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:03,840
What?

846
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:09,660
When Chairman Cheon Yeong Su passed away,

847
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:12,980
you were also standing on the stone stairs.

848
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:17,370
The question is why you just ran away.

849
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,440
That is, without saving your father.

850
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,160
What did you just say?

851
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:32,700
You look quite startled.

852
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:37,380
Then, shall we resume our conversation from the beginning?

853
01:06:53,690 --> 01:07:00,660
  vv

854
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:10,510
 Penthouse II 

855
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:12,700
 I heard the chairperson is stepping down. Is that true? 

856
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,090
 Regardless however much you hate me, 

857
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,620
 how can you stab me in the back with Oh Yun Hui? 

858
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:18,750
 Cheon Seo Jin, you must have a lot of enemies besides me.  
 Confidentiality Agreement

859
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,190
 Win against Bae Ro Na, even if that means you have to kill her. 

860
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:23,390
 No matter what people say, Eun Byeol is my one and only daughter. 
 Eun Byeol, fighting. From your dad. 

861
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:25,850
 Then prove to me that I'm your one and only daughter. 

862
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:29,880
 The grand prize for vocal music for the divine voice of... 

863
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,400
 Did you want the grand prize that much? 

864
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,220
 Are you getting ready to give me the grand prize? 

865
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:36,660
 Ju Seok Kyeong, no one will take away Cheong Ah Arts School from me. 

866
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:40,750
♫  No matter what people say  ♫
