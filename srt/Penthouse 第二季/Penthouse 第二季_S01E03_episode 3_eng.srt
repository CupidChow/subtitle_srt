11
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,760
 I can't believe it. That was a perfectly pitched High F 

12
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:17,930


13
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,960
What happened? You said nothing about raising the pitch to High F.

14
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,150
Unless you pause and  inhale, it's impossible to extend your breath as you did.

15
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,240
Did you purposely not show me all your skills before?

16
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,280
You...

17
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,390
What are you truly?

18
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,160
Who are you?

19
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,060
You!

20
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,270
How could you!

21
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,300
I guess I finally get to say hi the proper way.

22
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,580
Let's try to get along, Cheon Seo Jin.

23
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,290
How, how did you get here?

24
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,430
Aren't you suppose to thank me first?

25
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,910
How can you sing? You—

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,210
Your vocal cords were damaged.

27
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,950
That's how I was thanks to you.

28
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,460
Should I call it a miracle?

29
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,960
I risked my life for vocal cord recovery surgery and even removed the scars.

30
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,490
The throat you stabbed with a trophy

31
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,590
saved you from humiliation today.

32
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,420
Isn't the world fascinating?

33
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,190
Are you saying

34
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,740
really you singing?

35
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,400
No. There's no way.

36
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,360
I surely dealt with Park Yeong Ran ...

37
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,700
 The number you dialed is not in service. After checking the number again— 

38
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,190
What is it?  Are you taken aback because the phone number doesn't exist?

39
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,380
Did you set this up?

40
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,140
Did you trick me from the start? How did you know?

41
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:40,250
Did you follow me like a stalker? How did you know I had a problem with my voice?!

42
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,900
 Remove your belongings. I don't care whether your marriage is legit or you're putting on a show. 

43
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,200
 Either way, you can't live here. 

44
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,200
 This is where your daughter Eun Byeol lives. What kind of wound do you intend to cause her? 

45
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,140
 Do you even have the right to be her dad? 

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,580
 Why are you so anxious? 

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,220
 Not someone who has made her debut. Find her among amateurs. 

48
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,110
 She can't be too young or too old. She should be as close to my age as possible. 

49
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,990
 There is no time. One week is all we have. 

50
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,750
 Whatever I have to do, I must make this performance absolutely perfect. 

51
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,800
What's your purpose? You must have a reason to do this!

52
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,980
I'm just taking back what you stole from me, one by one.

53
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,770
You remember, don't you? The best voice and Ha Yun Cheol, too.

54
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,750
They were actually all mine.

55
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,450
What?

56
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,440
Who knew that the incomparable Cheon Seo Jin would ever need a ghost singer?

57
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,310
But you really never know what can happen to people, do you?

58
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,300
Fake soprano,

59
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,560
Cheon

60
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,880
Seo

61
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,490
Jin

62
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,200
There she is.

63
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,440
Congratulations for breaking records in the world of Korean vocalists.

64
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,320
Please tell us how you feel after your best performance.

65
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,640
You've put to sleep the rumors of your crisis or retirement in just one evening.

66
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,200
You must have felt burdened by the title of Best Soprano. How did you overcome it?

67
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,790
You showed your heavenly voice. What's the secret for doing it?

68
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,820
You are the greatest diva among vocalists. Please give us a comment.

69
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:27,130
Your performance was really amazing, Seo Jin. Congratulations.

70
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,170
This is only the beginning. Look forward to it. I will take back my place.

71
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:45,260
Thank you. I want to provide an official interview tomorrow. I want to rest.

72
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,530
Director Do, please schedule tomorrow's interview at a time that is most convenient for the reporters.

73
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,800
Please give us one comment, please.

74
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,700
Let's go out and I'll talk to you.  This way, please.

75
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,620
I will see you tomorrow. Yes, good night.

76
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,210
What is it?

77
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,010
Oh, nothing. Let's go.

78
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,100
How have you been?

79
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:46,450
I know I'm shameless and make no sense, but I really miss you.

80
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,210
I'm sorry. Please wait a little longer.

81
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,600
Even if I have to go through a wringer,

82
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,660
I will reveal the truth of that day. And,

83
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,550
I will pay for my sins,  I promise.

84
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,150
Let's toast to the 20th anniversary of the debut of the beautiful prima donna, Cheon Seo Jin. Cheers!

85
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,000
Cheers!

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,760
Congratulations.

87
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:37,650
I got the goosebumps all over. How can a human make such sounds?

88
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,190
The articles full of praises for you are pouring in, Ms. Cheon.

89
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,440
As expected they say you're the one and only national treasure!

90
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,720
Ms. Cheon, do you have anything you lack? You come from a great family, and your skills are superior.

91
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,980
Your ex-husband is a doctor, and your current boyfriend is a successful businessman.

92
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,950
Why have the heavens given you so much?

93
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,350
Chairman Ju is the one who is blessed. His business is booming

94
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,060
and his wife-to-be is so successful.

95
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,160
And his best friend is Gyu Jin.

96
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,340
He's a man who wouldn't even envy  the President.

97
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,940
Thank you everyone for congratulating us. Let's stay up late to drink and enjoy.

98
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,150
Everything is on me.

99
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,200
Brava!

100
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,900
During your performance today, your voice sounded very different from your usual voice.

101
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,330
You sang the high F at the finale, didn't you?

102
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,380
I thought it was a totally different person, too.

103
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,560
What is your secret? I want to tell my Je Ni.

104
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,760
Right. How did you do that? Did you master a new skill?

105
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,900
No, nothing like that.

106
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,560
Oh, right. I saw Oh Yun Hui at the concert hall. Perhaps, did Dr. Ha come with her, too?

107
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,880
That couple always shows up uninvited, don't they?

108
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,420
Oh Yun Hui was there? When? I didn't see her.

109
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,350
How about we stop saying useless things and drink?

110
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,560
I'm sure she wanted to ruin our wonderful occasion.

111
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,230
She has delusions that Seo Jin is her lifelong rival, and lives trapped in that inferiority complex.

112
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,490
She came apparently because she was jealous of Seo Jin having a solo concert—

113
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,220
Oh Yun Hui was not there!

114
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,390
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling well.

115
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,850
I will excuse myself.

116
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,000
Uh... Ms. Cheon...

117
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,690
What's going on?

118
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,840
What's with her?

119
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,460
Let's have a celebration party on another day.

120
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,370
Why is she acting like that on such a wonderful day?

121
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,290
Something is definitely going on with her. My sense tells me it's about Oh Yun Hui.

122
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,140
Needless to say, She's been clearly upset since Oh Yun Hui moved back in.

123
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,990
She is so unbridled in the ways she behaves. No wonder Dr. Ha left her for Oh Yun Hui.

124
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,250
We should watch our mouths for now. I'm scared that our children may be negatively affected.

125
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:17,380
Anyways, she sure has a mean temper. I feel sorry for Chairman Ju.

126
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,480
Why remarry someone like her? Better to grow old alone.

127
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,700
In any case, he is deprived of affection.

128
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,520
 Fake soprano, 

129
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,710
 Cheon 

130
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,260
 Seo 

131
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,860
 Jin 

132
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,800
 Stop! Stop! 

133
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,620
 What will you do when your voice is that stuck? Don't you realize how important this audition is? 

134
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,860
 It's your chance to stand on the best stage in Italy. 

135
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,830
 Oh Yun Hui at the top of the class was the only one going, but I pulled strings to get you in. 

136
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,820
 I will practice more, Father. I'm confident. 

137
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,680
 I will make sure to pass this audition. 

138
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,740
 Are you crying now just because I scolded you once? 

139
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,190
 Don't you know I hate girls crying? 

140
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,020
 Do it again! 

141
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,810
 How did it go, Father? 

142
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,520
 Who won between me and Yun Hui? 

143
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,510
 Useless brat. Why can't you ever beat her for once? 

144
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,180
 Then, 

145
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,070
 is Yun Hui going to Italy? 

146
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,070
 I couldn't let that happen. 

147
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,120
 I made it so Oh Yun Hui's side turned it down. 

148
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,840
 I did everything to give you that opportunity, yet you almost let it slip to someone like her. 

149
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,520
 You're an embarrassment to the family! 

150
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,490
 I'm sorry. 

151
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,230
 Go. 

152
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,190
Where is Eun Byeol?

153
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,370
She just went to bed after finishing her homework.

154
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,120
Good work.

155
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,580
You can rest, too.

156
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,180
Eun Byeol.

157
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,750
I think I can breathe a little now.

158
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,740
Mom getting engaged and Dad coming back after his remarriage

159
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,320
were all so annoying I thought I was going crazy.

160
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,820
Thank you for coming with me, Seok Hun.

161
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,500
Just hold out for a few months now.

162
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,340
When your mom and my dad get married,

163
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,980
we drop the bomb before we go our own ways.

164
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,330
Before then, no one must know.

165
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,370
You promised you wouldn't be like this.

166
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,820
Are you really not interested in me?

167
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,060
Aren't you tired of saying that?

168
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,540
I told you I don't have any interest in you.

169
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,580
We just have the same goal: stopping the marriage and not becoming a family.

170
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,760
It's never going to work out with you and Ro Na, anyway.

171
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,350
It's okay if you're only using me to forget about Ro Na.

172
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,920
- So — 
 - Ha Eun Byeol.

173
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,690
I warned you not to talk about Ro Na.

174
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,370
It's late, let's go.

175
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,460
Wait for me.

176
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,180
Thanks for helping me get some air.

177
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,060
Get in safely. Sweet dreams.

178
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,040
Where did you go?

179
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,880
The practice room.

180
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,870
I couldn't study, so I thought I would practice singing.

181
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,780
Where were you?

182
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,440
I went for a swim.

183
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,730
For someone who's the first in her grade, aren't you  working too hard?

184
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,950
I'm going to go up first.

185
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,310
She couldn't have heard anything, I hope.

186
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,410
Ha Eun Byeol is lying?

187
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,480
What boyfriend is keeping her up til dawn?

188
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,460
Doctor Ha mostly spent his time in meetings with clients

189
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,640
or with Oh Yun Hui.

190
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,740
There has been nothing unusual so far.

191
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,550
What about Oh Yun Hui's daughter?

192
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,050
I haven't seen her yet.

193
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,250
She never met her daughter?

194
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,190
Was Oh Yun Hui at the concert venue?

195
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,240
Yes, she was in the waiting room with Cheon Seo Jin.

196
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,730
They were together...

197
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,510
 I saw Oh Yun Hui at the concert venue. 

198
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,290
 Oh Yun Hui wasn't there! 

199
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,480
Put a tail on Cheon Seo Jin's side as well.

200
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,550
Report right away if you notice anything strange.

201
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,460
Cheon Seo Jin. Oh Yun Hui.

202
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,710
There's definitely something between them.

203
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,420
- I'm sorry, Chairperson Cheon. 
 - Is an apology going to resolve this?

204
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,960
Where did things get so twisted? How could Park Yeong Ran turn into Oh Yun Hui?

205
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,770
Who was the woman that I met?

206
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,550
The broker vanished so...

207
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,600
I'm very sorry.

208
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,300
Oh Yun Hui, what is it that you're scheming?

209
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,600
Just how much does she know?

210
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,990
What are you making?

211
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,160
You startled me.

212
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,320
You're violating our contract.

213
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,920
- Go sit. 
- Okay.

214
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,370
Why did you make so much?

215
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,330
This alone is enough for breakfast.

216
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,730
I made all that for me to eat.

217
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,120
What are your plans for today?

218
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,690
I thought we agreed to keep those things from each other.

219
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,710
I'm busy myself, too.

220
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,770
It looks good. Give me a bite.

221
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,280
No way, it's all mine.

222
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,300
Come on, you're so cheap.

223
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,910
- Just one bite. 
 - Nope.

224
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,250
Just one bite!

225
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,820
Okay, fine. I'll give you just one.

226
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,550
Here.

227
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,700
It's good.

228
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,580
 Cheong Ah Arts School 

229
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,160
Don't you think Seok Hun has a girlfriend?

230
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,330
- What? 
 - I think he rode his motorcycle, he came in late last night.

231
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,460
But he had two helmets.

232
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,770
Could it be Bae Ro Na?

233
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,310
Bae Ro Na? Say something that makes sense.

234
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,670
Seok Hun liked her a lot.

235
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,320
And now that her mom was proved innocent, there's nothing stopping them.

236
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,700
What do you mean he liked her?  He was just fooling around with her.

237
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,170
If Bae Ro Na shows up again and clings to my brother,

238
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,810
I won't sit back and just watch.

239
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,770
That's never going to happen.

240
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,220
She's not back in Korea. Her mom said so.

241
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,460
- She's still in America. 
 - Are you sure about that?

242
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,570
- You're sure she's still in America? 
 - Yeah.

243
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,450
I'm sure of it.

244
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,570
Thanks for the good info.

245
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,560
You're quite up to date about your best friend.

246
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,670
It's not that, by coincidence, the lady next door—

247
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,110
Don't think about coming to the community room later.

248
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,010
A two-timer like you creeps me out.

249
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,300
Give me back my bag. Someone would think I made you hold it.

250
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,890
Don't go overboard with your act of being nice.

251
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,830
 Thank you. 

252
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,690
- You look so beautiful. 
 - Thank you.

253
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,270
- I really enjoyed it. 
 - Could we please get a picture?

254
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,050
Of course. Here you go.

255
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,180
Thank you.

256
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,090
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

257
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,990
Hello, what's your name?

258
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,830
It's Oh Yun Hui.

259
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,020
What do you want?

260
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,030
I want your autograph.

261
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,710
This is a present.

262
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,190
Open it.

263
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,640
 Confidentiality Agreement 

264
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,860
 I, Park Yeong Ran, solemnly swear that I'll keep the contract with Chairperson Cheon Seo Jin confidential... 

265
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,030
I thought you might have forgotten about our deal.

266
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,460
Don't worry, I'll keep my promise.

267
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,430
Thanks for the autograph. I'll keep it in a safe place.

268
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,180
I heard you're receiving calls even from abroad. Do you have plans for a global tour?

269
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,120
There's still much to do in Korea.

270
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,650
I'll take my time thinking about it.

271
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,590
They praised your first song especially for having perfect pitch as if it were played by an instrument.

272
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,910
When are you going to release the CD version of this concert?

273
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,510
I want to listen to it soon.

274
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,700
Can you sing it for us right here?

275
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,360
Una Voce Poco Fa.

276
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,250
That song was so moving.

277
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,300
Could we really ask for this favor?

278
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,290
Yes, please!

279
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,750
Please sing it for us again!

280
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,680
Oh, gosh!

281
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,880
I'm sorry, I haven't fully recovered from last night.

282
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,240
I can't let myself be dragged around by Oh Yun Hui like this.

283
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,430
Find anything that could be her weakness!

284
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:43,750
Search her house, put a tail on her, or strangle her. Just find something!

285
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,280
How about postponing the alumni gathering tonight?

286
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,730
Clearly, you're not feeling well.

287
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,500
It's a special treat for my friends who came to the concert.

288
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:16,130
Hey, it's me. I'm really sorry about this.

289
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:20,270
I'm not feeling well, so I can't attend the meeting today.

290
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,500
I'll ask the chef there. You guys go ahead and eat without me.

291
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,450
What are you talking about?

292
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,870
Why would she be there?

293
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,920
I'll report to you just as soon as the new products roll out.

294
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,100
Chairman Ju!

295
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,010
You may go.

296
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,860
I'm Lee Gyu Jin, the assemblyman for the Gangnam district.

297
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,520
Judging by their reactions, they're not from my district.

298
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,070
Perhaps with your furniture business booming as well, you seem very busy.

299
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,110
I was about to get off. What are you doing here?

300
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:09,150
Wow, this looks great!

301
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,910
I just stopped in since I was in the area with some business to take care of.

302
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,660
I felt my fingers getting restless, too.

303
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,020
Aren't you sick of playing only between the two of us all the time?

304
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,290
Besides, winning your money all the time

305
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,490
is making me feel guilty.

306
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,000
That's why I'm about to bring some pushover to the table today.

307
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,590
Do you have anyone in mind?

308
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,540
 CASINO 

309
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,270
Thanks for inviting me. It's been a while since the three of us played like this.

310
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:55,060
Now it really feels like I'm back in the Hera Club.

311
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,850
By the way, I see you brought a very beautiful woman with you.

312
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,280
I met Je Ni's mother on my way here. She said she wanted to come.

313
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,380
I'll be your dealer today to keep things fair.

314
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,480
Shall we go all in with our bets for the table? No limits.

315
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,330
- Call. 
 - Of course.

316
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,390
Oh, Dr. Ha.

317
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,250
Raise by 10.

318
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,740
Assemblyman, planning to win all my money?

319
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,170
If you're scared, you can fold.

320
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,100
- Call. 
 - Call.

321
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,740
Damn it.

322
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,550
Hurry up.

323
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,830
I'm screwed.

324
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,150
- Will you keep going? 
 - I don't see why not.

325
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,620
You've gotten much bolder since you built your own business.

326
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,460
I admire your  guts, but what can I do?

327
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,070
Full house.

328
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,610
Too bad, but I think I won.

329
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,750
I have a higher three of a kind.

330
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,700
 It's really tasty. 

331
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,730
Hey, you came! You said you couldn't.

332
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:39,840
Come on in, I was disappointed, not getting to see your face. Are you sick with a cold?

333
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,090
I must have overworked myself. I took some medicine and I'm feeling better now.

334
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,150
That seat is taken already.

335
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,340
By whom?

336
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,060
You're here.

337
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,710
You're late.

338
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:01,030
I can be here too, right? I wasn't invited, but I wanted to congratulate you.

339
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:06,000
This is an alumni meeting for SNU (Seoul National University) School  of Music.

340
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,320
Won't it be uncomfortable for you?

341
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,390
Do you need to be so harsh with your words?

342
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:15,360
Yun Hui is also an alumni of Cheong Ah Arts. And she said she came to see your performance yesterday.

343
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,440
She has every right to be here. Isn't that right?

344
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,060
- Yeah, that's true. 
 - Let her stay.

345
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,280
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

346
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,010
Honestly, I was stunned by Seo Jin's skills. Yesterday was the best I ever saw you perform.

347
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:35,270
Yun Hui was actually better during our high school days. Remember our Cheong Ah Arts Festival in our senior year?

348
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,880
I was reminded of Yun Hui at the concert last night and got goosebumps all over.

349
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,740
Did you, too? Seo Jin sounded so similar to Yun Hui when she hit the high F.

350
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,540
If it hadn't been for that incident, Yun Hui would've easily made it into SNU School of Music.

351
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:55,290
She was admitted into Cheong Ah Arts School at the top of her class, and she got first prizes for every competition she went in.

352
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,860
That's all in the past. I don't even sing anymore.

353
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,120
You must really not be feeling well, Seo Jin.

354
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,760
You're not drinking at all. Are you okay?

355
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:12,180
Oh, you all heard of it, right? The Hera Palace incident?

356
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,820
Yun Hui suffered so much for the past few years.

357
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,910
She was even a runaway murderer.

358
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:23,620
It's nice to see you go about your life as a free person.

359
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,220
Why would you bring that up?

360
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,830
Why not? Is it uncomfortable for you to hear?

361
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,750
I thought you came since you're way past all that.

362
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:36,030
You're right. I was wrongly accused, but I have already been proven innocent.

363
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:39,470
Now, I'm the happiest I've ever been.

364
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,040
It's  a bit embarrassing to tell you this,

365
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,170
but I got married again.

366
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,270
- Really? 
 - That's great!

367
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,790
- That's amazing! 
 - When?

368
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,750
What does your husband do?

369
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:58,270
He just runs a small business. You probably never heard of it. JohnBio.

370
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,420
I know it! I heard it went viral in America!

371
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,240
- Really? 
 - Wow.

372
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,650
Guys, I'm going to use the restroom—

373
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,760
Don't look it up. You guys are making me embarrassed.

374
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,780
It's all true.

375
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,620
Daebak, this man is Seo Jin's ex-husband. He was a neurosurgeon at Cheong Ah Medical Center.

376
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:23,440
- That's crazy. 
 - You married Seo Jin's ex-husband?

377
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,410
 Yeah, it just happened that way. 

378
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,270
Oh Yun Hui.

379
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,890
I'm going to kill you.

380
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,320
- Be honest since Seo Jin isn't here.
 - Pardon?

381
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,860
Did you really slit your own throat?

382
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,770
You and Seo Jin were the only two in the waiting room that day.

383
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:09,830
We couldn't say anything back then, but honestly, none of us believed it.

384
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,760
Everyone thought Seo Jin had stabbed you.

385
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,070
Tell us quick. What's the truth?

386
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,120
Ask Seo Jin yourselves. She also knows the truth.

387
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,880
- Hey, come on! 
 - Tell us.

388
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,200
- Can't you tell us? 
 - Just say it.

389
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:44,180
- Then did you really do it? 
 - No way.

390
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:50,050
Wow! CEO Ha is on a roll! Can't believe it!

391
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,600
Did you lose it all, Player Ju Dan Tae?

392
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,670
For Pete's sake, can you all shut your mouths? I can't concentrate.

393
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,420
He's taking it all out on us.

394
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,350
I heard you'd lose your temper  when you lose your money. Sounds right to me.

395
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,410
Should we quit right about here? You're almost out with your chips.

396
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,500
Who gave you the right to call the shot?

397
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:16,000
Let's play one last round, a big one. Can you go all in?

398
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,400
If you can't, we can quit here.

399
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,170
It doesn't matter to me. Alright.

400
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,860
You're so cool, Ha Yun Cheol!

401
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,910
Let's bet everything we have for the last round.

402
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,480
Sure.

403
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,240
These first four cards are the most important.

404
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,090
- This is all nail-biting. 
 - It sure is.

405
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,660
In poker, the time of death is very important.

406
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,750
Even in life, one must die before 50 for the other to get married again.

407
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,840
 Gyu Jin's ❤︎ 

408
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,000
 Your call cannot be connected at this time... 

409
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,580
Where is he getting wasted this time?

410
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,720
His wife is busy with the affairs of his district,

411
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,180
working herself to death as she volunteers all day long.

412
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,320
He's having the time of his life all by himself.

413
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,960
How can he call himself an assemblyman?

414
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,860
That's why this nation is in the state it's in.

415
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,100
It's hard to read Chairman Ha.

416
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,690
It's three of a kind! It's a high number three of a kind! ( In poker, a card about 7 is considered "high"). 

417
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,210
Wow, that is amazing!

418
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:43,020
Chairman Ju, I'm so sorry about this.

419
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,680
I have a full Ace.

420
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,470
Amazing.

421
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,540
Chairman Ha, did you gamble in the States? You're like Tazza.  (T/N: pro-gambler, name of popular Korean movie franchise) 

422
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,910
I was just lucky. Beginner's luck.

423
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:06,060
Chairman Ju, how much did you lose today?

424
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,150
Oh my, really?

425
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:12,640
Let's play again sometime. When we do, I won't go easy on you.

426
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:17,280
What do you mean you went easy on him?

427
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,620
You worked your brain heart and soul, trying to figure things out. Bye!

428
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,640
Chairman Ha, you ought to treat us to something really fancy.

429
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,450
Not today. It's almost time for my wife to come home.

430
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,770
Next time. Let me go this once.

431
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,320
Hey, come on.

432
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:42,410
If I dont drink all the way, I'll have an even harder time sleeping at night.

433
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:48,330
What are you so worried about? Drink with me.

434
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,930
Just the two of us?

435
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:57,060
That's ridiculous. Boring.

436
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,260
When you're drunk,

437
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,200
do you not remember what happens?

438
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,960
No, I remember everything perfectly.

439
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,220
Then, you do remember?

440
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,270
A few days ago, you and I...

441
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,850
did that.

442
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,450
What?

443
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,690
What are you talking about?

444
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:30,290
This little punk is getting on my nerves.

445
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:33,260
You're the one who initiated it, so why are you acting dumb?

446
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,630
Do you remember it or not?

447
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:40,270
What did I do? What are you going on about?  What did I—

448
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,000
You do remember.

449
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,500
Oh, gosh.

450
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,350
What are you trying to do? What kind of trick are you pulling?

451
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,860
Are you trying to make me anxious to the point of death?

452
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,130
Why are you so scared, Cheon Seo Jin?

453
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,300
This isn't like you.

454
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:44,340
Relax. I haven't even started yet.

455
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,150
I know you're blindly flailing at me because you're impatient

456
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,180
but you're making me feel sorry for you.

457
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,880
The more you do this, the more I'm tempted to tell all.

458
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,430
Should I come out and just tell it?

459
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:09,180
That your singing is fake.

460
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:15,520
That I, Oh Yun Hui, was the one who made that concert a success.

461
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,850
Tell me what it is that you want.

462
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,840
Tell me exactly what you want from me.

463
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:29,800
 Hera Palace 

464
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,830
Retire.

465
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,550
What?

466
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,250
Retire, I said.

467
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:47,540
For having trampled on someone else and stolen what isn't yours,

468
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:51,910
and having climbed to where you are as a fraud, you should step down on your own.

469
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:59,750
The title of Best Soprano. Aren't you ashamed of it?

470
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,880
I didn't climb here as a fraud. I worked myself to death to earn it.

471
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,560
But the way you began was wrong.

472
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,210
You stabbed me in the throat

473
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:18,940
and trampled on my dreams. You haven't paid for those sins.

474
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:24,810
So everything that you enjoy in life now is all fake.

475
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:29,050
Cancel all future plans for your performances.

476
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:34,120
And hold a press conference to confess to the public that you cannot sing any more.

477
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:41,380
Then I'll keep secret the fact that I was your shadow singer.

478
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:46,990
How about it? I think that's a very generous offer.

479
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,730
Singing is life to me.

480
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:57,060
For me, singing was life, too.

481
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,090
Oh Yun Hui!

482
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:03,670
How about holding your press conference this Saturday?

483
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,870
It seems like you have your production presentation for your opera.

484
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:13,300
A lot of reporters will flock in from in and out of the country. Won't it be a good day?

485
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:23,080
Alright, try doing whatever you want until the end.

486
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,020
I won't stoop to begging you.

487
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,080
Don't underestimate me.

488
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,620
I'm different from Su Ryeon.

489
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,600
You'd better think about how much you'll lose in the future

490
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,500
and how you will step down from where you are.

491
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,140
Does your daughter know?

492
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,450
That you're going around like this?

493
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:03,570
Didn't your daughter leave you because she was appalled by your actions?

494
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:07,210
And isn't that why you returned to Hera Palace alone?

495
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:18,040
Shouldn't you worry about your own daughter first?

496
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,410
Because your daughter

497
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,500
is included in my plan.

498
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,870
Don't touch my daughter.

499
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,510
Not, Eun Byeol!

500
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,390
Oh Yun Hui! Oh Yun Hui!

501
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,660
Oh Yun Hui!!

502
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,880
How was your dinner engagement tonight?

503
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,200
It was just...

504
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,360
Shall we get some cocktails in the lounge?

505
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,750
I'm so tired. The autograph event and the interview. I am exhausted.

506
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,850
Cheer up.

507
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,950
I will take care of Oh Yun Hui soon.

508
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,750
I constructed Hera Palace, and I'm the one who leases its suites.

509
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,120
I have enough power to do just that.

510
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,320
Don't mess with Oh Yun Hui. Don't provoke her!

511
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,290
What do you mean?

512
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,870
For the time being, at least.

513
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,240
Don't mess with Oh Yun Hui.

514
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,470
What's that about?

515
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:31,440
Oh Yun Hui has something big over Choi Seo Jin's head.

516
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,390
This is Ju Dan Tae. Can we meet now, briefly?

517
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,470
Has something happened to Chairwoman Cheon?

518
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,270
That's what I want to ask you.

519
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:03,320
Director Do, how can you let things get this far?

520
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,130
After that big incident, you left her to clean up the whole mess by herself.

521
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:12,200
Can you really call yourself her hands-and-feet?

522
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,060
I am not sure what you are talking about.

523
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:20,180
She told me everything about the thing with Oh Yun Hui.

524
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,710
How long were you planning to hide it?

525
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:35,000
If that came out, didn't you think it'd cause problems  for her career?

526
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,440
She was threatened a moment ago. None other than by Oh Yun Hui.

527
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,230
When you see the woman I intend to marry going through such indignities,

528
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,360
you should've asked me for help right away.

529
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,990
Why didn't you do anything?

530
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,430
Secretary Do!

531
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,290
Everything is my fault.

532
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:02,180
When the chairwomn began having problems with the lump in her vocal cord, I should've done all I could to cancel her concert.

533
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,480
But knowing her, I can imagine she insisted on performing.

534
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,550
It appears that I was deceived by the broker.

535
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,620
We secretly searched for a person to sing for her

536
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:14,860
and never imagined Oh Yun Hui could sing.

537
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,940
I checked many times, but I never thought she could forge a fake ID to that perfection.

538
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,190
I am very sorry, Chairman.

539
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,000
So,

540
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:34,780
at Cheon Seo Jin's concert, Oh Yun Hui sang for her?

541
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,160
What fun.

542
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,580
You did not know?

543
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,160
You said before you knew all-

544
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,980
No way.

545
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,920
Now it's time for you to make a choice, Secretary Do.

546
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,350
Whether to take my hand right here and now

547
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:12,980
or to be thrown out in the street by the chairwoman for blabbing.

548
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,390
What? You surprised me.

549
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:56,190
What are you doing at this hour?

550
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:00,630
Just about to call you and say good morning, but then I wanted to see you sleeping.

551
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,600
Shall we have breakfast together?

552
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,170
Don't pull a prank like this next time.

553
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,910
I tossed and turned until dawn and barely fell asleep.

554
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,340
You seem very tense.

555
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,420
The concert went well, and so many good things are happening.

556
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:22,600
Perhaps, are you worrying about something that I don't know about?

557
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:28,290
What worries? I'll wash up and come out.

558
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,610
Have a cup of coffee.

559
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,900
 Oh Yun Hui, she's an extraordinary woman indeed. 

560
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,830
 If I use her well, she will be very useful in taming Cheon Seo Jin. 

561
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,600
What are you doing?

562
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,650
Can't you tell?

563
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,930
If possible, please have breakfast in your penthouse.

564
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,940
I'm a high school senior. When I get annoyed, my studies suffer.

565
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,390
Can you be quiet? I'm losing my appetite.

566
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:14,520
What did you just say?

567
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,800
You said I don't have to try hard. So I won't act anymore.

568
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,610
I despise having to do anything that doesn't benefit me.

569
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:25,040
What a jerk!

570
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:49,290
 I really love it here. 

571
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,550
 I made so many friends at school today. 

572
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:56,040
 You are with me, Mom, and I'm adjusting to school. 

573
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,140
 I am so happy I could die. 

574
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,030
 Ro Na. 

575
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,270
 I have something to tell you. 

576
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:11,460
 What is it? You're making me nervous again. 

577
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,020
 Hurry up and just say it. You're scaring me. 

578
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,980
 I need to return to Korea. 

579
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,540
 Why? 

580
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:27,590
 To live happily with you as if nothing happened, 

581
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,830
 I find it hard to breathe even. 

582
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,350
 Because I'm so sorry to Su Ryeon. 

583
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:42,340
 But you didn't kill her, so why are you so sorry to her? 

584
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,830
 I don't understand. 

585
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,490
 I still have to go. 

586
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:51,830
 I know I shouldn't be doing this to you, but I have to go. 

587
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:55,470
 I don't want you to, Mom. 

588
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,640
 Just stay here and live with me. 

589
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,660
 Let's forget about everything that happened in Korea. 

590
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,440
 I'll pray 

591
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,060
 I will pray here that Su Ryeon and her daughter 

592
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,420
 would live happily together in their next lives. 

593
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,220
 - Don't go, Mom. 
 - I... 

594
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,210
 killed the girl. 

595
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,810
 What? 

596
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:22,000
 Su Ryeon's daughter, Min Seol Ah... 

597
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,820
 I did that to her. 

598
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,920
 Sorry, Ro Na. 

599
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:34,010
 You're lying, aren't you? 

600
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,330
 Why are you lying? 

601
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,800
 You're not that kind of person. 

602
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,190
 I will pay 

603
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,780
 for all that I've done. 

604
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,730
 Did you do that on purpose? Because of me?   

605
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,550
 So that I could be accepted into Cheong Ah Arts school? 

606
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:56,870
 No.  I never intended for that to happen. 

607
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,640
 After you killed her, 

608
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,790
  how could you move into the very house where Min Seol Ah lived, 

609
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,560
 and be happy that the property value went up? 

610
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,770
 Are you human? You scare me! 

611
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,340
 Horrible! It's giving me the chills! 

612
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,310
 At that time, I really had no memory of the incident. 

613
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,670
 Really, Ro Na. Please believe me. 

614
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:14,010
 Stop! 

615
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,340
 You're saying you killed her. 

616
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,580
 You killed Min Seol Ah because of me! 

617
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,610
 My mom is a murderer! 

618
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,750
 No, it's not because of you. 

619
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,060
 It was never because of you. 

620
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,750
 Everything is my fault. 

621
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,250
 It has nothing to do with you. So don't blame yourself, Ro Na. 

622
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,720
 Then why are you telling me this? 

623
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,170
 You should have kept it a secret forever. 

624
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,870
 What am I supposed to do? 

625
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:41,330
 How am I supposed to live on with the guilt I have toward her? 

626
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:45,420
 Ro Na! Ro Na! 

627
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,790
 Don't forgive me, Ro Na. 

628
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,810
 Hate me and resent me forever. 

629
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:09,430
 Did you confess to your daughter? 

630
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,430
 That you killed Seol Ah? 

631
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,410
 This is my last request of you. 

632
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:26,240
 Never let 

633
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,960
 Ro Na come back to Korea. 

634
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,850
 As long as you keep that promise, 

635
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,340
 I'll do whatever you want me to do. 

636
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,770
 Don't worry about Ro Na. 

637
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:47,060
 I'll take care of her. 

638
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,430
Ro Na, you should never come back here.

639
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:03,130
At least not until I completely ruin them.

640
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:18,560
 From Oh Yun Hui: Are you getting on well with your preparation for the press conference? 

641
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,980
 Don't forget. It's this coming Saturday. 

642
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,220
That crazy bitch.

643
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,610
Come in.

644
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:45,720
Hello, Ms. Cheon.

645
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:03,600
It's already been two years, hasn't it?

646
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,030
Why...

647
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,320
Why are you here?

648
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,900
Readmission?

649
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,740
Did you just mention readmission?

650
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,210
Yes.

651
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:25,160
I came back because I want to return to Cheong Ah Arts School.

652
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:29,280
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.

653
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:33,260
There is no vacancy in the music department.

654
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:37,860
I'm even less inclined to go above and beyond to let you back in school.

655
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,100
Did that answer your question?

656
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,990
I knew you would say that.

657
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:46,980
But I'm sure you'll end up accepting me back.

658
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:54,930
Don't tell me. Are you acting like this counting on your mom?

659
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:10,990
 Elizabeth Competition 
 1st Prize 
 Country: Korea / Name: Ro Na Bae 

660
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,010
Je Ni looks the prettiest when drinking Coke like that.

661
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,340
Hurry. Bottoms up.

662
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,050
Ju Seok Gyeong!

663
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,250
- Enough already. 
 - Stay out of it.

664
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:39,390
She's shoving it in her throat voluntarily because she's thirsty.

665
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,840
Why are you butting in?

666
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,810
Stop it.

667
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,900
Talking to me? I'm not the Min Hyeok from before.

668
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,620
It is you who acts like a jerk!

669
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,900
You little...

670
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,930
You guys haven't changed at all.

671
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,370
Bae Ro Na?

672
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:14,700
What the...

673
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:18,620
Yu Je Ni, are you okay?

674
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,760
Hey. How dare you show up in our school like this!

675
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,820
You guys are still fooling around like this?

676
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,920
How could you not have changed after what you went through that night?

677
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,100
What are you saying?

678
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,350
Hey!  I—

679
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,060
I think I broke my wrist!

680
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,570
I'm telling you, I think I broke my wrist!

681
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,400
It hurts!

682
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,970
Bae Ro Na received the first prize at the Elizabeth Competition?

683
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:48,750
According to our school regulations, with an international competition award,

684
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,220
of course, she should be allowed to come back to school.

685
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:54,260
This is definitely hot news.

686
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,700
I think she may be the youngest person in our country to have ever won this award.

687
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,080
- I'll contact the PR department right away— 
 - I!

688
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:04,320
Do you really think I called you in here to ask you to do something like that?

689
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,940
Excuse me?

690
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,300
You're the Head of the Arts Deparment. It's time for you to step up.

691
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,360
While Bae Ro Na was attending school here,

692
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,990
she stirred up a lot of problems.

693
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:21,060
She could run the risk of ruining the atmosphere of the senior's class.

694
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,860
Don't you think the student and her family would take issue with this?

695
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:28,810
The rule is clearly stated under the school's readmission policy.

696
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:32,310
I can't let Bae Ro Na come back to this school ever again.

697
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:33,750
Come up with something!

698
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,870
You are the Head of the Arts Department, after all. Is this all you're capable of?

699
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:49,540
Yes, Min Hyeok's mother.

700
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,600
What do you mean, an accident?

701
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:05,710
Where's Ro Na?

702
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:10,900
Seriously, I hope you aren't here as Bae Ro Na's guardian.

703
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,350
Did you forget this is Eun Byeol's school? What if she sees you?

704
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:17,870
Don't start an argument. Just tell us what happened.

705
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,920
It's exactly what I said over the phone.

706
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,010
Bae Ro Na kicked Min Hyeok, and he fell.

707
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,650
Min Hyeok is in the emergency room now.

708
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,410
At Cheong Ah Medical Center, right?

709
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:31,020
I'll head over there now and call you later.

710
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,830
Don't worry too much. Wait.

711
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:34,680
Take care of Ro Na first.

712
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:40,490
Did Ro Na really come here?

713
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,040
Why would she come here?

714
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,680
Are you asking because you really don't have a clue?

715
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,660
Your daughter came with an international music competition award in her hand,

716
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,740
in order to come back to Cheong Ah Arts School.

717
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,710
You didn't send her here?

718
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,640
Ro Na did?

719
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,700
Where is she right now?

720
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:08,380
As you probably know by now, due to this incident of violence,  it became impossible for her to come back to school.

721
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:12,180
She's not a student here, so there may not be a need for the involvement of the Committee against school violence.

722
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,940
But you should brace yourself for her to get called in for a questioning by police.

723
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:22,190
Explain this in a way I can understand what happened.

724
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:25,290
Bae Ro Na showed up out of nowhere and kicked Min Hyeok.

725
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:29,200
Je Ni got scared of the whole thing and threw up. You all saw it, right?

726
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,500
- Yeah! I saw it too. 
 - Me too.

727
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,460
She's too strong for her own good.

728
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,810
I never did that.

729
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:39,350
They're all lying.

730
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:45,480
You guys were harassing Je Ni. Why do you leave that out?

731
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,760
Harassing Je Ni?

732
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,680
I mean, the best behaved students in school?

733
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,540
Yu Je Ni. You explain it yourself.

734
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,290
Were they harassing you?

735
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:09,060
No. We were just horsing around.

736
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,970
Hey, come on. Yu Je Ni.

737
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,530
Ro Na!

738
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,690
Are you out of your mind?

739
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:33,110
Why would come back to this hell hole again!

740
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,910
I came so I could get a diploma from Cheong Ah Arts School.

741
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:38,650
And the grand prize trophy for the Cheong Ah Arts Festival, too.

742
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:41,660
I don't need any of that, so go back promptly.

743
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,810
Not for Seoul University, nor for the grand prize.

744
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:45,700
No, even if they'd give me something even greater,

745
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,290
I don't want any of it. I mean it.

746
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:52,030
- Why do you think I'm singing for you? 
 - What?

747
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:55,200
I'm not trying to get the grand prize because of you.

748
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,210
I'm doing this for myself. I want to get the prize for me.

749
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:00,380
I want to come back to Cheong Ah Arts School.

750
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,810
I will definitely compete  in Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

751
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:04,930
I have to.

752
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:08,200
Why do you have to? Why?

753
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,970
You can't.

754
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,080
Please. Please go back to America.

755
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,760
Don't you still get it after all that you were subjected to?

756
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,000
What more horror do you want to bring upon yourself, huh?

757
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,760
Are you scared that I'll be bullied again?

758
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:27,740
You're being selfish till the end.

759
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:34,890
Now that you know I'm alive, may I be excused?

760
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,190
Ro Na!

761
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,200
Are you proposing to settle with that crappy thing?

762
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,130
My perfectly fine son's arm is broken!

763
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:01,790
His arm was as sturdy as a steel rod!

764
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,890
That's the arm of my son who's perfect and fine!

765
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:06,680
Why the hell is Ro Na so freakishly strong?

766
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:11,880
I'm a woman with manners, but I won't sit quietly when it comes to anything concerning my son.

767
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,650
Anyway, how are you going to take responsibility for what happened?

768
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:19,010
My mom is so pissed that she's writing a complaint to sue, and stopped eating.

769
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:23,510
An assemblyman's son became a victim of school bullying!

770
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:24,570
Does that make any sense to you?

771
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:29,960
The hospital said he didn't need a cast, but you insisted on him getting one.

772
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,930
It's not like we're strangers. You don't have to be so uptight.

773
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:37,630
Chairman Ha! I didn't think you'd be like this.

774
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:41,250
Are you acting however you want just because your business is doing well?

775
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:47,100
I am never going to let this slide.

776
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,250
Let's settle this by law.

777
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:52,640
You can forget about a settlement or mercy.

778
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,870
Indeed, what would you expect from the daughter of a murderer?

779
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,870
Violence must be in her blood.

780
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:00,660
Hit me, too. Hit me.

781
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,940
Don't talk however you want to about my wife or daughter!

782
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:09,620
You'll know this better than anyone since you were a lawyer.

783
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:13,810
What you just said is libelous on all levels.

784
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:16,360
Say stuff like that one more time,

785
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,240
and I'm going to rip your mouth out.

786
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:27,970
If someone sees you now, they'll think she's your first wife,

787
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:30,630
and her daughter is your real daughter!

788
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:52,940
That's right. This could be an opportunity.

789
01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:00,030
Bae Ro Na could end up becoming my shield.

790
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,390
Hello? Who?

791
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,030
Bae Ro Na?

792
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,440
Ro Na, what are you doing here?

793
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:31,860
Your daughter forced her way in here and is pestering me  to let her come back to school.

794
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:34,580
Get up right now. This instant.

795
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:39,900
I won't cause any trouble at school from now on.

796
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,970
I promise. If I cause any trouble at all, I'll accept any punishment.

797
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:47,860
So, please let me come back to school.

798
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:50,360
I really want a diploma from Cheong Ah Arts School.

799
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,570
I beg you, Teacher.

800
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:56,050
- Don't be ridiculoud.  Why would you ask her for that? 
 - Let go of me.

801
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:58,610
This is none of your business.

802
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:04,590
You were once my student. Seeing you this desperate makes me go weak.

803
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,090
I'll think about it.

804
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:10,900
In return, have your mom

805
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:15,830
submit a letter of agreement that says she won't interfere with the school affairs, and that she will pledge her cooperation.

806
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:17,780
I just can't trust her.

807
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:20,130
I can get one.

808
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:21,640
Rest assured, I'll deal with my mom.

809
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,010
Ro Na!

810
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:26,430
Okay. You can go now.

811
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,500
What are you doing?

812
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,490
Ro Na will never attend Cheong Ah Arts School. I'll never allow it.

813
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:47,550
I thought you would be very grateful, so this is unexpected. I wonder why.

814
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,040
I don't want that.

815
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:55,040
Whether you want it or not, I will make my decision based on the school regulations as the chairperson of the school.

816
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:59,950
Because I don't want there to be any misunderstanding about me refusing your daughter's admission

817
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:03,270
due to our history. I'm an educator, after all.

818
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:06,820
An educator?

819
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:11,380
I think you're planning on using Ro Na as a bait to deal with me.

820
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,570
About that,

821
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,450
don't you think it's time for us to move on?

822
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:23,220
If you want this issue with Min Hyeok to be resolved.

823
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:28,750
If the news about an assemblyman's son being the victim of school violence gets out, Ro Na's future won't be smooth.

824
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,750
Are you okay with that? If she wants to return to a school in the States,

825
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:33,840
She should, at least, have no record of inflicting violence on others.

826
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,890
Cowardly bitch.

827
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:39,390
Do you think this will cover up what happened?

828
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:44,050
What do you have to gain from tarnishing my reputation?

829
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:47,830
Are you willing to sacrifice your daughter's future to take down little old me?

830
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:50,990
Don't you dare try anything to my Ro Na.

831
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:53,290
I'm not going to just sit and take it.

832
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:55,380
That...

833
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:04,420
depends on how you're going to act.

834
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,730
Bae Ro Na. Why do you keep making me worry about you?

835
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:26,280
Please, go back to America. Please!

836
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:30,790
Do you wish me to disappear into a place you can never find me?

837
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:36,750
Or, do you want me to tell everybody the sin you committed?

838
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,800
Ro Na.

839
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,270
Don't ever try doing things for me again.

840
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:44,750
I can take care of myself.

841
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,560
Where are you going this late at night?

842
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,390
Ro Na! Talk to me!

843
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:06,250
What did you just say?

844
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:09,390
Don't shout at the dinner table.

845
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:11,860
Why would you admit Bae Ro Na into school?

846
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:16,740
What are you thinking? I don't want to go to school with her.

847
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:20,090
Can't you stop a thing like that as the chairperson of the school?

848
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,620
Are you throwing a tantrum just because you're scared of little Bae Ro Na?

849
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:28,000
You're at the top of Cheong Ah Arts School.

850
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,690
I think it'll actually be good for you to have a pacemaker.

851
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:35,360
Are you, by any chance, worried about the Cheong Ah Arts Festival?

852
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,980
Because you are afraid you might lose the trophy to Bae Ro Na?

853
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:39,430
That's never going to happen.

854
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,440
I'm not going to lose the trophy to a bitch like her.

855
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,340
Yeah, that's my daughter.

856
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:52,950
Having a rival is a blessing in your life.

857
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:55,490
This talk is over, then.

858
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:00,400
You finish your meal. I have an appointment.

859
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:08,680
Who said this was because of the trophy?

860
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:13,360
Mom doesn't know anything!

861
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:22,660
You must be upset, right? You're afraid Seok Hun might fall for Ro Na again.

862
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:25,480
Teacher.

863
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:29,620
I'm so anxious I'm going crazy.

864
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:33,640
I only have Seok Hun.

865
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,070
Should I call him for you?

866
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:39,390
I've gotten some test-prep books for the mock exam.

867
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:45,700
I have an important meeting, so I'm still in the office.

868
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,300
I'll make sure not to be late getting to the hotel. How do you feel?

869
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,750
Not bad.

870
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:54,890
I'm getting excited about spending some alone time with you. It's been a while.

871
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:58,630
I'm getting excited, too. I love you.

872
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:02,330
Now.

873
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:08,270
This is the proof that someone else sang at Cheon Seo Jin's concert, right?

874
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:10,540
The messages she exchanged with the broker are in there as well.

875
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:13,350
 Confidentiality Agreement  

876
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:16,000
Director Do, you're quite good at your job.

877
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,420
Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin certainly has a reason to favor you.

878
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:23,890
Dare I say we've gotten a bit closer because of this incident?

879
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:26,400
My relationship with you ends here.

880
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:31,260
If you ask for more, I will have no choice but to let Chairwoman Cheon know.

881
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:34,880
I believe you even more when you put it like that.

882
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,490
I will not respond to your calls anymore.

883
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,820
Where are you?

884
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:25,790
Hurry, I want to see you.

885
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:30,300
Eun Byeol?

886
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:34,500
Ha Eun Byeol!

887
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:47,700
Are you in the room?

888
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:51,430
You're here?

889
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,580
Who are you?

890
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,730
What do you think you're doing? Why are you here?

891
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:51,960


892
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,290
 Penthouse 2 

893
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:12,560
 You tricked me and met another man? 

894
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,550
 How long have you been keeping secrets from me? 

895
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:17,080
 Legally, we're not bound in any way. 

896
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,810
 I was wondering about you. 

897
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:20,670
 Have you ever thought about me? 

898
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,990
 You said I'm only acting to get you back. 

899
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:23,990
 Shut up! 

900
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:25,630
 It's your mom who  killed my mom. 

901
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:27,530
 You promised to protect my Ro Na. 

902
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:29,200
 The Cheong Ah Arts Festival trophy, 

903
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,250
 I'm going to make it mine no matter what. 

904
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,150
 You've gotten bolder. 

905
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:36,020
 I could kill your daughter Ju Seok Gyeong with my own hands. 

906
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:39,000
♫  Whatever anyone says  ♫
