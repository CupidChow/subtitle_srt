1
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,860


2
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,430
 She looks so much like Su Ryeon. 

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,150
Oh, it's you.

4
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,290
Did you come out to see me?

5
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,980
Of course.

6
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,820
What's the occasion?

7
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,690
Because I missed you.

8
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,330
Father, can I come in?

9
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,280
-What's the matter? 
 -Ro Na's mom came by.

10
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,340
She said something urgent came up and she'd stop by later.

11
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,040
Housekeeper Ahn said she didn't see her leaving.

12
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,980
Well, I saw her.

13
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,170
She told me to let you know.

14
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,520
Okay, I got it.

15
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,220
Go study.

16
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,400
- Where are you now, Ahjumma? 
 - What?

17
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,990
My dad's here. I told him you left, just so you know.

18
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,570
Okay, thank you, Seok Hun.

19
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,700
You scared me because you came without letting me know first.

20
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,460
Weren't you the one who was in a hurry?

21
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,460
I came with the property contract for the Gangnam building.

22
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,860
You know that, when it comes to this building,

23
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,510
I have a half of the ownership.

24
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,620
We split exactly a half and a half.

25
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,350
If you try to pull something funny, I'll kill you.

26
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,830
If I ever open my mouth,

27
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,720
I can make the name Ju Dan Tae disappear.

28
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,020
Don't forget that.

29
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,810
How could I not know you, Na Ae Gyo?

30
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,870
I've seen you since you were ten years old.

31
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,620
I don't trust anything, except money in my fist.

32
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,490
Neither Someone like you, nor someone like me.

33
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,210
When you don't trust even me, won't you feel too lonesome?

34
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,030
I only have you.

35
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,700
Living happily in this penthouse with Na Ae Gyo is my dream.

36
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,700
There isn't much time left.

37
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,210
I guess my stupid suspicions are getting the best of me again.

38
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,490
I was crazily lonely while I was in Thailand.

39
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,640
- Aw, were you?
 - Yeah.

40
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,220
Here.

41
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,880
Thank you.

42
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,930
Wow.

43
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,600
I'll be off. My car's on standby.

44
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,390
Take my car, instead.

45
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,230
No need.

46
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,240
Without being seen by anyone,

47
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,110
I'll disappear without a trace for you.

48
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,820
 -Na Ae Gyo? 
-Find Na Ae Gyo. 

49
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,110
 She knows all of Ju Dan Tae's secrets. 

50
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,300
 Turn left with caution 

51
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,450
Who are you?

52
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,640
Why do you keep following me?

53
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,580
Eonni Su Ryeon?

54
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,050
Were you alive?

55
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,670
Eonni, it's me. Don't you recognize me?

56
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,310
How am I supposed to know you?

57
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,640
You're Eonni Su Ryeon, for sure.

58
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,250
Don't you remember me? Why are you lying?

59
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,890
Can you not hear what I'm saying?

60
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,610
I don't know someone like you.

61
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,860
What a crazy bitch.

62
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,990
Wait, talk to me for a second.

63
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,980
 Residence Identification Card 
Na Ae Gyo 

64
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,770
You see this, right?

65
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,530
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,500
You look exactly like someone I used to know.

67
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,180
Don't touch my things.

68
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,800
 Voice Spy 

69
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,880
 Installation Complete  

70
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,210
Wait a moment.

71
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,490
Here, your cell phone.

72
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,250
Let's just call it a bad day.

73
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,310
I'm sorry.

74
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,150
Sorry again.

75
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,120
Logan. I just found Na Ae Gyo.

76
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,920
Where is that? I'll go right away.

77
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,150
I put a bug on her phone, so I'll call you once I confirm where she stays.

78
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,630
Okay then. Call me. I'll be waiting.

79
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,330
Su Ryeon, I'm sorry.

80
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,650
I was too late.

81
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,300
What's with the luggage?

82
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,820
You and I, let's call it quits.

83
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,890
The divorce papers are in there.

84
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,360
 Declaration of Divorce (Request for Custody) 
Ha Yun Cheol /Oh Yun Hui 

85
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,100
Why do we have to do this?

86
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,900
Payback and whatnot has gotten old for me.

87
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,290
Look at us. You lost Ro Na,

88
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,820
and all I did was hurt Eun Byeol.

89
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,610
I can't do this anymore.

90
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,400
So,

91
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,980
do you have to do this now?

92
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,510
It's only been four days since I buried Ro Na.

93
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,350
Either way, our marriage was only a contract.

94
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,020
What do you expect from a guy like me? It's all a show.

95
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,800
Did you really think I could be your husband?

96
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,260
 Yes, yes, yes!  

97
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,480
 Come to your senses. 

98
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,290
 For whose sake, are you ruining yourself like this? 

99
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,170
 Why are you here again? 

100
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,430
 I told you to stop looking for me. 

101
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,210
 Look. You see? 

102
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,440
 Thanks to Ju Dan Tae that bastard, 

103
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,740
 I can't live my life as a doctor anymore. 

104
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,150
 So what can I do? Since my life's already ruined, 

105
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,540
 I might as well do a good job ruining myself too. 

106
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,450
 Yun Cheol. 

107
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,710
 Let's go back to Korea. 

108
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,070
 Let's go and get revenge 

109
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,300
 on Ju Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin. Let's do it together. 

110
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,910
 Yun Hui. You and I are the losers. 

111
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,100
 We completely lost. What can we possibly do? 

112
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,270
 Even if I go back to Korea, there isn't a single hospital that will accept me. 

113
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,070
 You don't have anyone to welcome you there either. 

114
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,190
 What can't you do with your ability? 

115
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,540
 Start a business or get a job. Begin something, and I will help you. 

116
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,230
 We've been to the ends of Hell.  

117
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,570
 We have nothing to fear. 

118
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
 Ju Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin. 

119
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,720
 I hear they're getting engaged soon. 

120
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,080
Getting revenge too

121
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,960
was, in the end, because of my feelings for Seo Jin.

122
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,010
It was my lingering emotions toward her.

123
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,190
I realized just now.

124
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,750
That I'm falling for  Seo Jin all over again.

125
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,580
When you say it like that,

126
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,110
does it put your mind at ease a little?

127
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,420
Are you stupid?

128
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,050
Do you not have common sense, or do you pretend not to know?

129
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,270
Thanks to you, I wanted to succeed in my business and show off in front of Seo Jin.

130
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,240
I used you from the beginning. I can never give up Seo Jin even in my death.

131
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,500
I'm a piece of trash like that! That's what I am!

132
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,590
You bastard.

133
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Until we finalize our divorce, I'll live elsewhere.

134
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,690
My Ro Na

135
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,140
liked you so much.

136
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,920
 One, two... 

137
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,030
 - Mister, you should come too.
 - What? 

138
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,260
 Come, take the picture with us. 

139
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,870
 Should I? 

140
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,720
 Excuse me, but can you take a picture for us? 

141
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,000
 Sure. 

142
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,800
 Okay, I'm taking it now. 

143
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,490
 One, two. 

144
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,570
What's with the suitcase? Are you going somewhere this late at night?

145
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,000
By any chance... No, right?

146
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,790
By any chance, did you two fight in a situation like this?

147
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,610
Even so, how could a man just pack his things and leave? Is that what's going on here?

148
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,700
Let go of me. And get your nose out of other people's business.

149
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,710
What, other people? Yun Hui is practically my real sister.

150
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,260
You're running away because you feel guilty about something, right?

151
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,690
I said to stay out of it!

152
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,500
Hey you, you! If you're planning anything funny, I'll kill you myself!

153
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,020
I keep hearing a strange melody.

154
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,690
Mi, fa, sol, fa, mi, mi, mi, re, si, re, mi.

155
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,730
Everything is a mess. The death of Ro Na.

156
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:03,020
Even my mom's retirement. My head is turned upside down, and I'm going crazy.

157
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,400
Don't you still remember what happened that night?

158
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,600
Nothing other than what my mom told me.

159
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,750
It'll come back to you a little by a little. There's no need to be anxious.

160
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,140
Ro Na died without even knowing she won the grand prize, right?

161
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,870
It must've been her punishment for coveting what wasn't hers.

162
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,400
I'll help you fall asleep. Let's go to sleep.

163
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,860
 Ms. Cheon Seo Jin, how do you feel about getting permanently excommunicated from  the circle of vocal music? 
 Gangnam Police Station  

164
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,520
Is it true that your ghost singer was your high school classmate?

165
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,270
Do you happen to know Cheong Ah will hold an emergency board meeting to terminate you?

166
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,850
A comment, please.

167
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,400
Hurry and get in, please.

168
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,360
- A comment, please before you get in. 
 - Ms. Cheon Seo Jin!

169
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,490
- Ms. Cheon Seo Jin? 
- Are the rumors true?

170
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,980
Please say something!

171
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,000
- Hello? 
- Ms. Cheon Seo Jin!

172
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,950
How dare you hold an emergency board meeting without one word to me?

173
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,820
How dare you raise your voice after the way you humiliated your family?

174
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,920
You have no right to keep Cheong Ah Foundation. You smeared your father's name.

175
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,260
Give me the Cheong Ah Foundation now.

176
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:21,380
I'll take good care of the Cheong Ah Arts Center too, so  don't worry.

177
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,040
My in-laws say they'll pull some strings to get you investigated without detention.

178
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,480
Don't get cheeky with me. I don't need your help.

179
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,480
You can forget about the CAA Center.  I built and made every brick and stair in that place.

180
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,620
There's got to be a limit to your greed!

181
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,010
As your mother, this is the farthest I will go.

182
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,980
If you take it farther, I'll take you to court.

183
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,990
Let's see this to the end.

184
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,090
Today is the last day I, too,  shall regard you as my mother.

185
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,220
Unless Father comes back to life and takes away this position from me,  no one will.

186
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,220
Because Cheong Ah Foundation

187
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,800
is the last gift Father gave to me.

188
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,440
You shouldn't be out where it's crowded.

189
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,980
So, you're telling me to lock myself up in the mountain all day?

190
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,140
I'll escort you back to your lodge. It's the Chairman's order.

191
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,830
Get lost.

192
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:08,050
I'll make any of you idiots who touch me today crippled. So, there.

193
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,600
Hey, Eun Byeol.

194
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,040
Do you want breakfast? Should I make you some sandwich?

195
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,480
Ma'am, can you make me some juice?

196
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,840
Mommy will do it for you.

197
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,910
How do I...

198
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,080
I never asked you to act like a mom. How annoying.

199
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,520
Eun Byeol!

200
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,160
She's just sensitive now. I'll get her the lunch bag.  No worries.

201
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,940
What's that supposed to mean?

202
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,180
Is there a strange movement within Cheong Ah Group?

203
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,910
Lately, even the sharesholders who were on your side seemed to have turned against you.

204
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,900
It's true that I lost their trust in me this time. They need some time to recover.

205
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,480
It isn't the time to sit back and watch.

206
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,910
A few days ago, Chairman Ju met separately with the major shareholders of CA Group.

207
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,230
What's that supposed to mean?

208
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,640
Don't trust Chairman Ju too much.

209
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,280
Chairman Ju already knew about your use of  a ghost singer.

210
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,690
And that the singer was Oh Yun Hui as well.

211
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,620
What are you talking about?

212
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,120
How on earth did he know that?

213
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,460
I committed a sin deserving of death.

214
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,870
I was caught in a trap Chairman Ju Dan Te set up.

215
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:23,070
I'll accept whatever you will  do with me and any punishment.

216
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,540
Are you telling me Ju Dan Te knew about it?

217
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,210
♫   Round and round.    Hover around me. ♫

218
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,600
♫   Small circle-shaped  ♫

219
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,870
Everyone, sit down!

220
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,890
This is the decision just made from the faculty meeting.

221
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:26,120
Following the death of Bae Ro Na, the grand prize winner of the Cheong Ah Arts Festival,

222
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,740
Ju Seok Gyeong, the Gold Award winner

223
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,090
will get the dean's recommendation for Seoul National University.

224
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,800
What, Ju Seok Gyeong gets the free pass to SNU?

225
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,720
Wow, I'll say she just got lucked out.

226
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,740
Midterm tests will start soon.

227
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,150
The GPA for you, seniors is more important than ever.

228
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,800
Put behind the unsettling events of late and focus on your study.

229
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,540
-  Got it? 
 - Yes, Sir.

230
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,770
With that said, shall we remove those flowers? We've mourned long enough.

231
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,240
Yes, Sir. Let me remove them.

232
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,200
Take your hands off.

233
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,290
Anyone who puts their hands on the flowers,

234
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,010
I'll kill you.

235
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,730
Hey, you, do you have a death wish or something?

236
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,500
That's what I am saying. You guys are so heartless.

237
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,850
How come is there no one who truly mourns for the death of your friend?

238
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,050
Seok Hun, where are you going?

239
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,040
I see you're going home early. Okay, take care!

240
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,750
Wow, I like the way he answers me too.

241
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,830
What are you looking at? Open your books already.

242
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,970
 Bae Ro Na 

243
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,860
 Chocolate Milk 

244
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,690
 Thanks, Bae Ro Na. I'll enjoy it. 

245
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,050
 Sure. 

246
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,630
 Why are you keeping this? 

247
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,040
Delicious.

248
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,650
Aren't you cold?

249
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,150
I'll come back again tomorrow.

250
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,020
- Not yet. 
 - Come on, you will know when you get there.

251
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,870
What are you doing in front of other people's home?

252
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,290
What a surprise. Were you in there all along?

253
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,840
I was very disappointed that you were not home.

254
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,040
My mother-in-law is a great cook, so I brought especially all your favorites.

255
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,900
- Would you like to try them? 
 - I'm busy at the moment.

256
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,320
- W- why? 
 - None of your business.

257
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,840
Please let me join.

258
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,450
Are you going to see the Three Madams?

259
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,040
Forget it. I can see through your intention.

260
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,710
I lost all my appetite, all of a sudden.

261
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,940
Don't let your food smell in front of my house and take all of it back with you.

262
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,830
How dare that crude woman talk down to me like that!

263
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,820
Hold it in. Hold it in for Gyu Jin's sake.

264
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,360
Watch me and do exactly as I do.

265
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,070
Put your strength in your arms first.

266
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,530
And you've got to scrub as hard as you can.

267
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,700
Je Ni's Mom.

268
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,980
You need to circulate your wrists for the water scum.

269
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,260
Otherwise, you'll get muscle aches on your wrists.

270
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,800
What are you doing standing like that?

271
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:57,310
That cold bathtub is your responsibility. If you don't get it right, you won't get paid today.

272
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,670
Aren't you going to get to it already?

273
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,940
Good. Good. The corners too. Scrub them hard.

274
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,560
Great. That's it.

275
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,630
Put strength in your wrists and arms.

276
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,910
Okay.

277
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,610
Good. Harder.

278
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,500
Cheer up. Up, up, up!

279
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,300
Here, eat up.

280
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,180
The black bean noodles you eat in the bath house are  the best.

281
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,500
I feel the hunger.

282
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,260
How brazen of me.

283
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:46,360
Whether you lose a husband or a child, it's not a sin to fill your stomach.

284
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,580
So eat up.

285
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,280
You must be feeling awful on the inside.

286
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,280
I saw him yesterday, CEO Ha-

287
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,590
No, I mean, that bastard was carrying his luggage.

288
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,020
It didn't seem like any ordinary fight between couples.

289
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,410
Does that bastard want to split?

290
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,570
What a lowlife!

291
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:14,790
That son of a bitch, why, I ought to just-

292
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,680
They say one's true colors come out when they hit rock bottom.

293
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,850
How could he turn his back on his wife when she hurts this much inside?

294
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,660
The noodles will get soggy. Go ahead and eat.

295
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,680
How would my words be of any comfort to someone who sent off their child first?

296
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,680
You should never think of any bad thoughts.

297
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,070
No matter what, her mom standing on her two feet is

298
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,760
what Ro Na would want.

299
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,150
You get that, right?

300
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,950
I will go on no matter what.

301
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,870
I will stay alive, for sure.

302
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,680
Okay.

303
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,080
This black bean noodle is a way to do it.

304
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,280
What's this?

305
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,470
 Fake junior soprano, Ha Eun Byeol 

306
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,560
Who was it? How childish!  What do you all think you're doing?

307
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,730
I heard Cheon Seo Jin is going to be fired from her Chairman position.

308
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,220
Your mentality is awesome. When your mom might go to jail,

309
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,440
how can you memorize the English vocabulary?

310
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,900
Don't you think you should apologize to us on behalf of your mother, Eun Byeol?

311
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,470
You're a fake too.

312
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:11,650
You acting as though you were all that when you had no talent all this time

313
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,480
has always been a thorn in my eyes.

314
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,150
To be honest, Bae Ro Na sang way better than you.

315
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,850
You admit that, don't you?

316
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:23,050
Go away. Move!

317
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,160
What do you think you're doing?

318
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,290
How annoying! Why don't they clear out her desk already when she's dead?

319
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,770
Watch your mouth. Annoying?

320
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,050
Why is Ro Na annoying?

321
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,410
Don't talk like that about a girl who died such a pitiful death.

322
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,350
Did you just hit me? How dare you!

323
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:52,540
Je Ni's right. Bae Ro Na deserves our sympathy.

324
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,790
Ju Seok Gyeong. Do you think you have the right to say that?

325
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,940
Why don't I have the right?

326
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,950
Was I the one who killed her?

327
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,480
Come to think of it, I've been curious about something.

328
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,910
When they were announcing the winners at the Cheong Ah Arts Festival,

329
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,590
you were with Ro Na, weren't you?

330
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,030
No. I didn't see her.

331
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,960
You and she were the only two missing in the waiting room.

332
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,790
Tell us. Where and what were you doing?

333
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,900
I was-

334
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,330
 Eun Byeol,  you took too many of the sedative pills, 

335
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,810
 so you were resting in the infirmary. 

336
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:33,210
 Then you fainted right before they announced the winners, 

337
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,440
 and Secretary Do carried you home. 

338
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,230
I was at the infirmary. I felt dizzy because of the effect of the medication.

339
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,960
Are you certain? Is that the truth?

340
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,900
Did anyone see you?

341
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,830
Are you okay?

342
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,730
Seok Hun.

343
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,470
What happened?

344
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,450
You fainted all of a sudden in the classroom.

345
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,450
My head hurts so much I feel like it's going to split.

346
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,360
It seems like you aren't really feeling well.

347
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,260
I heard you also fainted during the CAA Festival.

348
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,780
Yeah, I think so.

349
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,500
I'm a little hurt.

350
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,560
Because it seems like you don't remember what happened that day.

351
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,900
Don't you even remember what you said on the stone stairway?

352
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,430
What did I say?

353
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,070
Don't you really remember?

354
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,760
Because of what you said that day, I asked you to go steady with me.

355
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,500
I liked what you said.

356
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,670
I'm going to head out first.

357
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,110
Seok Hun!

358
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:01,300
What did I tell him standing here?

359
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,310
I just can't remember.

360
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:13,270
You need to remember, Ha Eun Byeol. What you did.

361
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,130
What brought you here, Yun Hui?

362
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,830
You came all the way here to see  me, Gyu Jin.

363
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,200
As you already know, I have no one else to turn to.

364
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,430
After some thought, I remembered you, Assemblyman, and how you treated me like my own brother.

365
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:47,180
I'm famous as an assemblyman who listens to the voice of the people.

366
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,620
On top of that, we're practically a brother and a sister.

367
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,460
That makes me want to lend my ears even more.

368
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,690
Look at me. You trust me, right?

369
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,150
Tell me everything.

370
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,360
What do I do now?

371
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,840
No, no.

372
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,780
I knew things would be like this between you two. I had a gut feeling.

373
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,310
Not long ago, I ran into Ha Yun Cheol at dawn.

374
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,480
I badmouthed Seo Jin just a little. This is what he said.

375
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,920
"If you're drunk, go home quietly and sleep it off."

376
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,080
"Don't go running off at the mouth."

377
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,150
I didn't know why he was protective of her since they'd already split.

378
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,390
But now all the pieces of the puzzles are coming together.

379
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,380
He's a piece of trash.

380
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,840
Even when having affairs, we have the lines we don't cross.

381
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,860
You could go with a woman you don't know at all.

382
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:03,210
Or when you don't have a woman, I can get one for you.

383
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,810
No, no, what I mean is like a pen pal or an anonymous friend like,  a manito.  

384
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,510
Wow, but did he hook up with his ex-wife?

385
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,990
What a crazy bastard!

386
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:15,330
I'm losing my mind because he's demanding a divorce out of the blue.

387
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,500
It's me, your brother. Don't worry.

388
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,140
I was really successful when I practiced the divorce laws.

389
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,490
Ro Na's Mom, all you should do is do exactly what I tell you.

390
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,450
What do I need to do, Oppa?

391
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,400
When it comes to divorce, the cause of the divorce matters the most.

392
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,700
Get the evidence that says the two had an affair.

393
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,100
I'll introduce you to a really competent, junior divorce lawyer that I know.

394
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,860
You poor thing, you look so haggard.

395
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,320
 By the way, does Ju Dan Tae know this crucial information? 

396
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:06,330
 Don't hold it in and run, Lee Gyu Jin. I only want that one thing from you. 

397
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,920
I get all my salary from you, people.

398
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,550
You pay taxes, right?

399
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:16,200
Thanks so much. I don't have much to give but take this,  my love. 

400
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,750
Assemblyman, what's the occasion for you to call me out to a place like this?

401
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,290
Why, did you come into some free money somehow?

402
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,920
I plan on drinking to my heart's content since you're buying.

403
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,540
Don't stop me.

404
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,890
Get me the most expensive and the finest you can.

405
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,550
I don't owe you anything.

406
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,280
You will. Soon enough.

407
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,560
Here, have a shot.

408
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,680
What is it so that you're taking your sweet time getting to it?

409
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:50,670
For a delicious bowl of rice, my mom told me to wait patiently. So wait a little.

410
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,790
I, Gyu Jin have a special relationship with Seo Jin.

411
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,670
We both went to the same private and English kindergartens.

412
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,070
When we began living in Simwon Mansion the first time,

413
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,240
we were the neighbors living next door to each other.

414
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,360
Just tell me already, and stop joking around.

415
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,170
Ha Yun Cheol and Oh Yun Hui are getting a divorce.

416
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,480
- Why? 
 - Why do you think?

417
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,600
This guy just can't put two and two together! Don't you think?

418
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,100
It's all because of Seo Jin.

419
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,780
Ha Yun Cheol and Seo Jin.

420
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,190
They're joining their forces yet again.

421
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,410
Well then. Can I hear more in-depth from the Assemblyman, Mr. Two and Two?

422
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,740
 It may be good for you to take your hands off of the company matters for a while. 

423
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,590
 It's important to calm down the shareholders for now. 

424
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,910
 When something like this happened, you should've consulted me first. 

425
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,750
 Why have you been hogging it to yourself ike a fool? 

426
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,410
 - It's Oh Yun Hui. 
 - What? 

427
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,310
 The one who sang for me  

428
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,190
  was Oh Yun Hui. 

429
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,800
 Was it really Oh Yun Hui? 

430
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,080
 What on earth happened between you two? 

431
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,050
Ju Dan Tae.

432
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:33,520
Did you scheme up a thing like that to get Cheong Ah Foundation in your hand?

433
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,860
You.

434
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,450
You were indeed that kind of person.

435
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:52,830
Was what you said about the day Ro Na died all true?

436
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,080
What are you talking about?

437
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,960
Was it true that I fainted and was carried home?

438
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,010
Of course, why would I lie to you?

439
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,730
But why are you asking about that?

440
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,720
Do you by chance

441
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,200
remember anything?

442
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,550
Why? Is there something I shouldn't remember?

443
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,230
It's me. Where are you now?

444
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,430
 About Our Company 
 JohnBio 

445
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,840
What's all this? Are you sleeping here?

446
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,090
What's with this luggage?

447
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,730
I left the house.

448
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,660
So have you been staying here?

449
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,000
This is more comfortable since I'm busy at work and don't want to bother getting a hotel.

450
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,020
What happened with Oh Yun Hui?

451
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,720
I asked for a divorce.

452
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,730
But that doesn't mean I'm coming back to you.

453
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:21,100
I just don't have the right to be by Yun Hui's side. That's why I left.

454
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,900
Good for you.

455
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,170
You should look into a place to stay soon. You can't stay here like this.

456
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,890
I'll figure it out myself.

457
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,540
How's Eun Byeol?

458
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,910
Are you certain that her memories were erased?

459
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:40,560
I give her the medicine, but I'm so nervous.

460
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,620
She seems to remember something and doesn't really talk to me.

461
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,900
How about your meals?

462
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,190
Do you eat?

463
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,930
You have to hold on no matter what for Eun Byeol.

464
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:06,000
If you get weak, it's over for Eun Byeol.

465
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,270
What's wrong with your hand?

466
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,580
It's nothing. I think I got a cramp.

467
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:24,130
Did you hurt your hand? Did you?

468
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,560
 Who are you? Why are you doing this? 

469
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,150
 Looks like you put your hands on the wrong woman. 

470
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,670
 Who sent you? Was it Ju Dan Tae? Bastard! 

471
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,700
 Break his hands first. 

472
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,150
 No! 

473
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,060
Why are you telling me that now? You're like this because of me!

474
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,090
It's not because of you. Don't concern yourself. It's my problem.

475
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,470
It's my problem too.

476
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,590
I know what you had to go through to become a doctor,

477
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,040
and how much you liked being one.

478
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,250
It's all because of Ju Dan Tae.

479
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,210
I can't let this go. That sly bastard.

480
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,800
What are you going to do about it?

481
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,880
I'm going to break off my engagement  at once.

482
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,850
- What? 
- I've never loved that man.

483
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:22,160
I just hated you for having Oh Yun Hui in your heart your whole life.

484
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,890
I needed someone who saw me as a woman. It's my fault for believing that was love.

485
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:32,970
If I marry him, our Eun Byeol, too, will be miserable.

486
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,520
I'm sorry.

487
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,760
Because of that bastard,

488
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,070
I made things hard for you,

489
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,360
and ruined our relationship too.

490
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,550
It's all in the past. We can't turn things around.

491
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,850
We can.

492
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,560
I'm throwing away my pride and holding on to you.

493
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,450
I beg of you. Stay by my side.

494
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,280
I told you not to be like this.

495
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,680
You're late.

496
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,020
Where have you been?

497
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,620
I almost fell asleep here.

498
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,530
None of your business.

499
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,200
I couldn't reach my fiancée till this late at night.

500
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,150
Isn't it only natural that I should be worried?

501
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:08,930
What happened to the board members who want to terminate you? Should I meet and try convincing them?

502
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,500
What are your true intentions?

503
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,810
Do you want me to give you all of Cheong Ah Group

504
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:19,240
and grow old and die as the Chairperson of Cheong Ah Arts School alone?

505
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,880
Why are you so pissed at me?

506
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,620
I understand. You're having a hard time these days, right?

507
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,180
I understand you knew all along I used a shadow singer.

508
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,890
Wasn't it you who tipped off the Foundation and disgraced me?

509
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:37,180
How dare you threaten my secretary and pull a move like that behind my back? Why?

510
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:42,650
Were you itching to get it over with the merger? What you wanted wasn't me, but Cheong Ah Group!

511
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,370
Tell me if that isn't true!

512
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,160
Money

513
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,600
is something your family goes crazy over it, too.

514
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,960
You lowlife bastard.

515
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,950
As long as I know what kind of bastard you are, I can't marry you.

516
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,000
Our relationship is over with this.

517
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,190
Get out!

518
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,370
Cheon Seo Jin.

519
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,540
You shouldn't be going down that road.

520
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,250
Yes, Attorney Park.

521
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:43,230
I want to proceed with the dissolution of my engagement as quickly as I can.

522
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,920
Plus, white out everything that's about the merger.

523
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:52,770
Our agreement specifies that CA group is to formally go public after our wedding ceremony.

524
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,100
Okay then, I trust you'll do a good job.

525
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,660
I think you need to come out for a moment.

526
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,680
Some detectives are here.

527
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,860
Detectives?

528
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,690
In the house, there are many eyes that see and ears that hear.

529
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,900
You can speak comfortably in here.

530
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:24,940
Why do you need to see Eun Byeol?

531
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,650
We need to confirm something directly with Eun Byeol.

532
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,580
It's about Bae Ro Na's murder case.

533
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,060
Isn't that case already closed?

534
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,920
I feel bad about Ro Na's death,

535
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,550
but I don't see why you have to see Eun Byeol about it.

536
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,810
Eun Byeol is the prime suspect.

537
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:44,180
We also found hard evidence.

538
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,450
Evidence?

539
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:49,240
This necklace belongs to your daughter, right?

540
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,450
Both of your daughter's DNA and the victim's blood were found on the necklace.

541
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,940
We already obtained the statement from Security Guard, Park.

542
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,230
He says he falsely testified for money.

543
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:05,620
Oh, Ha Yun Cheol is also detained at the police station and getting questioned.

544
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,920
Your daughter killed Bae Ro Na, didn't she?

545
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,460
That day on the stairs,

546
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,480
it was Ha Eun Byeol who struck the victim's head with the trophy, correct?

547
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,780
You and Ha Yun Cheol used a phony culprit to cover that up!

548
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:31,440
Did you purposely kill Bae Ro Na at the hospital for the fear of the truth coming out?

549
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,540
No.

550
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,670
No.

551
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:35,820
Arrest Ha Eun Byeol immediately!

552
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,720
No! No!

553
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,050
My Eun Byeol did nothing wrong.

554
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,380
I did it all!

555
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,750
Bribing Mr. Park and killing Bae Ro Na were all my doing.

556
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,310
My Eun Byeol doesn't know anything.

557
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:53,350
I won't leave you alone if you lay even a finger on my daughter!

558
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:56,420
Your motherly love makes me all teary-eyed.

559
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,920
The love you have for both your daughter and your ex-husband.

560
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,490
I can't listen to it without shedding a tear.

561
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,560
Ju Dan Tae.

562
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,940
-Chairman. 
- Okay, take this and treat your men to a nice meal.

563
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,640
Thank you. Wow.

564
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:12,840
Let's get some meat today!

565
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,320
Yes, Sir.

566
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:19,990
I was very moved. By your confession.

567
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:24,880
Did you set this up?

568
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,480
You said you wanted to break off your engagement with me.

569
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,660
Why, do you want to go back to Ha Yun Cheol?

570
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:37,170
Since when? Were you falling for him again the moment he returned to Hera Palace?

571
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,950
Or was it the night I crippled his hand?

572
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,260
You son of a bitch!

573
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,790
Son of a bitch?

574
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:52,550
Did you think I didn't know what you and that bastard did in New York?

575
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,560
You betrayed me.

576
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,730
Don't come to me.

577
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,830
Don't come closer!

578
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:08,180
Should I take this evidence to a police station now?

579
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:14,150
Nah. In fact, sending it to Oh Yun Hui would be much more fun.

580
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:19,230
When the woman who lost her only daughter learns that her husband betrayed her too,

581
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:25,960
it makes me wonder how she'll rip you and Eun Byeol into pieces to death.

582
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:30,510
You're crazy.

583
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,090
This is the price you pay for betraying me.

584
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:43,110
Did you really think you could break off our engagement without facing this much?

585
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,780
What should I do?

586
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:49,770
What can I do to rip Eun Byeol's heart to pieces and hurt her?

587
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:52,750
You make the choice.

588
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:57,520
But when I think about it, telling Oh Yun Hui would be the most fun.

589
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,810
No. You can't! You can never!

590
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:07,210
I'll do everything you want, so don't do anything.

591
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:11,150
I'll do everything you tell me to, so leave Eun Byeol alone.

592
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:15,270
Please!  I beg of you. I do beg of you.

593
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:21,370
Can you really do everything I tell you to?

594
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,780
What's this?
  Wedding Invitation  

595
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,800
What the heck is this?

596
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,800
 The number you have dialed is currently unavailable. 

597
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,440
Cheon Seo Jin, open up. We need to talk.

598
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,950
Cheon Seo Jin!

599
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:42,520
Open the door. We need to talk!

600
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:47,740
Seo Jin, open the door! Open up!

601
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:52,020
Let's talk. We need to talk!

602
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,460
Cheon Seo Jin.

603
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,580
Cheon Seo Jin!

604
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:14,210
Did you get the wedding invitation?

605
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:17,410
Yes. It's in fifteen days.

606
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:21,410
I didn't know Chairman Ju would come out like this.

607
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,430
When he knows well that Seo Jin changed her mind,

608
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,420
he's still determined to go through with the wedding.

609
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,810
Does this mean he loves Seo Jin that much?

610
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:34,520
Chairman Ju must have an important reason why he can't ditch Cheon Seo Jin.

611
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,490
I have an appointment, so I'm hanging up now.

612
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:41,980
What? What appointment? Weren't you going to tell me, your oppa, everything?

613
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,910
Hello?

614
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,740
Hui! Hui!

615
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:53,438
Oppa? Hui!

616
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:57,170
I'm sorry I couldn't  keep my appointment with you last time.

617
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,000
Anyhow, what's the reason you wanted to see me?

618
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,990
I'm sure you already know.

619
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:06,370
I'm curious to know how you came to possess Hae In's land.

620
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,650
Hae In is my daughter.

621
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,750
To be precise, she is Su Ryeon's daughter.

622
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:19,410
Apparently, you weren't informed since Su Ryeon appointed someone else to be Hae In's legal guardian.

623
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:25,610
It makes sense because you don't deserve to be a father, to begin with.

624
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:29,100
There is no development plan for Cheonsu District yet.

625
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,310
Why are you interested in an area as underdeveloped as that?

626
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:37,840
Yet Chairman Ju, you built the Cheong Ah Art Center in that underdeveloped area.

627
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:42,330
For someone who just lost her child, you're being quite greedy over material things.

628
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:47,940
I only focused on raising my child before.

629
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:52,020
But now, I no longer have my daughter.

630
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,960
My goal has changed thus.

631
00:53:55,910 --> 00:54:00,220
I want to be filthy rich.

632
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:07,640
I'm going to make money like crazy. Enough to get this penthouse.

633
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,690
My Ro Na really wanted to live here.

634
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,470
The penthouse, you say.

635
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:17,050
Would you like to make a bet?

636
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:21,550
On who lives in this house a year from now.

637
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,450
The Chairwoman is here.

638
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,420
Why are you so shocked?

639
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:41,040
I stopped by just for a talk about business. Don't get the wrong idea.

640
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,030
I didn't know you had a guest. I'll come back later.

641
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:48,360
There's no need. I was just about to leave.

642
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:54,000
It's been a while, Eun Byeol. I heard you were sick. Are you okay?

643
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,240
Yes.

644
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,570
That's good to hear. It's nice to see you healthy.

645
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:02,610
Do you see your dad often?

646
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,140
Why are you asking her a thing like that?

647
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,890
I'm just jealous.

648
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:11,610
My Ro Na grew up lonely without a father.

649
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:15,570
She can't ever see her new dad either.

650
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,770
Because she is dead.

651
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:27,280
By the way, congrats on your wedding.

652
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,800
Thankfully, Chairman Ju sent me an invite.

653
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,310
Well then. See you at your wedding.

654
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:41,600
What? Aren't you two high school friends?

655
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,240
The wedding is fifteen days from now. We're going to be  a real family.

656
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,400
So let's get along.

657
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,950
This makes no sense.

658
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,860
What's the point of going through with the damned wedding?

659
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,410
I thought you and Dad were getting along again.

660
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,090
How much more are you going to hurt me?

661
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:08,770
I'm already sick of getting fingers pointed at me at school.

662
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:12,110
Are you now putting me through this crappy wedding?

663
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:16,090
Say it. Say you won't do this wedding!

664
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:20,270
This marriage is my decision.

665
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:24,050
Eun Byeol doesn't seem ready to accept me as your father yet.

666
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:27,060
It's okay. We can try adjusting to each other a little by a little.

667
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,160
I really hate this.

668
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,220
I will never approve of this marriage.

669
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,510
For once, Ha Eun Byeol said something right.

670
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:42,540
I also cast my vote in not approving this damned wedding.

671
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:48,180
Congratulations. You two look great together.

672
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,900
- This is crazy! 
 - Sit.

673
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:04,150
Please stop. If money is what you want, I'll give you enough alimony.

674
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:05,370
So stop this wedding—

675
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,410
Go ahead and try!

676
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,850
There's nothing you can decide in this game.

677
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:14,170
Whether we marry or break off the engagement,  I decide!

678
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,400
On the day I choose, you will be Ju Dan Tae's wife,

679
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,420
and walk into this penthouse. Got it?

680
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,700
Housekeeper Ahn!

681
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,020
Yes, Chairman.

682
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,480
Call the dress shop and tell them we're heading there right now.

683
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,560
Understood.

684
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:04,590
Try this. I think it'll look good on you.

685
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,160
 Cheong Ah Arts 28th Festival 

686
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,730
 Where have you been? You were gone for a while. 

687
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,900
 Ro Na! Ro Na! 

688
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,340
 Ro Na! 
 Fire Alarm  

689
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,770
 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival  

690
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,840
Bae Ro Na.

691
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:45,180
Everything's working out smoothly because of that child.

692
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:51,060
I want to tell her how thankful I am.

693
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,360
But I can't.

694
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:59,950
It's me, Secretary Do. Go home quickly and get Eun Byeol's and my passports.

695
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,690
Reserve tickets on the first plane out of here tonight.

696
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:05,010
It doesn't matter where to.

697
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,490
Looking for these?

698
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:13,920
Why? Are you disappointed?

699
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,740
Did you think I wouldn't have prepared this much?

700
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,860
Let's not waste each other's energy.

701
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:27,150
Wherever you run away, I'll find you, no matter what.

702
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:33,370
Are you okay?

703
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,420
No, no.

704
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,190
It doesn't suit you.

705
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,570
This is a little weird too.

706
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:07,540
Just kill me instead!

707
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:17,870
My bride doesn't like her dress at all. I see how mad she is.

708
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:21,220
She's someone with great eyes for fashion. Show her  some other designs too.

709
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,530
Crazy bastard.

710
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:26,680
You son of a bitch. You're a piece of trash!

711
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,580
What's this?

712
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,450
A gift.

713
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,260
It's totally my style.

714
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,550
Did something good happen today?

715
01:00:55,550 --> 01:01:00,290
You coming back is the best thing happened. I missed you so much.

716
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:03,730
You're acting very cute today.

717
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,890
I'll go change.

718
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,610
What are Ju Dan Tae's true intentions?

719
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:19,630
Does he have special feelings for her because she's the kids' birth mom?

720
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:24,290
To think that a monster like Ju Dan Tae has a woman he really likes, 
  Voice Spy  

721
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:26,930
it's unexpected.

722
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:28,190
Something's strange.

723
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:34,060
Two years ago, Na Ae Gyo most certainly wanted to run away from  Ju Dan Tae.

724
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,040
Those two are completely on the same side.

725
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,270
It doesn't matter. There's no time!

726
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:45,720
I've got to meet Na Ae Gyo and hear from her. About what she did to Su Ryeon.

727
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:49,550
I won't mess up twice.

728
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:54,300
What was your relationship with Su Ryeon?

729
01:01:54,300 --> 01:02:01,170
Seol Ah's adoptive older brother and her birth mother. Was that all?

730
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,980
I wanted

731
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:09,340
to make her happy.

732
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:12,800
I should've protected her whatever it took.

733
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,020
I was stupid.

734
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,450
I can't forgive myself.

735
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,470
Everything has been sold out.

736
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:31,150
And at the highest price.

737
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:34,240
Is that why you're in such a good mood?

738
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,080
It should be, given the great location.

739
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:41,210
It might go up even higher later. Why did you sell it already?

740
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:45,420
This is at the highest price. Once it becomes associated as a speculative investment area,

741
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,090
the loans will be blocked.

742
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:51,780
How many people can afford to buy a property worth billions of wons without a loan?

743
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:55,650
I see that Chairman Jeong Du Man is still giving you good information.

744
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,040
Everything is thanks to you.

745
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,340
You've been my perfect partner for the last 20 years.

746
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:03,750
Did you realize that just now?

747
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:10,820
Now that I think about it, Sim Su Ryeon was really pitiful.

748
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:15,860
She lived her whole life, knowing very little about her husband.

749
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:21,140
I don't want to talk about her on a day like this.

750
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:25,420
It's the last bullet. I'll go first.

751
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,230
You should be nervous.

752
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:32,690
As should you.

753
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,160
Na Ae Gyo, tell me the truth.

754
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,640
Two years ago, you were about to betray me, weren't you?

755
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,660
What do you think you're doing?

756
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,170
Tell me!

757
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:49,190
You can't fool me. I already knew from the start you'd changed.

758
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:54,180
You didn't answer my calls or come home. You kept avoiding me, and I think you had a reason for that.

759
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,960
What are you up to?

760
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,550
Were you going to leave me?

761
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,090
Go ahead and shoot me if  you can.

762
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:09,430
Shoot me if you're confident to protect your assets without me.

763
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,030
You retard.

764
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,020
Whoever betrays me dies.

765
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:17,080
The same goes for you, Na Ae Gyo.

766
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,590
 Mom, you can't die. 

767
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,200
No. No.

768
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,000
No. No.

769
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,900
No!

770
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,350
No.

771
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,330
No.

772
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,970
No. No!

773
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,130
Chairman!

774
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,960
What is it, Sir?

775
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,200
Please wake up!

776
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,570
Na Ae Gyo disappeared.

777
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:30,490
- Find her quickly! 
 - Yes, Sir!

778
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,580
Na Ae Gyo, wake up! Open your eyes!

779
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,320
She's not breathing.

780
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,420
What?

781
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:52,120
We have to get out of here quickly.

782
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,320
We don't have time, quickly!

783
01:05:55,590 --> 01:06:02,620


784
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:28,270
♫  You keep repeating just the words that you love me   ♫

785
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:36,260
♫  Still saying it's okay even it if becomes so   ♫

786
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:42,800
♫  To me who abandoned you everyday♫  

787
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:47,230
♫  Are you the only person who changes?♫  

788
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:48,820
 What do you mean, you're getting married to Chairman Ju? 

789
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,100
 I told you that you wouldn't escape from me. 

790
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,630
 No matter what, you need to leave before the wedding! 

791
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:54,920
 The person who killed my mom.   

792
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,140
 I found out about everything. 

793
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:59,220
 I'll kill you Ju Dan Tae! 

794
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,090
 The trophy? 

795
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:01,940
 I feel like I'm going to go insane. 

796
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:04,370
 Seok Hoon, Seok Gyeong, your birth mother is alive. 

797
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:05,600
 Oh Yun Hui, is it you again? 

798
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,890
 Would you believe if you were me? 

799
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,330
 You tried to kill me. 

800
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:12,650
 You were sincere. It was you without a doubt!
