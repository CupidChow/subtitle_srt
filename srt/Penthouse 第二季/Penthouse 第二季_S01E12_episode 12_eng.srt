 Episode 12 

2
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,350
- Search the place top to bottom.
- Yes, Sir.

3
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,060
- Here are some pictures.
 - Okay, seize them.

4
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,510
There are some over here, too.

5
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,170
Why would anyone keep their frames there?

6
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,510
Here is this.

7
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,630
Isn't this Cheon Seo Jin? Seize that.

8
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,990
Yes, Sir.

9
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,920
Hey, remove this.

10
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,150
Hey, where is that crow bar?

11
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,980
I did wrong.  I did wrong. Please let me out!

12
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,700
- Save me, please. I beg you!
- Take it easy. We are the police.

13
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,420
- Please.
- Relax, relax.  We are the police.

14
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,300
What's your name?

15
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,890
I'm Sim Su Ryeon.

16
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,600
A-A-Are you being locked up in here?

17
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,800
Ju-Ju Dan Tae locked us up here.

18
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,700
How long have you been in here?

19
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,150
What's today's date?

20
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Please take this child over to the hospital first.

21
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,180
I beg of you.  Hurry, please!

22
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,790
Call an ambulance quickly. People were found in the basement. Two people, no less.

23
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,870
Can you walk okay?

24
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,880
Shine the light ahead.

25
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,600
 Consider yourself mad, and do you want to try trusting me? 

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,400
 I have a fantastic plan to finish off Ju Dan Tae with one blow. 

27
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,510
 What was that again now? 

28
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,570
 You did say you wanted to get back at him. 

29
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,580
 Do as you will with him. 

30
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,530
 All I care about is getting his money. 

31
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,500
 In return, you can't tell a soul about my existence. 

32
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,910
 How does that sound? Deal? 

33
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,160
 No, thanks. 

34
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,670
 I don't trust you either. 

35
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,000
 What about this as collateral? 

36
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,050
 You must protect your daughter. 

37
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,930
 Whatever you need to do, you've got to protect your child. 

38
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,000
 Because you are a mother. 

39
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,470
 Turning vicious for the sake of her child is what a mother does. 

40
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,530
 A mother can do anything for her child. 

41
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,870
 Cancelled the contract? 

42
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,510
 You didn't know? 

43
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,940
 To my surprise, Na Ae Gyo contacted me last night 

44
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,070
 to cancel your contract. 

45
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,150
 It's a much-coveted property. 

46
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,950
  I came to see why you suddenly changed your mind. 

47
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,270
 What kind of joke  is that? 

48
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,830
 She said she needed fast cash. 

49
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,580
 Since her need looked so urgent, I didn't even charge her the penalty. 

50
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,800
 Who dared to cancel the contract without my permission?   

51
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,800
 Oh, no.  By any chance, did Na Ae Gyo scam you, Chairman? 

52
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,270
 Apparently, you trusted Na Ae Gyo a good deal. 
   

53
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,380
 Enough to trust her with your everything. 

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,840
 Your call cannot be connected at this time... 

55
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,020
 My money. Did she dare to run with my money? 

56
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,850
 I'm going to kill you, Na Ae Gyo. 

57
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,070
 Can you really get rid of Ju Dan Tae? 

58
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,590
 Only if you follow my directions. 

59
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:42,550
 Starting now we will create each and every crime Ju Dan Tae will commit. 

60
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,430
 I will help you, Cheon Seo Jin. 

61
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,310
 You, your daughter, and Ha Yun Cheol will be cleared of the false accusation. 

62
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,970
 If you cooperate well on this, I can bring you Eun Byeol's necklace from Ju Dan Tae. 

63
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,650
 Is that true? 

64
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,660
 What will you have me do? 

65
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,270
 Tonight, a person will die. 

66
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,040
 Who will it be? 

67
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,910
 Na Ae Gyo. 

68
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,970
 Na Ae Gyo, you mean Seok Gyeong's birth mom? 

69
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,350
 I see that you knew. 

70
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,900
 I've never met her. 

71
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,070
 Apart from knowing Ju Dan Tae was secretly seeing her as the agent of Cheonsu District. 

72
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,040
 Did she run with Ju Dan Tae's money? 

73
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,880
 Something like that. 

74
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,290
 Why are you trying to kill her? 

75
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,530
 Are you asking me to take part in a murder? 

76
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,550
 It's not like it's your first time. 

77
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,780
 Weren't you the one who helped Ju Dan Tae to kill Su Ryeon? 

78
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,910
 Did you forget that already? 

79
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,280
 It's time to pay back what I have received. 

80
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,710
 Exactly for what I went through. 

81
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,850
 You don't have to do it if you don't want to. 

82
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,150
 If you want to live forever suffering at the hands of Ju Dan Tae. 

83
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,990
 I'll do it! Anything. 

84
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,630
 In return, you make sure you keep your promise. 

85
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,110
 About handing over Eun Byeol's necklace. 

86
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,050
 Don't worry. I will keep my promise. 

87
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,090
 The time Na Ae Gyo dies tonight is ten o'clock. 

88
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,070
 We have to finish everything we planned prior to that. 

89
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,680
 An hour prior to Na Ae Gyo's time of death. 

90
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,270
 Sleep aid. Stinox CR. Nighttime Tartrate. 12.5mg. 100 count. 

91
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,390
 What's taking you so long? 

92
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,970
 I asked for the wine a while ago! 

93
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,910
 Just who are you looking for like the way you do? 

94
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,340
 Who is Na Ae Gyo? 

95
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,660
 Why? Are you going to find her for me? 

96
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,860
 Drink slowly, or you'll get drunk. 

97
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,490
 Stop pestering me. Get out of my sight! 

98
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,140
 To: Na Ae Gyo. Come to the warehouse with the money by 10 p.m., 

99
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,170
 if you don't want to die. 

100
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,250
 The time has come. 

101
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,900
 I put Ju Dan Tae's clothes and shoes inside the bag. 

102
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,220
 Report his movements from time to time since he may wake up. 

103
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,320
 He is completely out. He won't wake up even if I hit him with a bat. 

104
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,810
 You must succeed. Eun Byeol's and my life depend on it. 

105
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,310
 I can trust you, right, Oh Yun Hui? 

106
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,850
 There is no SDHC card detected. Please insert the card. 

107
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,670
 Half an hour prior to Na Ae Gyo's time of death. 

108
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,560
 - Where is Na Ae Gyo? 
 - She is headed  toward the warehouse already. 

109
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,150
 Be careful. 

110
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,830
 You as well. 

111
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,130
 One minute prior to Na Ae Gyo's death 

112
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,850
Hello?

113
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,520
Ju Dan Tae is trying to kill me.

114
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,820
Please help.

115
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,350
This is...

116
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,660
Are you alright? You're not hurt?

117
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,080
I'm okay.

118
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,050
That's such a relief.

119
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,940
Take her safely to the villa.

120
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,550
Oh!

121
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,140
This is a ring Ju Dan Tae gave to Na Ae Gyo.

122
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,080
This will count as evidence.

123
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,000
 Rest in Peace 

124
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,300
 Sim Su Ryeon 
 05.22 1977- 05.08. 2020 

125
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:47,770
 Four hours after Na Ae Gyo's death 

126
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,210
I'll leave the rest to you.

127
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,500
You be careful as well.

128
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,380
Where is Ju Dan Tae's cellphone?

129
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,850
 To Secretary Jo: Bring the guys to the warehouse immediately. 

130
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,080
Ju Dan Tae, you're now finished.

131
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,600
Keep an eye on him here.

132
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,110
Everyone, go to the warehouse.

133
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,380
 Emergency Medical Center 

134
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,510
It's been a while, Ju Seok Hun. We can greet each other later.

135
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,770
Leave Ro Na to me, and you can go home now.

136
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,860
No, I want to go with you.

137
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,350
I won't trust any adult until I see it for myself.

138
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,420
Mom. Ro Na will be fine, right?

139
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,560
You trust me, right? I'm going to protect her, so don't worry.

140
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,420
How's Seok Gyeong?

141
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,270
I told her to stay in the study room.

142
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,870
Good.

143
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,470
The police are going to be there soon, so it'll be best not to go home tonight.

144
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,490
You should take Seok Hun and go. I'll do the rest from now on.

145
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,560
Mom, no matter what you do,

146
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,500
I'll always be on your side.

147
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,320
Alright.

148
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,540
Thank you for trusting me.

149
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,030
Ahjumma?

150
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,210
What is this place?

151
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,460
Starting now, I'm going to ask

152
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,130
something difficult of you.

153
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,140
I'm going  to punish the people who hurt you.

154
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,690
If I do that,

155
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:21,060
will you and I both be able to go back to the way we were?

156
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,320
I'll do whatever it is.

157
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,830
I want to repay the debt I owe you and Seol Ah.

158
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,370
 Go to the villa in Pangyo and set up the pictures. Then lock the basement door. 

159
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,330
 Five hours and twenty minutes after Na Ae Gyo's death 

160
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,620
 Six hours after Na Ae Gyo's death 

161
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,690
At least explain to me what's happening.

162
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,040
Is Na Ae Gyo really dead?

163
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,230
You couldn't have done it  by yourself. There's someone backing you.

164
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,120
Is it, by chance, Logan Lee?

165
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,320
You'll learn everything by tomorrow. Just make sure to finish it well.

166
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,260
I did everything you asked me to.

167
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,900
Now, keep your promise. Where is Eun Byeol's necklace?

168
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,910
It's in Ju Dan Tae's Pangyo Villa.

169
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,780
This is the key to the drawer. I don't know the exact location myself.

170
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,430
Return before Ju Dan Tae wakes up. Six in the morning at the latest.

171
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,860
By morning, the police will be searching that place as well.

172
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,150
What are you waiting for? Hurry and go.

173
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,720
Which drawer is she talking about?

174
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,170
Where is the necklace?

175
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,700
  Eight hours after Na Ae Gyo's death 

176
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,410
- How's your stomach? 
 - What happened yesterday?

177
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:46,910
You drank so fast that you got drunk. Do you want some soup for your hangover?

178
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,710
No need. I just have a splitting headache.

179
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,980
Funny, why can't I remember anything? I didn't drink that much.

180
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,780
Where is my cell phone? It wasn't in my room.

181
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,220
I haven't seen it. Shall I try calling it?

182
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,290
I have an arrest warrant.

183
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,270
- Dan Tae! 
 - Don't step on this.

184
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,460
Dan Tae!

185
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,510
- Dan Tae, Dan Tae! 
 - Don't step on that either. Search the place.

186
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,170
- You're Ju Dan Tae, right?
 - I am.

187
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:40,490
You're under arrest for a murder and desecration of a human corpse. Arrest him.

188
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:45,080
What gibberish is that? Just who did I kill?

189
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:51,060
- Are you folks crazy? 
- Na Ae Gyo died last night.

190
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,000
Is Na Ae Gyo dead?

191
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,520
- Come with us to the station now. 
 - Wait.

192
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,490
Dan Tae! What's happening? You, killing a person?

193
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,970
How can that be? He can't even kill a bug. He's such a gentle man.

194
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,040
- Something's wrong. 
 - Let go!

195
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,570
Alright then, can you testify where Ju Dan Tae was last night?

196
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,750
You know well I came home early and slept through. Tell them!

197
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,170
We use the separate rooms, so I'm not entirely sure.

198
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:28,810
Except that he drank and was in an agitated state.

199
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:33,870
- Oh, he kept making calls looking for someone.
 - Who was that?

200
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,720
Well, he said it was Na Ae Gyo.

201
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,020
What a crazy—. Have you gone mad? Get your hands off me!

202
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,550
I didn't kill her. Never. Show me the evidence, or I won't even take one step.

203
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:47,350
Get me Secretary Jo, and call Lawyer Jeong.

204
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:51,090
We've found these in the fireplace.

205
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,560
They're gloves half burnt and a pair of shoes.

206
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,560
- Collect them as evidence. 
 - It wasn't me!  I've never seen those.

207
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:04,590
In the morning, from the front door, I saw the muddy footprints and thought it strange.

208
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:10,180
Did you really kill that woman? The birth mother of your children?

209
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,450
You...

210
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,430
- How do you know Na Ae Gyo?
 - Take him.

211
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,800
Let go of me! Who the hell did I kill?

212
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,850
You, there. Who are you? What the hell are you doing here?

213
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:42,020
Damn it, let go! What are you doing here? Hey, you bastard!

214
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,220
- It's payback. 
 - Bullshit! What payback?

215
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,240
Hey, Gu Ho Dong! You bastard, what are you doing here?

216
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,190
- The addresses for the warehouse and the crematorium are in here. 
 - What about the blackbox?

217
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,860
The SDHC card is missing. It was removed on purpose prior to driving.

218
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:09,190
- There is a ring dropped here. 
 - Collect it. And gather any DNA.

219
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,730
Cheong Ah Group's Chair Ju Dan Tae was just arrested on a murder charge.
  Gangnam Police Station 

220
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,960
The victim, Ms. Na, was revealed to be the birth mother of Chairman Ju's twin children.

221
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,190
Shockingly, she was Chairman Ju's business partner  and was having a long-term affair.

222
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,640
Eight, eight, three, seven.

223
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,330
It is Ju Dan Tae's car.

224
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:38,140
I found this  in the crematory for animals. It looks like the ashes of a burned bag.

225
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,240
Is this the man that came here last night?

226
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,500
Yes.

227
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:53,270
Over money or whatnot, Chairman Ju seemed very upset yesterday.
 Golden Realty - Office of a Licensed Realtor  

228
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:56,250
He was very upset that the woman sold the land without his permission.

229
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,940
And he smacked her almost to the point of death. Oh, right.

230
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,870
It was recorded on that CCTV,

231
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,810
and it's all on this USB.

232
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:15,120
- I found something here. It's an urn. 
 - A urn?

233
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,640
What in the world? That's absurd!

234
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,260
Send it immediately to the National Forensic Service for human remains and its DNA.

235
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:44,200
- Oh Yun Hui, why aren't you answering the phone? 
 - Oh, okay.

236
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,640
Human remains are found in the study of your penthouse.

237
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,770
Human remains? What crazy talk is that?

238
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,270
Why would I have human remains in my house?

239
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,390
You swore to kill Na Ae Gyo. I have a witness for that.

240
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:08,560
What witness? I slept through the day. Who witnessed me doing what?

241
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,800
I'm the witness.

242
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,510
What kind of bullshit is this?

243
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,990
I met Chairman Ju in his penthouse yesterday afternoon.

244
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,070
He was enraged with Na Ae Gyo.

245
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:32,950
I got so startled by the look of his eyes I thought I should record him.

246
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,740
 My money. Did you dare to run with my money? 

247
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,340
  I'm going to kill you, Na Ae Gyo.  

248
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,770
You have a clear motive for your crime, and all the evidence points to you.

249
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,330
Do you still deny, Chairman Ju?

250
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,300
  Were you ever threatened directly?  

251
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,540
  Ah, she even said something like this to me. 

252
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:00,290
 I recorded her just in case. 
   

253
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:03,660
  I waited because I have a favor to ask. 
 Oh Yun Hui voice file  

254
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,080
  Get rid of Sim Su Ryeon. 

255
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,070
Oh Yun Hui, you bitch.

256
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,310
You have many enemies surrounding you.

257
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,930
- So it was easier than I thought it would be. 
 - What?

258
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:43,060
You taught me. If there's no evidence, you fabricate one.

259
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,100
How does it feel? To become a murderer.

260
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:54,620
Oh Yun Hui, Cheon Seo Jin. You two planned this, didn't you? I'm going to kill all of you!

261
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,040
I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you! Kill you!

262
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,120
Let go. Let go! I'm going to kill you!

263
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,670
Let go! Let go! Damn it!

264
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:13,560
Don't worry. You won't be lonely by yourself in jail.

265
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:19,090
Then, good luck.

266
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:23,300
Oh Yun Hui. Oh Yun Hui, stop right there.

267
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,130
Where's Na Ae Gyo right now? What did you do with Na Ae Gyo!

268
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,380
Let go of me! I didn't kill her.

269
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,550
This is all a trap. Go get Oh Yun Hui, that crazy bitch!

270
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:37,040
I didn't kill her!  I didn't kill her! Let me go!

271
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,980
 Forensic Investigation 
 Police 

272
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,040
-Block the entrance. 
-Yes, Sir.

273
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,840
Don't take pictures. No pictures.

274
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,190
Move, move. Get out of the way.

275
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,700
What happened at the villa?

276
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,100
When I filed for divorce, Ju Dan Tae

277
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,280
trapped me in the villa and made it look like I was dead.

278
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,200
And every night, he pressured me into giving up my assets.

279
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,170
When I didn't obey him,

280
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,470
he would do

281
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,310
horrific things to me in the basement.

282
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:58,340
Do you remember who hurt you like this?

283
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,360
Yes.

284
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,640
Who is it?

285
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:12,050
It's okay. Tell them.

286
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,680
Mister Ju Dan Tae who lives in the penthouse.

287
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,020
 VIP 

288
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,150
Nothing happened, right?

289
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,640
It all ended well, right?

290
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,050
It's over now. I finished giving my statement.

291
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,060
It's all thanks to you, Logan.

292
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,710
I was so worried

293
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,950
that you might disappear again.

294
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,050
I'm relieved.

295
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,120
I'm so relieved.

296
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:34,850
♫    Please get away from here like we don't care.  ♫

297

I ask for a thorough investigation. Be safe.

305
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,400
Good day.

306
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,250
Director Do, get ready to sue him for a divorce.

307
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:44,120
Look into ways I can take back all the real estate, the fifty billion won,

308
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,270
plus all the Cheong Ah group shares that Ju Dan Tae took.

309
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,130
Right now.

310
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,090
My gosh, you scared me.

311
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,620
When did you get here?

312
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:02,040
I thought you were studying in the study room.

313
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,940
Is everything you testified true?

314
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,820
Are you implying that I lied?

315
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,210
It just seemed like you were telling things as if on cue.

316
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,490
As if you already knew my father's crime.

317
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:24,440
Did my father really kill my birth mother?

318
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,830
I'm sure you're shocked that your father was arrested.

319
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,590
But this is your father's true color.

320
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:40,020
Well, you've probably known that already.

321
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,360
And you haven't done anything wrong?

322
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,190
Is my father the only bad person?

323
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,530
What?

324
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,410
It doesn't matter what kind of person you are.

325
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,390
It's not like you were going to be my mom, anyway.

326
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,490
Now I'm really an orphan.

327
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,340
Where are you?

328
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,360
Come to Cheong Ah Medical Center now.

329
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,520
Why there?

330
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
You should meet Mom.

331
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,630
Mom?

332
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,810
Sir, what happened?

333
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,510
Where were you that you're showing up just now, you worthless jerk?

334
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,740
I gathered all the guys because you texted me  to meet you at the warehouse.

335
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,710
What warehouse? I never sent a message like that!

336
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:48,580
Hire me lawyers this instant! As long as they have their badges, ten or a hundred, bring them all here!

337
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,890
If they can't get me out of here, I'll kill you myself!

338
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,620
For god's sake, gather your wits together, you jerk!

339
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,000
What the heck is going on exactly?

340
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,360
Murder? Is Chairman Ju crazy?

341
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,110
To think that someone like him was my neighbor and I saw him everyday,

342
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,690
it's so scary. How am I supposed to live in this apartment now?

343
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,640
But still, isn't it a relief that he didn't kill her in our Hera Palace?

344
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,450
How is that a relief?

345
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:18,260
Chairman Ju and Doctor Ha. During these past few days, how many murderers came out of Hera Palace?

346
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:22,580
Does this make sense? Chairman Ju killed the twin's birth mother?

347
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:27,690
Looked like the detectives were leaving just now. Did they obtain all the evidence?

348
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,900
It's just as what the news says.

349
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,750
Let's talk later since I'm a little overwhelmed myself.

350
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,790
The woman we saw at the auction,

351
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,990
I hear she's the twin's birth mother.

352
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:43,690
You know, the woman with those huge sunglasses and in that ridiculous rainbow outfit.

353
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,700
She called out, "Fifty billion!"

354
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,080
No wonder, she seemed  to be on a different level than us.

355
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,390
Oh, my gosh, that was her?

356
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,500
She must've planned from the start to scam Chairman Ju.

357
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,520
She sold all the land he owned in Cheonsu District and fled.

358
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,640
I feel bad for Chairman Ju.

359
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,080
He lost his money, was betrayed, and became a murderer.

360
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,760
Why do you feel bad for him?

361
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,590
He hid his children's birth mother for twenty years as a mistress.

362
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,340
How is he pitiful? He should be hanged immediately.

363
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,860
By the way,

364
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,660
how much did you know, Seo Jin?

365
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,430
There's no way you didn't know at all what your husband was doing.

366
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,930
I didn't know anything.

367
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,960
I never met the kids' birth mother either.

368
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,990
Even the fact that Sim Su Ryeon is alive?

369
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,490
What?

370
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,990
What?

371
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,450
What, what are you talking about?

372
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,790
Who's alive?

373
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:47,200
You didn't know? News flash, it went viral.

374
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,890
Sim Su Ryeon, that woman is back. Alive and well.

375
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:56,030
She was locked up in Ju Dan Tae's first wife's mountain villa for two years.

376
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,450
Vill-

377
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,090
The villa?

378
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,370
Well,

379
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,510
Chairman Ju locked up  Su Ryeon in the basement

380
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,890
and tormented her by feeding her water alone.

381
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,510
I was so scared earlier I thought I'd faint.

382
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,060
Then, what's going to happen now?

383
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,220
Is Chairman Ju's wife Su Ryeon or you?

384
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,830
How is that important? It's not like it's a good place to be.

385
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:22,080
You're lucky if you don't get tangled up with that kind of psychopath.

386
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,730
 Sim Su Ryeon is alive? There's no way. It can't be. 

387
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:30,740
 Why are you trying to kill that woman? 

388
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,420
 Do you want me to take part in a murder? 

389
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,360
 It's not like it's your first time. 

390
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:41,560
 The one who helped Ju Dan Tae to kill Su Ryeon,wasn't that you?  

391
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,470
 Did you forget that already? 

392
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,020
 It's time to pay back what I have received. 

393
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,990
 Exactly for what I went through. 

394
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,180
 It was Sim Su Ryeon. She was behind Oh Yun Hui. 

395
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,460
 Then, was I helping Sim Su Ryeon all along? 

396
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,260
Sheesh.

397
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,600
You scared me.

398
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,470
No. No.

399
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,540
What is?

400
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,990
No. No! No!

401
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,640
Teacher Cheon!

402
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,860
Where is she running off to like that?

403
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,150
We didn't even get around telling her Ro Na is alive.

404
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,460
What if there's another bloodbath in Hera Palace?

405
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,720
Su Ryeon is probably back with vengeance.   

406
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,510
I'm getting the creeps. Something feels really off.

407
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,860
Will Sim Su Ryeon seek us out for a payback?

408
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,860
What did we do wrong?

409
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,340
Chairman Ju was the one who kidnapped, locked up, and tormented her.

410
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,410
Don't be scared!

411
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:45,950
Plus it was ages ago.

412
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,480
- Sheesh!
 - Ooh, come on.

413
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,330
Don't be scared!

414
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,490
Open up, Oh Yun Hui! I know you're in there.

415
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,030
Come out! Come out and talk.

416
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,840
You knew all along that Sim Su Ryeon was alive!

417
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,690
Come out! What on earth are you scheming?

418
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,060
Oh Yun Hui, tell me!

419
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,400
 Cheon Seo Jin 

420
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,620
My beautiful daughter.

421
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,980
Mommy

422
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,350
misses you so much.

423
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:42,640
Eun Byeol, Eun Byeol!

424
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,160
Teacher Jin! Teacher Jin!

425
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,820
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

426
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,550
Eun Byeol!

427
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,950
What happened to her room?

428
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,350
 The number you have dialed cannot be connected— 

429
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,070
Eun Byeol.

430
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,120
Where on earth did she go?

431
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,150
 Your call will be directed to voice... 

432
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,890
Where is Eun Byeol?

433
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,140
I sent her to the swimming pool, so I could clean her room.

434
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,880
There were a lot of books and clothes she didn't need.

435
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,060
For a change of mood, I'm rearranging the furniture in her room as well.

436
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,980
And why are you doing that, Teacher Jin?

437
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:38,050
Who will if I don't? From now on,  I'll take care of Eun Byeol.

438
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:41,510
She needs me more than her mom.

439
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:44,080
Don't you know that yet?

440
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,520
What?

441
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:52,220
You crazy— As of today, you're fired. Get out of my house at once!

442
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,030
Didn't you hear me? Get out before I drag you out!

443
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,150
I think the person who needs to leave is you.

444
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:02,160
Come in.

445
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,450
 Arrest Warrant 

446
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:09,970
Ms. Cheon Seo Jin?

447
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,530
What's this about?

448
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:15,250
I believe I have nothing more  to say if this is about Ju Dan Tae.

449
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,250
By collaborating with Ju Dan Tae,

450
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:22,550
you kidnapped and imprisoned Sim Su Ryeon and Bae Ro Na. Do you admit to these charges?

451
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:25,890
What, kidnapping? I don't know anything about that.

452
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,260
The victims have already testified.

453
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,910
In order to steal Sim Su Ryeon's assets and her husband, did you commit these crimes?

454
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:36,340
What kind of crap is that? I didn't even know Sim Su Ryeon was alive.

455
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,090
Last night,

456
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,690
using the secret pathway, you went to the villa where Sim Su Ryeon was confined.

457
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:55,810
Oh Yun Hui.

458
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:59,760
Was this it? This was your plan?

459
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:11,030
Cheon Seo Jin. You're under arrest for kidnapping, imprisonment, and assault.

460
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,590
Arrest her.

461
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,590
Teacher Jin, where is my Eun Byeol?

462
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:18,400
I need to see Eun Byeol. None of this is true!

463
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,340
Bring my Eun Byeol, right now! Hurry!

464
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:26,000
Don't worry too much about Eun Byeol. I'll look after her as her mother would.

465
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,130
Didn't I tell you Eun Byeol is like a real daughter to me?

466
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:32,010
I asked you where my Eun Byeol is.

467
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,760
Where is she? No. Let go!

468
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,590
Let go!

469
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,850
By the way,

470
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:42,380
Ro Na's mother at Suite 4205 asked me to give this to you.

471
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,160
According to her,  you'll know what it is when you see it.

472
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,400
Seize it.

473
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,190
No. No! Give it back! No!

474
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:52,670
What's your real identity? Are you with Oh Yun Hui?

475
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:57,060
No. Hurry and tell me you are not. Where did you take my Eun Byeol?

476
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,350
Let go! I'm innocent! I never!

477
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,140
Something went wrong! Let go!

478
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,310
Let go! Teacher Jin, where's my Eun Byeol? I didn't do it!

479
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,410
Chairman Ju Dan Tae, you'd better brace yourself.

480
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:15,390
On top of the charges of murdering Na Ae Gyo and kidnapping and imprisoning Sim Su Ryeon,

481
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:19,580
the charge of attempting to kill Bae Ro Na will be added as well.

482
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,660
Sim Su Ryeon is alive?

483
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:29,270
With Bae Ro Na? In my villa of all places?

484
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:37,330
Crazy. This is totally crazy. Who would do something this crazy—

485
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:43,570
 I'm curious about something. When did you quit smoking? 

486
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:45,990
 Didn't I ever tell you? 

487
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,030
 I couldn't stop coughing for  a long time. So I quit. 

488
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,050
 Perhaps, it's because I am seeing you after a long time, 

489
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:01,190
 something about you is not quite familiar. 

490
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:07,480
 When you hold your wine glasses, you always use your left hand.  

491
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,750
 Now I see you're using your right.  

492
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,290
 You used to get mad at me, saying I made you use your right hand like Sim Su Ryeon. 

493
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:18,460
 I've lived all my life imitating Sim Su Ryeon.  

494
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,140
  I guess I've grown used to using my right. 

495
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,160
Sim Su Ryeon?

496
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:32,120
It wasn't Na Ae Gyo, but Sim Su Ryeon.

497
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,780
Who was the person that died then?

498
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,940
 How could you— 

499
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,160
No. No, there's no way.

500
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,350
There's no way. That can't be.

501
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,220
No. No!

502
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,850
No!

503
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,440
That can't be. No!

504
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,650
No! Bring Na Ae Gyo!

505
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:11,310
Where is Na Ae Gyo?

506
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,220
Stay still!

507
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,880
Hold him tight!

508
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,810
Soon an arrest warrant will be issued to you.

509
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:29,060
Even if a divine power has your back, you won't be able to get out of this one.

510
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,150
So give up, Chairman Ju.

511
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,920
Wait.

512
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,410
Just one favor, please.  Let me make one call. Just one call.

513
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,760
You already called up all your lawyers earlier.

514
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,480
Give me back my cell phone before I rip your mouth off!

515
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,320
Or damn it, I will just—

516
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,830
The original district for redevelopment wasn't Cheonsu, but Ohpoong District.

517
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:56,310
Did you really switch which district to be  redeveloped for Ju Dan Tae?
 The nation we build together:  Ultimate growth of Republic of Korea. 

518
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:58,150
Chairman Jeong?

519
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,090
I know your relationship with Ju Dan Tae's wife.
  The Happy Future Party 

520
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:16,170
Was she the reason you were giving him the information?

521
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:21,330
Unfortunately, the person you were seeing wasn't Sim Su Ryeon.

522
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,340
I know that myself.

523
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,010
That she was

524
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:32,840
Na Ae Gyo.

525
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,990
You knew?

526
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:43,640
Since my youth, I admired Chairman Sim of Sim Woon Construction.

527
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,470
and I got a lot of help from him.

528
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:51,910
At first, I met her because I was told she was his daughter.

529
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,640
But I found out soon

530
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,860
that she was a completely different person.

531
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:02,970
Yet, why did you keep seeing her?

532
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:07,720
The woman called Na Ae Gyo

533
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:10,910
was someone I loved.

534
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:17,040
No matter what anyone said about her, my feelings for her were true.

535
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,780
I truly pitied the woman.

536
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,400
I find it hard to understand.

537
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,840
When you already knew who she was, why did you give her the intel?

538
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:37,620
That way she could live.

539
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:44,800
Ju Dan Tae doesn't keep what's useless to him.

540
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,340
He would've killed Na Ae Gyo, too.

541
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:52,310
Since he didn't forgive anyone who betrayed him.

542
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,280
Is that why she tried to flee abroad two years ago?

543
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,380
She wanted to run away from Ju Dan Tae.

544
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,570
I...

545
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:08,120
even  got her a house overseas.

546
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,560
But she didn't show up till the end.

547
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:18,230
When I couldn't get a hold of her anymore, I knew.

548
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,020
That it wasn't Sim Su Ryeon who died,

549
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,920
but it was her.

550
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,940
 Chairman, it's Ju Dan Tae. 
 The Party of Happy Future 

551
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,730
 I'm at the police station right now— Hello? 

552
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:59,650
Now it's time to put everything back to its rightful place.

553
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:05,850
Ju Dan Tae who killed Na Ae Gyo.

554
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:10,740
I can squash him with my own foot.

555
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,010
That's a relief.

556
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:17,780
You won't be safe either, Chairman.

557
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,030
It's something I've been getting ready for.

558
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:24,260
Crazy bastard. Did you just ignore my call?

559
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,650
It wasn't long ago you were messing with Na Ae Gyo.

560
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:29,950
Do you think I'll die alone? Wait and see.

561
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:33,890
It's clear everyone got the whiff of the situation, so give up already.

562
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:38,150
Wait, one more. Let me make just one more call.

563
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,920
Please just this one.

564
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:45,050
 Logan Lee, your father won't be able to ignore me, 

565
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,930
 if he wants to keep the account of 35 trillion won. 

566
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:57,440
She hasn't fully recovered yet. Let her not move too much and be careful.

567
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,460
Okay, I will.

568
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,760
Instead of waiting, why don't you give her a call?

569
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,130
I sent her another message. She'll respond soon.

570
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:24,750
I probably wouldn't know what to say when I see my mom.

571
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:29,420
She's so surprised, I guess she's unable to run.

572
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:48,460
Thanks, Logan.

573
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:53,330
I had a nice talk with Chairman Jeong Du Man.

574
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:57,780
I bet Ju Dan Tae's blood should be drying up by now.

575
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,550
He has all his connections cut off.

576
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:04,940
It's clear that Jeong Du Man truly liked Na Ae Gyo.

577
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,140
Were you aware of that by chance?

578
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:15,520
When I saw Na Ae Gyo at a hotel two years ago, I felt it.

579
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,890
 I'll be right back. 

580
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,340
 Sim Su Ryeon. 

581
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:54,130
 Are you happy with yourself? Impersonating  someone else? 

582
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:56,810
 Are you pleased with youself scamming people for a living? 

583
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:00,770
 This is why bitches with big money are bad luck.  

584
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:05,430
 Is love of money a crime? What, like killing a man? 

585
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:09,910
 You've never been poor your whole life and can't know even if you were dead and born again. 

586
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:16,370
 That most people live like me cheating a little and feeling humiliated a little. 

587
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:24,830
 If you're that sick of money, why do you live rolling with money in that penthouse? 

588
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,200
 Since when did you start impersonating me? 

589
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:32,090
 You use my name to fish for the real-estate information from politicians and develop buildings. 

590
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:36,520
 Did you think you could keep that as a secret forever? Please come to your senses. 

591
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,480
 Even for the sake of Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong, 

592
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,600
 you mustn't cooperate with a man like Ju Dan Tae. 

593
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,050
 Yeah, I sold your name a little. What's the big deal? 

594
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:50,530
 Just because I look like you, I get treated like a human for a change.  

595
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:55,230
 People buy me clothes and fancy food for no other reason than I'm the daughter of Sim Woon Construction. 

596
00:57:55,230 --> 00:58:00,150
 They rattle off their information which I don't ask for, so I use it. Is that a crime? 

597
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,740
 Why can't I live like that? 

598
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:06,220
 I'll tell everything to Chairman Jeong Du Man. 

599
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,820
 That you're a fake.  

600
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:10,680
 Keep off that man. Don't do anything to him! 

601
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,380
 If you harass him, you'll die in my hands for sure.  

602
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,970
 I see that you're capable of feeling sorry. 

603
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:19,620
 I don't get it. Yet why are you helping a man like Ju Dan Tae? 

604
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:24,230
 Do I help Ju Dan Tae? What, are you nuts? 

605
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:27,410
 All I did was get political funds from Ju Dan Tae 

606
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:30,000
 and help  Chairman Jeong Du Man. 

607
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,360
 Because that's the only thing I can do for him. 

608
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:39,860
 Likewise, in order for Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong, my kids, to live in a nice house, 

609
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:43,580
 I have no choice but give what Ju Dan Tae wants. 

610
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:52,080
 Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong aren't happy.  

611
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,250
 They're being mistreated by Ju Dan Tae.  

612
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,620
 Mistreated? 

613
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:05,250
 That son of a bitch. 

614
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:13,430
Na Ae Gyo loved Jeong Du Man.

615
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:18,680
So, the one deceived wasn't Jeong Du Man, but Ju Dan Tae.

616
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,310
Since he believed Na Ae Gyo was on his side till the end.

617
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:29,940
Ju Dan Tae will never give up.

618
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:36,360
He'll threaten anyone to get out of this crisis.

619
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,770
I must find a way to drive him even further into the corner.

620
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,410
Mom.

621
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,200
Is that really you, Mom?

622
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,190
Seok Gyeong.

623
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:09,420
 CAMC  VIP Medical Center 

624
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,230
Is that you, Mom? For real?

625
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,450
Is that really you, my mom?

626
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:20,950
Why did you show up only now?

627
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:24,470
Why did you lie that you were dead?

628
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:30,610
Do you, do you have any idea how much I missed you?

629
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:36,390
Every night, every day, how I missed you.

630
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:39,700
Why didn't you come? Why didn't you?

631
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:47,190
Mom!

632
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:50,350
- I hate you, Mom. 
 - So sorry, I came so late.

633
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,310
There, my girl.

634
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,740
Have you been well, Sweetheart?

635
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,020
Mom, sorry.

636
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,020
So sorry.

637
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:22,140
I've been informed your parents in America are being investigated now. 
 Cheong Ah Medical Center  

638
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:25,500
They were reported for illegally obtaining bone marrow.

639
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,460
By any chance, were you involved in that yourself?

640
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:31,830
I'm going to go back just as soon as things settle down here.

641
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:33,290
I should be investigated.

642
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,510
Come on, Logan.

643
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:40,060
If you commit a crime, it's only natural that you get punished.

644
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:42,930
Don't say anything to Su Ryeon.

645
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:46,290
What's happening with Oh Yun Hui? Can't you contact her yet?

646
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:49,040
No, her cellphone is turned off.

647
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,660
Ro Na didn't get in touch with you either.

648
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:55,790
Oh Yun Hui, what are you trying to do?

649
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:02,120
 Jin Boon Hong 

650
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:04,880
Hello, Teacher Jin?

651
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,350
Did you happen to see Oh Yun Hui today?

652
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:14,010
No, I didn't. But don't you think she naturally went to see Ro Na?

653
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:19,030
I haven't told a thing to Eun Byeol yet.

654
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:23,580
If she knows Ro Na is alive, the shock of it will be too much for her.

655
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,880
Cheon Seo Jin was arrested by the police a minute ago.

656
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,370
She'll probably be sentenced to jail and can't come out for a few years.

657
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:40,090
I guess this is the end even for  Cheon Seo Jin.

658
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:45,150
Thank you for all you've done. Now are you returning your home in America?

659
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,180
Well.

660
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:51,360
I've got to start thinking about that now.

661
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:06,560
My baby, sleeping so soundly.

662
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:12,140
People like them have no right to be the parents of my Eun Byeol.

663
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:16,450
From now on, I'll protect you.

664
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:18,900
I, your mom, will.

665
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,440
Teacher Jin.

666
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,060
Is it already the evening? How many hours did I sleep?

667
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:34,310
I didn't wake you. You were sleeping so soundly.

668
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:41,940
I missed the calls from Mom. What's going on?

669
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:47,550
Your mom was arrested.

670
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:50,000
Sorry? Why Mom?

671
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,700
I'm not sure myself. Apparently, she took part in the murder of Seok Hun's mom two years ago.

672
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,520
Mom did?

673
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,490
Why would my mom do that to the penthouse lady?

674
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:02,980
Where is she now? Mom!

675
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,920
- Mom!
 - Calm down, Eun Byeol.

676
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,970
Mom asked me not to tell you anything.

677
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:13,110
She asked you not to contact her or come to see her.

678
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:16,130
She doesn't want to see you.

679
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:22,540
How can she be a mother when she leaves me without a word?

680
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:27,140
I'm here by your side. I'll never leave you.

681
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:29,940
Really?

682
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,020
You won't leave me?

683
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:38,280
Don't worry. I'll be a mom for you, Eun Byeol.

684
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,960
And a dad, too.

685
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:59,980
My retainer with acquaintance discount is thirty billion won.

686
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:05,260
My law firm will give priority to your case with its top lawyers and get you out.

687
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,460
What kind of bullshit is that?

688
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:11,520
My blood's boiling being framed for murder. On top of that, must I take a hit from you?

689
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,470
I don't care whether you're being framed or not.

690
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:18,180
It's just that I'm low on cash because of my recent large  investments.

691
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,850
If you make an one-time payment, I'll throw in another ten percent discount.

692
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:25,550
And within a week you'll be out and investigated at home with less expenses for you.

693
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:27,340
But your jail time increases.

694
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,260
How lame, who are you trying to fool?

695
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:34,490
I'm Ju Dan Tae. What crime did I commit to cough up thirty billion?

696
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:38,050
Dude, you hit the jackpot.

697
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,640
"Dude?"

698
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,300
Murder, abandoning a corpse, kidnapping, false imprisonment, and to top them all off, embezzlement.

699
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:48,510
You've got no one to defend you besides our law firm. What, will you wait for a public defender?

700
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:53,010
You crazy bastard. You knew it all along, too, didn't you?

701
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:56,850
You teamed up with Sim Su Ryeon and bought off my land!

702
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:59,690
Let go! Let go!

703
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:01,750
Hey, lock the door.

704
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:07,620
This bastard. Apparently, I've been too nice with you.

705
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:11,570
You clearly let it go to your head. You did nothing but a menial job for a living.

706
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:14,410
You dare lay your hands on the precious body of an assemblyman?

707
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:16,340
You bastard.

708
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:19,110
Damn it,  hold him up straight.

709
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:28,060
Try clenching  your teeth.

710
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:30,820
Sit him down.

711
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:37,270
Deposit the money by tomorrow.

712
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:39,330
Do you think I'm crazy?

713
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,970
Don't be scared.

714
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,520
Have you been listening to anything I said the whole time?

715
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:54,320
I went to Na Ae Gyo's villa for the first time today. How many times do I have to tell you?

716
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:58,630
Then why did you have the key to the basement in the villa?

717
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:03,210
I got that from Oh Yun Hui. It's not mine.

718
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:07,620
In the villa, your clothes, bags, shoes,

719
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:11,130
and even your wedding photos all came out.

720
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:13,500
Are you still going to deny?

721
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,900
We even collected your fingerprints and hair everywhere in the villa.

722
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,170
How will you explain this?

723
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:36,240
It's Oh Yun Hui's doing. She schemed  this with Sim Su Ryeon to entrap me.

724
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,760
Get Oh Yun Hui in here. I want to talk to her face to face.

725
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,010
She's behind this soap-opera and fooling you all!

726
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:12,120
 I'm sorry. I promised you that I would fix it. 

727
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,930
 I couldn't keep my promise. 

728
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:16,040
 It's okay. 

729
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:22,130
 It feels like a dream getting my voice back. 

730
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:26,680
 I got my voice back and my first love, too.  

731
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:31,110
 Ro Na is back, too. I'm so happy these days. 

732
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:35,170
 Even though this act of ours will end one day.  

733
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,610
 If you are happy, then so am I. 

734
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,330
 It feels like we're newlyweds. 

735
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:48,880
 Every time I come home, my heart flutters. 

736
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:55,080
 Yun Cheol. After we finish getting our revenge, 

737
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:01,740
 will you stay by my side if I hold on to you? 

738
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:11,900
 I'm just kidding. Don't get scared. 

739
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,970
 Are you that afraid? 

740
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:26,240
 I won't let you go even if you run away. 

741
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:09,670
2001. 2395.

742
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:12,070
2358. Letters for you.

743
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:22,010
  To Ha Yun Cheol 
 (No sender information) 

744
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:38,140
 When thinking of you, I feel you'll probably blame yourself and regret your actions everyday,  so I'm writing down a few words. 

745
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:42,880
 I know you didn't do that to our Ro Na. 

746
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,860
 The real culprit will be caught soon, and you'll be proven of your innocence.  

747
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:51,730
 I was the one who wasn't able to protect Ro Na.  

748
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:58,040
 Don't blame yourself anymore. I'll take on myself the burden of all my crimes. 

749
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,760
Yun Hui.

750
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:09,970
Yun Hui. What are you thinking of doing?

751
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:11,780
Yun Hui.

752
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:22,730
What do you mean Yun Hui disappeared? What are you talking about?

753
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:26,050
I can't get a hold of her. Her phone is off, too.

754
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:30,570
Doesn't she know  Ro Na is alive yet?

755
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:32,900
I didn't tell her that yet.

756
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:38,500
You don't think she'll do something irrational, do you?

757
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:42,210
That can't be. No, never.

758
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:45,480
Su Ryeon. Su Ryeon.

759
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:51,880
Yun Hui.

760
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,190
Yun Hui.

761
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,980
Where are you, Yun Hui?

762
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:12,210
We can finally meet. Why are you doing this? You're scaring me.

763
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:18,540
Yun Hui.

764
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,160
 To sister, Su Ryeon 

765
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,180
 I committed a sin to you that can't be washed away. 

766
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:43,920
 No word or action of mine will absolve me of  what I did. 

767
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,890
 Back then, I wonder 

768
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:56,050
 why I made the choice I made. 

769
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:03,090
 If I hadn't done that horrific deed, 

770
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:06,970
 Ju Dan Tae would've never thought of killing you, 

771
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:10,060
 and Ro Na wouldn't have died either. 

772
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:18,320
 Bae Ro Na 

773
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:24,190
She isn't here either.

774
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:56,510
 I missed you a lot, Su Ryeon, and I liked you very much. 

775
01:13:56,510 --> 01:14:00,820
 Which was why I hated you all the more. I'm sorry. 

776
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,910
 I'll receive my punishment. 

777
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:27,180
 This is the last atonement I can make to you. Goodbye.  

778
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:45,380


779
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,940
Yun Hui.

01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:50,890
 Je Ni's father is  a really scary person.
