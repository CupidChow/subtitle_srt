00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,420
 Episode 2 

2
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,300
 Steady your legs. Look like you're standing on a rope bridge. 

3
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,130
Whose legs are not steady?

4
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,860
Tomorrow is your engagement. How are you doing with the preparation?

5
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,980
Can I help with anything?

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,490
I appreciate your thought. That's enough.

7
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,660
By the way, suite 4502 was just sold.

8
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,560
Really?  Does it mean I get to have a neighbor?

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,170
That's good news.

10
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,550
Anyway, do you know anything about the new neighbor?

11
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,560
Though Oh Yun Hui was found innocent, I don't feel entirely comfortable about the place.

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,930
Did the new neighbor buy the suite without knowing what happened in there?

13
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,030
The neighbor's moving in through Chairman Ju's referral.

14
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,810
An executive at a bio company in the US, I hear.

15
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,250
Is he American then?

16
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,130
If not, a Korean-American?

17
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,020
Korean, I hear.

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,080
The name of the company is JohnBIO.

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,850
Did you just say JohnBIO?

20
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,050
The property value of Hera Place is about to shoot up again.

21
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,110
Anyhow, how do you know about JohnBIO?

22
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,800
Its new line of stamina boosters just went viral.

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,640
My husband is an avid user of its products.

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,960
Results are guaranteed!

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,130
Do you have to rub it in? You know I live alone.

26
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,850
What, are you aggravating me on purpose? A punch in my stomach?

27
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,450
Shall we call it a day?

28
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,230
Okay, shall we?

29
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,690
Tomorrow is my engagement, so I'm in a bit of rush.

30
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,170
Thank you all for coming, members of the press.

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,780
You appear quite tense since this is a big performance at the 20th anniversary ceremony.

32
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,520
At one point, you sang off key.

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,480
I guess I had a dry throat.

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,820
I hope you wouldn't put it in your article.

35
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,610
Of course, I won't.

36
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,000
By the way, are you putting on any special performance for the big event?

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,140
The music industry is looking to you for something new and dynamic.

38
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,890
I won't be disappointing you.

39
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,520
Well then.

40
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,010
- Secretary Do! 
 - Yes.

41
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,510
I dare you to write up another fishy article of yours.

42
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,190
Let's give it another go, starting where I left off.

43
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,360
You're in no condition to sing at High F at the moment.

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,950
You should go home. Tomorrow is your engagement ceremony.

45
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,260
As far as I'm concerned,   my concert comes before my engagement ceremony.

46
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,910
This is the most important performance of my life.

47
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,480
I can do this. Start, but just the end.

48
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,120
♫  Non, rien de rien  ♫

49
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,290
♫  Non, je ne regrette rien  ♫

50
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,810
♫  Ni le bien qu'on m'a fait  ♫

51
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:08,960
♫  Ni le mal, Tout ça m'est bien égal  ♫

52
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,340
♫  Non, rien de rien  ♫

53
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,300
♫  Non, je ne regrette rien  ♫

54
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:25,070
♫  Car ma vie, Car mes joies  ♫

55
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,470
♫  Aujourd'huii  ♫

56
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,660
♫  Ça commence avec toi  ♫

57
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,350
Has everyone been well?

58
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,600
I guess you were in the middle of something.

59
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,460
Why are you all so surprised?

60
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,040
Am I not allowed to be here?

61
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,030
Say hello to my wife.

62
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,790
Oh Yun Hui

63
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,420
It's been a while.

64
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,660
Congratulations on your engagement, Seo Jin.

65
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,240
Wife?

66
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,060
Did I hear that right?

67
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,190
Do you mean you two got married?

68
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,010
Is Oh Yun Hi your wife, Dr. Ha?

69
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,940
You two? Oh, wow.

70
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,870
Anyway, why did you have to cause all this mess, though?

71
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,020
I can't believe you got tangled up with Oh Yun Hui.

72
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,730
That's what I'd say.

73
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,180
Of all women,

74
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,850
why does it have to be a murder suspect?

75
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,910
- Please, Je Ni's mother. 
 - Pardon?

76
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,940
I've got to give it to you. You and your way with words.

77
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,770
But enough. Speak no more.

78
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,230
Picking on what the law already concluded

79
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,340
isn't a courteous thing to do.

80
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,540
How about Ro Na? Didn't she come with you?

81
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,840
I love your dress. Excellent choice.

82
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,430
I don't recall having you invited to my engagement ceremony.

83
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,130
No misunderstandings, please.

84
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,200
I came because I have a business to attend to at the hotel.

85
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,990
Anyhow, I'm glad to see you again.

86
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,790
Dr. Ha, I almost didn't recognize you.

87
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:27,270
I heard that you were doing some research in the US, right?

88
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,610
I realized being a doctor wasn't my thing, after all. So I start a small business of my own.

89
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,280
Did you say a business?

90
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,990
I think business is even less of your thing than being a doctor.

91
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,310
Ouch.

92
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,830
But you didn't  start seeing each other from the days of Hera Palace, did you?

93
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,030
No way.

94
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,870
I don't do such a thing.

95
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,610
I ran into her while I was in America.

96
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,000
Dr. Ha. I have to say you went out of line with what you did.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,840
On a day as good as this, didn't you come to turn things upside down on purpose?

98
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,400
Not at all. I was passing by and stopped in. That's all.

99
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,650
If I interrupted you in any way, I apologize.

100
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,380
See you next time.

101
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,770
Congrats, Eun Byeol. Looks like you've got yourself a new mom.

102
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,490
And she's no other than the infamous celebrity dominating all media.

103
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,900
Stop looking at me that way as I'm welling up with this affection I didn't have for you before.

104
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,010
Don't you feel we're finally getting close?

105
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,470
As they say, misery loves company.

106
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,460
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol, where are you going?

107
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,900
- You, murderer! What audacity to show yourself here!
 - Ju Seok Gyeong!

108
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,210
I don't believe you are innocent.

109
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,310
There's no way Housekeeper Yang killed my mom. It's you!

110
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,430
My mother was kind to you. Why did you kill her?

111
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,640
Why did you?!

112
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,890
I thought everyone already forgot about Sim Su Ryeon.

113
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,240
So I was feeling sad about that.

114
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,560
You just made me feel a whole lot better, Seok Gyeong.

115
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,700
Clearly, you haven't forgotten your mom.

116
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,460
Okay, let's go.

117
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,470
Your sweet talk isn't going to fool me.

118
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,080
You, murderer! You're wicked!

119
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,690
That little thing is just...

120
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,310
Anyhow, how was she able to change herself that much?

121
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,150
You see that, too. Right?

122
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,850
For you,

123
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,560
I thought 7 billion won in alimony was way too much.

124
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,850
Now, wanting to squeeze more out, you showed up in fancy clothes that don't suit you

125
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,430
and flew in a chopper with that pretentiousness that nauseates me.

126
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,740
To provoke Cheon Seo Jin,

127
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,300
if you schemed with your head only to pair up with Oh Yun Hui,

128
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,030
you really disappoint me.

129
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,240
I see you're clawing at straws. But what you did today reaches the limit of my tolerance.

130
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,100
If I see you one more time, I'll just—

131
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,620
Back off!

132
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,090
- Shall we go? 
 - Yes.

133
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,000
 JohnBIO Korea 
 Business Conference  

134
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
You.

135
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,380
What happened?

136
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,450
That bastard should've been eaten up by fish already. Why is he still alive?

137
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,700
They assured me that they took care of him.

138
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,940
You idiot.

139
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,570
Find out if their marriage is legit.

140
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,860
Plus, report to me everything you can about Oh Yun Hui for the last three months.

141
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,150
Do you like it here?

142
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,640
We couldn't go anywhere far this time due to your upcoming concert.

143
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,380
Once it's over, let's go to Italy which you love so much. What do you think?

144
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,950
Our engagement news is already out there.

145
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,660
And I don't see why we should delay merging our companies.

146
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,660
Next week, I'll hire a team of  MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) specialists to look into the transfer—

147
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,380
Why are you in such a hurry?

148
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,790
I'm already overwhelmed with my concert schedules alone. Isn't that why we got engaged, instead of marrying?

149
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,210
I'm worried.

150
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,850
- About what? 
 -  Since earlier all you've been thinking about is Ha Yun Cheol

151
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,470
That's not true.

152
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:34,980
Don't I know you?  I'm trying my best to make you feel better, but you keep thinking about something else.

153
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,820
He ruined our engagement party in front of the VIPs and the people from Hera Palace, too!

154
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,050
I can't figure out what those two are up to.

155
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:53,060
What if Oh Yun Hui was in contact with Logan Lee in America?

156
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,100
Maybe she dragged Ha Yun Cheol into helping her to get back at us.

157
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,390
That's not possible. Logan Lee is confined to his home 24 hours a day.

158
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,260
I've been in contact with his father.

159
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,320
So if he's not invovled in this,

160
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,900
did those two really get married? Nonsense.

161
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,920
They were each other's first love. Perhaps the two losers decided to join forces.

162
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,100
He's not the type who'd jump into a marriage because of Eun Byeol. And there is  a business?

163
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,790
I did give him $10 million after I sold the land in Myeongdong.

164
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,100
Ten millions? When was that?

165
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,890
One year ago.

166
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,760
He wouldn't give up being a doctor. Nor does he have the guts to run a business.

167
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,140
He's not an ambitious person either.

168
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,770
We just got engaged today! When will you stop talking about Ha Yun Cheol?

169
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:44,170
Can't you just leave things to me? Don't you trust me at all?

170
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,380
Sorry, I yelled at you.

171
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,400
Because of Eun Byeol, I think I was a bit stressed, too.

172
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:08,810
Ha Yun Cheol. Oh Yun Hui. They don't matter to me anymore.

173
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,120
I have no reason to see them again.

174
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,360
Are you all right?

175
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,170
Did something happen, Je Ni's mother?

176
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,620
Ms. Cheon. You won't believe this.

177
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,330
The person moving into suite 4502 is Oh Yun Hui!

178
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,720
Ha Yun Cheol and Oh Yun Hui!

179
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,510
What do you mean? That place-

180
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,380
We'll talk again later.

181
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,330
Oh Yun Hui is back.

182
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,950
What?

183
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,500
Back at Hera Palace.

184
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,860
What are you saying?

185
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,410
The person who bought suite 4502 is Ha Yun Cheol!

186
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,740
Ha Yun Cheol? How could the bastard afford Hera-

187
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,980
No way. Can he be JohnBIO?

188
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,880
 JohnBIO KOREA 
Business Conference 

189
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,840
That's absurd!

190
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,060
Why didn't you verify if the whole deal made sense or not? On what basis, did you allow him to  move in?

191
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,880
I had no way of knowing when the contract was signed using a corporate entity.

192
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,990
You should've been more careful. Weren't you keeping an eye on Oh Yun Hui all this time?

193
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,690
Didn't it occur to you that those two could've met?

194
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,300
Do you now expect me to track the comings and goings of your ex-husband? Is that my fault, too?

195
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,150
You're incompetent. Come on, admit it.

196
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,850
If you're that competent, why didn't you lose him in a place where he can never come back?

197
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,760
Don't you know what I did to kick Oh Yun Hui out of Hera Palace?

198
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,470
Not to mention, the dispicable things I had to do to get her out of my sight!

199
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,430
But she's back?

200
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:54,410
This is all because of you. If you hadn't handled the Yang's case as you did, Oh Yun Hui wouldn't have been set free innocent.

201
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,530
The matter is all done and over with! Oh Yun Hui is back, but what can she do?

202
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,730
I had her home and all her money seized.

203
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,550
She's innocent in name only. She can't take off the label of a murderer for the rest of her life.

204
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,920
Didn't you hear? Ha Yun Cheol is the CEO of JohnBIO!

205
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,230
And Oh Yun Hui is now Ha Yun Cheol's wife.

206
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,330
I underestimated Oh Yun Hui.

207
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,420
I need to go.

208
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,540
What can you do by returning now? We barely made this trip possible in our busy schedules.

209
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,380
Do you have to ruin our precious time together because of them?

210
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,810
It's already ruined.

211
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,780
I can't trust you anymore. Going forward, I'll handle things myself.

212
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,670
Damn you, seriously.

213
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,480
Speak.

214
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,030
I found out the reason why Dr. Ha is back in Korea.

215
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,310
He's the real owner of the American start-up, JohnBIO.

216
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,020
How come you're telling me that now, you bastard?

217
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,210
Fuck.

218
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,930
That's crazy. That can't be!

219
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,030
So PowerUp was developed by Ha Yun Cheol?

220
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,310
The CEO of JohnBIO was my third most admired person in the world.

221
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,270
Why does he have to be the loser, Ha Yun Cheol? I'm slighted.

222
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,150
It's as if Professor Ha gained wings after living in America.

223
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,870
His charisma as an entreprenuer was something to behold.

224
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,700
With the future growth, the value of his stocks will climb high.

225
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,220
At this rate, he'll get to the penthouse on 100th floor ahead of us.

226
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,740
That's so true. When Assemblyman, Lee Gyu Jin for Gangnam district barely hangs on to the 50th floor,

227
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,590
how lucky is Oh Yun Hui?

228
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,490
Do you think I can't go up higher because I don't have the money? You know how critical voters are.

229
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,810
And Dr. Ha's style is amazing.

230
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:50,920
He looks so good in his Italian suits.  Was he always so handsome?

231
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:56,310
That's why a man has to meet a right woman. That's how he becomes sweeter and gets better manners, too.

232
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,990
I totally agree. And they're each other's first love, right?

233
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:04,030
If Cheon Seo Jin hadn't gotten in the way, the two would've been happy together in the first place.

234
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,730
Cheon Seo Jin got a good punch in the face this time.

235
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,910
She must be writhing in pain of envy in the stomach.

236
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,470
Why would she be envious? She's about to marry Chairman Ju.

237
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,180
That's not how it is for women. You really don't get us.

238
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,090
This is why you aren't popular with women.

239
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,860
I'm not kidding. When I was little,

240
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,380
- Oh Yun Hui must have saved a nation in her past life.
 - everybody  had to pinch my face telling me how cute I was.

241
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,750
I even framed the award I got for being a cute child

242
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,030
and nailed it on the wall.

243
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,550
What are you doing, Ms. Jin?

244
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,270
Madam! Weren't you on a trip?

245
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,360
I asked what you were doing. Why are you cooking at this hour?

246
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,910
Eun Byeol said she was in charge of bringing snacks tomorrow. So I'm getting some cooking done ahead.

247
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,930
Pizza, spicy rice cakes, tempura.

248
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,660
What time did Eun Byeol go to sleep?

249
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,320
I'm not sure of the exact time.

250
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,370
Does it make sense you don't know such a thing?

251
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,330
Ms. Jin, you and Eun Byeol must think and move like a unit during her senior year in high school.

252
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,600
You're supposed to sleep and wake with her, and check if she's sick and has regular bowel movements and menstral cycle.

253
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Didn't I tell you to watch and anticipate her every move?

254
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,540
Her diet, riding schedules, moods, weight and even her sleeping habits are all your responsibilities.

255
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:45,280
I know it well. And that I should care for her as if she were a porcelain figurine.

256
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,190
I hope you'll be more alert on the job.

257
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,390
You weren't sleeping? It's already past three.

258
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,110
I have some studying left to do.

259
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,090
When did you get back from the trip?

260
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,060
I was worried about you, so I came back.

261
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:11,860
Why would you be worrying about me? I'm fine. You should've  enjoyed your time with him.

262
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,600
My throat felt a little prickly, so I put this on to prevent a cold.

263
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,970
Make sure to take your propolis and vitamins.

264
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,270
Didn't you talk with your dad at all all this time?

265
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,890
You blocked all his calls and e-mails.

266
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,190
Did you know that Dad married Bae Ro Na's mom?

267
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,690
No, not at all.

268
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,540
I'm so humiliated in front of the other kids that I could go crazy.

269
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:06,270
Why Bae Ro Na of all people? He knows how much I hate her.

270
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:12,070
I hope you know now  your dad is of no help to you, not even a little bit.

271
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,870
I already erased Dad from my life.

272
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,890
I'm not going to see Dad even if he tries to contact me.

273
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,600
That's it.

274
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:28,220
Until you climb to the top, I'll give you my full support.

275
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:35,470
I only have you. I'm going to study some more before bed. Get some rest, Mom.

276
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,630
Don't overwork yourself.

277
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,530
Hurry and leave through the rear door.

278
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,950
What are you doing over there?

279
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,450
Did you come here to see Ro Na?

280
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,150
No.

281
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,490
 Handle with care - Frames 

282
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,170
What are you doing? This isn't for you.

283
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,910
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

284
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,160
Hey.

285
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,890
Eun Byeol. Come on.

286
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,960
Eun Byeol. Come on, Eun Byeol.

287
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,320
I can imagine how stunned you must've been.

288
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,170
Do you live here?

289
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,890
At Hera Palace with Bae Ro Na?

290
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,400
Sorry, Eun Byeol. I meant to tell you before I did it, but I had no way to contact you.

291
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:23,440
- You didn't respond to my calls or texts. 
 - You don't have to explain.

292
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,940
Nor should you apologize. We're strangers now.

293
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,790
Strangers? What kind of talk is that?

294
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:33,170
You abandoned me when I needed you the most.

295
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,500
Don't act you know me even when we run into each other.

296
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,500
Eun Byeol, Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

297
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,780
Ms. Cheon, aren't you supposed to be traveling?

298
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,160
Or, are you coming back cutting it short?

299
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,210
That icy look.

300
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,890
Why is my heart pounding like this all of sudden?

301
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,930
Is something exciting about to happen?

302
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,860
Looks like blades of knives flying around at Hera Palace soon.

303
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,030
Oh Yun Hui!

304
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,950
Where the hell are you?

305
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,180
Come out, Oh Yun Hui!

306
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,050
What's up?

307
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,600
Explain yourself.  Why are you here of all places?

308
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,780
Why are you coming back to your old place?

309
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,800
Surely, Hera Palace isn't the only place to live. Or, are you a stalker?

310
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,470
Am I not allowed to be back here?

311
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,410
I used to live here.

312
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,940
Besides, I have the fond memories of the place when I just moved in.

313
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
That's why I'm returning.

314
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,760
Did you forget who died in the penthouse already?

315
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,330
While having nightmares every night won't be enough, you're coming back here to live?

316
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,270
Many residents still remember you getting dragged out of here in handcuffs.

317
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:02,230
- To them, you are still— 
 - You're also one of the residents and still live here.

318
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,300
- In fact, you gave me the courage I needed. 
 - What?

319
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,810
Aren't  you making too much noise in a house that isn't yours? If you have to, go outside.

320
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,380
No way.

321
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:19,050
I'm going to talk right in here. I don't care whether your marriage is legit, or you're putting on a show.

322
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,750
Either way, you can't live here.

323
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,440
And the reason is?

324
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,920
This is where Eun Byeol, your daughter lives.

325
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,300
What damage are you planning to do to her?

326
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,180
How dare do you call yourself a father?

327
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,460
I came back because I care for Eun Byeol.

328
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,470
You cut off all the means of communication between me and her.

329
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,720
So, what else can I do besides hoping to run into her while living in the same building?

330
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,800
We're divorced, but I intend to stay close to Eun Byeol.

331
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,480
Daebak. What a man, what a man he is.

332
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,620
Wow, that masculinity.

333
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,360
What right do you have to see Eun Byeol?

334
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,620
She doesn't want a father.

335
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,120
What keeps you so insecure?

336
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,240
You already have everything.

337
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,120
The chairperson position and the man you coveted,

338
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,180
and now, even Eun Byeol.

339
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,830
You live your life as you do now.

340
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,270
Of course, happily. With Ju Dan Te.

341
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,320
I intend to live my life happily, too.

342
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,910
With Yun Hui.

343
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,570
In fact, I'm grateful to you.

344
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,000
Much of my life has changed since my divorce from you.

345
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,820
Don't act cool.

346
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,250
You staged your comeback of all times after two years of absence at the exact moment of my engagement.

347
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,830
As if that's not enough, you have to live right in front of me.

348
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,330
Forget it if you're doing all this because you still have feelings for me.

349
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,000
I'll never return to you. Over my dead body.

350
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,870
Don't insult my man. Now he isn't yours anymore.

351
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,630
You deserve the humiliation.

352
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,910
Here at Hera Palace,

353
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,390
everyone knows your husband and I were once a husband and a wife.

354
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:02,880
Just as everyone knows you and Ju Dan Te had an affair.

355
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:06,190
Yet you're carrying on quite nicely without paying any attention to how people think of you.

356
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,530
What makes you that impatient. I'm sad to see.

357
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,040
Let us both live good lives as we take care of our families.

358
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,050
You live yours, and I live mine.

359
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:22,540
Well then, can you leave us alone? The movers will get here before the lunch time.

360
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:27,530
Is this yours? Make sure you don't misplace it.

361
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,580
Oh Yun Hui, that was something else.

362
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,910
Damn you, Oh Yun Hui.

363
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,040
Why the hell did you return?

364
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,990
What were you doing all that time?!

365
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,760
Why the hell?

366
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,570
- Say ah. 
 - Ahh.
 CAMC - Cheong Ah Medical Center  

367
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,700
Good.

368
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,270
Now this time, give me five short, 'ah.'

369
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,100
Good.

370
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:08,640
I felt I was losing my breath when I hit high notes lately.

371
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,840
I also feel something's in my throat.

372
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,190
Nothing serious, I hope.

373
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,290
- I advise you to cancel your performance schedules rigth away.
 - Pardon?

374
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,240
The infection in your vocal cords is quite serious.

375
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,440
I also find this ominous-looking lump right here.

376
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,880
if it gets worse, I might have to operate on you.

377
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,640
Did you say an operation? Why would I-?

378
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,970
No, never.

379
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,980
If you let it, you may not be able to have your old voice back.

380
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,740
Cancel the upcoming performance and rest at all costs.

381
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,010
No, I won't. I'll never cancel the show.

382
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,150
The tickets have beenn sold out, and the orchestra for the show came in from overseas.

383
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,340
I can't retract myself from my commitment.

384
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,070
I must be on that stage.

385
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,290
You may end up never being able to sing again.

386
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,600
Are you okay with that?

387
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,000
Today I brought double the snacks I usually do. Can you eat it all?

388
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,990
Of course. I'm really hungry today.

389
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,310
Hey, Yu Je Ni!

390
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,800
Eat as if I'm putting it in my own mouth so that I can imagine how it tastes.

391
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,550
Eat it realistically.

392
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,570
What, do you have talent in eating food as if it isn't delicious at all?

393
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,770
Can you not hear me? Open your mouth wider.

394
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,130
Wow, so greasy.

395
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,610
The level of trans fat in her is going to explode.

396
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,400
Ugh, that's just disgusting.

397
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,420
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

398
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,840
Don't criticize her too meanly  when it looks like she isn't feeling well.

399
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,970
As promised, I'll assume you aren't coming to my mom's solo concert.

400
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,260
Why not? I did everything you told me to. I ate all the food you told me to.

401
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,980
I agreed to go with my mom.

402
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,420
Please let me go, Eun Byeol.

403
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,600
Were you ever our friend? You have another friend.

404
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,860
Do you still keep in touch with that friend?

405
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,800
No, I haven't since then. Not even once.

406
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,110
Really! Trust me.

407
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,960
Make some excuse to your mom and tell her you can't go.

408
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,280
Let's go.

409
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,160
Sir, you have a guest.
 JKING HOLDINGS 

410
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,250
What did you just say?
 JKING HOLDINGS 

411
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,650
I want to get back into Hera Club.

412
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,160
You've become much more shameless since I last saw you.

413
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,760
Your moving in hasn't even been confirmed yet.

414
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,220
And yet, you ask to join Hera Club?

415
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,750
For the sake of the children,

416
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:10,470
their father and mother who divorced their exes getting married again and living in the same building as they do

417
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,240
isn't a thing to do. Don't you think?

418
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,500
You're saying the same thing as Eun Byeol's mother.

419
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,600
Did you two meet by yourselves?

420
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,940
Gritting my teeth, I worked hard and succeeded in America.

421
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,990
Now that I have returned to Korea,

422
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:28,340
Isn't it only natural for me to want to live at Hera Palace, the most valued property in Korea?

423
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,670
The Property Management Board is considering saying no to your request to reside in Hera Palace.

424
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:36,040
It's easy to leave, but it isn't to get back in.

425
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:39,720
That's the kind of place Hera Palace is.

426
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,700
Do you not like me being in the vicinity of  Cheon Seo Jin?

427
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,480
Why?

428
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,890
You two are only engaged, so you are not at ease?

429
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,750
Or maybe there's another reason?

430
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:03,260
Wow, you aren't the Ha Yun Cheol you used to be.

431
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,330
Once you've tasted money, you've lost your mind.

432
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,200
People do change.

433
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,930
 JohnBIO headed towards the world, our precious promise 

434
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,890
Oh, I forgot to give you my business card.

435
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,650
Next time we meet, go ahead and call me CEO Ha. 
  Korean Branch Director, Ha Yun Cheol 

436
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,430
Don't you dare speak casually to me as if we're friends.

437
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,330
CEO Ha.

438
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,410
CEO Ha, if that is what you want,

439
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:47,860
I shall address you as CEO Ha.

440
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,130
If you want to move into Hera Palace that much,

441
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:56,000
how about making a donation? How much do you want to give?

442
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,290
Five millions?

443
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,470
Ten millions?

444
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,110
If you give that much, I'll think about it.

445
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,740
 Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin 

446
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:24,050
 " Soprano Cheon Seo Jin: now is the time to relinquish the crown." by Son Chang Jin. 

447
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,200
 Mr. K, an owner of an Internet music channel uploaded an article entitled, ':Soprano Cheon Seo: Jin:  The Queen Falls"  

448
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,000
 which insinuates a change in her timbre due to deteriorating vocal cords. 

449
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,450
These sons of bitches, how dare did they release the article already?

450
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,970
You mustn't. It's too dangerous.

451
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:38,010
Do what I tell you. It's not impossible.

452
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,760
It hasn't surfaced yet. That's all.

453
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,200
But still...

454
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,790
No one who's made their debut. Find someone fresh.

455
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,430
No one who's too old or young. Pick someone as close to my age as possible.

456
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,520
There is no time. One week is all we have.

457
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,660
Whatever I have to do, I must make

458
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,520
this performance absolutely perfect.

459
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,080
 Dan Tae 

460
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,100
What is it? I'm finishing up work now.

461
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,980
Right now?

462
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,790
That's what I said, yeah.

463
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,990
I'm a little late, aren't I?

464
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,630
We just arrived, too.

465
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,430
The traffic was very bad, wasn't it?

466
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,240
Sometimes, even elevators have traffic.

467
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:42,320
Are we, the Property Management Board going to vote on whether to admit the person into suite 4502?

468
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:47,320
Clearly, you haven't heard yet that we made a decision already.

469
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,380
What do you mean?

470
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,200
JohnBIO. Your ex-husband.

471
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,890
He donated $5 million to Hera Palace.

472
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,610
So there was no need for a vote.

473
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:02,450
Chairman Ju created a useless rule.

474
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:06,530
So based on the donation rule, his request to reside here was automatically granted.

475
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,480
What happened? You didn't say anything to me.

476
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,960
Welcome!

477
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,310
We welcome you.

478
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,870
Everyone was here.

479
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,930
It's an honor to be invited into Hera Club.

480
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:23,250
- Come in! 
 - Take a seat!

481
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,660
We already know each other, so no need for introductions, right?

482
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,500
I'm glad to be moving into Hera Palace.

483
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,800
Oh, you're here, too?

484
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,380
Thank you for welcoming us.

485
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,330
Yun Hui,  you look great.

486
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,790
By the way, I, Gyu Jin became an Assemblyman.

487
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:48,680
I heard. You became such a powerful man while we haven't seen each other. Very impressive.

488
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,610
And Sang Ah, I hope to see more of you from now on.

489
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:54,340
Oh, I welcome it.

490
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,510
Come to our place for dinner this weekend. You can come, right?

491
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,660
I'll prepare fruits and dessert.

492
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,090
I wonder what you like, Yun Hui?

493
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,530
Well, I have an idea.

494
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,850
Why don't we just  invite CEO Ha and his wife back to Hera Club?

495
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,880
It's nice for us, the neighbors, to get along.

496
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,210
That's what I'm saying. It hasn't been the same since Su Ryeon left us.

497
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,430
Since we're all here, how about deciding right now with a show of hands?

498
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,170
- I approve.
 - Me too, of course.

499
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,180
What are you doing right now? Hera Club? Are you all in your right minds?

500
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,630
When did any of us ever get along with Oh Yun Hui?

501
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,880
Don't you know what kind of a woman she is?

502
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,570
 JohnBIO
 CEO 

503
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,540
 What? 

504
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,710
 You're going to give us JohnBio's unlisted stocks? 
 - Yes. 

505
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,640
 To us? Really? 

506
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,980
 I was distributing some to my hard-working employees, then I thought of you two families. 

507
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,690
 We were like family before. 

508
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,360
 The treasures you store in the enterprise Heaven will go on as long as we humans will. 

509
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,220
 Of course, we're interested! 

510
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:07,050
 Then, can I ask you to do me a favor? 

511
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,120
 Of course! Ask me, me! 

512
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,450
 Anything! Just let us know. 

513
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:19,690
I don't know what you're getting from those two in return. But I'm against it.

514
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,360
Hera Club has a reputation to maintain! How can a woman like Oh Yun Hui—

515
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,000
Don't talk about my woman like that.

516
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,540
Everyone in the world knows that Oh Yun Hui is a murderer.

517
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,550
Did you see it yourself?  Her killing someone?

518
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,150
Shouldn't you all be apologizing to her?

519
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,200
For making someone innocent into a murderer.

520
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,120
Yet she didn't resent any of you.  She understood and endured, instead.

521
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,050
Do you know how heartbroken I became watching her suffer?

522
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,510
I can't bear to listen because it brings tears to my eyes.

523
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:53,940
We both decided to begin a fresh start. So bringing up the past to hurt each other

524
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,750
is a thing we should stop.

525
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:01,150
I don't care what you say to me, but I won't stand if you keep harassing my woman.

526
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,150
Stop, please. I'm fine.

527
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,100
I feel more uncomfortable if you keep this up, Honey.

528
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,010
But why should you be uncomfortable?

529
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,080
You have the right to be confident.

530
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,900
That Su Ryeon was killed by Housekeeper Yang.

531
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,310
Didn't Chairman Ju acknowledge?

532
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,090
Fine then.

533
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:25,030
I'll leave Hera Club. That'll take care of things.

534
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,880
Why should you leave? Why?

535
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,620
Let go!

536
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,170
Ms. Cheon. Wait, Ms. Cheon.

537
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,210
Chairman Ju?

538
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,530
Anyway, I've got to hand it to you,

539
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,850
Chairman Ha, you speak so well. You sound like a spokesperson.

540
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,870
Yes, I was so moved.

541
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:56,640
Dr. Ha, were you always such a manly man?

542
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,800
You seem like a completely different person.

543
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,220
Why are you so worked up? This doesn't solve anything, does it?

544
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,010
How can I not be worked up? Didn't you hear what Ha Yun Cheol was saying?

545
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,430
When was he so good at taking care of his wife?

546
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,780
"My wife?"

547
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:19,060
What is this? Are you upset that your loser ex-husband has succeeded in business?

548
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,410
Or, are you upset to see the splendid comeback of Oh Yun Hui, whom you despise?

549
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:28,500
Perhaps both? Your behavior just now is like throwing mud on my face.

550
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,110
'Ah, Cheon Seo Jin still has feelings for Ha Yun Cheol.'

551
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:35,770
'She regrets getting engaged to Ju Dan Tae. She still gets bothered by Oh Yun Hui.'

552
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,940
Those words will be in those gossipy mouths every day.

553
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,360
Are you happy after humiliating me this way?

554
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,250
What are you talking about? What would I regret?

555
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,430
I lost all affection for Ha Yun Cheol a long time ago.

556
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,170
Do you realize that we keep fighting after we got engaged?

557
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:55,140
And who would enjoy that the most? Oh Yun Hui is more dangerous than Ha Yun Cheol.

558
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,510
We have to find out why that woman returned here.

559
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:01,120
Probably because of you and me.

560
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,560
There is one principle I always stick to, when it comes to running business.

561
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,400
Keep your enemies closer.

562
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,730
That way, I can see what my enemy is aiming for.

563
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,980
All Ha Yun Cheol can boast about is his money.

564
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,340
We don't know how he achieved it, but he is not big enough to retain his wealth for long.

565
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:21,450
He said he would give a donation, so I accepted it. So  for now we just need to  use him for what we need.

566
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:26,160
When you attack him as you do, you're only letting him know you're nervous.

567
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,390
Sorry.

568
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:34,340
I've just been sensitive lately preparing for my concert.

569
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,600
Come on, look.

570
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,470
You are so amazing. You can't ever be compared to Oh Yun Hui.

571
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,110
Oh Yun Hui is a bottom dweller.

572
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:50,410
So you should maintain your dignity as you deal with her.

573
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:55,600
I don't know what I'm afraid of.

574
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:03,870
I feel like everything is a mess since Oh Yun Hui returned.

575
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,550
Why did you drink so much?

576
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,340
Are you okay?

577
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:20,220
I'm going to throw my back out carrying someone else's husband.

578
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:26,140
Oh, that was hard. Why is he so heavy?

579
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,520
Is he a rock or what?

580
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,790
Excuse me for a moment. I'll get you some cold drinks.

581
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:38,260
- What would you like to drink? 
 - Anything is fine. Oh, my back.

582
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:44,130
Honey. Dr. Ha gave me something good.

583
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,580
He said it's a new product.

584
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,050
He said the product never fails to perform. So you're in trouble.

585
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:53,390
Thank you so much.

586
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,630
What are you talking about?

587
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:00,050
Your honey is over there—

588
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,790
Is orange juice okay with you?

589
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,510
Orange is the best.

590
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,290
How about taking off-, no, I mean, grinding lots of ice?

591
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:15,070
Just wait for a moment. I'm going to make some nice, cold juice.

592
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,490
It's done.

593
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,160
Look, he's taking off his clothes.

594
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,940
He could catch a cold like that.

595
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,320
Oh Honey, why are you doing this here? Come on.

596
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,130
My Je Ni's waiting. I'll be going now.

597
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:49,460
Drink this before you go.

598
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,910
No thanks. You keep it.

599
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,020
What's with her?

600
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,620
You must be tired. You worked hard with the move.

601
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,290
Do you like our new home?

602
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,500
Yes, I do. I'm so grateful.

603
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,370
As we planned, we succeeded in getting into Hera Club.

604
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:18,170
Now that we have those wedding photos on the wall, we seem like a real married couple.

605
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:23,640
I don't think I could've returned  alone. I was able to, because of you.

606
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:29,110
Cheon Seo Jin and Ju Dan Tae will scheme up anything they can to kick us out of here.

607
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:33,880
If I were scared of them, I wouldn't have come back here at all.

608
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:38,930
Don't worry. They won't be able to mess with you as easily as before.

609
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:40,970
I'll protect you from them.

610
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:47,130
You know that now I am your business partner and your husband.

611
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,940
Stop joking around.

612
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,860
Just don't betray me.

613
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,520
If you betray me again, you are really dead.

614
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:06,620
What about Ro Na? Not yet?

615
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:15,620
I'm sure I'll see her again someday.

616
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:21,960
I will when I have the right to see her.

617
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,360
 Cheong Ah Arts School 

618
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,330
Next.

619
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,340
This isn't it, either. Next.

620
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,410
Next.

621
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,300
This is no good. No. Next.

622
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,930
Next.

623
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,140
Next.

624
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,070
Her tone is flat.

625
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:56,060
Next.

626
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:59,220
No, this is not it. Turn it off right now.

627
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,330
The audience listened to me sing their entire lives.

628
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:04,930
They will notice even when my breathing is off.

629
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,190
How can I fool them with singers who have such mediocre skills?

630
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:12,930
I used a broker and got about ten referrals. These are all of them.

631
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,950
How about canceling the concert before it's too late—

632
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:18,060
No, never.

633
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,910
You're telling me to throw a bait at those who can't wait to see my demise?

634
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,960
They will laugh and giggle with glee.

635
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,150
They'll say Cheon Seo Jin finally falls from her prima-donna status in twenty years.

636
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,560
And that she lost her crown.

637
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,650
The truth is, there was a voice that was the closest to your voice.

638
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:44,670
But she bailed out on me suddenly, so I eliminated her.

639
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:49,410
She refused an offer of a teaching position at Cheong Ah Arts School?

640
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,420
Let's hear it.

641
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:59,770
 Resume: Park Yeong Ran 

642
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,230
This is it.

643
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,560
None of her notes drops flat.

644
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,360
Her breath is extended.

645
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,500
Her personal information?

646
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,000
She is in her late 30s.

647
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,640
She is currently teaching children in Ulsan. 
   Resumé 

648
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,410
She's never debuted as a singer and is a music major from a local college.

649
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:44,450
Hire. Do whatever you have to, and bring her to me.

650
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,560
Contact her immediately.

651
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:00,860
I'm glad you're here. It's nice to meet you.

652
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,040
Don't turn around.

653
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:07,290
Your name?

654
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:11,170
It's Park Yeong Ran. I was such a fan of yours,

655
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:15,480
so I am honored to be able to meet you face-to-face.

656
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,560
I enjoyed your demo. You have an amazing voice.

657
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,370
I'm lacking in many ways, but I'm thrilled

658
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:29,130
to hear my idol complimenting me like this.

659
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:33,690
Why did you refuse the teaching position at Cheong Ah Arts School?

660
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:40,690
It's because my father received surgery, but he's getting worse.

661
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,410
So I didn't think I could move to Seoul for work.

662
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:47,630
For now, I have to stay with him and take care of him.

663
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:52,130
If that's the problem, I can help you.

664
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:59,200
Your father will be treated at Cheong Ah Medical Center by the best doctors.

665
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:04,490
Of course, he will also have a nurse caring for him 24 hours a day.

666
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:08,280
So you won't have to do anything.

667
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,360
Pardon?

668
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,390
That is if you'd do as I request.

669
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:19,880
I'm about to tell you something very important.

670
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,560
No one must know what I am about to tell you.

671
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:27,100
Can you promise me?

672
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:34,700
This will become the most important opportunity of your life, Yeong Ran.

673
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:41,500
I promise. I won't tell anyone.

674
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:51,290
First, please sign this non-disclosure agreement.

675
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:55,590
The first song of the concert is  Una voce poco fa. 

676
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:59,260
You must master that song

677
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:02,290
and send me a demo.

678
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,650
The cooperation between us is the most important thing.

679
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,520

 Don't forget, please.

Seo Jin!

685
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,330
I hear you have a special performance tomorrow for the 20th anniversary. Congratulations.

686
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,500
Well, thanks, whether you mean it or not.

687
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:06,690
- Darling, you must be hungry. 
 - Well, yeah.

688
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,630
 I'm going to make something delicious for you. 

689
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,780
- Isn't it heavy? Put it down.
 - Okay.

690
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,680
I made the stew that you like so much with soybean.

691
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,690
- You did? 
 - Sure, I did.

692
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,240
You're the best.

693
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,820
I'm just happy that you enjoy my cooking.

694
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:24,370
How lucky am I to have found a woman like you?

695
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:38,100
How was I? Natural, I hope.

696
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,060
Do you want to die?

697
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,530
You took such liberty with what you did back there.

698
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:48,090
Well, I couldn't stop myself.

701
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,290
I must've been practicing too hard as this is a major concert.

702
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:30,320
Shall we stop the researsal right here?

703
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,260
This isn't like you. You usually practice a rehearsal just as same as you'd an actual performance.

704
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,750
Will you be really okay with the actual performance?

705
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:38,230
This isn't my first performance, after all. All I need is some rest in my dressing room.

706
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:40,540
Let me just see how I should move about once I'm on the stage.

707
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,250
I trust that I'm in good hands, Director.

708
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,980
As you sing on the stage,

709
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,320
Park Yeong Ran will sing simultaneously from this hidden space.

 Park Yeong Ran - Directly in front of the pipe organ 

711
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,130
 All I need is a little help for this performance so that it'll go without a hitch. 

712
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:16,890
 I can sing the way I did once my vocal cords are restored. 

713
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:20,520
 Nothing will happen.

Again, try a loud noise.

Is there some kind of a problem?

743
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,590
I think it's too hard.

744
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:44,350
At this point, the vocal cords aren't moving.

745
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:58,960
She wants to try it one more time.

746
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,240
We're going to try it again.

747
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,230
Make some noise.

01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:30,480
 I can't believe. That was  perfectly pitched High F. 

755
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,030
Cheon Seo Jin, that was, by far, the best performance of your career. You gave me the chills!

756
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,500
Why didn't you tell me you'd sing on a higher pitch?

757
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,150
You're starting the prime of your vocal career all over again!

758
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,950
What happened? You said nothing about raising the pitch to High F.

759
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:19,150
Unless you pause and  inhale, it's impossible to extend your breath as you did.

760
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:22,400
Did you purposely not show me all your skills before?

761
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:27,360
You must have a reason why you wanted to trick my ears.

762
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:35,570
You...who are you?

763
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:44,040
Who the hell are you?

764
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:53,460
You.

765
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:57,500
How on earth you...

766
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,590
I guess I finally get to say hi the proper way.

767
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,690
