1
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,170


2
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,680
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,350
You did say I was your daughter, too.

4
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,520
Can't a daughter just visit her mom for no reason?

5
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,150
I'm busy.

6
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,430
Why don't you just tell me what you need and leave?

7
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,960
I have a lot of paperwork to go through.

8
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,850
Cheong Ah Arts Festival is coming up in a few days.

9
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,410
I've been waiting for it for a real long time.

10
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,980
Just thinking about what dress I should wear

11
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,490
gets me excited.

12
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,550
I'm sure the announcement was posted.

13
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,900
At today's faculty meeting, it was decided that you are prohibited from entering the competition.

14
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,150
I couldn't do anything on your behalf because the trouble you caused was quite outlandish.

15
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,650
You shouldn't mess with me.

16
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,670
Especially when my dad's asking as a personal favor.

17
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,790
Just let me enter the Festival.

18
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,570
When you're the chairperson, you have more than enough power to do that.

19
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,750
Oh no, did I startle you?

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,350
I was just imitating Eun Byeol.

21
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,020
I hope I don't have to answer you anymore.

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,480
Oh, since you're already doing things for me,

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,370
can you go all out and give me the grand prize too?

24
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,730
- What? 
- If you really love my dad,

25
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,680
shouldn't you do that much for me?

26
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,640
Are you joking with me now?

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,310
You're not talented enough to win that grand prize.

28
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,750
You know already

29
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,240
I can't beat Eun Byeol talent-wise.

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,660
Thus having put aside my shame, I came and am now begging you like this.

31
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,740
Will calling your dad shut your mouth?

32
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,370
Get out! At once.

33
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,170
If you go on that way, you'll only put yourself at a disadvantage.

34
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,220
I know something quite grand, Ahjumma.

35
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,230
What?

36
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,330
When Chairman Cheon Yeong Su passed away,

37
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,280
you were also standing on the stone stairs.

38
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,750
The question is why you just ran away.

39
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,940
That is, without saving your father.

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,460
What did you just say?

41
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,290
You look quite startled.

42
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,870
Then, shall we now resume our conversation from the beginning?

43
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,060
Seok Gyeong, you...

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,050
What ridiculous things are you saying?

45
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,640
Is this how you want to go about entering the Cheong Ah Arts Festival?

46
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,550
No matter what tricks you use, you're already disqualified.

47
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,420
Besides, the victims' parents won't just stand and watch.

48
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,500
Am I doing this for my sake alone?

49
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,540
You can keep your secret, and  it's a win-win for both of us.

50
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,550
Enough with that crazy talk.

51
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,420
Should I cave in and do your bidding because of your foolish threats?

52
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,750
Do you mean you have to see the proof for yourself?

53
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,660
Sure, if that's what you want, I can get it to you.

54
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,430
But you'll feel even worse when you see it for yourself.

55
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,430
I think you should drink some water.

56
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,770
Your face is white as a sheet.

57
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,040
You should take care of your health, right?

58
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,630
That damn thing.

59
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,670
What on earth did she see for her to act like this?

60
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,060
No way, was it Ju Seok Gyeong who sent that threatening text?

61
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,120
No. It can't be her.

62
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,010
If she had that video,

63
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,250
she would've shown it to me right away.

64
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,960
Calm down. Calm down.

65
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,540
 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival Final 
 Drawing of the contestant singing order and times 

66
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,230
 Sang Ah 

67
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,120
Hello?

68
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,690
 Teacher, there's a big problem! 

69
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,660
How could you two  have done this?

70
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,410
What did my Je Ni ever do to you?

71
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,150
As if turning her into an outcast wasn't enough,

72
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,640
you forced her to eat to the point where she threw up, and you recorded and mocked her.

73
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,460
Are you even human?

74
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,490
What are you going to do about  the pain you caused Je Ni?

75
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,930
Please stop!

76
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,580
What do you think you're doing at someone else's home?

77
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,520
You're no better either, Ms. Cheon.

78
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,010
That brat of your daughter made the problem even bigger.

79
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,900
Don't look down on others.

80
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,800
I will never let the kids involved in this incident get away with it.

81
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,660
I'll see to it that they all get their punishment.

82
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,240
I won't let them get away with what they did.

83
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,280
The other kids did nothing wrong, but they happened to be there.

84
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,700
This has all been verified!

85
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,130
So, are you going to pin this all on Seok Gyeong alone?

86
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,560
Why? Is it because one of the perpetrators is your daughter?

87
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,310
"Perpatrators?" That's quite unsettling.

88
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,710
All of those kids are precious students of mine.

89
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,700
Would punishing all the best-behaved students in school put your mind at ease, Je Ni's mom?

90
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,870
You ought to put yourself in the school's position, too.

91
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,260
That's right!

92
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,550
My innocent Min Hyeok says he did what Seok Gyeong made him to do.

93
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,290
Things are unjust for us too.

94
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,010
What kind of bullshit is that?

95
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,960
Je Ni told me everything!

96
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,380
No one stepped up to help her while she was being bullied!

97
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,790
Being a bystander is also violence!

98
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,500
That's why we're allowing Je Ni to go to the final.

99
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,790
That's a given!

100
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,240
I want all those participated in bullying to be reprimanded.

101
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,690
No settlement. No exceptions!

102
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,720
You're so insistent I can't even stick a needle in you.

103
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,470
Think about all the years we've known each other.

104
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,210
Exactly, there's only so much we can take.

105
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,330
We still have to live in the same building and see each other in the future, so meet us halfway.

106
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,110
And yield a little. That's how things ought to be.

107
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,620
For the sake of our relationship in the future,

108
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,860
I'm telling you this.

109
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,200
Ma Ri, don't.

110
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,980
Our relationship...

111
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,000
Relationship, your words are garbage.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,160
Going forward, it's war.

113
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,530
I have no business with the people who messed with my daughter.

114
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,430
I'm blind with fury!

115
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,050
You! If you don't apologize to Je Ni at once,

116
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,050
I'm going to break your legs.

117
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,650
The same goes for you too!

118
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,460
And you! You better come to your senses as well.

119
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,220
You, come here. Come here!

120
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,190
- She's gone. 
- Where?

121
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,530
She's a total gangster!

122
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,770
Fine! This is war!

123
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,200
Goodness gracious.

124
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,530
My Min Hyeok, you're all grown up now.

125
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,870
Son, work hard for the Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

126
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,160
As your father, I will take care of this —

127
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,430
Shut up. Look at your face.

128
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,150
I am so embarrassed.

129
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,230
When you became an assemblyman,  I thought you were the man of ultimate influence.

130
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,770
Kang Ma Ri, how dare you

131
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,880
treat me, Lee Gyu Jin, like a pushover?

132
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,470
- This is Gyu Jin. 
- Yes, Hyungnim, no, I mean Assemblyman. Speaking.

133
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,810
Someone named Kang Ma Ri lives in Suite 4503 in my building. Report all that you can about her.

134
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,450
I understand. Consider it done.

135
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,200
Now, all I need is Eun Byeol's cell phone.

136
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,740
Do you ever think?

137
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,640
I heard you're on probation.

138
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,590
Something like school violence will go on your record.

139
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,520
That'll end you even before you can write an application for a college.

140
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,600
How much money have I poured into that school?

141
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,410
With that kind of money, I can build a building in Cheongdam-dong.

142
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,760
Why does everyone single me out to blame?

143
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,160
The daughter of your fancy fiancée did more and worse

144
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,490
to Je Ni than anybody when nobody was looking!

145
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,850
Then you shouldn't have been caught either!

146
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,230
How is it that there isn't a thing you can do better than Eun Byeol?

147
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,980
Your family is well-to-do, and I get you the best of teachers.

148
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,870
And I spend my money to do everything for you.

149
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,040
And can't you even beat a girl like her?

150
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,560
I was born without the brains. What am I supposed to do about that?

151
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,510
I guess my birth mother was dull.

152
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,420
You little!

153
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,630
It's not fair for me to get punished alone.

154
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,760
That sly bitch is hiding behind her mother.

155
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,360
I won't go down alone.

156
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,240
Just go, study abroad.

157
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,970
I never expected you to actually win the grand prize.

158
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,740
Why would I study abroad, when I can go to Seoul National University?

159
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,150
Instead of getting rejected and embarrased by applying for a school that's ridiculously out of your reach,

160
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,510
just go to any country and get a diploma.

161
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,440
That'll be a whole lot cheaper than getting you the SAT answer keys.

162
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,680
I seriously don't need your help anymore.

163
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,800
I'll compete in the CAA Festival and make the grand prize mine at all costs.

164
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,640
Just make good on your promise and let me move out.

165
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,250
Ju Seok Gyeong! Get over here, at this instant!

166
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,950
Ju Seok Gyeong!

167
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,460
I'll go and talk to her.

168
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,130
What's the point of bringing the mess this far? What's there to gain by making Father mad?

169
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,090
- I told you to be a little more patient. Then I can take you— 
 - Stop acting like you care about me.

170
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,810
Aren't you disgusted at the sight of Bae Ro Na ever since her return to school?

171
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,210
Stop insisting.  I told you Ro Na's mom wasn't the murderer.

172
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,410
Do you believe that?

173
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,750
Do you really think Housekeeper Yang killed Mom?

174
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,360
That's...

175
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,380
 I didn't do this for money. 

176
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,700
 Keep it. You've just become a valuable person to me. 

177
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,260
I'm certain Ro Na's mom isn't the murderer.

178
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,710
So don't take your guilt out on someone else.

179
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,810
You're supposed to be my brother. How could you say that?

180
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,830
You're just like Bae Ro Na.

181
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,150
 From now on, 

182
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,050
 I have nothing to lose nor owe anything to you. 

183
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,610
 You just gave us a single apartment. 

184
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,550
 Should I just reveal everything that you did to my husband? 

185
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,720
 It'll be best if you don't bring that up, Ms. Kang Ma Ri. 

186
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,510
 The reason my husband went to prison in your place 

187
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,420
 was because of Je Ni. 

188
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,880
 But you dared to tear my child's heart into pieces? 

189
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,100
 Be prepared. Your daughter Ju Seok Gyeong, 

190
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,600
 might die in my hands.  

191
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,890
I'm told Yoo Dong Pil is in prison and stays out of trouble more or less.

192
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,580
He doesn't seem to know what happened to his daughter yet.

193
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,100
When did you say he would be released?

194
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,940
In about two more months.

195
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,670
Two months, I see.

196
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,380
I can't let you out so soon,

197
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,720
when your wife dared to cross Ju Dan Te.

198
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,060
Why did you call us here? Our kids have to go to school. If you're trying to ruin the morning for us—

199
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,230
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,070
Je Ni. And Ro Na.

201
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,090
I want to sincerely apologize to you two.

202
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,630
Stop acting. It won't work.

203
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,840
I know. I know that what I did was wrong.

204
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,290
But after what happened to my mom,

205
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,180
it's been so hard.

206
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:38,310
I wasn't ready to accept my mom's death, but then my dad suddenly got engaged.

207
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:44,090
I was forced to be family with Eun Byeol. I couldn't handle all that.

208
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,550
Do you think that'll excuse what you did?

209
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,870
Just because you're having a hard time, does that mean you can take it out on others?

210
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,740
When I still hated Ro Na and her mother,

211
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,010
I got upset knowing Je Ni was getting close to Ro Na.

212
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,170
I'm sorry. This won't happen again.

213
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,790
Please forgive me just this once.

214
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,110
I'll accept the punishment from the disciplinary committee.

215
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,060
It's my dream to stand on the stage in the final.

216
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,170
Just that, just that, I beg of you.

217
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,990
You don't think that brat  Seok Gyeong  was being sincere, do you?

218
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,110
It was obvious she was acting.

219
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,530
The haughty look in her eyes still wasn't that of someone who was truly sorry.

220
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,360
Still, despite her pride, she got down on her knees.

221
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,360
She's still a kid.

222
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,960
Don't you think we should give her another chance?

223
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,740
No. I can't forgive her.

224
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,270
Did she say her dream was to participate in the CAA Festival?

225
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,280
I'm more adamant  than ever that I can't forgive her.

226
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,290
Losing something the most precious for her should be the only proper punishment.

227
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,970
At least,

228
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,040
don't you think you should apologize?

229
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,590
For what Seok Gyeong did to my Ro Na.

230
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,350
The Office of Education seems to be looking into the matter quite seriously.

231
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:38,060
Do whatever you like. By means of force or lawsuit,  there's no way you'll make me lower my head to you.

232
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,510
If the late Su Ryeon saw the state Seok Gyeong is in now,

233
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,520
what do you think she would say?

234
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,110
Shame on you. How dare you utter her name?

235
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,990
It wasn't long ago you begged me to get rid of her.

236
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,680
Is that why

237
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,080
you killed her? For me?

238
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,670
What?

239
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,500
Never mind.

240
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,960
I don't want to argue over what happened in the past.

241
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,920
Since it's true that I wanted Su Ryeon to go away.

242
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,510
What's your reason for coming back?

243
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,130
To get your payback for what you were put through because of me?

244
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,620
Do you think that's actually possible?

245
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,060
Apparently, you're taking me too lightly.

246
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,990
Don't waste your time and leave with Ha Yoon Cheol, unless your daughter has two lives.

247
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,190
Thanks for worrying about me, but

248
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,180
shouldn't you look after your company before anything else?

249
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,480
You company is rumored to have money problems and your stocks plunge daily.

250
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,680
There was an article in the business newspaper.

251
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,170
It said your stocks are guaranteed to flop.

252
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,730
And it looks as though the merger with Cheong Ah Foundation isn't happening either.

253
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,640
The rumor has it that you and Seo Jin aren't getting along. What's more, your money line may easily get blocked.

254
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,150
That'll put you under great pressure for funds.

255
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,470
Will you be okay?

256
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,470
I'll decline your unsolicited advice.

257
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,840
Today alone, five percent has already gone out.

258
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,410
Who the hell leaked our money problems?

259
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,910
It's not the bank. I believe it's due to Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin's scandal—

260
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,860
If we don't announce the merger soon, my company may fall.

261
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,560
 Confidentiality Agreement 
Signed by Park Yeong Ran and Cheon Seo Jin 

262
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,430
Looks like I'll have to use this hidden card, after all.

263
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,810
Are you getting ready to give me the grand prize?

264
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,590
You should've engraved my name on the trophy by now.

265
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,350
There's limit to how much you can act up.

266
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,290
Oh, don't worry.

267
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:27,410
I'll send you the evidence you want soon enough.

268
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,720
You can look forward to it.

269
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,120
What the heck does she have that she's acting like that?

270
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,350
-Are you here? 
-Yes.

271
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,990
Long time no see, Seo Yeong.

272
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,130
Yeah. We came without notice. You seem really busy.

273
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,600
I was in the auditorium because of the CAA Festival. What brought you here today?

274
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,620
I saw your performance at the 20th anniversary concert and was moved. My belated congratulations to you.

275
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,170
No need. We're a family.

276
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,720
Especially the first song.

277
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,250
It was so perfect that I wondered if it was really you.

278
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,030
If your father were alive, how happy would  he be?

279
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,520
What a shame.

280
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,540
What are you trying to say?

281
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,640
How absurd.

282
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,220
Open it.

283
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,460
 Confidentiality Agreement 
How dare you use a shadow singer for such an important concert?

284
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,670
I was beyond shocked.

285
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,630
Did Korea's best vocalist fool and con the entire nation?
 Contract between Cheon Seo Jin and Park Yeong Ran 

286
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,000
You really give me the creeps.

287
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,760
This.

288
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,590
Where did you get it?

289
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,720
The Foundation's ethics committee was contacted anonymously.

290
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,850
What kind of embarrassment is this to our family?

291
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,710
Any idea what I had to do to quiet the members of the ethics committee?

292
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,900
I doubt you kept them quiet for my sake.

293
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,330
If you were my mom,

294
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,440
you would've asked how my vocal condition was and where and how I hurt

295
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,630
before anything else.

296
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,300
If you were my real mother.

297
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,420
Isn't that so?

298
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,240
What?

299
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,000
Resign from the chairperson's position, before you face any more embarrassment.

300
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,080
Turn over the Foundation to Seo Yeong.

301
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,170
What did you just say?

302
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,150
If this gets out, did you ever think about what that would do to the Foundation?

303
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:48,160
The CAA Foundation your father worked so hard to build will crumble in an instant!

304
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,360
Was that what this is all about?

305
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:56,360
Taking away the position from your stepdaughter and giving it to the one you bore?

306
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,560
I bet that would make you satisfied.

307
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,380
Since Father isn't here, you won't need to act like a mother anymore!

308
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,330
You awful brat. Where did you learn to speak like that?

309
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:13,430
I  fed, clothed, and raised you for 35 years.  Have you even, once, acknowledged me as your mother?

310
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,940
What mother in the world would like a daughter who won't open her heart even once?

311
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,260
You're the one who made me like that, Mother.

312
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,020
Who tried so hard all the time to make my father hate me?

313
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,410
Resign. Before I blow this up myself.

314
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,020
Also sell Cheong Ah Arts Center as soon as it's completed.

315
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,890
How much of the Foundation money was wasted in building that useless opera theater!

316
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,360
That was late Father's lifelong dream.

317
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,490
No matter what, I'm going to run it.

318
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,620
I'm going to stop it. I have thirty percent of the foundation shares.

319
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,760
Forget the thought that nothing can be done without you.

320
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,280
Oh Yun Hui.

321
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,070
Did you have to expose it?

322
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,170
 It maintains high percentage of moisture... 

323
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,190
Why are they rushing me like this

324
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,880
when I feel so troubled?  Besides, I have no appointments today.

325
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,020
She said she came through a referral.

326
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,530
She wanted to get the massage specifically from you and asked me to give this to you.

327
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,600
She's waiting, so hurry and get ready.

328
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,060
She's quite a spender and paid the membership in cash.

329
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,980
- Is she already inside? 
 - Yes.

330
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,400
 Ma Ri Sauna 

331
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,670
Hello.

332
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm wondering who you are.

333
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,140
I normally don't take same day reservations for anyone.

334
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,910
But today I'll make an exception because the owner herself referred you to me.

335
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:30,770
The reason why you came home with the fresh scent of soap every time

336
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,250
was this,  Ms. Kang Ma Ri. Huh?

337
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,100
I thought you were having an affair, but this is way more shocking!

338
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:43,200
You are a first for Hera Palace!

339
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,030
How on earth did you—

340
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,580
Just hurry up and get dressed.

341
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:57,560
Our assemblyman doesn't like waiting.

342
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,740
Sorry.

343
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,800
 Bathhouse 

344
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,960
Honey!

345
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,800
What is this?

346
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,370
Now that I see you like this, I have to say you look perfect.

347
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:35,290
Honestly, I couldn't believe it when my aide told me Je Ni's mom is a sauna attendant.

348
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:40,030
I must say one should wear clothes that complement one's body.

349
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:43,330
Doesn't she look fabulous, Honey?

350
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,930
I'll say.

351
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,060
The reason why she was so bad at bragging at Hera Palace

352
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,850
has been this.

353
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,340
So, what?

354
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,180
I have nothing to be embarrassed about in front of you.

355
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,780
I swear to the heavens that I've lived my life cleaner than you two ever have.

356
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,300
I earned money by my own toil and sweat.

357
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,570
There's no reason for me to be ashamed in front of you.

358
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:10,100
Then why have you deceived us so completely?

359
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,400
- Well that's,— 
 - It's because of your child, what else would it be?

360
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,100
But you know, this sauna is too run down.

361
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,870
When her mom works like a dog at a place like this,

362
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,540
Je Ni will have to study real hard.

363
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,480
That's why I, Gyu Jin ordered my aide

364
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,300
and sent a few photos to your house for Je Ni to see.

365
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,270
It's time for her to grow up.

366
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,650
What, what?

367
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,570
Shouldn't you be scrubbing? Go Ttaemiri, Ahjumma?  (TN Ttaemiri:  professional scrubber at bathhouse) 

368
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,900
How hilarious.

369
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,700
My stomach!

370
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,580
Ro Na!

371
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,170
Are you coming home now? Nothing happened at school, right?

372
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:58,000
Can Ro Na and I get ready for finals together?

373
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,400
I'm too anxious to do it by myself.

374
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,740
Of course, you can.

375
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,630
Let's go. I'll make tteokboki  (spicy rice cakes) for you.

376
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,830
Sorry.

377
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,510
Ow, you have a rock-hard head.

378
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,070
I'm sorry.

379
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,960
It's okay.

380
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,710
Excuse me, but who are you?

381
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,150
It's a secret.

382
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,460
A bathhouse?

383
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,710
Who is this?

384
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,160
Oh, this must have gone to the wrong place. It was meant for me.

385
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,720
Je Ni!

386
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,250
Je Ni! Are you okay?

387
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,600
Did anyone come looking for you?

388
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,250
Mom! Why do you look like this?

389
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,210
Where are you coming from?

390
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,670
I was at the sauna and came here in a hurry.

391
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,250
I forgot I had plans for dinner.

392
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,480
Do you want to go out and have dinner with Je Ni? I'll make tteokboki for you next time.

393
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,820
Mom, can I?

394
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,510
Of course. Sure.

395
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,010
Okay then, I'll see you later.

396
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,730
- Let's go, Ro Na. 
 - See you later.

397
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,230
Are you looking for this?

398
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,850
Gosh.

399
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,310
Lee Gyu Jin, this bastard. Is this why you became an assemblyman?

400
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,030
Who is it?

401
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,140
 Dubai 

402
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,760
Yes, Prison Officer.

403
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,920
Why? Did something happen to my husband?

404
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,590
What?

405
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,540
What do you mean?

406
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,060
Are you telling me he's hurt?

407
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,270
There was a fist fight amongst the inmates.

408
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,260
Yoo Dong Pil is in the hospital because he was beaten a lot.

409
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,380
Did you say he got into a fight?

410
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,360
What happened?

411
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,540
I know he is on guard and very careful with his conduct now.

412
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,990
Something like this has never happened before.

413
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,340
The incident is under investigation, and I just wanted you to know for now.

414
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,920
With his release coming up, you're supposed to watch out for even falling leaves.

415
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,810
If something goes wrong, his release could be delayed.

416
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,420
Hello? Prison Officer? Sir?

417
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,920
What's going on?

418
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,690
Who did he get into fight with-

419
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,190
Is it, by chance, Ju Dan Tae?

420
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:14,160
This son of a-

421
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,290
Did you have to expose it this way?

422
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,500
Did you have to bring me down with your god-damn shadowsinging?

423
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,670
What are you talking about? Say it in a way I can understand.

424
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,770
Why of all people did it have to be my mom?

425
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,030
Why, my little sister?

426
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:34,140
You clearly thought using them would make me feel most miserable,

427
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,920
but whatever you do, I won't let anyone take CAA School away from me.

428
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,090
I won't give anyone the chairperson's position.

429
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,930
I don't know what's going on here,

430
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:53,760
but are you going to keep coming to me every time something in  your life goes wrong?

431
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,250
Sorry to tell you, but I haven't even started a thing.

432
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,850
You must have a lot of enemies besides me, Cheon Seo Jin.

433
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,980
Shut up.

434
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,410
What do you think you're doing?

435
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,920
Get out of my house. I thought I warned you.

436
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,850
If you touch my wife, I won't just stand and watch.

437
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,570
You know too, don't you? What this bitch Oh Yun Hui has been doing.

438
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:24,610
When you live with her, you must know too.

439
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,840
How much did you ridicule me? Was it so much fun?

440
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,600
Did you two have fun laughing together, you bastard!

441
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,930
What are you accusing me of knowing?

442
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,510
Regardless how much you hate me,

443
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,630
how dare you to stab me in the back with Oh Yun Hui?

444
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,360
You know

445
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,320
how much Cheong Ah Arts Foundation means to me.

446
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,420
Are you okay? Did something happen between you two?

447
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,600
No, nothing. There must've been a misunderstanding.

448
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,800
We can't let her be like this anymore. She keeps doing it because you let her every time.

449
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,000
Don't do anything.

450
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,370
It'll only tire us if you cause problems for nothing.

451
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,620
Don't let her abuse you anymore. If she provokes you, you get right back at her!

452
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,090
The man who can protect you

453
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,740
is right here. You're not alone here anymore.

454
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,710
It's nothing. Stop overreacting.

455
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,220
I have dinner ready. I need to step out for a bit.

456
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,490
I won't be long.

457
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,550
Come back safely.

458
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,930
Why was it so hard to get a hold of you? I was so worried.

459
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,440
Why would you be worried?

460
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,680
Your mom contacted me.

461
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:21,180
I heard you're resigning from the chairperson's position at the Foundation.

462
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,450
Is that true?

463
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,530
Is that what my mother said? To you?

464
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:40,310
What's wrong?  Is there a problem I'm not aware of?

465
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,460
Tell me so that I can help you.

466
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,640
Cheong Ah Arts Center.

467
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,760
It's progressing well, right?

468
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,950
Of course.

469
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,300
It's going to be the world's best opera house as you've been dreaming of.

470
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,940
Expedite the merging.

471
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,260
Is it because of your mother?

472
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,770
Don't rush it. It's an important matter, so you should think about it carefully.

473
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,380
No, I thought about it long enough.

474
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,650
There's no reason to delay it further.

475
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,130
Announce the company merger and acquisition.

476
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,170
I can give the department and hotel businesses to my mother and Seo Yeong.

477
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,580
I just need the Cheong Ah Arts Center.

478
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:47,770
I'll leave the procedure of merging the two companies up to you.

479
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,380
If that's what you think,  I'll get things started.

480
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,650
It's going to cause a huge impact on the stock market.

481
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:59,960
In all probability, far more than you can imagine.

482
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,740
My desire for money was already fulfilled a long time ago.

483
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,300
Well, about that.

484
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,630
Is it something that can really be fulfilled even if you think you have?

485
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,830
Even if you live in a penthouse on the 100th floor,

486
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:22,110
the human nature in you makes you want to soar higher and higher to the top.

487
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,600
Isn't that why you chose me, to begin with?

488
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,730
Let's not delay our marriage any longer.

489
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,490
Move into the penthouse as soon as the CAA Festival is over.

490
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,840
Your daughter, Seok Gyeong.

491
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,400
Will I be able to handle her?

492
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,080
Our getting together—

493
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,010
What about Seok Gyeong?

494
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,380
What did she do this time?

495
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,560
No, nothing. We'll talk later.

496
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,870
Sorry, but will you let me be alone today? I want to get some rest.

497
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,340
Sure.

498
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,770
 Ju Dan Tae Village 

499
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:31,920
Cheon Seo Jin  is going to help me realize my dream.

500
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,060
Now all I need to do is find that brat, Ju Hae In.

501
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,620
Then this land will be mine as well.

502
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,310
If it weren't for that bitch, Sim Su Ryeon, this land would've been mine already.

503
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,640
Stop drinking.

504
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,460
Do you want to get drunk in front of Je Ni?

505
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,500
Don't stop me.

506
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,970
I'm going to die after drinking this today. Wait, no.

507
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,810
Rather, we all are going to die together.

508
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,300
Because you are embarrassed about working at a bathhouse?

509
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:19,680
Did you see the pictures? You saw them!

510
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,370
Why did you? Why?

511
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,730
What's wrong with scrubbing other people's backs?

512
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,280
It's not like you stole things.

513
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,000
Are you making fun of me right now?

514
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,900
The people who're threatening you with a thing like that  should be embarrased.

515
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,970
What did you do that's so shameful, Je Ni's mom?

516
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,860
It's Min Hyeok's family, isn't it? They sent those pictures, right?

517
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:41,480
That rotten bastard, while he's blind to the wrong his kid did,

518
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,840
he threatens people with their weaknesses.

519
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,330
Why doesn't a thunderbolt strike him in the head?

520
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,660
There's no use whining.

521
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,230
If you have no power, you're made to suffer.

522
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,770
I was made to suffer a lot as well.

523
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,080
By the people from Hera Palace.

524
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:10,010
I'm sure you find it annoying, seeing me apologizing only now that I'm in this situation.

525
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,650
But I have to say I, too, was a crazy bitch.

526
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,550
Not all people are like that.

527
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:21,830
But I had no idea until I was forced to go through something like this myself.

528
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,130
If you feel raw about it, you can sue me.

529
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,270
You even apologize in the way I know you to be.

530
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,700
There's no definitive evidence in this school violence case

531
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:42,080
so if you persist in it,  you could get hurt instead.

532
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,040
How about settling the case at this point?

533
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:51,110
I know that too.  That I am being stubborn.

534
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:56,670
But till my child got all messed up,

535
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,010
I, her own mother didn't know a thing.

536
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,950
I can't forgive myself for that.

537
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,160
I feel so sorry.

538
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,540
Grant one

539
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,700
but in its place, we must take one.

540
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,780
What will that be?

541
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,300
I stopped by, so I can go to school with Eun Byeol.

542
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,610
Where is she?

543
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,710
She's washing up right now.

544
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,070
Then, I'll wait for her.

545
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:38,550
It might take her a few minutes. Have a seat and wait.

546
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,930
What, why isn't it here?

547
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,000
Did she take it with her to the bathroom?

548
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,600
Eun Byeol, aren't you ready yet?

549
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,140
What are you doing in here?

550
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,260
That hurts! I got it, so let go.

551
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,710
What are you up to? Why are you in a room when its owner isn't around?

552
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,490
I came by, so I could go to school with Eun Byeol.

553
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,020
Why can't you believe what I'm saying?

554
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,090
Since when did you start caring about Eun Byeol so much?

555
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,710
Mom, is something going on?

556
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,250
Come out!

557
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,480
Come on, Lady. You  know you're overreacting, right?

558
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,770
What happened to your denying it all?

559
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,030
By acting like this, you'll get caught.

560
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,410
Ju Seok Gyeong.

561
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:59,200
Maybe I came too early. I'll see you at school!

562
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,940
Mom, what's going on?

563
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,710
Keep your distance from Seok Gyeong.

564
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:13,230
Don't pay any attention if she talks nonsense. Understand?

565
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,620
Okay, got it.

566
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,980
Ha Eun Byeol, just a sec. Stop.

567
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,720
Do you know?

568
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,010
That Seok Hun and Ro Na are seeing each other again.

569
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,230
What? Who told you that?

570
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:40,030
I saw them together last night.

571
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,720
By the looks of them together last night, Ju Seok Hun

572
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,720
is not over Bae Ro Na yet.

573
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,280
Is there anything you know?

574
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,260
No,  not at all.

575
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,630
Let go! What are you doing?

576
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,540
Let go of me!

577
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,980
Stop flirting with Seok Hun.

578
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,010
Do you and your mom have no conscience?

579
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:16,170
- Is stealing someone else's man your hobby? 
 - Watch what you're saying.

580
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,940
What flirting?

581
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,080
Seok Hun is my boyfriend.

582
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,690
We're dating.

583
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,930
So don't talk to him.

584
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:27,840
Don't look at him or even be seen by him. I get annoyed.

585
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,450
But your mom and Seok Hun's dad are engaged.

586
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,200
How could you two be dating?

587
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,600
I don't want to explain our private lives to a thing like you.

588
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,430
There, I gave you a warning loud and clear.

589
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,470
If I catch you with Seok Hun one more time, you and I

590
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,160
will go to hell.

591
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,990
Got it?

592
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,780
Are the two dating?

593
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,560
That's a lie. It makes no sense.

594
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,610
What did you just say?

595
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,730
I'll end the school violence case right here.

596
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,830
Let's wrap it up here by putting Seok Gyeong on probation.

597
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,950
That's what you should've said from the start, Ms. Kang Ma Ri.

598
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,770
Have you finally come to your senses?

599
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,780
And Seok Gyeong

600
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,840
should be allowed to participate in the Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

601
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,060
Why did you have a sudden change of heart?

602
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,250
I'll say. Isn't it better for Je Ni if Seok Gyeong can't participate?

603
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,790
Getting another competitor  for no reason would only lower her rank.

604
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,830
My Je Ni can easily beat someone like Seok Gyeong.

605
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:45,770
I just want to show that to everyone.

606
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,430
Besides, I've received something similar to an apology.

607
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:54,870
Anyway, thank you for making a good decision.

608
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,620
You're in agreement too, right, Ro Na's Mom?

609
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,060
Yes, I agree.

610
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,110
- But under one condition. 
  - What is it?

611
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:07,470
I will join the parent committee of CAAHS.

612
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,470
As a parent member,

613
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:14,590
I will have the right to observe the children's life in school and to watch the CCTVs.

614
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:19,280
Because there's no guarantee that the kids won't bully Ro Na again, and that makes me nervous.

615
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,060
Are you saying you'll be surveiling them?

616
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,960
Shouldn't I protect my own child?

617
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,190
In that same vein, please let the parent committee be in charge

618
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,170
of choosing the judges for the upcoming CAA Festival.

619
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:36,240
That is the school's exclusive prerogative.

620
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,900
So hasn't it been corrupt all of this time?

621
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,580
There was even an awarding of the grand prize that made no sense.

622
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,680
Obviously, you don't mince your words.

623
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,770
It's a fact that fairness has always been questioned.

624
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,740
If you want to avoid suspicion,

625
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,810
all you have to do is follow the recommendation of Ro Na's mom.

626
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,970
I'm for it.

627
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,730
What about you, Go Sang Ah?

628
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,940
I have no reason to be against it.

629
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,990
Subject to the approval of the Office of Education,

630
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:13,570
I'll let my wish to compromise be known.

631
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,850
What would you like to do?

632
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,360
 Seven days before the Cheong Ah Arts Festival Final 

633
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:39,570
♫ Je veux vivre

634
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:43,620
♫ dan ce réve

635
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,140
♫ E tu che sai

636
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,970
♫  che memori e ti struggi  ♫

637
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,480
♫ Da me tanto ri—

638
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,940
You can't eat salty food.

639
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,320
You need to take in all the five major nutrients in balance.

640
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,040
You need to eat enough so you can sing with the strength of your belly. Open wide.

641
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:10,480
♫ Wenn ich lache, hahaha!

642
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,160
♫ Ja, sehr komisch, hahaha

643
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,430
No, no, no. Let's wrap this around your neck.

644
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,320
Again!  Is that all you can do with your voice?

645
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,390
I've told you you must breathe lower so that you can sing at a higher pitch.

646
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:31,180
Raise the pitch higher.  Make the maschera ( mask resonance ) ring.

647
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,000
Okay.  I'll do it again.

648
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,800
What's the matter, Mom? Is something wrong?

649
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:55,870
It's nothing. Just focus on the song.

650
00:45:55,870 --> 00:46:02,470
♫  le angosce tue non le vuoi 

651
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:06,020
♫  der ma ti sante mor— 

652
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,760
What are you going to do when your breath is that short?

653
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,840
Do you think you can win with that skill?

654
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,650
If you lose the grand prize to Ro Na,

655
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,520
then my life is over too.

656
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,000
You absolutely must defeat Bae Ro Na.

657
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:23,380
Even if you have to kill her to win.

658
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,230
I can do it.

659
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,390
I'll make sure to get the grand trophy.

660
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,620
I won't ever lose to Ro Na.

661
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:34,730
You must sound so perfect that you humble those who dare to talk about fairness.

662
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,270
Practice and practice again until you can do it!

663
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,700
Unitl you can breathe through your abdomen.

664
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,100
Make your core hard. Harder!

665
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:03,340
 I was worried for no reason. There's no evidence. 

666
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,930
 So unlike me to get shaken up by a kid. 

667
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:08,450
Harder!

668
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,170
♫ Tornami a vagheggiar,

669
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,240
♫ te solo vuol' amar

670
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:28,100
♫ quest' anima fedel,

671
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,910
It'd be hard not to get that grand prize when you sing like this.

672
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:37,330
- Was it really okay? 
 - Yes.

673
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,450
Just make sure to keep your condition good till the final.

674
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,970
- Congratulations in advance! 
 - Thank you.

675
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,820
 Cheong Ah Foundation    / Ju Dan Te J King Holdings 

676
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,160
  Merger Agreement Signing Ceremony 

677
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,780
 Ju Dan Tae

 Cheon Seo Jin 

680
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,360
 Cheong Ah Foundation J King Holdings 
Merger Agreement Signing Ceremony 

681
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,800
I wanted to keep it simple and celebrate just between us.

682
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,190
Now that we're engaged and merged our companies,  it finally feels like we've become one.

683
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,880
I feel relieved too.

684
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,630
It took me a while to make up my mind, but since I started, I trust you.

685
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:50,070
Cheong Ah Group will be a holding company for construction and investment.

686
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,820
That's your specialty.

687
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,510
I already came up with a concrete business plan.

688
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,860
Here.

689
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:06,170
It's a redevelopment area I'm planning in Cheonsu District.  It's  exactly 20 minutes from Gangnam.

690
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:10,070
Right here, your Cheong Ah Arts Center is at the center.

691
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,400
Soon it'll be completed, right? I'm getting excited.

692
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,440
The second the development plan is  announced, it'll become real estate you want to buy, but can't.

693
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,840
It'll be worth more than Hera Palace.

694
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,540
The best wealthy town surpassing Dogok-dong will be developed here in the future.

695
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:29,800
If it's worth that much, I bet big corporations went after it as well.

696
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,400
Because I'm Ju Dan Tae, I'm able to do this.

697
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,110
I'm hungry. I'm going to eat light and get up.

698
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:39,090
Tomorrow's the Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

699
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:42,200
That's right. You've put in a lot of preparation for it.

700
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,990
Thanks for giving Seok Gyeong a chance to participate.

701
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,620
Of course.

702
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:53,440
Seok Gyeong or Eun Byeol, regardless who wins the grand prize, I can sincerely congratulate either of them.

703
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,380
Shall we toast?

704
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,310
I look forward to tomorrow.

705
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,360
 Alarm will ring in 6 hours. 

706
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,080
 Make sure to win the grand prize! Fighting! 

707
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,180
 From Dad 

708
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:17,360
 Clear weather is expected tomorrow, and the level of fine dust will be average as well. 

709
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,860
 Along the East Coast, there is a warning for high waves.  

710
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,100
 The difference in temperature is going to be high again today.  

711
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,790
 The current temperature in Seoul is... 

712
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,590
Ro Na, do well today, and I'll see you later.

713
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,100
I'll be off.

714
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,350
Okay, bye.

715
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,690
Ro Na.

716
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,750
It's red ginseng. Eat it and cheer up.

717
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:49,700
Just do as you practiced. You were doing very well.

718
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,890
Keep this in your mouth until the competition begins.

719
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,100
It prevents your mouth from getting dry.

720
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,380
Thanks. I'll do well.

721
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,820
You should at least eat a banana before you go.

722
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:12,470
The medication. Where is it?

723
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:15,070
You said you wouldn't take it this time.

724
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,330
I'm too nervous.

725
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:20,380
I just need to control this shaking.

726
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,250
Make sure to only take one.

727
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:28,570
It's medicine for the heart.  One is enough to calm your nerves.

728
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,030
 Alpranas 

729
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,500
Please speed things up, we don't have much time!

730
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,460
Okay!

731
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:42,230
Wipe it clean so that there won't be any fingerprints showing.

732

 Assemblyman Lee Gyu Jin 

735
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:08,660
The contest will start soon, so everyone should move to the auditorium.

736
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,020
Don't be nervous.

737
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:17,580
The first one up for the CAA Festival is Student Bae Ro Na.

738
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,860
 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival 

739
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,590
 Tornami a Vagheggiar 

740
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,130
Teacher.

741
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,040
Teacher!

742
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:57,560
What's wrong?

743
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,320
This isn't the right pitch.

744
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:07,700
♫ Tornami a vagheggiar,

745

♫ cara mia spene.

749
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,420
 It's perfect. She did it too perfectly. 

750
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,620
 Good job. 

751
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,590
 Bae Ro Na, you're insane. 

752
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:28,850
You did well.

753
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,640
Thanks.

754
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,400
 Next up is Student Ha Eun Byeol.  

755
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:46,890
What happened?

756
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:51,250
I'm sorry. Ro Na did way better than I expected.

757
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:55,670
This is the end of our contract. Make sure you keep your mouth shut.

758
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,310
Don't worry about that.

759
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,340
Eun Byeol can't be too anxious.

760
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,530
 Don't forget when you look around, there'll always be someone on your side.  

761
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:29,650
 I'll be rooting for you. From Mister

♫ Sehr komisch, Herr Marquis sind Sie!

771
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,060
Good job, everyone.

772
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,560
Because everyone performed better than usual,

773
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,290
I think this year's grand prize will be a close competition with the difference of a single point.

774
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:18,530
While they're evaluating, I hope everyone enjoys the Festival.

775
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,550
That's all.

776
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,800
 I worked insanely hard for this. 

777
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,970
 This is all Bae Ro Na's fault. 

778
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,500
 You did really great today. 

779
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,080
 You were totally cool. 

780
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:12,350
 -Here. 
-Thanks. 

781
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,900
What is this? Why isn't it working?

782
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,590
Did she change it already?

783
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,430

 28th CAA Festival: Judge's Room 

786
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,790
Did you decide on the winner for the grand prize?

787
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,990
Yes. We just made our decision.

788
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:13,640
The judging criteria were future potential and the vocal timbre.

789
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,660
These are the final results.

790
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:20,130
Good work, everyone.

791
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,970
Let's get into the award ceremony right away.

792
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:23,690
Okay.

793
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,230
Eun Byeol, it's Mom. Are you okay?

794
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,620
Why were you so nervous?

795
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:45,110
You were a little off key, but it wasn't a critical mistake.

796
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,030
Don't worry too much.

797
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:49,370
That's not right, Ahjumma.

798
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:52,190
It  was  a critical mistake.

799
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,030
Why you-

800
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:59,130
Why do you have my Eun Byeol's cell phone?

801
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,520
Ju Seok Gyeong!

802
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,350
You got here quickly.

803
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:10,140
You're going to give me the grand prize like you promised, right?

804
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,150
What nonsense are you sticking with?

805
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:14,350
I don't know who's going to win the grand prize either.

806
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:18,290
The judges made a fair decision based on talent and skill.

807
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,260
Fair?

808
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,690
Ask anyone out on the street.

809
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:26,730
If the word like   skill    or  talent  even exists in CAA School.

810
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:32,900
You boldly claimed you'll bring me evidence. Is this all there is to your imagination?

811
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:38,990
It's almost time for the announcement. I had no intention of making a dramatic show of it.

812
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:43,630
I'll show you the evidence you wanted to see so badly.

813
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:48,340
It's right in here.

814
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,380
The evidence.

815
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:58,010
What are you saying?

816
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,510
Eun Byeol had it all along.

817
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:06,620
The evidence that you killed Eun Byeol's grandfather.

818
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:10,460
Why she has this, or what she was planning to do with this

819
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:15,280
is none of my business. What I want is the trophy for the grand prize.

820
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,160
In any case, Eun Byeol is talented enough to go to SNU's (Seoul National University) School of Music without the grand prize.

821
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:26,390
So, it doesn't matter whose name is in the envelope. You just need to say my name.

822
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:34,810
Now it really feels like we've become a family.

823
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:40,050
See you later, Stepmom.

824
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:38,270
 Seo Jin. 

825
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:05,110
 Chairwoman, where are you? 

826
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:08,090
It's almost time to announce the winner.

827
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:29,260
What did you talk about with Seok Hun?

828
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:33,130
He just congratulated me on my performance. It's almost time they announce the winner.

829
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:35,020
I need to go.

830
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,540
Why? Do you think you'll win the prize?

831
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,260
That won't happen.

832
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:46,040
My mom would never give someone like you the grand prize.

833
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,090
Like what happened with my mom?

834
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:56,870
- What?
 - Your mom stole the trophy for the grand prize as well.

835
01:04:56,870 --> 01:05:00,250
Your mom took my mom's.

836
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,860
Through your grandfather's connection.

837
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:08,560
My mom won that prize because she deserved it. Don't insult my mom.

838
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,430
Then she slashed my mom's throat.

839
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:17,050
Because of your mom, my mom got robbed of her college, her trophy and even her dream.

840
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,870
No. My mom wouldn't do that!

841
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:22,430
Even if you refuse to admit it, everyone knows.

842
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:27,880
That even then, my mom did better than Cheon Seo Jin.

843
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,120
It's the same now.

844
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,370
You lost to me, Ha Eun Byeol.

845
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:39,400
Your dad bought off the pianist for my song, right?

846
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:44,070
You probably asked him to ruin my song.

847
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:51,700
Did you want to win the grand prize that badly?

848
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,020
But I won't yield it to you.

849
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:58,550
I need to win the grand prize, no matter what.

850
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:14,760
 No matter what anyone says, you're my one and only daughter. 

851
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,300
 You'll win the grand prize today regardless. 

852
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,730
 I believe in you. 

853
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:23,060
 Do you really mean that? 

854
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:25,160
 Of course, it is! 

855
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,240
 Why, you don't believe me? 

856
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:31,760
 Then, prove it. That I'm your only daughter. 

857
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,570
 Okay. Tell me whatever it is on your mind. 

858
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:37,410
 I'll do it for you. What should I do? 

859
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:41,230
 Ruin Bae Ro Na's song for me today. 

860
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:46,350
 You'll break  the piano or bribe the pianist.    

861
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:49,570
 Whatever you do, stop Bae Ro Na from winning the grand prize. 

862
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:50,820
 Eun Byeol, that's— 

863
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:54,270
 You promised that you'd do anything. 

864
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,790
 You will. For me, right? 

865
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:06,250
 Or else, I'll never see you again. 

866
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,720
Ha Eun Byeol. What's wrong, Ha Eun Byeol?

867
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,880
 If you lose the grand prize to Bae Ro Na, my life will be over, too. 

868
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:26,410
 You absolutely must defeat Bae Ro Na. Even if you have to kill her to win.
 

869
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:28,410
Stop it.

870
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:31,150
Stop it!

871
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:39,770
 You lost to me Ha Eun Byeol. 

872
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:47,080
 Your dad, Seok Hun, and this Cheong Ah Arts trophy are all mine. 

873
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,240
No. Shut up!

874
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:27,030
Ha Eun Byeol, what's wrong with you?

875
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:43,100
And now, to announce the results of the judges' decisions,

876
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,750
I'd ike to welcome Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin on to the center stage.

877
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,330
Let's welcome her with a round of applause.

878
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:55,640
 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival 

879
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:00,340
The bronze award for vocal music goes to

880
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:05,190
Cheong Ah Arts   senior students, No Ji Ah and Cho Bo Mi.

881
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,190
Congratulations.

882
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,930
The silver award for vocal music goes to

883
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:19,010
Yu Je Ni.

884
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:23,290
Je Ni! Je Ni!

885
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:26,690
Congratulations.

886
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:42,410
Now I'm going to announce the impressive grand prize winner.

887
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:47,910
The Chairwoman will announce the winner herself.

888
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:03,710
 28th CAAF 2022 

889
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:10,040
The highlight of the 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival.

890
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:15,090
Given to the most divine voice in the vocal music,

891
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,960
the grand prize goes to...

892
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,400
Even our Chairwoman appears to be very nervous.

893
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:36,560
This award offers a free-pass to SNU's School of Music.

894
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,850
The grand prize for the vocal category for CAA Festival.

895
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:43,260
Madam Chairwoman, please announce the name.

896
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:47,100
 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival: The Grand Prize for Vocal 
 Cheong Ah Arts School Senior  

897
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:50,340
 Bae Ro Na. 

898
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:52,680
Bae Ro Na!

899
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:14,480
You were wrong, Bae Ro Na.

900
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:19,930
I won't have anything taken from you.

901
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:27,510
Neither my dad nor Seok Hun nor the grand prize trophy.

902
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:31,500
Cheong Ah Arts senior student

903
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,280
 Bae Ro Na 

904
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:46,030
 What I want is the grand prize. 

905
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:53,800
 So, it doesn't matter whose name is in the envelope. You just need to say my name. 

906
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,550
It's Student Bae Ro Na.

907
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:37,710


908
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,330
 War In Life Penhouse 2 

909
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:53,970
 Isn't this a murder case? 

910
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,790
 The culprit was definitely in the school. 

911
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:57,530
 Seok Gyeong tried to kill Ro Na! 

912
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:58,710
 What happened between you two? 

913
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,080
 Tell me the truth! 

914
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,650
 Seok Gyeong isn't the culprit. 

915
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:04,290
 Did you do this? 

916
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:06,490
 No! Please believe me! 

917
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:08,010
 I'm going to protect her with my life.  

918
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,230
 Even if you had to kill Bae Ro Na? 

919
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:11,780
 Ha Yun Cheol. You shouldn't have done that to Ro Na. 

920
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:14,280
 The culprit in Bae Ro Na's case... 

921
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,070
 Who are you?
