00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,080
 Episode 9 

2
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:58,020


3
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,530
Are you awake?  Miss Na Ae Gyo?

4
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,240
What are you?

5
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,620
Where are we?

6
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,980
I saved your life. Aren't you quite hostile with your thank-you?

7
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,560
Apparently, your resemblance to Su Ryeon ends with your looks.

8
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,490
Who are you?

9
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,600
I'm  Logan Lee. We met two years ago.

10
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,150
Logan Lee?

11
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,950
I don't know anyone like you.

12
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,150
Instead of talking bullshit, beat it.

13
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,300
Wait a moment.

14
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,840
I'm not trying to hurt you.

15
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,780
I just want to hear what you were intending to tell me then.

16
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,210
If you don't want to die, remove yourself.

17
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,660
You're no match for me.

18
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,430
Up until Su Ryeon's death, with a face like hers, did you pretend to be Ju Dan Te's wife?

19
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,500
By lobbying the Happy Future Party head Jeong Du Man and  government officials,

20
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,710
I know you obtained intel and made a huge fortune.

21
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:17,060
But two years ago, I am sure you decided to part ways from Ju Dan Tae.

22
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,740
That's why you asked to meet me.

23
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,640
Don't give me bullshit. I never did anything of the kind.

24
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,020
The only person I trust is Ju Dan Tae.

25
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,130
This voice. It certainly is you.

26
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,490
 I am Na Ae Gyo. 

27
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,960
 I have something I must tell you before I leave. 

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,020
 What that bastard Ju Dan Tae did to Sim Su Ryeon.  

29
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,480
 What kind of person he is. 

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,670
 If I don't do it today, I might never be able to do so. 

31
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,240
At the time,

32
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:58,390
you were sincere. You- you were desperate.

33
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,690
At the time ...

34
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,700
we must have had a spat.   Couldn't I have wanted to dis him out of anger?

35
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,190
I can't control my anger very well.

36
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,910
Then, are you okay if Ju Dan Te hears this?

37
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,160
Ha, let him hear it.

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,240
Are you trying to blackmail me with a thing like this?

39
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,050
I'm sorry but

40
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:36,510
Ju Dan Tae and I have a much tighter and deeper bond than you think.

41
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,070
We even had our children together. Do you think he'd fall for a word like that?

42
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,490
Don't mess around.  Never approach me again.

43
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,080
We meet again.

44
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:03,160
What's this? Were you in cahoots with him to approach me deliberately?

45
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,100
Clearly, you misunderstand something.

46
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,070
I'm Ju Dan Te's woman and the twin's birth mother.

47
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,870
Ju Dan Tae tried to kill you.

48
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,060
You almost died today.

49
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,010
You don't know when or how you will be disposed of like Eonni Su Ryeon.

50
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,950
But are you going to stand by Ju Dan Tae out of loyalty?

51
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,020
What do you think you know about him to be yakking as you are?

52
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,340
I, too, have been thoroughly betrayed.

53
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,520
Because of him, I was made a fugitive and nearly died.

54
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,430
You, too, will be no different from me.

55
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,910
You know best.  How Ju Dan Tae handles a person he doesn't need any more.

56
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:52,010
We're giving you a chance to dump him before he dumps you.

57
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,530
Join hands with us, Na Ae Gyo.

58
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,560
Just what the hell are you two?

59
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,760
 Seok Hun 

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,150
 Hello? 

61
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,610
Seok Hun?  It's Ahjumma.

62
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,860
Nothing happened, did it?  I was worried so I called.

63
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,680
 No, I'm okay.  How about you? 

64
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,280
 Has my dad perhaps done something to you again? 

65
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,850
No, I'm fine. Now that I hear your voice, I'm hanging up.

66
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,760
Your children. Don't you want to see them?

67
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,540
Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong. I'll help you to see them.

68
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,480
Isn't it too cute what you're doing?

69
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,280
Are you buying my heart with things like my kids?

70
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,330
If I had something remotely akin to motherly love,

71
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,890
would I have run away leaving the newborns behind?

72
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,980
Being a mom is something I detest most.

73
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,570
Do you know what Ju Dan Tae has done to your children?

74
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,980
They're being abused and live in hell.

75
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,850
Despite that, do you want them to grow up at the mercy of that lunatic?

76
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,660
Don't talk whatever you like about the affairs of another family.

77
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,880
Leave her alone.

78
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,930
You can't let her go like this.

79
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,210
What if she goes to tell Ju Dan Tae everything?

80
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,420
We can't help it if she talks.

81
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,950
So are you giving up? I can't do that.

82
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,630
Even if she talked like that, I saw her eyes trembling.

83
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,800
Let's hope there's the last remnant of motherhood somewhere in her.

84
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,990
Where have you been?  Why didn't you answer the phone?

85
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,350
What, have you got another man or something?

86
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,410
Who tried to kill me? Who's blaming whom here?

87
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,400
Why did you do that,  you son of  a bitch?

88
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,100
The building is sold so you're going to kill me, because I am no longer useful?

89
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,910
I wanted to validate your sincerity because I didn't understand what you did two years ago.

90
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,260
What didn't you understand?

91
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,180
I was in obedient exile in Thailand, just as you ordered.

92
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,920
That was ...

93
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,010
Because Sim Su Ryeon died, I told you to lay low abroad for a while.

94
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,200
Because you shouldn't be seen by others.  But why did you keep avoiding me?

95
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,040
You wouldn't answer the phone or come back even when I begged.

96
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,910
You pretended not to know me. How should I have interpreted that?

97
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,760
Darling. We are amazing partners.

98
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,270
We have been one for a long time.

99
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:50,350
As long as you don't betray me, I, too, will never betray you.

100
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,340
You mess with me only once, Ju Dan Te.

101
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,680
Do it once more and I'll put a bullet in your head.

102
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,540
Do you understand?

103
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,860
Now I think my Na Ae Gyo has returned.

104
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,270
By the way, you were a tad sexy earlier.

105
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,090
My heart fluttered for a second there.

106
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,340
Shall we have a drink to celebrate our making up?

107
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,980
I was anxious that you might have other feelings. You know very well what you are to me.

108
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,270
We've got to fish something big out of the Cheonsu District development.

109
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:56,240
At least until then, I won't double-cross you. 
  Voice Spy 

110
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,280
Ju Dan Te's relationship with Na Ae Gyo seems more solid than we thought.

111
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,820
No, I felt a crack between them just now.

112
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,180
She didn't tell him about meeting us.

113
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:28,090
 Contact me anytime if you change your mind. I'll help you meet your children. 

114
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,660
What brought you here? Chairman hasn't come home yet.

115
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:44,570
I came because of his tuxedo for our wedding. I need to check his shoulder size.

116
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,970
Go and do your work.

117
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,890
Yes, Ma'am.

118
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,920
 This necklace is your daughter's, right? 

119
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,360
 We found both your daughter's DNA and the victim's blood. 

120
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,830
Where did he put it?

121
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,310
What are you doing in here?

122
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,400
Like a rat in a room without the owner present.

123
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,710
Are you looking for this?

124
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,250
Give it to me. You have no reason to keep it now.

125
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,520
I did everything you told me to.  I sent out the invitations and got the wedding dress.

126
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,120
I'll walk into the wedding as I promised. So give me the necklace back.

127
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:03,630
Giving it back to you isn't hard. But don't think this is the only card I have up on my sleeve.

128
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,130
What do you mean by that?

129
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,740
I heard Eun Byeol got an IV.

130
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,730
So, was her memory erased well?

131
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:19,460
How could Dr. Ha test on his daughter the medicine that's still in a clinical trial?

132
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,290
That isn't anything a doctor with a current and valid license should do.

133
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:30,560
With any side effects,  his daughter's life will surely be ruined and he'll end up in jail.

134
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,590
Ms. Cheon Seo Jin, why is it that you can't understand?

135
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,110
I told you that you wouldn't be able to get away from me.

136
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:48,850
Accept your fate unless you want your daughter's lost memory back.

137
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,090
Did you get it, Cheon Seo Jin, my darling?

138
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,180
 Eun Byeol's Dad  

139
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:37,110
 Destiny 

140
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,330
What do you think you're doing? Marrying Ju Dan Te?

141
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,510
For Eun Byeol's sake, you did say you wouldn't. Don't you know what an awful man he is?

142
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,850
I know. So what?

143
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,460
What man won't lose it when his fiancée's hooking up again with her ex-husband?

144
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,700
What's wrong with you? Something happened with Chairman Ju, right?

145
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,270
Why is the abrupt change of mind? You don't love him!

146
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,690
Am I a 20-year old kid smitten by love?

147
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,840
Marriage is the best business deal you make in life, so I chose Ju Dan Te.

148
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,160
What happens to our daughter?

149
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,160
Will Eun Byeol accept this marriage?

150
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,890
I am doing this for me.

151
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,710
You left Oh Yun Hui. That's enough.

152
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:39,660
Over my dead body, I'd see you being happy with her.

153
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,680
- What?
 - Why?

154
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,510
Were you clueless that I was this kind of woman? I've been using you all this time.

155
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:51,340
I needed your blind fatherly love in order to cover up Eun Byeol's criminal act.

156
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,330
I put on an act to pay back Oh Yoon Hui and pretended I was coming back to you.

157
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,990
You're lying.

158
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,000
However desperate you are, you can't be doing this to me.

159
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,020
Stop clinging to me and leave me alone!

160
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,450
I had no intention of going back to you in the first place.

161
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:21,760
A man who suits me is Ju Dan Te who's wealthy and a gentleman to his core.

162
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,890
Come on, Seo Jin.

163
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:30,140
Take Eun Byeol and go. To America or wherever, it doesn't matter.

164
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,810
Are you abandoning your daughter, too, now?

165
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:36,210
My life matters more than my daughter's.

166
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,860
It's better this way for Eun Byeol, too.

167
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,440
So ...

168
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,800
go away before my wedding no matter what!

169
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,070
I ...

170
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,200
am done talking.

171
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,790
Leaving your child

172
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,890
is a grave sin.

173
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,410
 You 

174
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:24,330
 you've got to protect our Eun Byeol. Now that's the only way. 

175
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,530
What are all these?

176
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,860
These are Chairman Ju's wedding gifts.

177
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,670
He got yours, too. Do you want to have a look?

178
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,650
The dress and the shoes you're going to wear to the wedding.

179
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,860
Does he really mean he'll go through with the damn wedding?

180
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,610
Damn it!

181
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,680
Seok Hun, where are you right now?

182
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,460
Je Ni's Mom! Je Ni's Mom!

183
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,510
Oh my, what are all these?

184
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,130
How come did you buy so many prestigious brand-name bags?

185
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,550
These are my birthday gifts from the Three Madams. They cared.

186
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,990
Goodness, all of them?

187
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,500
My, then all the new things you've  been carrying are from the Three Madams, too.

188
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,690
I thought so. I bet you're closer to them than their own flesh and blood.

189
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,890
- They must be heavy. Let me help carrying them.
- No, no need.

190
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,130
If someone sees us, they'll think I'm ordering you around.

191
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,810
Who will? I'm at your service of my own accord.

192
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,620
I, Gyu Jin, am awfully good at doing things like this.

193
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,660
The 21st Korean National Assembly voted me as the ultimate politician of manners . Let's go.

194
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,600
What, manners?

195
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,180
I told you no need. Hey, give them back to me!

196
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,130
Be careful.

197
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,100
Come on, you're a VIP.

198
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,450
What on earth is this?

199
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,980
It's okay. They were going to find out about us anyway.

200
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,600
Let's go.

201
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,870
I see they're two friends hitting it off quite nicely.

202
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,900
They'll be a brother and a sister soon!

203
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,890
Were they like that coming down all the way from the fifth floor?

204
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,570
What was that again?

205
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:55,330
When their parents set the day of their betrothal, how shameless Eun Byeol and Seok Hun are to be dating?

206
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,710
They're a cute looking couple, though. They even excite me a little.

207
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,510
Chairman Ju, at this rate, your wedding may get called off.

208
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,580
When the two go around like that,  word will spread in no time.

209
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,310
As long as you keep your mouth shut, no one will know.

210
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,930
I'm a strong and silent type, to begin with.

211
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,930
Oh, no. There was Kang Ma Ri at the scene.

212
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,540
The game's over when she spreads the word in her bathhouse.

213
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,470
My Seok Hun isn't at an age where he does things impulsively.

214
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:27,640
Eun Byeol's tricking Seok Hun to stop the wedding. Any reaction now will further egg her on.

215
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,060
I decline your unsolicited advice in the affairs of my household.

216
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,990
You get lost in that direction.

217
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,820
Chairman Ju. Tell me, it's just between us.

218
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,980
What's the real motive behind your determination to do this wedding?

219
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,400
When your fiancée is falling again for her ex, Ha Yun Cheol,

220
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,650
It can't be that you love Seo Jin. Then is it her share of Cheong Ah Group that you love?

221
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:57,960
I wouldn't want to use force this morning with an occasion for celebration approaching fast.

222
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,690
After all, you're a member of the Korean National Assembly.

223
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,520
I'm rooting for you. This is true love.

224
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,100
Chairman Ju, you're the true romantist who attains love despite your children's opposition!

225
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,380
I'm almost moved.

226
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,330
I have a bodyguard, too. He's a first-rate martial art practitioner.

227
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,560
Turns out my son is pulling quite a stunt.

228
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,070
I thought he'd grown up from the fearless way he dared me. But he's still a child.

229
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,980
He's a baby who still needs to be cared for in my bosom.

230
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,490
I hear Teacher Cheon is getting terminated from her chair position.

231
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,460
We'll see how competent Ha Eun Byeol  is. Her first test ever, fair and without her mom's help!

232
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,250
In her current state of mind, I doubt she can do well on her test.

233
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,130
I also hear Teacher Ma shut off  her exclusive bathroom, too.

234
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,250
She'll eat the same lunch as we do.

235
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,510
The queen of Cheong Ah Arts School is now disgraced and became a commoner.

236
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,420
Our Teacher Ma is awfully good at such things.

237
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,990
Come on, split, split.

238
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:33,070
Must you be like this? Why do you bother showing up at school, knowing how things are?

239
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,850
I swear, you have no regard for me at all. School or marriage, you do everything your way!

240
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,010
Don't waste your energy riding in a taxi. The day's barely started.

241
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,200
If you don't want to ride with me, I'll get a car for you.

242
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,100
I hate your guts. You're selfish without a dime's worth of motherly love.

243
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,150
Are you crazy? Let go!

244
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,190
What the hell are you up to?

245
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,410
Do you advertise you're seeing my brother? Is this your silly protest to stop the marriage?

246
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,980
It's not a protest, but truth. Seok Hun and I like each other.

247
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,210
Do you think if you like each other madly, you can stop the wedding?

248
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,980
You'll only get my brother beaten for nothing. In fact, possibly to the point of death.

249
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,140
Him, dying?

250
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,450
You clearly have no idea what a formidable man my father is.

251
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,790
- Do you see these? 
 - What happened to your arm?

252
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,670
Don't tell me.

253
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,510
This is the true color of your soon-to-be stepfather.

254
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,100
So quit trying to persuade my dad. Just make your mom give up.

255
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,750
I swear, I won't leave you alone if you play my poor brother and get him hurt.

256
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:14,130
Since we're all here, we're going to vote yes or no on terminating the current chairperson.

257
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,710
Before the voting begins, I'd like to say something.

258
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,980
Cheong Ah is the most prestigious private school foundation in our country.

259
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:28,470
Fostered by the generous donations and the passion of the previous chairperson, our foundation is now the cradle of education.

260
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:34,780
Such a reputation has been tarnished by Cheon Seo Jin's incompetence and arrogance.

261
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:40,100
With that said, I strongly demand the current chairwoman be terminated.

262
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,800
Madam Chairwoman, you may make your statement as well.

263
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,040
I acknowledge the grave nature of my error.

264
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,590
I'm very ashamed of it.

265
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:58,640
But this isn't a time for strife but harmony. I'll do my utmost best to turn things around.

266
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,780
I can leave the world of vocal music with no regrets, but Cheong Ah Foundation is

267
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,650
my life.

268
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:13,590
I'll personally turn everything around, and I humbly ask that you give me just one more chance.

269
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,210
We'll begin voting now. 
 Regarding the termination of the chairwoman 

270
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,680
 Cheong Ah Foundation : Vote in opposition 

271
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,450
Well then,

272
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,030
I'll announce the result of the voting.

273
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,250
 On terminating Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin 
 Yay:5    Nay:6 

274
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,490
Five votes for terminating her,

275
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,620
and six votes against her termination.

276
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:56,360
How absurd. She's a thief.

277
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,040
What just happened?

278
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,090
With this, we've just decided not to terminate Chairwoman Cheon Seo Jin.

279
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,050
Thank you.

280
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:17,010
Thank you so much for trusting me.

281
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,440
All of you directors, I won't forget your mercy and will do my very best

282
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,000
to restore Cheong Ah Foundation's reputation.

283
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,330
I don't know how you were able to win the directors over,

284
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,100
but I won't ever accept this decision.

285
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,310
Rest assured that we'll protest the decision and vote again.

286
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,130
Let's go, Mom.

287
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,760
Your father asked us a favor before he passed away.

288
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,600
What was it?

289
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,480
 You'll find that my eldest daughter falls short in many ways. 

290
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,920
 She's ambitious but is still deficient in many aspects. 

291
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,790
 Once she becomes the chairperson, her mom will try to push her out with various justifications. 

292
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,410
 Seo Yeong will also cause problems and divisiveness. 

293
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,390
 Never mind all that. Just trust Seo Jin and help her become strong 

294
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,230
 so that she will be able to keep her chair position. 

295
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,290
Father.

296
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,110
So you don't need to thank us.

297
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,630
Think of your father and be strong.

298
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,410
We have your back.

299
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,500
Father. Oh, Father. Father.

300
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,330
Father, I was wrong.

301
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,890
Father,

302
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:33,080
forgive me.

303
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,430
Were you here?

304
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,870
Were you looking for me?

305
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,130
They rejected the call to terminate your mom as the chair person. Did you hear?

306
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,390
No, I don't care.

307
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,470
I don't understand why my Mom is so obsessed with the Foundation.

308
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,390
She must not even be ashamed in front of the kids. It's so embarrassing.

309
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,640
Don't concern yourself with what other people say.

310
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,980
Once time passes, people will forget.

311
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,880
Cheer up.

312
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,870
Seok Hun.

313
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,670
You should also lean on me when you have a hard time.

314
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:30,080
I'll listen to whatever you have to say.

315
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,240
You know how much I like you, right?

316
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,900
Did any of your memories come back?

317
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,480
Do you remember what I told you that day?

318
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,090
No. No matter how hard I think, I really can't.

319
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,350
Can't you just tell me?

320
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,130
Think harder.

321
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,920
Don't you remember whom you met on these stone stairs that day?

322
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,380
Did I?

323
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,430
Who besides you?

324
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,760
You have to remember.

325
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,420
You might have seen Ro Na's real killer.

326
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,640
What does that mean?

327
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,970
Isn't Mr. Park the killer?

328
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:12,470
You also know what a kind man Mr. Park is.

329
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,150
I'm certain he's being framed.

330
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,200
I didn't believe it either.

331
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,380
Mr. Park isn't a man capable of killing anyone.

332
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,780
As long as you remember, a true killer can be found even now.

333
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,540
Mr. Park will be released, too.

334
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,240
If you remember anything, only to me,

335
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,200
come and tell. Only me.  Can you promise that?

336
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:39,900
But are you still thinking about Ro Na?

337
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,740
It's not because of Ro Na.

338
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,260
I just feel bad for Mr. Park.

339
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,330
You'll help, right?

340
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,750
Okay. I'll do that.

341
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,670
I'll do anything you want. I'll try to remember.

342
00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:00,130
 The day's last music. It'll take you right back to reality. Here  it is. 

343
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,680
Eun Byeol, what's wrong?

344
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:23,150
How did you say Ro Na died again?

345
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,210
She was hit in the head with the Cheong Ah Arts Festival trophy.

346
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,110
A trophy?

347
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,360
 Gold Real Estate  
 Specializing in Cheonsu District  Investment Consulting 

348
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,400
I'm Hwang Geum Bong.

349
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,830
I'm interested in looking at some properties for sale in Cheonsu District.

350
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,510
Did you say Cheonsu District?

351
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:54,190
There's no plan to develop the area yet.

352
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,840
If your interest is investing, I recommend Okpyeong District.

353
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,110
Hold on a second. Let me consult with the investor himself.

354
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,820
Are you sure about the information that Cheong Ah Group is going to invest in Cheonsu District?

355
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,660
Of course, I heard it directly from Mr. Ju himself.

356
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:14,130
But do be careful about it because the official announcement hasn't been made yet.

357
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,710
Okay, so how much property are you looking for?

358
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,890
Everything you can get your hands on.

359
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,570
-There's going to be a massive increase in value soon.
- Okay.

360
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,950
Do you know Dan Tae Ju?

361
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,600
Apparently, he got a direct referral from Chairman Ju Dan Te.

362
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,420
My investor has his heart set on  Cheonsu District.

363
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,340
Okay.

364
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,730
Where is Cheonsu District?

365
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,940
Chairwoman Song! It's Hwang Geum Bong.

366
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,500
Have you been well? It sounds like Gangnam District is getting developed.

367
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
So I'm making an urgent call.

368
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,180
Is that so?

369
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,600
Okay.

370
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,740
Oh, do some research and send the files to my secretary's office.

371
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:08,260
Lady from Jincheon, do you like the gifts I sent you today?

372
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,850
I put a lot of thought into choosing.

373
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,420
Of course, I love, love them.

374
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:18,120
You ladies have the best eyes for everything in Korea.

375
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,340
Is that rude wench from last time still bothering you?

376
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,110
You said she lives at Hera Palace with you, right?

377
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:26,770
After she got some serious scolding from you ladies,

378
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:30,980
she's on all fours around me. So no worries for me.

379
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,820
If she acts up again, tell us immediately.

380
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,470
How dare a mere assemblyman's wife look down on our Lady from Jincheon?

381
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,960
Forget all that, and why don't you move?

382
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Move?

383
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,830
I just got a call.

384
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:50,480
I hear a 130-storey commerical and residential complex is coming soon in Cheonsu District.

385
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,870
Did you hear about that, too, Chairwoman Song?

386
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:58,400
Chairman Ju Dan Te is getting in, so announcing of the area development will come soon.

387
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,570
Did you say Chairman Ju?

388
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,420
He's so fast on such things.

389
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,210
Lady from Jincheon, you, too, should get something for youself.

390
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,740
It'll grow into a district much more affluent than Hera Palace.

391
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,750
Really?

392
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,690
This is indeed hot and valuable information.

393
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,960
 Since it hasn't been announced yet, 

394
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,610
 it must not be that expensive either. 

395
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,360
 But you should still hurry. 

396
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,400
 I hear all the good spots are already taken by Chairman Ju.  

397
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,570
Honey!

398
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,860
Honey! Honey! Gyu Jin!

399
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,900
Unless you dress me, I can't go to work and look after people and  their livelihoods—. Forget it.

400
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,490
What's with coming in looking like that?

401
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,160
Like a woman who's been around the block.

402
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,310
Did you go to Kang Ma Ri Bathhouse again?

403
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,910
You might as well clock in there every morning.

404
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,170
Did you save a nation in your previous life?

405
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,550
How come did you get so lucky to meet a woman like me?

406
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,750
On the contrary, I couldn't save a nation and hence, I met you.

407
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,410
How will you raise your campaign funds without me?

408
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,550
What? Did you hear something?

409
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,360
Cheonsu District will soon be developed!

410
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,850
The news is about 200 years old already.

411
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,820
Ever since I was in grade school, I shopped for land with my mother.

412
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,560
This is a sure thing. I cleary heard what the Three Madams say with my own ears.

413
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,730
Who are they? The indisputable golden source of real estate.

414
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,930
Chairman Ju already smelled something and is buying off the land there.

415
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,500
Ju Dan Te, that punk, didn't say anything to me.

416
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,270
Is he going to take everything for himself?

417
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,130
Wait a sec.  What kind of savings do you have?

418
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,940
No, no, no. I've got to call Mom right away.

419
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,180
- Yes, yes. 
 - Right away, today,

420
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,620
I'll throw a party of cuteness,

421
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,998
and collect all the cash I can from her.

422
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,389
This, here, is something very rare.

423
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:49,849
In two years, it's going to be a hundred-years old.

424
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:52,279
Well, you shouldn't have gone so far.

425
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,599
And these too.

426
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,759
Well, this is all too much.

427
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:00,279
Now this.

428
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:01,979
Have a look, please.

429
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:12,929
 Real Estate Sales Contract  

430
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:19,189
 Buyer: Kang Ma Ri     
 Agent: Hwang Geum Bong 

431
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:28,069
It's just enough for a nice meal.

432
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:32,869
This just came out.

433
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:35,169
It's worth $5 million per square feet.

434
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:36,909
Five million!

435
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:41,999
- Shall we stamp the seal together? 
 - Shall we?

436
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,999
Grab it.

437
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:45,549
 Seller: Choi Do Ju / Buyer: Yi Yong Beom / Agent: Hwang Geum Bong  

438
00:35:45,549 --> 00:35:48,239
Ta-da!

439
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,809
Congratulations. Now sit and wait for the windfall.

440
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:54,519
That sounds great!

441
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:58,749
Although I'm not sure who leaked the information, 
 JKING HOLDINGS 

442
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:02,279
real estate sales in Cheonsu District are suddenly skyrocketing today.

443
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:06,729
- Who got the scent and crawled in? 
 - I haven't been able to look into that far yet.

444
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,779
Hey, you idiot!

445
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:12,419
When you spend that much for your work expenses, can't you handle a thing like that?

446
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:15,369
Find out at once whose names are on the contracts and who are the actual buyers.

447
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:21,179
No, no. First, buy all the parcels of land that I checked out as soon as possible.

448
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,199
- Get going already!
 - Sir!

449
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,879
That retard.

450
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,589
By any chance,

451
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:36,159
Is it you, Oh Yoon Hui again?

452
00:36:36,169 --> 00:36:38,139
 My goal has changed. 

453
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:41,519
 I want to become really rich.  

454
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,809
 I'm going to make money like crazy. 

455
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:46,899
 Enough to get this penthouse. 

456
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:50,559
What an arrogant bitch.

457
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:53,909
So you think you can get my penthouse.

458
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:03,479
Darling, it's me.

459
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:05,509
I need you to do me a favor.

460
00:37:05,509 --> 00:37:09,529
You've got to handle a pesky woman for me.

461
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:12,839
That's my speciality.

462
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:15,179
Tell me about her when I see you later.

463
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:21,289
Thank you for your call, Ms. Na Ae Gyo.

464
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:23,789
I didn't know you'd get back to me so soon.

465
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:26,709
No need to thank me.

466
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:31,799
How good you're with keeping your promises,

467
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:34,349
I came to confirm it.

468
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:37,649
Are you okay with just seeing the kids from here?

469
00:37:37,649 --> 00:37:39,279
What then?

470
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:43,449
Should I put my arms around them and shed tears of joy?

471
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:48,079
They're here.

472
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:01,359
- You're here early. 
 - You came.

473
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,719
What's this? Is this Ahjumma what you wanted to talk about?

474
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,679
Don't be rude. Ahjumma said she had something to tell us.

475
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,539
What do you want to drink? It's on me.

476
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:13,159
The strawberry milk shake here is  good.

477
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:18,899
It's really sweet.

478
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:25,939
Are you satisfied now?

479
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:31,929
I don't have a stomach strong enough to be chatting with the person who killed my mom.

480
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:34,529
Sit, Seok Gyeong.

481
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:37,069
It's about your mother.

482
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:38,809
My mother?

483
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:41,699
Your birth mother.

484
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:43,949
- She's alive. 
 - What do you mean our birth mother?

485
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:46,769
Ahjumma, I'm sorry, but

486
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:50,049
our birth mother died of sepsis right after we were born.

487
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:52,619
Know your facts before scamming us.

488
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,559
Do we have to keep listening to this crap?

489
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:57,299
Your father lied to you.

490
00:38:58,009 --> 00:39:00,339
Your birth mother is alive.

491
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:07,479
She is the one who gave birth to you.

492
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:17,799
Are you crazy?

493
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:20,599
Are you playing with us? This is our dead mother.

494
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:23,549
No, she really is your birth mother.

495
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:27,719
It's astonishing how much she looks like the late Su Ryeon.

496
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:33,149
It may be hard to believe, but it's true. I met her and confirmed a few days ago.

497
00:39:33,149 --> 00:39:35,979
Is this real? Where is she now?

498
00:39:35,979 --> 00:39:37,919
Oppa, do you believe what she says?

499
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:41,349
She's tormenting us because she's mad I hated  Ro Na.

500
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:45,069
This kind of a shabby picture can be easily fabricated.

501
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:47,799
We can just go and ask father.

502
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:51,289
Do you trust our father?

503
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,979
Do you still not know what kind of a man he is after all we've been through?

504
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:57,579
Our father is the one who abuses, torments, and controls us the most.

505
00:39:57,579 --> 00:40:00,469
What kind of truth do you expect from him?

506
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:02,529
Please, don't do anything.

507
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:05,489
Ahjumma is trying to help us.

508
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:07,949
She's very near you.

509
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:12,019
I'll help you if you want to meet her.

510
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:14,999
When did I say I want to see my birth mother?

511
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:18,529
Who the hell is she to try and be our mother after all this time?

512
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:21,399
To me, there is only one mother.

513
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,879
This kind of a fake mother?

514
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,019
I don't need her.

515
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,990
Give it to me straight.

516
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,400
You know something, don't you?

517
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,780
What is it? Tell me!

518
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,230
The one who killed our mom

519
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,300
might be our father.

520
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,860
Are you crazy?

521
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,280
Why would father do that? Why would he kill our mother?

522
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,960
Why?

523
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,130
Because he didn't need our mom anymore.

524
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:31,780
Our father is that kind of man. He never keeps what he doesn't need.  Even us!

525
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,230
He might throw us out anytime.

526
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,560
So we can't trust him anymore. Do you understand?

527
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,210
There's only you and I in this world.

528
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,890
I'll never  abandon you even if I die.

529
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,450
I will protect you from our father.

530
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:54,730
If my dad really did that to my mom,

531
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,070
I won't leave him alone.

532
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,700
I'll never forgive him.

533
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,260
What the hell are you doing?

534
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,890
What did you threaten Seo Jin with?

535
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,660
Stop the marriage immediately!

536
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,100
Seo Jin is too precious to be given to a piece of trash like you!

537
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,250
You've done enough.

538
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,010
If I give up Cheon Seo Jin,

539
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,630
that you two will live happily ever after. Tell me so honestly.

540
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:32,050
Didn't you come back for Cheon Seo Jin's money, too?

541
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,770
So that's how little you can use your hand.

542
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,580
I should've made sure to completely destroy it back then.

543
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,700
I suppose I was too softhearted.

544
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,110
You crazy bastard!

545
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,280
I'm going to do whatever I can to stop this marriage! Even with my own life!

546
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,200
I really admire how gutsy you are.

547
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,230
But I guess you haven't heard anything from Cheon Seo Jin yet.

548
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,670
She's heartless. After all, it concerns your daughter.

549
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,560
Her birth father should know.

550
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,910
What trash talk is this?

551
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,050
I found out.

552
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:10,580
That daughter of yours killed Bae Ro Na.

553
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,330
What should you do?

554
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,430
A parent should cover their kid's transgressions.

555
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,060
Seo Jin's decided to bear the burn all by herself.

556
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,380
Her love for her daughter is quite something else.

557
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,850
Such a pity seeing you like this all alone.

558
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:39,540
Go on. Hit me.

559
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,850
Hit me if you think you can keep me from spilling the beans.

560
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,240
I told you to hit me!

561
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,950
Take your daughter and get out of my sight.

562
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,060
Before I hand her over to the police.

563
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,670
I'm going to kill you.

564
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,230
I'm going to kill you, Ju Dan Tae!

565
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,420
Fighting!

566
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,540
I'm going to kill you, Ju Dan Tae!

567
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:08,830
I'm going to kill you!

568
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,230
I'm going to kill you!

569
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,960
  Controlled Area 
 Restricted Access  

570
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,420
I can't read Na Ae Gyo.

571
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,540
She hardly reacted when she saw the kids.

572
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,630
She isn't a type forthcoming with who she really is.

573
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,740
We'll have to keep an eye on her.

574
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,300
Any reactions from Cheonsu District?

575
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,620
As expected, Kang Ma Ri and Lee Gyu Jin dived in.

576
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,480
They're buying into the information they get from Three Madams.

577
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,410
The time has come to act.

578
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,250
Mr. Hong, it's Oh Yun Hee.

579
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,330
I'm selling the property at Number 27 in Cheonsu District.

580
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,420
Can you see if any buyers are there?

581
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,050
As soon as possible.

582
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,430
Yes.

583
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,530
It's about time Ju Dan Tae arrives at the mountain villa.

584
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,700
  Voice Spy  

585
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:11,100
  Did you ask to see me just to give me the damn wedding invitation?  Jeez! 

586
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,310
If Cheon Seo Jin won't divorce you,

587
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,400
you'll probably live with her for the rest of your life.

588
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,070
Do you think I'm crazy?

589
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:23,350
  That woman, too, can't help but marrying me because she knows I know her weakness.  

590
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,580
  - This marriage means nothing to me!   
 - Did he say, "weakness?"

591
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,640
It's just an excuse to get my hands on the shares.

592
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,520
As for the land you bought in Cheonseo Distict,

593
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,070
I want you to register all of it under my name.

594
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,220
- Let's do half and half. 
 - Seventy percent!

595
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,700
Nothing below that!

596
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,590
In return, I'll recover the land Oh Yoon Hui owns.

597
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:49,610
Don't you think seventy percent is going overboard?

598
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,890
Is seventy percent overboard?

599
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,700
Really?

600
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:59,420
Fine! It's only until I divorce Cheon Seo Jin.

601
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,690
When are you going to end that marriage?

602
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:14,220
Once the marriage registration is done, I become the biggest shareholder of Cheong Ah Group.

603
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,680
Once the house is turned over to me, I'll divide it and sell off immediately what's mine.

604
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,100
After I raise the value of the shares to max, I'll wash my hands off them. Don't you trust me?

605
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,500
How can I trust someone who tried to kill me?

606
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,640
If you were me, would you trust?

607
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,760
I already explained everything!

608
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,670
Nobody knows!

609
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:37,360
Like Sim Su Ryeon, suddenly one day

610
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,110
I may vanish quietly.

611
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,510
Get lost!

612
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:50,480
I don't feel like drinking with you.

613
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,410
We haven't finished talking!

614
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,390
What temper.

615
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,380
What's wrong with your face?

616
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,260
Who did this to you?

617
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,720
Stop this marriage immediately! It's a crazy thing to do.

618
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,340
Is it because Ju Dan Te knows your weakness? Don't be afraid.

619
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:36,510
There's no evidence to prove Eun Byeol is the true killer.

620
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:40,200
How did you know? Did that bastard tell you?

621
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,490
However Ju Dan Te threatens you, hold your ground firmly.

622
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,920
I will take care of Eun Byeol's sleep treatment.

623
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,250
Just say you know nothing.

624
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:54,070
He has evidence. Eun Byeol's necklace.

625
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,900
It has Eun Byeol's DNA and Ro Na's blood on it.

626
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,370
Even the recording where I confessed everything.

627
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:05,310
Why are you telling me this now?

628
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:12,520
How are you going to deal with this alone?

629
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:15,500
Don't patronize me.

630
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,770
I'm enough to control Ju Dan Tae anytime.

631
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:23,870
If you just take care of Eun Byeol, I will deal with the rest.

632
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,760
Please leave quietly.

633
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,620
It's my last request.

634
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:45,040
No way.  I'm not the one who did that, right?

635
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,500
No, it can't be. There's no way.

636
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,940
Why do I keep thinking of the trophy?

637
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:09,650
It's time for your medicine. Your Mom said you make sure to take it.

638
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,770
If I take this, will my headache go away?

639
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,360
Does your head hurt a lot?

640
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,800
What do we do? You went through the test materials only three times.

641
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,580
My head feels like it's going to burst!

642
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:30,980
I'm working on my math problems, but the numbers are crawling around in my head!

643
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:35,060
What if I really go crazy?

644
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,810
You've been doing great so far. Now, Ro Na is gone, too!

645
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,520
This isn't good. Enough studying today and go to bed early.

646
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,250
I'll wake you up early tomorrow morning. Come on.

647
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,890
How is Eun Byeol doing?

648
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:05,230
She's quite shaken up. Her mother's wedding is coming up, and

649
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,350
I think there's a problem with her memory circuit.

650
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:11,840
What about the medicine she takes? Does it keep her from remembering?

651
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,260
I already replaced the pills with vitamins, so the drug should have no effect.

652
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:20,890
She'll remember soon what she did.

653
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:24,500
No matter how hard she tries, she ends up back to square one.

654
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,450
I feel sorry for her.

655
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,600
  Seok Hun  

656
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:36,640
Why did you want to see me?

657
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,540
That there's a real killer who killed Ro Na

658
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,560
- I know. 
 - What?

659
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,490
Is that..

660
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:51,710
Eun Byeol?

661
00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:00,370
I have my suspicions, but I'm not sure.

662
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,710
I have no proof either.

663
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,810
I think my father is involved in Ro Na's death. 
  Cheong Ah Arts Festival 

664
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:11,910
  He has the necklace that Eun Byeol wore on the night of her performance.   

665
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:19,550
  Ju Dan Tae knows everything. That Eun Byeol is the killer.  

666
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:24,610
  He threatened Cheon Seo Jin with that and is going forward with the wedding.  

667
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:29,100
A good item is up for sale in Cheonsu District. 
  Golden Real Estate,  Licensed Real Estate Broker's Office 

668
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,110
Then, of course, I must buy it!

669
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:33,720
I will pay fifty million more than the highest bidder without fail!

670
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,910
No.  I will bid one hundred million more. I really will.

671
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:39,950
I will trust you, Mr. Hwang. Yes.

672
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:43,770
Is it already worth that much?

673
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:46,670
It's worth all the money we paid to Mr. Hwang.

674
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,410
When the land is truly coming into my hands,

675
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:52,100
I'll be moving onto the new chapter of my life.

676
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:57,500
On that parcel, there is going to be a 130-storey residential and commercial complex.

677
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,150
Next to it, Hera Palace will look so tiny.

678
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:04,770
Wow, really, Three Madams' information is powerful.

679
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:07,200
Hooray, hooray!

680
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,550
What did I tell you?

681
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,760
Didn't I tell you Kang Ma Ri Bathhouse was the conference room for the Ministers of Land, Infrastructure and Transport?

682
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,170
Who would've known I'd benefit from a scrubbing ahjumma in my life?

683
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:21,070
Let's send Je Ni's mom several cases of the finest Italian towels.

684
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:26,590
I'll say.  Honey, we played it perfectly.

685
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:29,200
Kang Ma Ri Bathhouse?  Is Je Ni's mom a scrubber?

686
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,150
- Alright. 
 - Gyu Jin, I love you.

687
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,310
Hey, Yu Je Ni!

688
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:53,240
Do you know it costs over $100 for a piece of that candy?

689
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:59,670
If your throat hurts, just go to a convenience store and get some mint candy.

690
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,510
Can you mind your own business?

691
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:06,840
Stop picking a fight and get lost.

692
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,930
Isn't that humidifier from Switzerland? It's an luxury item for someone like you.

693
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:15,210
Head to toe with designer brands.

694
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,650
You, really shouldn't be doing this.

695
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:24,270
Did you buy them for me? Did I steal from you folks?

696
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:27,780
I use them because I can afford them. What do you care?

697
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,520
I have to study so get lost.

698
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,300
Still, that really isn't right.

699
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:37,050
Your mom works to the bone to earn $10, $20 at a time by scrubbing bodies.

700
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,800
You should be frugal, too! Am I wrong?

701
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:44,180
What?  Who is doing what?

702
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,550
Hey, did you really not know?

703
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:51,160
When I heard your mom works with tears and sweat,

704
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,800
I was so moved. That's why I got you some gifts.

705
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:01,520
Hey, what are you waiting for? Present your gifts.

706
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,220
Bam, bam, hey!

707
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:12,410
How pretty!

708
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:19,660
So sore. Why are my wrists so sore?

709
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:23,280
It's not good if they break down already.

710
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:29,520
Ahjumma! Are you crazy?

711
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,600
Why are you drying these out in the living room? What if Je Ni sees?

712
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,420
- Ahjumma! 
 - I did it!

713
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,700
Je Ni!

714
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,970
I, um, what happened here is...

715
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:48,420
How long were you planning to hide this from me?

716
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,340
If you're too embarrassed to even tell your daughter about it, why do it?

717
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,580
Quit this job immediately!

718
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:59,950
How did you find out? I wasn't trying to lie to you.

719
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,870
- I'm sorry, Je Ni. 
 - What are you sorry about?

720
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:08,960
Did you steal? Did you get money by whacking people?

721
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,360
- No, it's nothing like that! 
 - Then why do you hide?

722
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,950
I never did a thing  that made me ashamed of myself before you.

723
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:18,760
Even if you're embarrassed, I can't quit this job.

724
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,240
What did I do wrong?

725
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,970
I did my best to raise you so you won't envy a chaebol's daughter,

726
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:29,000
and took care of you without any regret. Isn't that enough?

727
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:43,830
If you don't dry them thoroughly, they'll smell.

728
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:48,370
If you don't take care of your customers, you'll lose them all.

729
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:52,100
- Then what will we live on? 
 - What?

730
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,830
After what happened to Ro Na, I'm no longer scared or ashamed of anything.

731
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:02,850
I'm not scared of the kids, and I don't care if I don't make it to Seoul National University.

732
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,820
What I'm scared of

733
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,750
is someone who used to be by my side not coming back.

734
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,270
Dad's not even here, so we should be relying on each other.

735
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:22,900
What's the use of keeping it a damn secret? I'm your daughter!

736
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:27,170
Do I have to hear about your job from a jerk like Min Hyeok?

737
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,280
Je Ni.

738
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:36,450
I filled the tub, so come in when you're ready.

739
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:39,890
I want to see how good a scrubber you are.

740
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:42,810
Don't forget my banana milk either.

741
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:51,870
When did my princess grow up like that?

742
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:56,410
Since I got found out, should I tell her about her father, too?

743
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:57,810
Or not?

744
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:03,530
- Mom, what are you doing? The water's getting cold! 
 - Okay, okay, I'm coming in now!

745
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:06,890
I don't care for now.

746
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:10,110
What are you doing? I will do it for you.

747
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:13,310
Stay still.

748
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:17,250
I'm an expert who's been doing this for 25 years.

749
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:22,250
Wealthy CEOs are lining up to get scrubbed by your mom.

750
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,320
Do you not believe in my skills?

751
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:29,590
Look at all these dead cells! You've been scrubbing others, but you haven't youself, right?

752
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,430
A lot of dead cells!

753
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:36,470
What dead cells? I wash up every day!

754
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:41,680
You suck at this.  I'm going to learn how to scrub.

755
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,090
Why would you learn this?

756
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:48,350
You'll live in nothing but luxury after finishing Seoul National University.

757
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,770
That's why I've been working with great excitement.

758
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:54,090
Are you listening to me or not?

759
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:57,120
Lady, you talk way too much.

760
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,290
I won't ask you to pay. Just stay still.

761
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:04,180
At least for today.

762
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,350
Mom!

763
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,200
- Mom! 
 - Get your snacks and you should study.

764
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,040
Did you tell Dad to take me to the States with him?

765
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:58,940
He says he needs to visit his headquarters.

766
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,570
Go and clear your head. It'll be soon school break anyway.

767
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:07,160
Liar. You're kicking me off to the states so you can get married.

768
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,950
You're supposed to be my mom. How can you do this to me?

769
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:16,220
Mom! Can you not do this wedding?

770
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,820
Mom, I can't live without you!

771
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,790
Please, don't abandon me!

772
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:23,910
Mom, I'm so scared!

773
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:26,330
Eun Byeol.

774
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:32,780
You're everything I have. So don't get married.

775
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:37,300
If I must go to the states, come with me then.

776
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,770
As long as I have you,

777
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:45,250
I can even give up college. I mean it.

778
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:48,480
Why would you give up college? You worked so hard to get here!

779
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,310
Stop acting weak and do what I tell you to.

780
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,780
  I'm staying here to protect you.  

781
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:06,740
  To protect you from that devil.  

782
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,060
Why?

783
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:22,410
I told you I'm not mad.

784
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:29,100
It's fine. Just get ready for your wedding with Cheon Seo Jin.

785
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,930
You're really coming in a few days, right, Mom?

786
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:28,590
Of course.

787
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:33,170
I'll be there as soon as I settle the matters of the company and the Foundation.

788
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,750
Don't worry.

789
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,430
Go with your dad ahead of me.

790
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,170
I'm not sure if this is really the best option.

791
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:52,650
Don't let Eun Byeol catch on.

792
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:55,570
Don't say anything about me either.

793
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:59,110
I can never. I can't leave without you.

794
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:04,090
Let's kill Ju Dan Tae instead and run away. We can be together.

795
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:05,830
Stop with the nonsense, and get going.

796
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:08,110
Hurry!

797
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:10,160
Seo Jin.

798
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,940
Farewell.

799
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,780
 Don't become weak, Cheon Seo Jin. 

800
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:22,260
Today's your wedding. Did you send your daughter away without her seeing it?

801
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:25,680
I guess Ju Dan Te is  a lousy stepfather.

802
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,740
Why don't you mind your own business, and see yourself out of here.

803
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:34,040
You have no child, no husband. Why are you still here at Hera Palace?

804
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:39,760
I like it here.

805
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,420
I also like that you can't wait to get me out of here.

806
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:51,330
I'm also curious as to how happy you and Ju Dan Te will be in that penthouse.

807
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,310
What?

808
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:57,670
So I want to give you my heartfelt congratulations on your wedding.

809
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:02,110
See you later, happy bride, Cheon Seo Jin.

810
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:14,510
Why is the bride's face so puffy? Were you so excited you couldn't sleep?

811
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:18,940
If you can't wait like that, why didn't you tell me to rush the wedding?

812
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,880
This is what you need, right? You take care of the marriage registration.

813
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:34,050
I would have liked to rent out an entire hotel,

814
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:38,320
and made you the ultimate bride,

815
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:42,940
but your name nowadays is, well...

816
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:49,760
 Harvard Business Review 
 How to Lead with Purpose 

817
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:54,470
I hope you understand why we're having a quiet wedding at Hera Palace.

818
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:57,930
Yet, today, you're becoming the owner of the penthouse.

819
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:00,430
So you should enjoy it.

820
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,530
Did Eun Byeol leave?

821
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:06,280
The weather in California is going to be beautiful.

822
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,390
Don't you dare say her name.

823
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,800
We might be married, but Eun Byeol won't be your child.

824
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,750
She will never have anything to do with you.

825
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:16,020
What a pity.

826
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:20,360
I was so excited that I was getting another daughter.

827
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,550
They're really going through with the wedding.

828
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:29,280
Ha Eun Byeol left for California.

829
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,320
Left? Ha Eun Byeol?

830
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:41,070
Where are you going?

831
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,810
 Seok Hun  

832
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:53,400
Don't answer any phone calls, Eun Byeol.

833
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,380
 Seok Hun 

834
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,880
  5323, stop the car on the shoulder! 

835
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,130
 Stop the car! Stop! 

836
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:30,750
Don't get out, Eun Byeol.

837
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,720
Are you Ha Yun Cheol?

838
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,510
Yes, what's going on?

839
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:42,890
You're under arrest as the main suspect of Bae Ro Na's murder.

840
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:44,740
What?

841
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:47,500
What are you talking about?

842
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,770
Dad! What's going on?

843
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:53,110
What are you doing to my dad!

844
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:56,300
Park Jeong Sik who was detained on the murder charge has confessed everything.

845
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:59,120
He got paid by you and made a false confession.

846
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,730
Let's go to the station.

847
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:02,200
Wait! Wait!

848
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,510
Something's wrong. Wait!

849
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:04,960
Wait!

850
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,620
That's not true!

851
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:08,360
Wait! I have something to say to my daughter.

852
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:11,260
Eun Byeol! Grab a taxi and head to the airport now, okay?

853
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:13,340
- Dad! 
 - Eun Byeol, I'll be okay.

854
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,440
Don't worry and make sure to go!

855
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,130
- Dad! 
 - Eun Byeol, you can do it!

856
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,070
Let go of me!

857
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:23,050
Dad! Dad!

858
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:25,690
Dad!

859
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:28,250
Dad!

860
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,790
Dad!

861
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:36,630
Dad!

862
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:38,880
Dad!

01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:11,330
 Good job.

Ha Eun Byeol. What happened? What's going on?

870
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,920
Seok Hun. What am I going to do?

871
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,350
Thank you to all of you at Hera Club.

872
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:47,430
We're finally getting married.

873
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:49,320
You've suceeded.

874
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,100
You two look good together.

875
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,620
There, the star of the night, the bride!

876
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:21,050
Noona!

877
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:24,050
 You're wrong, Bae Ro Na. 

878
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:29,570
 I'm not letting you take anything away from me. 

879
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:34,480
 Neither my dad nor Seok Hun. 

880
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,350
 Nor the grand prize trophy. 

881
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,670
What's wrong, Ha Eun Byeol?

882
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:45,160
 Ro Na. It was Ro Na. 

883
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,510
 I did it to Ro Na. 

884
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:02,540
Smile.

885
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:06,670
Smile as if you're so happy you might die.

886
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:44,970


887
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,730
 Sorry for realizing this too late. 

888
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:54,490
 I loved you, Ha Yun Cheol. 

889

 You've got to learn some manners, Ahjumma. 

895
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:26,950
 I killed her.

 I'm going to make you regret this with your whole life.

 I kept thinking you don't seem a bad person.

 Why Ro Na died— 

902
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:40,460
 There is a trap.  I need you to catch Ro Na's real killer. 

903

 I'll take back what's mine even if I twist your neck.
