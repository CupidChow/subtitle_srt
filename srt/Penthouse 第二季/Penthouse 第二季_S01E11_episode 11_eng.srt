2
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,700
 I feel so sorry for Sim Su Ryeon. 

3
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,270
 She was too gentle a person to have been used and killed 

4
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,300
 by someone like you. 

5
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,710
Thank you.

6
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,150
For still remembering me.

8
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,040
What are you doing?

9
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,030
You're Su Ryeon!

10
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,000
You're indeed Su Ryeon!

11
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,770
Don't think about running away anymore.

12
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,010
I'm sorry for recognizing you so late.

13
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,450
Where are you?

14
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,190
Cheon Seo Jin, where the hell are you?

15
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,670
She went to the lesson room.

16
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,560
How dare she leaves without my permission?

17
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,480
I asked her to give me a lesson. To get ready for my final-term exam.

18
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,880
You didn't bring her here to make her cook, did you? Let me borrow her from you.

19
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,460
Tell her to get right back home when she's done.

20
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,050
Sure thing.

21
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,130
 I told him you went to the lesson room. You have a couple of hours free of him.    
   

22
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,950
Sir, take a look at this, please.

23
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,570
What is it?

24
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,980
Logan Lee?

25
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,520
Did Na Ae Gyo meet Logan Lee?

26
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,810
Yes. Apparently, they got together in secret at the end of the auction.

27
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,370
When did that damn guy crawl back into Korea?

28
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,220
What the hell is James doing not keeping track of his own son?

29
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,700
- Where is Na Ae Gyo now? 
 - She returned to the mountain villa.

30
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,760
The mountain villa.

31
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,620
Hey, it's me.

32
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,580
Do you know who Logan is?

33
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,510
Come to the mountain villa right away. It's urgent.

34
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,050
Got it. I'm on my way.

35
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,790
Bring the car around.

36
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,600
Help me, Yun Hui.

37
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,370
How can I trust you?

38
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,220
Naturally, you can't trust me. I understand.

39
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,230
But when I am where I am, what's the point of deceiving you?

40
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,240
I came to you willing to go to prison.

41
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,250
So?

42
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,280
What do you have to tell me?

43
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,290
On the day of the Cheong Ah Arts Festival,

44
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,790
Eun Byeol struck Ro Na with the trophy.

45
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,350
Ro Na fell down the stairs.

46
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,040
And it was Eun Byeol's dad who put that trophy in Seok Gyeong's locker.

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,060
We both were crazy with the single thought of saving Eun Byeol.

48
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,830
Knowing that, Ju Dan Tae began threatening me.

49
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,490
He had the Eun Byeol's necklace that fell off of her at the scene.

50
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,180
 Are you looking for this? 

51
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,820
In order to take my Cheong Ah Group away from me,

52
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,370
he took advantage of your daughter's death.

53
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,950
What's the difference?

54
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,060
It's still Eun Byeol who killed my daughter.

55
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,210
No! It may be Eun Byeol.

56
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,470
Or it may not.

57
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,290
Ju Dan Tae was also at the scene. Eun Byeol heard his ringtone.

58
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,690
Are you joking now?

59
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,230
Do you expect me to believe your daughter who barely remembers a thing?

60
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,590
I, I can prove it.

61
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,290
At the concert, Ju Dan Tae changed his clothes.

62
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,720
Isn't it suspicious for him to change right before the award ceremony?

63
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,030
Definitely there must be something.

64
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,830
 Either way, 
 Voice Spy 

65
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,370
  Bae Ro Na proved to be a pretty useful child. As much as Min Seol Ah. 

66
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,320
 Because those children who were nobody died at the time they did, 

67
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,210
 I could so easily get my hands on Sim Su Ryeon and 

68
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,290
 Cheon Seo Jin's assets. 

69
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,250
Are you framing Ju Dan Tae for everything at this point?

70
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,490
Do you really think you can prove his guilt with these few pictures?

71
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,740
He could've had plenty of reasons to change his clothes.

72
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,590
Believe me. I'm not doing this to save Eun Byeol.

73
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,170
What I'm after is the truth of that day.

74
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,530
Ju Dan Tae, that devil.

75
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,920
Help me to finish him off with my own hands.

76
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,440
I beg of you. Yun Hui.

77
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,070
Then come clean.

78
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,020
Confess everything you and Eun Byeol did to my Ro Na.

79
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,520
 Recording in progress 

80
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,660
Fine.

81
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,790
I'll tell all.

82
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,730
Who the hell are you?

83
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,980
What are you trying to pull off? Huh?

84
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,960
Logan!

85
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,110
How long has it been?

86
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,120
I thought your dear father kept you locked up, but I see you're a horse on the loose.

87
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,320
Ju Dan Tae!

88
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,480
What brought you here? No, no.

89
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,880
Rather, how did you find out about this place?

90
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,620
He followed me here all the way from the auction site.

91
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,580
Clearly, you haven't freed yourself from the grip of Sim Su Ryeon even in her death.

92
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,870
Apparently, I was too gentle with you last time.

93
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,150
Put him in the warehouse. I'll give him a good lesson.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,790
Let go. Let go! Let go of me!

95
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,160
What the heck did he tell you?

96
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,920
He marveled how I looked just like Sim Su Ryeon and asked what my connection to you was.

97
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,830
That lunatic.

98
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:33,210
The trouble is he knows about Chairman Jeong Du Man.

99
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,490
What?

100
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,590
He seemed to know we've been investing with the information from Jeong.

101
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,770
That scumbag threatened me demanding the truth.

102
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,290
By any chance,

103
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,590
didn't Sim Su Ryeon also know before her death?

104
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,100
No, she didn't. She couldn't have known anything.

105
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,000
It isn't likely that Jeong Du Man opened his mouth either.

106
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,050
Anyhow, go see him. If you probe him deep enough, something's bound to come out.

107
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,070
Talk to you later.

108
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,810
Mr. Hong, this is Sim Su Ryeon.

109
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,980
Let go!

110
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,020
Let go, you bastards!

111
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,910
You thugs.

112
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,260
Let go!

113
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,000
Hey, Logan!

114
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,680
Apparently, you got quite excited thinking Sim Su Ryeon came back from the dead.

115
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,840
What a shame. To be disappointing you like this.

116
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,710
Don't you have any fear? You shouldn't have coveted another man's woman.

117
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,640
You and your flimsy attempts to side with her is

118
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,610
what sent her to her premature death. You asshole.

119
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,960
I get that a young lord from an affulent family with too much

120
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,800
is wasting his time on earth obsessing over useless things.

121
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,270
Too bad. But your pathetic attempts at a payback has got to stop right here.

122
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,050
You son of a bitch.

123
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,730
Take it off.

124
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,470
What the hell? What just happened here?

125
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,050
Douse him!

126
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,100
Sir.

127
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,730
We got ambushed. Logan's people knew, and they followed us.

128
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,200
They replaced the driver. Obviously, they knew Logan was supposed to get in that car.

129
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,110
 Step on it.  

130
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,080
 What's that? 

131
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,130
 Just go. 

132
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,820
 Just step on it and go! 

133
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,940
 Who the heck are you? 

134
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,630
 Hey! 

135
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,020
 Are you alright, sir? 

136
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,770
You worthless jerk.

137
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,530
Didn't you even bother identifying the driver?

138
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,110
Damn you, seriously.

139
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,160
Na Ae Gyo?

140
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Wait, him and Na Ae Gyo?

141
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,870
 Calling Na Ae Gyo 

142
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,120
 How did it go? What did he say? 

143
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,220
What took you so long to answer that damn phone only now?

144
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,480
I was in the shower and dashed out to pick it up.

145
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,090
That temper, temper. Do you think I'm some pushover?

146
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,000
Forget it. I'll catch up with you later.

147
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,050
You, some piece of work.

148
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,290
This has been your plan all along. Right, Su Ryeon?

149
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,720
If you were going to rescue me, why did you call in Ju Dan Tae?

150
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,650
I had no choice in order to earn his trust.

151
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,510
He's already suspecting me knowing that we met privately.

152
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,920
We lived twenty years together. It's only a matter of time he begins to see things.

153
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,670
Why on earth are you doing something as risky as this?

154
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,460
Where have you been all this time? And not a word or one call from you?

155
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,150
You're alive. Why didn't you ever contact me?

156
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,630
Sim Su Ryeon is dead.

157
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,650
At that time two years ago.

158
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,930
Sim Su Ryeon is alive and she is right before me.

159
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,050
You and I have nothing to do with each other now.

160
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,120
I've got things to do as Na Ae Gyo.

161
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,260
Until I completely finish what I have to do, no one must know I'm alive.

162
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,960
That includes Oh Yun Hui.

163
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,190
How can I pretend that I don't know you?

164
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,040
Besides, you may end up in danger again.

165
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,550
Su Ryeon.

166
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,470
I regretted every single day of the last two years.

167
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,090
For the fact that I failed to protect you and

168
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:32,950
I left for the airport without you, I couldn't forgive myself, and that drove me crazy everyday.

169
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,280
 GPS Tracking Target Acquired 

170
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,500
  GPS Tracking Target Acquired 

171
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,460
Ju Dan Tae is coming.

172
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,200
Hurry up and leave. I can't help you again.

173
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,210
I can't leave. Let's go together.

174
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,780
I will never leave alone.

175
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,260
You did everything you could by bringing justice for Seol Ah.

176
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,020
Going forward, it's my problem now.

177
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,630
Don't get involved anymore.

178
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,980
Everything will be over in two weeks.

179
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,570
If my plans are ruined because of you,

180
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,430
I'll live in misery for the rest of my life.

181
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,650
And I'll resent you forever. Hurry and go.

182
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,290
Promise me one thing.

183
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,320
That you'll call me if you're in danger.

184
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,740
That you will never leave without me.

185
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,930
Hurry and leave.

186
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,320
Su Ryeon.

187
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,860
Thank you for being alive.

188
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,620
We have to pay off the remaining balance in full by tomorrow?

189
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,300
What kind of ridiculous condition is that?

190
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,460
I barely managed to buy that land through the auction.

191
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,400
We should be willing to do that much.

192
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,960
Today alone, the price of the land we own went up twenty percent.

193
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,890
Still, how are we going to raise fifty billion won in a day?

194
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,830
Well, we can scrape up anything worth money.

195
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,320
And you can get a loan with your penthouse as collateral.

196
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,190
That's ridiculous. I won't touch my penthouse.

197
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,940
Honey.

198
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:37,120
How much is that new safe that moved into your house worth?

199
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,170
Safe?

200
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,110
You mean Cheon Seo Jin?

201
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,080
We should try squeezing out of her what we can since we're in a rush.

202
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,560
Are you going to lose the downpayment of the fifty billion?

203
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,870
Everything got messed up because of Oh Yun Hui.

204
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,980
I'm positive Logan Lee is helping her from behind.

205
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,020
They definitely bought Ju Hye In's land and are now playing  us.

206
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,240
All the more reason why we can't give it up.

207
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,080
Are you going to let Logan Lee take the center of Cheonsu District?

208
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,210
Stop it!

209
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,010
Logan Lee, that bastard, didn't he come back to see you?

210
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,220
If he did,

211
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,240
you would've been notified.

212
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,350
Do you know how many security guards you have on me?

213
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,840
Did he really have feelings for Sim Su Ryeon?

214
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,670
He's been sticking like a leech interfering with all my plans.

215
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,770
But you can't just kill him.

216
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,760
I heard he's a rich man from America.

217
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,780
Sim Su Ryeon, that woman,

218
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,820
dead or alive,

219
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,620
is such a persistent woman.

220
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,430
Don't you think?

221
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,220
I'll call you tomorrow.

222
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,210
 The quantity of A and B—  

223
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,060
  Accelerated High School Math 

224
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,870
 Seok Hun 

225
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,330
 It's me. 

226
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,420
Is it really you, Ro Na?

227
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,260
Where are you?

228
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,130
Seok Hun.

229
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,990
Ro Na.

230
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,190
It's been about a week since I woke up.

231
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,830
They said I was talking nonsense for a while.

232
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,630
I had three surgeries that required my head to be opened up.

233
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,840
They say for me to be alive and talking like this

234
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,250
is a miracle.

235
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,740
I see. It's such a relief.

236
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,330
I thought you  really died.

237
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,350
Who brought you here? Did you contact your mom?

238
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,450
No.

239
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,210
Why not?

240
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,150
She'll be so happy when she finds out you're alive. Let's call her right now.

241
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,130
I can't yet.

242
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,640
But it won't take long.

243
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,130
Before that, I have something to tell you.

244
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,580
That's why I called you.

245
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,740
What is it?

246
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,160
The person who made me like this.

247
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,430
Could it possibly be ...

248
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,020
my father?

249
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,090
I so hoped it wasn't him.

250
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,120
I desperately hoped it wasn't. Why—?

251
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,270
Why does he keep taking away people I care about?

252
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,700
Why the hell?

253
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,000
I can never forgive him.

254
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,410
Seok Hun.

255
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,910
I'm going to kill him.

256
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,800
Seok Hun.

257
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,590
Mom?

258
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,490
Ajumma saved me.

259
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,150
M- M- Mom.

260
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,500
Seok Hun.

261
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,090
Mom.

262
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,370
I missed you, Seok Hun.

263
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,330
Mom, I missed you so much.

264
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,630
My son.

265
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,210
My son.

266
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,640
Cheon Seo Jin suggested helping each other.

267
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,850
Seeing how she confessed her wrongdoings,

268
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,020
I think she's sincere and can be trusted to a certain point.

269
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,740
We can use Cheon Seo Jin for our benefit.

270
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,260
She's already cornered, so there's nowhere for her to run.

271
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,730
I'm meeting Na Ae Gyo tomorrow to proceed with the contract.

272
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,920
Do you think it's okay to give her the land so easily?

273
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,730
Give it to her just the way she wants.

274
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,830
If it lands in Ju Dan Tae's hands, everything is done for.

275
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:16,380
Don't tell me. Do you still trust Na Ae Gyo?

276
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,430
She even deleted the wire tapping app.

277
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,840
We don't know where she is and what she will do anymore.

278
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,450
Do you think, without a plan,

279
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,850
I would've put that land up for sale?

280
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,810
I have a plan.

281
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,250
How much?

282
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,970
Fifty billion won.

283
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,570
Get it ready in cash by tomorrow.

284
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,120
Are you joking?

285
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,260
Who has that much money in cash?

286
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,550
If you don't, you can make it and bring it to me.

287
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,970
Take a mortgage out on your building or sell your diamonds,

288
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,470
or even steal your mother's money,

289
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,840
you are capable of raising at least that much money.

290
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:02,900
If not, Eun Byeol's safety can't be guaranteed.

291
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,520
I need it by noon tomorrow.

292
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,680
I'm in a bit of hurry.

293
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,180
Do that for me, will you?

294
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,950
 Sales Contract for Real Estate 
 Seller: Oh Yun Hui Buyer: Na Ae Gyo 

295
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,710
Yes, I'll check it.

296
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,910
I appreciate your effort for meeting the deadline, Honey.

297
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,590
The full balance was just transferred to you through wire.

298
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,900
Ah, yes. You managed such a large amount of money in one day. You're incredible.

299
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,610
Madam, you are very lucky.

300
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,790
At this price, you're really getting the best deal that there is.

301
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,790
Congratulations.

302
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,920
Can you leave us for a moment?

303
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,210
Of course. Since the remaining balance is paid off,

304
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,280
you two can take your time and talk.

305
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,890
I'll organize the contracts and return them to you.

306
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,240
You just earned a lot of money. Why the long face?

307
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,830
You look as though you really don't want to sell the land.

308
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,590
It's the land that Su Ryeon cared for.

309
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,450
I'm upset it's going to trashy people like you folks.

310
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,150
It's over now that you've got your money.

311
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,430
What's the point of your allegiance to a dead person?

312
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,260
I almost fell for it.

313
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,690
Don't you feel the least bit sorry to Su Ryeon?

314
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,100
She took your children in as her own and raised them for seventeen years.

315
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,130
What shady things have you been doing pretending that you are her?

316
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,430
What's your relationship with Chairman Jeong Du Man?

317
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,140
What weakness does he have that he turned over all the information about the redevelopment?

318
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,830
Are you curious?

319
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,580
But what can I do?

320
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,100
To someone who wiretapped my phone

321
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,910
and invaded my privacy, I really can't tell anything.

322
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,920
You. You look like someone who would stab me in the back.

323
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,200
You have the face of a traitor.

324
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,740
Why? Guilty?

325
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,450
Your guilt toward dead Sim Su Ryeon isn't the motive for your revenge.

326
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,610
Rather, you're ticked off because Ju Dan Tae betrayed you.

327
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:31,400
I know too well you'll run to him anytime when he beckons you.

328
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,940
You know what an unscrupulous man he is. Yet you fell for him because of his wealth and manners.

329
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,480
Did you lust after his penthouse that badly?

330
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,400
You became envious of Sim Su Ryeon for what she had. How dare you  think you can advise me?

331
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,830
Don't you see? How brutally I'm getting punished for it?

332
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,740
What else do you expect me to do when I lost my child?

333
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:58,150
Tell me the way to redeem myself. Whether you want me to die or kill, I will.

334
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,550
I am curious, though.

335
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:06,790
You were with her when Sim Su Ryeon died.

336
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,060
Then you surely heard.

337
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,840
What was her last word when Sim Su Ryeon died? Anything?

338
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,510
She didn't leave any word for you. So no need to get your curiosity piqued.

339
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:24,340
She must've said something for her children. Well, when they ask me later,

340
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,520
I feel obliged to tell them at least what their mother's last word was for them.

341
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,000
After all, she was the mother who raised them.

342
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,260
She said to run.

343
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,040
To run?

344
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,180
She said, "Go. Hurry and run."

345
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,080
As worthless as I am, she cared enough to tell me to run.

346
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,680
I betrayed her and even had the sadistic hope of her dying. Yet she told me to run.

347
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,430
Yes, what you say is right.

348
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:12,160
We are the same leeches sucking on Su Ryeon's blood. No need to blame each other.

349
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,290
Each of us deserves the life of waiting on divine punishment.

350
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,220
Oh Yun Hui!

351
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,510
Consider yourself mad, and do you want to try trusting me?

352
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:31,260
I have a fantastic plan to finish off Ju Dan Tae with one blow.

353
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,150
What was that again now?

354
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:40,720
You did say you wanted to get back at him. Do as you will with him.

355
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,800
All I care about is getting his money.

356
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,620
In return, you can't tell a soul about my existence.

357
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,520
How does that sound? Deal?

358
00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:00,020
No, thanks. I don't trust you either.

359
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,350
What about this as collateral?

360
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,870
You must protect your daughter. Whatever you do, you've got to protect your child.

361
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,860
Because you are a mother.

362
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:23,250
Turning vicious for the sake of her child is what a mother does.

363
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:29,250
A mother can do anything for her child.

364
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,640
If you change your mind, let me know. 
 Golden Realty   CEO: Hwang Geum Bong  

365
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,760
  Whatever you do, you've got to protect your child. Because you're her mother.  

366
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:54,180
 Turning vicious for the sake of her child is what a mother does.  

367
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,130
 A mother can do anything for her child. 

368
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,760
Eonni!

369
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,980
Eonni! Eonni Su Ryeon! Sis!

370
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,130
Eonni Su Ryeon! Sis!

371
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:21,500
Sis! Look at me, please! Eonni Su Ryeon!

372
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,870
Sis! Eonni! Eonni.

373
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,760
Eonni.

374
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,740
 She said to run. To hurry and run.  

375
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,600
 My little sister ♥️ 

376
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,440
 Housekeeper Ahn  

377
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,220
- Hello, Mrs. Ahn. Is there  a problem?
 -  Ma'am. 

378
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,450
 The Chairman took the kids into his study again. What shall I do? 

379
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,460
 Who are you? 

380
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,620
 Na Ae Gyo? What are you doing here? 

381
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,350
 What if Ju Dan Tae sees you? I have to go quickly. Our kids are in danger again.  

382
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:58,980
 Precisely that's why I'm here. I'll go to the penthouse.  

383
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,530
 Are you joking? Didn't I tell you everything on the phone earlier? 

384
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,460
 Our kids are locked up in his study.  

385
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,720
 Who knows what that lunatic Ju Dan Tae will do to them? 

386
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,990
 That is why I said I'm going in. A mad dog must be dealt with by another mad dog.  

387
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,260
 I'm in no state of mind to be chatting with you.  

388
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,950
 If anything happens to our kids,   

389
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,760
 I'll die. 

390
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,130
 Let me go.  

391
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,350
 I want to see my kids.  

392
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:41,640
 I'm leaving Korea soon never to return again.   

393
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,350
 I'm running to where Ju Dan Tae can never find me again.   

394
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,960
 So do me a favor.  

395
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,620
 Let me see my kids for one last time.  

396
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:31,110
 Be careful not to get caught. By nature, he is full of suspicion.  

397
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,950
 Wait a moment. 

398
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,000
 The flight leaves at eight tonight heading for America. 

399
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,150
 You'll be met by Logan Lee at the airport. Leave with him.  

400
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,180
 You can trust him, and he'll protect you in a safe place.  

401
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:58,290
 - What about you then?  
  - I must stay with the kids.  

402
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:11,780
 Thanks for everything, Sim Su Ryeon, for letting me live as you.  

403
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,390
 If anything happens to me, 

404
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,670
 I will scream for you to run.  

405
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:26,200
 If I do,  never look back and just run.  

406
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,620
 You've got to take care of my Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong.  

407
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,820
 After all, you're their real mother.  

408
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,340
 Seok Hun! Seok Gyeong! 

409
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,310
 How could you— 

410
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,050
 Chairman, are you in he—? 

411
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:52,170
 Eonni. 

412
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,110
 Eonni! 

413
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:01,910
 Eonni, I'll call the ambulance right away. Hang tight for a moment. 

414
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,660
 I can't hear you, Eonni. I can't hear you.  

415
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:13,690
 Run from Ju Dan Tae. 

416
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,460
 Eonn— 

417
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:28,850
 A murder at the penthouse? How can something like that happen at Hera Palace? 

418
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:34,420
 - Isn't this all a fake?  
 - Is that really Su Ryeon? 

419
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,990
 What in the world? 

420
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,600
 - There, isn't that Oh Yun Hui? 
 - Did she really? 

421
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,350
 Wait, did Oh Yun Hui kill Su Ryeon? 

422
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:50,380
 That, that, that crazy wench. Is she even human? 

423
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,090
Na Ae Gyo?

424
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,710
Get in!

425
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,140
 Chairman Jeong Du Man  

426
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:38,010
 You've got to take care of my Seok Hun and Seok Gyeong.  

427
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,020
 After all, you're their real mother.  

428
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:46,800
Thank you, Na Ae Gyo.

429
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,660
I'll avenge your blood, too.

430
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:18,440
More coffee, please. The aroma is even finer than usual.

431
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,570
Enough already. Go easy on her.

432
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,590
Do you think that apron suits her?

433
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,830
Get the helpers back, will you?

434
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,080
I'm fine. I can do this alone.

435
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,530
I won't be eating home anymore.

436
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,310
You don't have to set a separate place setting for me.

437
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,970
Sit back down. That isn't the table manners I taught you.

438
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:58,130
In fact, I haven't learned anything from you.

439
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,090
You little punk.

440
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,770
Ju Seok Hun! Stop right there!

441
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,460
You don't have to set mine either.

442
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,370
I might as well try a hard-core diet this time around.

443
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,230
Are you incapable of winning them over?

444
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,220
Can't you do a simple thing like catering to their taste buds?

445
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,860
Care for them as you would your Eun Byeol and see if they won't follow you.

446
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,560
I'll try. It's just that I've never done this before.

447
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,570
Once I get used to managing the household, I'll get the hang of it.

448
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:41,270
Cheon Seo Jin, Miss High and Mighty is acting all docile suddenly. I wonder why.

449
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,490
What changed your mind?

450
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,240
If you promise to stay away from Eun Byeol, I'll do my best to cooperate with you.

451
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,880
Acting happy isn't that hard.

452
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,990
I won't see Eun Byeol without your permission.

453
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,970
Do you really mean all that?

454
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,480
Just let Ha Yun Cheol take the sole blame for Ro Na's death.

455
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,040
If you do, I'll  hand over everything including  Cheong Ah Medical as you wished.

456
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,780
I'll think about it.

457
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,280
Thank you.

458
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,630
See, Cheon Seo Jin? That's it.

459
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:29,190
What a beautiful thing it is to acknowledge your loss.

460
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,790
Thanks to you, I'm having a good morning.

461
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,270
 Go on. Mock me as much as you  like. 

462
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:56,820
 If I'm to leave here as a corpse, I will, just as soon as I kill you. 

463
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,400
Did you look into it, huh?

464
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,810
Are you taking your sweet time? Come on, spill it out quick!

465
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:19,350
I got this secretly from MOLIT (The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport).

466
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:24,140
It's true Cheonsu District is getting developed in high confidentiality.

467
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,640
When?

468
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:30,340
As soon as within this week, they'll announce the development.

469
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,390
Within this week? That fast?

470
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:38,930
But anyway, who is feeding Ju Dan Tae with all the information?

471
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,230
It's Chairman Jeong Du Man. Apparently, the two go way back.

472
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,830
Jeong Du Man? He's a totally reliable source of information.

473
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,800
Chairman Jeong Du Man politely declined your offer.

474
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,640
What? Isn't this enough for him? Is that it?

475
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,910
By chance, is he implying he's cutting ties with me?

476
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,500
I, Gyu Jin, have come!

477
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,790
Assemblyman Lee, mind your manners, will you?

478
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:11,320
You don't barge in someone else's house without an appointment in advance. I'm busy now.

479
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,920
Why? Are you rushing to Cheonsu District to buy some more land?

480
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,570
How can I? I've sold all my buildings, and this house is all I have left now.

481
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,060
Don't accuse me of the things I'm innocent of.

482
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,780
Right, you sold all your buildings and put the money in one basket, Cheonsu District.

483
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:37,750
You gobbled up Number 27 in Cheonsu with your fifty billion plus your minion. That gives me indigestion.

484
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:43,140
Why didn't you snatch it away with a higher bid? The rich get richer, isn't that natural?

485
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,960
Wow. Gyu Jin is heartbroken.

486
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:49,880
Did you wrap the loyalty among us Hera Club members in a lettuce leaf and consume it?

487
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,460
I hear they'll announce the District development this week?

488
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,070
Where did you hear that?

489
00:42:55,070 --> 00:43:00,490
I'm the assemblyman of Gangnam District. I have at least  that level of intel.

490
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:08,150
Big Bro, come on. Just throw a few, good properties my way.

491
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,600
I'll give you the highest price.

492
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:14,400
I also really want to do that for you.

493
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,240
 Jajung Jae.   Prudence in your speech, action and carriage.

494
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,400
 Tagyeong Takjo.  Live free of all worldly dictates.

495
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,250
 Ilgeum Ilhak.  Live with purity and integrity.

496
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,540
Come on, my dear Assemblyman.

497
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,600
You once went on a hunger strike to protest unfair real estate investment practices.

498
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,490
If people see you salivating over a real estate investment,

499
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,910
how cheated would they feel? Don't you need your gold assemblyman's badge anymore?

500
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:42,090
This bastard. You're publicly attacking me with what I said in private. You traitor!

501
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:46,340
Do you think I can't buy that crappy land without you?

502
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,420
Crappy land?

503
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,830
If you're that confident, go ahead and get it for yourself.

504
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,890
What are you barking at me for?

505
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:55,910
Okay, fine. You and I go till the end.

506
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,550
I might as well buy off as much land as I can.

507
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,780
I sure hope you won't regret, you money-monger, no, you thug.

508
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,300
You dimwit, nothing like that will ever happen.

509
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:18,060
The announcement is in two days. The game's already over.

510
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:24,130
Here. I even sold my son's gold rings given to him on his first birthday.

511
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:26,740
You've got to show me the land you still have in Cheonsu District.

512
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:31,280
Whatever is fine. Even a trash site!

513
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,260
If you don't give me anything, I'll penalize and stop your business.

514
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:40,870
Jeez, how many times do I repeat myself? I really have no more land to show you.

515
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:47,320
Hence we're at your mercy. Will you do some sweet talking to the land owners, Mr. Hwang?

516
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,070
Mother, not "Mr. Hwang." Try, "Sir, Hwang Geum Bong."

517
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:53,630
You, zip it up.

518
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,100
I can't give in here.

519
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:02,040
I'm the visionary who once bought all the mulberry fields and developed a 15-storey apartment complex!

520
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,740
My mother-in-law is well-known in the industry for her big scale.

521
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,190
We'll be sure to repay you if you sell us good, quality properties.

522
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,500
We'll double your sales commission, okay?

523
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,640
We will!

524
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,840
Oh, my, my, I'm really going nuts.

525
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:25,670
Swear that you won't tell a soul.

526
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:28,440
I'm doing this especially just for the assemblyman.

527
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,210
- What is it?
 - Gather up.

528
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:40,150
This is the land where the best sports center will come in.

529
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,730
No one saw you, right? 
 When you are with Golden Realty, you become rich.  

530
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,520
Rest assured, no worries. I came in through the back door.

531
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,440
So, will the land come available, after all?

532
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:56,080
This is the perfect spot for a brand name goods department store. A parcel like this never comes out for sale.

533
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,840
It begs the question though. Why is the owner selling such good land?

534
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,500
She borrowed excessively from loansharks.

535
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,560
And her husband found out.

536
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,830
Oh, no, really? How unfortunate for her.

537
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:14,630
I'm buying it. All of it. Okay?

538
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,770
I hear you have some great land.

539
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:26,520
These are one-hundred percent pure gold bars.

540
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,600
In here are the certificates that guarantee their purity. Sell me the land.
 Certificate of Gold Purity 

541
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,040
 Golden Realty 
 Specializing in Redevelopment and Investment  

542
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:52,320
I've finished all the contracts without a problem and more importantly, at the highest prices.

543
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,620
Here, good job.

544
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:59,260
Sell them the rest of the land as well.

545
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,350
All the land in my name.

546
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:06,490
Oh, demand nothing but cash. No exception.

547
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,090
 If she'd known the person who killed her was her own birth father... 

548
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:28,080
 What, what are you doing now? 

549
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,810
 Tell her just once with all your sincerity that you're sorry. 

550
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:39,260
 Your daughter's gone not ever being cared for as a child should've been. I pity her. 

551
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,780
 At least, you can do that much, right? 

552
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:50,580
 I knew I was pregnant with Ro Na after our breakup. 

553
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:55,250
 You were already engaged to Seo Jin, and I couldn't return to you. 

554
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,260
 I met someone and I married him.  

555
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:01,200
 Sure, I told him about the child I was having.  
 Destiny 

556
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,470
 He was very fond of me.  

557
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:07,090
 And he promised to care for my child, too.  

558
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,740
 But he changed his mind all together when he saw the child that didn't look one bit like him.   

559
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,040
 Soon he spent more time outside home and ignored my child all together.  

560
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,510
 I feel sorry for the way Ro Na grew up.  

561
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:21,190
 She wasn't loved the way she should have been.  

562
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,350
No. That just can't be.

563
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:41,030
How could I not recognize my own child?

564
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:45,270
It's all a lie. Lie. Lie! Lie!

565
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:47,900
- Lie!
 - Hey, hey, Mister.

566
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,150
The proprieties, please. Shall we observe them, okay?

567
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:51,650
- Hey, Bro. 
 - Are you crazy?

568
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:54,380
Are you the only one with problems here?

569
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,450
Shut up! A thing like you!

570
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:02,170
Hey, hey, do you want to die?

571
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:06,230
Right. Kill me. I can't wait to die.

572
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,990
Teach him a lesson!

573
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,990
Hey, you all, pipe down!

574
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:23,940
You, damn all of you.

575
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,350
Hit me. Hit me harder!

576
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,740
Damn you punk!

577
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,030
Hey, hey, hey!

578
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,970
Didn't you hear what I said?

579
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,800
Let go!

580
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:42,990
Damn all of you!

581
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:50,730
Just kill me. Why aren't you killing me?

582
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:05,740
- What the? 
 - You startled me!

583
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,640
What is this? Why are you watching at my house?

584
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,220
Don't you have a TV at home?

585
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,650
I'm too nervous to watch it by myself.

586
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,550
It's today, isn't it?

587
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:20,590
You acted as though you were Oh Yun Hui's best pal, but you wanted to go by yourself.

588
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:24,000
Right?  When it comes to land and money, there's no big sister or little sister.

589
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,980
Okay, I admit it. I do.

590
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,700
While experiencing the incident, I felt many things.

591
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,920
You shouldn't be indiscriminately nice to people.

592
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,330
So, I'm making a comeback. To hang out with the old crowd.

593
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,500
- Please be quiet.  
 - Count me in. Oh, yes, I will.

594
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:42,410
- The news is starting. Turn up the volume. 
 - Yes.

595
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,990
 Korea's newest development boom has exploded. 

596
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,010
 Just a moment ago, the Cheonsu District New Town Plan was announced in a surprise move. 

597
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:52,120
 Let's hear from the Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport himself! 

598
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,170
 Hello. I am  Kim Gi Song , Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. 

599
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,200
  I am here today to— 

600
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,120
Wow! Gyu Jin! Bravo!

601
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:16,600
Coming through!

602
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:23,460
Guess what this is.

603
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,050
Russo Baltique Vodka!

604
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:29,620
It's vodka! Guess what!

605
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,870
It costs a whopping 1.3 billion a bottle!

606
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,990
When you drink something like this, now you're super rich!

607
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:49,070
Now I am filthy rich!

608
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:52,200
 A surprise announcement of an area redevelopment 

609
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,900
 is sending shock waves throughout all the industries involved. 

610
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,220
 Cheonsu District, a designated area of redevelopment, has been for the last 20 years  

611
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,550
Seventy percent of Cheonsu District. 
 named as the last york of Gangnam. 

612
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:04,320
 Whether it would be redeveloped or not has been the source of much speculation and anticipation.  

613
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,960
Everything is perfect now.

614
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,720
 The surprise nature of the announcement intensifies the level of shock.   

615
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,620
 The result of consulting how the area should be reconstructed also came out today.  
   

616
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,810
 The government increased the percentage of the land usage by changing its purpose.  

617
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:21,050
 It also stated loosening of the restrictions are also reflected in the consulting.   

618
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:26,580
 Cheonsu District will be reborn as a new hot spot in Gangnam with a large-scale redevelopment.
  

619
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:31,310
 Through a brand new city that's equipped with homes, convenience, and culture,  

620
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:35,030
 the government hopes to secure the momentum to facilitate new growth in the 21st century.  

621
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:41,350
 With the announcement, the prices of the real estate in the District are expected to soar. 

622
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:47,180
 Given the continued interest of many viewers, we'll keep up with our report on our SBC News.   

623
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:56,150
What a surprise! I thought we had no business to see each other.

624
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:01,530
Who knew I could get your help, Chairman Ju, in my life time?

625
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:09,370
What are you really getting at with that?

626
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:13,320
I'd rather not ruin my mood on a good day which is rare for me nowadays.

627
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:18,970
If you're bored having no one to talk to, go and see your friend in the kitchen.

628
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:24,160
Apparently, you weren't all that sure about the Cheonsu District redevelopment.

629
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,850
You canceled your contract just a day before the announcement.

630
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:35,290
- Canceled my contract? 
 - Oh, you didn't know?

631
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:41,680
To my surprise, Na Ae Gyo contacted me last night to cancel your contract.

632
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,930
It's a much-coveted property. I came to see why you suddenly changed your mind.

633
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:50,410
What kind of joke  is that?

634
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,940
She said she needed fast cash.

635
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,740
Since her need looked so urgent, I didn't even charge her the penalty.

636
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,780
It's better for me this way, though.

637
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:06,120
Who knew? The windfall of the redevelopment came through out of nowhere.

638
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:10,100
Who cancelled the contract without my permission?  I never agreed.

639
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:15,870
Oh, no. Could this mean, by any chance, Na Ae Gyo scammed you, Chairman?

640
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:30,450
Apparently, you trusted Na Ae Gyo a good deal. 
 Cancellation of Real Estate Sales Contract

Enough to trust her with your everything. That's not like you.

 Your call cannot be connected at this time... 

643
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:51,520
My money. Did she dare to run with my money?

644
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,260
I'm going to kill you, Na Ae Gyo!

645
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:13,570
- Did you trace her current location?
 - It's confirmed she's at a realty in Cheonsu District.

646
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:17,710
- I instructed the guys to hold her down there.
 - Go at once!

 Seller: Oh Yun Hui  / Buyer: Na Ae Gyo  

650
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,600
Have you lost it? What possessed you to sell my land without my permission?

651
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,660
Why is that your land? As long as it's in my name, it's mine.

652
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,460
So, is this your true color?

653
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,060
I was right. You've been meaning to betray me since two years ago.

654
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:11,090
Crazy? Why did you do something like this? Why? I trusted you all the way.

655
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:15,400
I've got to get paid for the years I lived as Sim Su Ryeon.

656
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,470
Blind trust in you won't get me anywhere. I've got to have something for myself.

657
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:23,180
Where is my money? What the hell did you do with it?

658
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:29,810
You fool. Do you think I'll open my mouth?

Get in quick before I crush your face!

662
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:57,840
Damn it, get her!

663
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,990
Hop on, hurry!

664
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,460
Damn it, bastard, don't lose them!

665

 DANGER 

666
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:04,880
 STOP 

667
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:44,050
Why did you come? What if you get caught?

668
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:46,290
They're already hot on your tail to kill you!

669
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:51,250
Doesn't matter. I'll stand by you even in my death.

670
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:54,710
Push me away if you'd like. But I won't go away now.

671
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:57,660
What's the matter with you?

672
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,190
What if something bad happens to you because of me?

673
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:04,660
What happened to Na Ae Gyo was because of me, too.

674
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:14,500
I'm not interested in anything else.

675
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,960
Except keeping you safe.

676
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:22,830
Go on with your revenge as you planned it.

677
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,800
What was your motive to kill young Bae Ro Na?

678
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,870
Did you kill her purposely because she was the archrival of your real daughter?

679
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:37,300
Did you do it upon the request of your real daughter?

680
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,640
What was the reason?

681
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,280
 Sweetie, Daddy's fine.  

682
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,640
 Dad.  

683
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:58,620
 Dad! Dad! 

684
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,580
 Dad! Dad! 

685
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,130
Dad!

686
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:08,650
Mr. Ha, won't you make a comment?

687
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,500
Dad!

688
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:55,650
Yes, it's me.

689
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,240
Tonight?

690
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,410
I'll get ready and wait for you.

691
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:09,000
She hasn't returned to the mountain villa.

692
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,780
You idiot. If you were her, would you have crawled back in there?

693
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:18,840
- The airport? 
 - The guys are out there.

694
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:24,680
Don't lose her. No matter what. If you do, you die in my own hands.

695
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,040
That idiot.

696

 Your call cannot be connected and is being directed to voice— 

697
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:38,100
Pick up your damn phone, Na Ae Gyo.

698
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:46,780
What's taking you so long? I asked for the wine a while ago!

699
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,780
Just who are you looking for like the way you do?

700
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:56,200
Who is Na Ae Gyo?

701
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:00,130
Why? Are you going to find her for me?

702
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:04,580
Drink slowly, or you'll get drunk.

703
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:08,540
Stop pestering me. Get out of my sight!

704
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:26,890
What the—? Seriously. 
 Your call cannot be connected at this time... 

705
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,420
Damn it.

706
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:41,510
The mountain villa and the airport are fully surrounded by Ju Dan Tae's men.

707
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,330
I expected something like this.

708
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:55,230
 Come to the warehouse with the money by 10 p.m., if you don't want to die.  
 Ju Dan Tae 

709
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,650
The time has come.

710
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,990
Everything will work out fine.

711
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:17,230
No worries.

712
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:02,690
Hello?

713
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:05,370
Ju Dan Tae is going to kill me.

714
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:09,780
Please help.

715
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,770
Here is...

716
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,340
Here is... Oh, no.

717
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:23,760
 True Love 
 Funeral Home and Crematory for Pets 

718
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:01,280
How's your stomach?

719
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,950
What happened yesterday?

720
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:05,840
You drank so fast that you got drunk.

721
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,370
Do you want some soup for your hangover?

722
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:12,700
No need. I just have a splitting headache.

723
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:17,820
Funny, why can't I remember anything? I didn't drink that much.

724
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:21,290
Where is my cell phone? It wasn't in my room.

725
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:24,890
I haven't seen it. Shall I try calling it?

726
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,740
I have an arrest warrant.

727
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:41,250
Dan Tae!

728
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:42,850
Don't step on this.

729
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,950
Dan Tae!

730
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:47,300
Dan Tae! Dan Tae!

731
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,650
Don't step on that either. Search the place.

732
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,100
You're Ju Dan Tae, right?

733
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,370
I am.

734
01:07:56,370 --> 01:08:01,750
You're under arrest for a murder and desecration of a human corpse. Arrest him.

735
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,300
What gibberish is that?

736
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:08,580
Just who did I kill? Are you folks crazy?

737
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:12,680
Na Ae Gyo died last night.

738
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:17,200
Is Na Ae Gyo dead?

739
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,390
Come with us to the station now.

740
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:20,830
Wait.

741
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,140
Dan Tae! What's happening?

742
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,900
You, killing a person? How can that be?

743
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:31,520
He can't even kill a bug. He's such a gentle man. Something's wrong!

744
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,360
Let go!

745
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,850
Alright then, can you testify where Ju Dan Tae was last night?

746
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:42,010
You know well I came home early and slept through. Tell them!

747
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:45,520
We use the separate rooms, so I'm not entirely sure.

748
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,220
Except that he drank and was in an agitated state.

749
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:53,300
Oh, he kept making calls looking for someone.

750
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,010
Who was it?

751
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:57,090
Well, he said it was Na Ae Gyo.

752
01:08:57,090 --> 01:09:00,280
What a crazy—. Have you gone mad? Get your hands off me!

753
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:04,840
I didn't kill her. Never. Show me the evidence, or I won't even take one step.

754
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,600
Get me Secretary Jo, and call Lawyer Jeong.

755
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,100
We've found these in the freplace.

756
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:15,820
They're gloves half burnt and a pair of shoes.

757
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,330
Collect them as evidence.

758
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:19,850
It wasn't me. I've never seen those.

759
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,960
In the morning, from the front door,

760
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,790
I saw the muddy footprints and thought it strange.

761
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:29,020
Did you really kill that woman?

762
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:31,930
The birth mother of your children?

763
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,830
You...

764
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,110
How did you know Na Ae Gyo?

765
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:39,870
Take him.

766
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:46,180
 Detective 

767
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:25,660
Your vehicle was cleary caputred in front of the storage and at the crematory.

768
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:29,870
You bumped the victim with the car and killed her. Then you transported her and burnt her at the crematorium, correct?

769
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:33,250
The owner of the crematorium, after getting money from you,

770
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:36,750
testified already  that he let you use his facility anonymously.

771
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,410
I've never done anything like that. Don't you hear?

772
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:42,900
I'm going crazy here.

773
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,530
I drank last night and fell asleep in my own bedroom, for sure.

774
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:49,860
When I didn't take one step outside my home, how could I kill a person?

775
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,560
If you don't trust me, ask my wife, Cheon Seo Jin.

776
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,090
She said she couldn't confirm your alibi.

777
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:57,130
What- what- did you say?

778
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:02,000
That woman is lying. I swear, I'm innocent.

779
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,750
All of you are getting fooled by some ridiculous scheme.

780
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:08,670
I swear I never visited some storage, much less a crematory.

781
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:11,390
If you doubt me, check the CCTV cameras at Hera Palace.

782
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:13,830
See if you can see me leaving home at night.

783
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:17,550
When you spotted the muddy footprints in the hallway, approximately what time was that?

784
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:20,580
I saw them on my way to collect the morning newspaper.

785
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:24,300
It was probably around five in the morning.

786
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:27,180
That only means he left the house at night.

787
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:31,470
What's strange is the CCTV cameras at Hera Palace

788
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:35,570
do not show your husband leaving home after 8 p.m.

789
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:40,290
Is there possibly another exit?

790
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,070
We're talking about a murder here.

791
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,910
I need you to testify truthfully.

792
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:06,570
What is this place for?

793
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,630
This is where he punishes the kids.

794
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:14,860
I myself came to know this recently because it hasn't been that long that I married him.

795
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:16,320
Take pictures in there.

796
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,970
Yes, Sir.

797
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:20,440
And this

798
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:24,240
leads to the pathway out without going through the Hera Palace water fountain.

799
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,960
Inside is an elevator that leads directly to the parking lot.

800
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:32,900
Is it probable then that he could've used this passage last night?

801
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:37,840
Call the Team Captain and let him know we've found the secret passage.

802
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,550
Yes, Sir.

803
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:46,080
He might be hiding some important clues in here.  Run a thorough search.

804
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,040
I've found something.

805
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,830
It's an urn.

806
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:53,860
What in the world? That's absurd!

807
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:57,550
Send it immediately to National Forensic Service for human remains and its DNA.

808
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:59,060
- Yes, Sir,
 - How terrible.

809
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:06,410
Okay.

810
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:13,410
Human remains are found in the study of your penthouse.

811
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:15,840
Human remains?

812
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,290
What crazy talk is that?

813
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:21,760
Why would I have human remains in my house?

814
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,120
You swore to kill Na Ae Gyo. I have a witness for that.

815
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:32,420
What witness? I slept through the day. Who witnessed me doing what?

816
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:34,780
I'm the witness.

817
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:42,480
I heard him clearly when he said he'd kill Na Ae Gyo.

818
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,540
Oh Yun Hui!

819
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:49,570
 CCTV Recording in Progress 

820
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:52,620
What kind of bullshit is this?

821
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,640
I met Chairman Ju in his penthouse yesterday afternoon.

822
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:03,500
He was enraged with Na Ae Gyo.

823
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:08,750
I got so startled by the look of his eyes I thought I should record him.

824
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:13,290
 My money. Did you dare to run with my money? 

825
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:16,460
 I'm going to kill you, Na Ae Gyo! 

826
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:22,000
You have a clear motive for your crime, and all the evidence points to you. Do you still deny, Chairman Ju?

827
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,520
Oh Yun Hui, you bitch.

828
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:40,700
Search the place top to bottom.

829
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,550
Yes, Sir.

830
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,910
Hey, remove this.

831
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:31,350
I did wrong. I did wrong.

832
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,810
Take it easy. We're the police.

833
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:36,560
Relax, relax, we're the police.

834
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:43,980
What's your name?

835
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:50,660
I'm Sim Su Ryeon.

836
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:54,650
A-A-Are you being locked up in here?

837
01:15:54,650 --> 01:16:00,270
Ju- Ju Dan Tae locked us up in here.

838
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:04,230
How long have you been in here?

839
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,570
What's today's date?

840
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:20,280

842
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:43,120
 - Who is alive?
 - Sim Su Ryeon, that woman is back.  

843
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,420
 - It's payback.  
  - Damn it, what payback? 

844
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:47,610
 He lost money, he got betrayed, and he became a murderer. 

845
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:50,160
 I won't let you be lonely in jail. 

846
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,740
 What wrong have we done? 

847
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,320
 It's time for you to reap what you sowed. 

848
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,060
 File for a divorce right away. 

849
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,300
 Do you think I'll die alone? 

850
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:58,300
 Don't ever disappear from me. 

851
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:03,000
 You've got to protect your kid no matter what because you're a mother.
