 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival 

2
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,340
 Cheong Ah Arts High School 

3
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,720

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,250
 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival 

5
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,500
The highlight of the 28th Cheong Ah Arts Festival is

6
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,400
the grand prize for vocal music for the divine voice of ...

7
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,120
- Cheong Ah Arts High School senior—
 - Ahh!

8
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,480
Down there! There!

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,330
- Wait for me. 
 - What's going on? 
 - Oh, my.

10
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,160
- Oh no! 
 - What's this?

11
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,010
 Four Months Ago
 New York

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,670
 SEOJIN CHEON
 CONCERT 

13
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,820
 Episode 1 

14
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:30,110
♫ lo sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere, 
  Ennio Morricone: "Nella Fantasia" 

15
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:43,150
♫ Como le nuvole che volano

16
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:51,660
♫ pine' d'manita

17
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,960
♫ O my soul, soar high

18
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,710
♫ O the world, bless us

19
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:17,660
♫ Passare. Oh, passare!

20
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,120
Bravo.

21
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,160
Thank you for inviting me, Chairman.

22
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,370
I am more grateful to you for coming.

23
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,330
These Korean-American entrepreneurs here in this room

24
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,620
chose you, Chairwoman Cheon, as the one they wanted to see most.

25
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,340
You know that my wife is your fan, too, don't you?

26
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,040
I'm honored.

27
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,940
You're so beautiful, Madame.

28
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,220
Do you know how hard our Korean American Association worked to bring you here, Chairwoman Cheon?

29
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,650
We took advantage of every influence we could.

30
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,250
But why didn't Chairman Ju Dan Tae come with you?

31
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,570
He had an important business to attend to.

32
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,030
It's very regrettable that he couldn't join me here.

33
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,920
We thought he'd accompany you.

34
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,190
So we especially reserved the best room at this hotel.

35
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,820
- We heard that the two of you would be engaged soon.
 - Oh, wow.

36
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,690
He's calling me now.

37
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,470
He's probably dying of curiosity.

38
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,440
Excuse me for a moment.

39
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,320
I should see your beautiful performance with my own eyes. What a shame.

40
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,200
I know, you should've made time for a day like today.

41
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,930
I was quite amazing today.

42
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,070
But this involves Cheong Ah Arts Center, which is as important as you.

43
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,100
I can't be sloppy about it, can I?

44
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,310
Though I'm not with you, you know that I think about you all the time, don't you?

45
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,460
Is the construction going well?

46
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,570
You can look forward to it. I'll make an absolutely perfect opera house for you.

47
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,720
What's on your schedule next?

48
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,280
I'm so tired I want to collapse and fall asleep.

49
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,360
I'm returning to Seoul tomorrow on the first plane.

50
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,070
Alright, see you at home.

51
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,710
You must've been tense for the performance. It wouldn't be bad for you to drink a little.

52
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,140
Love you.

53
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,770
I love you, too. Honey.

54
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,650
Who... ?

55
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,280
It's been a long time.

56
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,370
You...

57
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,490
What brings you here?

58
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,310
I had some business in New York.

59
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,100
So you had a performance? I guess you're staying here, too?

60
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,730
Yes.

61
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,590
You look good.

62
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,440
Seeing you like this, I feel you're unfamiliar. How long has it been?

63
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,460
I guess it's been about two years.

64
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,200
Go on in. You're drunk.

65
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,400
Are you still single?

66
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,100
Should I take you up to your room?

67
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,280
Oh gosh, really.

68
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,940
Did you leave something behind?

69
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,400
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

70
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,920
Looks like you put your hands on the wrong woman.

71
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,770
Who sent you? Was it Ju Dan Tae? Bastard!

72
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,720
Break his hands.

73
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,770
No more surgery for you, Doc.

74
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,260
Throw his ass in the water.

75
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,010
No, no. No!

76
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,660
You did well.

77
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,230
Clean things up so there won't be problems.

78
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,890
Ha Yun Cheol.

79
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,970
Why did you do that?

80
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,580
Eun Byeol! Are you already going to school?

81
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,300
It's not even seven yet.

82
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,560
Did you forget? I have the practical exam tomorrow.

83
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,440
I have to stop by the lesson room before school.

84
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,420
I rushed home so I could eat with you.

85
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,080
My New York concert was—

86
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,580
I'm sure it was great. Tell me about it later.

87
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,240
  Dan Tae: Are you back?  

88
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,120
  Come eat breakfast. I'll be waiting. 

89
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,100
  Die! Just die! 

90
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,190
Something like this came in again.

91
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,120
The level of intimidation is way out of line.  It's so horrible I don't even want to talk about it.

92
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:38,230
I'm sure it's Oh Yun Hui. The only person who's capable of something like this is her.

93
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,110
Calm down. It might not be her.

94
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,560
There's a lot of people who hate you.

95
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,620
Do you know how many times this has happened?

96
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,370
No one would do something this dangerous if it were not for revenge.

97
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,000
I feel like I'm being watched lately. You know it, too.

98
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,070
As long as Oh Yun Hui is alive, we can never be completely free.

99
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,310
It's already been a year since Oh Yun Hui disappeared.

100
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,980
If she hasn't been caught yet,  I gather she died while on the run,

101
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,240
or in hiding. It's one or the other.

102
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,750
I won't believe either. Not until  her corpse is found.

103
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,030
Are you keeping an eye on Oh Yun Hui's daughter?

104
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,210
She's the daughter of a runaway murderer.

105
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,740
The police are watching her 24/7.

106
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,700
And I have someone following her, too. So no worries.

107
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,750
Seeing that she can't come see her one and only daughter,

108
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,950
I'm sure she's dead.

109
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,050
- But... 
 - Stress isn't good for your body.

110
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,720
You're being too sensitive lately.

111
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,680
What's this?

112
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,130
Did you cook all this?

113
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,180
I missed you very much.

114
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,790
You look even prettier today.

115
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,490
Thank you.

116
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,350
How was the party?

117
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,500
Did you get drunk?

118
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,660
Did anything happen?

119
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,560
What could've happened?

120
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,260
I drank just enough to feel good.

121
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,820
 National Assembly Building in Yeoido, Seoul 

122
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,940
As it causes much despair for those who don't own their homes,

123
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,950
the current policies on housing development

124
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,690
must be repealed right away!

125
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,180
Repeal! Repeal!

126
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,280
 Assemblyman Lee Gyu Jin!
 10th Day of Hunger Strike 

127
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,870
Ministers of Housing and Urban Development must  apologize,

128
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,560
and resign!

129
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,570
Resign! Resign!

130
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,100
On the fifth day of this hunger strike, a citizen
 Reformation of housing development 

131
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,970
personally put this handmade scarf on me

132
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:49,460
and said his lifelong dream was to own a house of his own.

133
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,470
I, Assemblyman Lee Gyu Jin,

134
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,500
will make that citizen's dream come true, for sure!

135
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,790
- Assemblyman! 
 - Honey!

136
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,410
Assemblyman!

137
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,380
Assemblyman, oh no!

138
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,360
Assemblyman!

139
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,170
Assemblyman!

140
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,670
Assemblyman!

141
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,630
- Don't leave like this! 
 - Assemblyman! Breathe!

142
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,230
Assemblyman, you can't die like this!

143
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,450
I'm so hungry I'm going to die.

144
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,290
My hands start shaking when I miss even a meal.

145
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,660
I already set up everything for you.

146
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,640
Your mother sent herbal chicken soup, japchae, and grilled shrimp. All your favorites. Eat up.

147
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,940
How long do I have to put up with this wretched hunger strike? Do you know how cold it is?

148
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,990
My mouth is about to freeze.

149
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,310
What kind of sorry act am I putting on?

150
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,580
Your performance was excellent today.

151
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,130
Since everyone saw you faint, you can fold this act without arousing suspicion.

152
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,150
Once the ban on redevelopment is lifted, apartments will be built without problems.

153
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,990
And banks are eager to give out their loans.

154
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,940
Then, all problmes will be solved, right?

155
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,410
- Hey, aide. 
 - Yes, sir.

156
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,700
You're making me do this on purpose, aren't you? To screw me.

157
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,210
No, but for you to make up for the mistake you made at the state audit—

158
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,700
You. Don't you ever make a mistake?

159
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,420
I see. You don't.

160
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,850
Then, why don't you become an assemblyman?

161
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,890
Stop it.

162
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,410
I'm sure your aide is working hard. Look at his face.

163
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,220
He's looking down on me because it's my first term.

164
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,560
I'm the fifth wealthiest assemblyman in Congress.

165
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,100
While living clean and corruption free, do you think it's easy to amass that kind of wealth?

166
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,540
Honey, stop all that. And look at this.

167
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,990
They released an article.

168
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,260
Chairman Ju and Teacher Cheon, 
  J King Holdings' Chairman, Ju Dan Tae is engaged to Cheong Ah Foundation's Director, Cheon Seo Jin 

169
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,420
are getting engaged.

170
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,670
For both, this is their second marriage after cheating on their spouses.

171
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:57,680
They sure think theirs is the  love of the century. Why else do they go to the press when their engagement is still months away?

172
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,220
I heard that Cheong Ah Foundation and J King Holdings are merging.

173
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,420
So their respective stocks have risen quite a lot.

174
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,040
Oh, oh, oh!

175
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,790
Hey, Lee Gyu Jin, didn't I tell you to buy those stocks?

176
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,890
How can an assemblyman not even know that?

177
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,130
Hey, come here.

178
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,530
I asked you to tell me. Did you buy them or not?

179
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,430
All the stocks were confisticated.

180
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,070
Are you crazy?

181
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,440
I made you a man when all you did was hopping around in the Internet searching for your next gig.

182
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,610
Hey. Get out.

183
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,360
Go back to your home.

184
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,760
- Get lost.  
 - I'm sorry.

185
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,770
Why you—

186
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,080
  Cheong Ah Art School. 

187
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,760
Eun Byeol, are you here?

188
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,780
Eun Byeol, give me your bag. It's heavy, right?

189
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,790
This is chocolate my dad bought for me.  Eat some while you study.

190
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,780
Eun Byeol, this is the new item for this season.

191
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,530
My mom bought it at the department store just for you.

192
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,250
You look really pretty today.

193
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,310
You face is brighter than my future.

194
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,230
Eun Byeol. Let's go play at my dad's hotel after school today.

195
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,810
No, I have a lesson today.

196
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,330
Then, do you want to go with me to a restaurant tommorow?

197
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,810
No, I'm busy.

198
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,530
  Faculty restroom 

199
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,130
This is huge.

200
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,720
J King Holding's Chairman, Ju Dan Tae is engaged to Cheong Ah Foundation's Director Cheon Seo Jin?

201
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,660
Wow, this is really dynamic.

202
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,470
They're here! They're here!

203
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,750
Awsome!  I hear they announced their engagement today.

204
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,210
It's the hottest news at the moment.

205
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,870
Ju Seok Gyeong, how does it feel to become sisters with Ha Eun Byeol? Who's the older sister?

206
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,930
Sisters, my ass. How annoying.

207
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,390
Why should you be annoyed?

208
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,270
Do you not like my family that much?

209
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,010
For me, I'm happy that we are becoming sisters.

210
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,210
Let's get along well, Ju Seok Gyeong.

211
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,240
Has that wrench gone crazy?

212
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,200
Don't do anything.

213
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,910
What's wrong?

214
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:38,190
What the heck.

215
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,050
Really!

216
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,650
 Designated seat for the outcast 

217
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,780
  Bae Ro Na 

218
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,520
It's her.

219
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,800
- It's her right?  
- A murderer's daughter?

220
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,100
- So disgusting. 
 - I'm scared.

221
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,370
It's her, isn't it?

222
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,550
Look how brazen she is, walking around with her head up. 
 Bae Ro Na's mom, the murderer 

223
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,800
You're a murderer's daughter. 
 Get lost.  Bae Ro Na, the murderer's daughter 

224
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,470
I got chills. I heard her mom stabbed someone to death. 
 Bae Ro Na's mom, the murderer! 

225
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,670
The psychopath's DNA is in her.

226
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,590
She's a potential criminal, too.

227
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,830
Don't mix with her.

228
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,740
Get lost, get lost. I said get lost!

229
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,310
- Nice. 
- Amazing.

230
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,160
Is everyone here?

231
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,770
You're all here.

232
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,470
Next year, you'll be seniors with college years ahead of you.

233
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,830
Starting today, we're beginning a special study class to go to Seoul University.

234
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,900
So make sure to meet back here after school.

235
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,480
Plus,

236
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,110
these are the in-school competitions you can add to your school records and personal statements.

237
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,530
To make sure your choices won't overlap and are evenly distributed among you,

238
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,400
I made a list of some possible choices.

239
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,430
I do this under the guidance of the Director and to help you go to the schools of your choice.

240
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,410
Hence, you guys need to do what I tell you to do.

241
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,360
Now, go to your seats and fill out the applications.

242
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,530
 Application for In-school Competition 

243
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,840
 Next on the news, the engagement of Ju Dan Tae, Chairman of J King Holdings 

244
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,140
 and Cheon Seo Jin, Chairwoman of Cheong Ah Foundation has just been announced. 

245
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,620
 They've been continuing their relationship over the years  and 

246
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,920
 just recently, they've pledged to marry each other. 

247
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,580
 Since the murder case at Hera Place, J King Holdings has stood by 

248
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,820
 Chairman Ju Dan Tae who lost his wife in that murder. 

249
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,270
How are you, sir?
 CEO Hyun Seo Joon of J King Holdings stated through a press release  

250
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,860
Never mind how I am. 
 that the two people made the difficult decision of starting afresh. 

251
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,970
Hey, who are the people out there? 
 And he urged others to join him in congratulating the couple.  

252
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,380
Are you really the daughter of the murderer?

253
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,160
Are you really the woman's daughter?
 Wanted: Murder suspect on the run 

254
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,260
Hey, get lost this instant. Get out quick.

255
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,060
Out, out.

256
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,810
Get out, out.

257
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,560
Out, out.

258
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,240
Bae Ro Na, can I speak to you for a moment?

259
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,280
Has your mother contacted you at all? You've met her, right?

260
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,510
Please say something, Student.  Giave a statement.

261
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,980
Come on, come on, tell us something, Student.

262
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,950
Hey, come on, kid.

263
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,200
You've seen the announcement of our engagement on papers, right?

264
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,250
Congratulations, sir. And Mom, congrats.

265
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,880
Thanks, Eun Byeol.

266
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,010
Most importantly, I hope you kids will get along with each other.

267
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,560
There's no reason why we can't.

268
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,450
Now we, too, live in this penthouse, right? I like the place a lot.

269
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,640
Do you two have anything to say?

270
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,700
Not really.

271
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,530
I'd like be excused.

272
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,790
Where's your manners? Sit down. The adults are  still eating.

273
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:19,230
You know me well. I can't digest my food when I eat with annoying people.

274
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,880
Hey, Ju Seok Gyeong.

275
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,990
Go on and eat. The steak is quite tasty.

276
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,740
Get up.

277
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,670
Don't act like a child. This marriage is a business deal before anything else.

278
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:53,880
In other words, you making me irritable like this won't help your dad.

279
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,480
You give me the creeps.

280
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,380
Does my dad know how you really are?

281
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,450
Don't cut me off when I speak. That's rude.

282
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:08,540
I won't forgive your insolence as long as you're part of my family.

283
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:15,360
What a shame. You wouldn't be acting like this if you were just, a tad smart.

284
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,220
Clearly, your late mother didn't raise you well.

285
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,040
Watch your mouth. Don't you dare talk like that about my mother.

286
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,450
It's  you  who should watch your mouth.

287
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,230
I don't know what and how you did things before.

288
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:33,000
Going forward, I won't allow you to do things that tarnish my name.

289
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,450
Behave, Ju Seok Gyeong.

290
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,950
How do you like the lemon salad? I heard it's your favorite, so I made it myself.

291
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,580
Did you make it yourself? Really?

292
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,880
It's just marvelous!

293
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,340
Is there anything you  can't  do?

294
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,660
You're from a good family. Besides, you're rich and handsome.

295
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,010
On top of all that, you're good with cooking, too.

296
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,040
I'm glad you find the salad delicious.

297
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,380
Can I tell you something, though?

298
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,300
You shouldn't try too hard when my mom isn't around.

299
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,290
Sorry?

300
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,200
I'll tell her you're very good to me.

301
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,130
So you can relax around me.

302
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:50,780
It's just that I'm sorry to see you trying so hard.

303
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,890
Something's nagging me.

304
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,500
Or, am I just being too sensitive?

305
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,470
 You die!  -   I hate you.   - Devil's voice!! 

306
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,370
Secretary Do is looking into all the CCTV footage in the security room.

307
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,820
He says he hasn't seen yet the record of a stranger entering or leaving. still, I'm petrified.

308
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,010
Why a thing like this happens just as we announced our engagement?

309
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,000
Someone came up so close to be right under my nose.

310
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,940
What if this is Oh Yun Hui? What if she came back?

311
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,710
She's a suspect on the run. She can't gain an easy access.

312
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,490
If it's not her, then who? Who did this evil thing?

313
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,520
We should find out.

314
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,940
I'll beef up the security. So don't worry too much.

315
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,180
You didn't have to take away her house from her.

316
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,680
When she sees her daughter living out of room-and-board, she'll go crazy enough to lunge at us with a knife.

317
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,230
If I hadn't framed Oh Yun Hui with embezzling public funds, I would've put myself in danger. I had no choice.

318
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:26,060
Still, it wasn't prudent of you to have messed with Bae Ro Na.

319
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,540
A mother who lost everything has nothing to fear.

320
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,350
You

321
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,590
made a mistake.

322
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,940
Housekeeper Yang, I didn't put you in charge of stopping that kid just to be told what I'm hearing now.

323
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,550
You disappoint me too often lately. How can I trust you?

324
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,120
I apologize, Chairman. Forgive me.

325
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,760
I apologize. I apologize again, sir.

326
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,050
Forgive me, forgive me, sir.

327
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,110
Why are you here again?

328
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,920
You're coming back from seeing your mother, right? Where did you meet her?

329
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,860
Who gave it to you? Your mom?

330
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,350
Your mom came for you, correct?

331
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,640
No, she didn't.

332
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,320
Where is she then? Where's she hiding? Tell me!

333
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,810
I swear I also don't know. If you know where my mom is, please tell me.

334
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,480
Stop coming here. How long will you keep this up?

335
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,780
Until that murderous mother of yours shows up,

336
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,930
I won't let you run away from the reach of the Chairman.

337
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:06,230
If I see you contacting or seeing your mom,

338
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,860
I'll kill you then with my own hands.

339
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,970
Understand?

340
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:25,100
What am I supposed to do? I have nowhere to run anymore.

341
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:31,140
I want to see my mom just once even if I'd have to die for it.

342
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:43,920
That dummy. Why did she let that woman take away the sandwiches?

343
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,470
Yu Je Ni.

344
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,900
What are you guys doing here? Did you follow me here?

345
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:01,170
I told you she's acting weird lately. She's late for school every day.

346
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,830
She's fooled all of us quite expertly.

347
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,850
Tell us the truth. Have you been friends with Bae Ro Na all this time?

348
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:12,630
Well, it's not like that. What happened was—

349
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:18,090
So you've been buying her food and meals? Come on, tell us.

350
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,210
Yes! I ate breakfast with her this morning as well. Don't you feel sorry for her at all?

351
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,100
She had no one. No father and mother.

352
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:29,380
She's the daughter of the murderer who killed my mom. Because of her, I lost my mom.

353
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,360
It wasn't Ro Na's fault.

354
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,640
So I take it that you're on Ro Na's side.

355
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,720
I'll let teacher, Ma Du Gi know starting tomorrow you're dropped from the class studying for Seoul University.

356
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,640
Come on, Eun Byeol.

357
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,140
 Die! Die! 

358
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,940
You unlucky bitch.

359
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:59,350
Get your hands off Chairman Ju. Ju Dan Tae is my man.

360
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:03,590
No woman will take him away from me.

361
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,970
 Die, just die! Cheon Seo Jin.  
 Death 

362
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:12,630
 Die, just die! Cheon So Jin. 

363
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,070
 Is that you, Housekeeper Yang? 

364
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,470
Madam, what are you doing here at this hour?

365
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,480
My goodness.

366
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:34,960
I thought I've seen those white sneakers before. I guessed it right. It's you.

367
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,230
Is that little, flimsy thing enough to curse me?

368
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,640
Will it make Chairman Ju to be your man?

369
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,300
Madam, please spare me. Please keep this from Chairman.

370
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,890
I can't live without him.

371
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,660
You're worthless, and I won't trouble myself dealing with you.

372
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,270
Pack up and get out of this house immediately.

373
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:02,690
If I see you again, you won't walk out of here alive.

374
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:08,100
I can't. I can't leave. Please forgive me this once.

375
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,790
Even if I die, I'll die in this house.

376
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:16,850
Besides Chairman, no one can get me out of this house.

377
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,080
When I marry Chairman Ju, I  am  the lady of this house.

378
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,970
It's well within my right to fire you or get you out of the house.

379
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,760
It isn't me who should leave,

380
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:46,850
it's you, Cheon Seo Jin. You bitch.

381
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,370
What?

382
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:53,310
I and Chairman

383
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,160
have lived in this house for twenty years.

384
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:03,190
The way he looks at me, his breath,

385
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,820
and even his touch

386
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,170
I remember everything.

387
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:16,740
I'm willing to die for that man.

388
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:22,150
Ju Dan Tae is mine. I won't let anyone take him away from me!

389
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,760
You're a royal pain in the ass.

390
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,480
Chairman.

391
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,490
You haven't fixed that old habit of yours yet.

392
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,860
I was willing to watch you a bit longer for the sake of what you've done for me.

393
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,000
But no, I'm going to have to address that madness of yours.

394
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,760
Without you, I have no reason to live.

395
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,210
No reason to live?

396
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,790
I

397
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,320
love you

398
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:59,160
to death.

399
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,990
What are you waiting for? Get rid of her.

400
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,110
No, no! I can't leave!

401
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,120
Please, please.

402
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,930
Chairman!

403
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:15,940
Now that I can't get to eat the fish dish she's so goot at making,

404
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,220
I have to say I'm a little sad.

405
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,550
 Go ahead and just die! 

406
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,010
 Who did this then? 

407
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:28,590
 We'll find out. And I have one person that comes to mind. 

408
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:34,860
Ju Dan Tae, I've got to give it to you. You're so smart.

409
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,380
By the way, was it your public relation's team that issued the announcement of our engagement?

410
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,620
Why? Is anything bothering you?

411
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:47,000
- I like to fix  the wording that says I'll be the chairperson when our two companies merge. 
 - What do you mean?

412
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,880
When Cheong Ah Group comes to existence, naturally, you, Ju Dan Tae should be the chairperson.

413
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,790
My plate's already full shaping up Cheong Ah Art Center to become the world-class opera theater.

414
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,330
Okay, I'll ask them to rewrite that part.

415
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,480
What are you doing tonight?

416
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,020
Why do you ask?

417
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,010
Just curious.

418
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,830
 JAKOMO 

419
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,800
Are you coming in, sir?

420
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,400
So I hear he fainted from the hunger strike.

421
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,700
Why is he dozing off in my showroom?

422
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,820
Do you know who I am? You called me in here only to show up just now?

423
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:40,960
I work for the government. You shouldn't treat me like a piece of dirt.

424
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,620
Did you forget it already? Who put that badge on your collar?

425
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,350
I gave you the half of the people who voted for you.

426
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:54,930
Chairman Ju, the death of your wife dropped the value of Hera Palace to be that of shit.

427
00:37:54,930 --> 00:38:01,200
Who was the one who grabbed the place by its neck and yanked it up high?

428
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,390
If I, Gyu Jin hadn't been elected to be a Assemblyman,

429
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,170
there's no way you can stick a price tag of 1.5 mil per 6 cubic feet for Hera Place.

430
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:15,030
Isn't that  because Seo Jin announced she'd build a second Cheong Ah medical center in Samsung-dong?

431
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:21,010
Okay, I'll give you that. Anyhow, aren't you doing too well with your business?

432
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:24,340
Your business is already substantial, and you're growing it every day, it seems.

433
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,410
Be honest and tell me.

434
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:33,420
Thanks to Sim Su Ryeon, you doubled your wealth. Am I wrong?

435
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,840
I guess  I got lucky that way.

436
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:47,370
Forget it. Why did you call me in? About Min Ah?

437
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,580
No, not her. There's something really important.

438
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,540
 Just and trusted police  

439
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,430
Surprise!

440
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,830
¡Felicidades por tu boda! (Congratulations on your wedding!)

441
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,800
What's all this? You shouldn't have.

442
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,900
 Will you marry me? 

443
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,040
Dan Tae.

444
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,770
- Come on. 
 - Now, go to him.

445
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,290
I feel, at long last, I've met the true half of my soul.

446
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,460
For the rest of my life,

447
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,230
I shall remain devoted to you, Cheon Seo Jin.

448
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,790
I love you.

449
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,510
He's just like a prince.

450
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,740
Did you call in the busy assemblyman just to propose to me?

451
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:46,430
I put the wellfare of my people on the backburner for a moment to be at your service.

452
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,960
Ms. Cheon, what are you waiting for? Say yes.

453
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,860
Chairman Ju's knees are crying out in pain.

454
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,710
Get up and put that ring on my finger yourself.

455
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:06,520
This isn't your first time. You should know that much after all you have a mania for proposing, ha, ha.

456
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,810
Your hand.

457
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:23,240
Pretty. I like it very much. Thanks.

458
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:33,250
Ju Dan Tae. You're under arrest for the murder of Sim Su Ryeon.

459
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,160
What did you just say?

460
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,050
What are you talking about? A murder suspect?

461
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,980
What do you think you're doing? Why would I kill my own wife?

462
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,840
You have to come with us.

463
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,630
Let go! Show me the arrest warrant!

464
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,060
Dan Tae, Dan Tae!

465
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,570
Why would I do that? I never would.

466
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,340
What's going on here?

467
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,380
Sure, this is going to be one event they'll never forget.

468
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,350
 Gangnam Metropolice Station 

469
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:11,640
I'm a defense lawyer for Chairman Ju. For what reason, did you arrest him?

470
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,260
There has been a report.

471
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,700
What report?

472
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,970
A report that Chairman Ju is the actual murderer who killed Sim Su Ryeon.

473
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:23,130
Who is the source of that ridiculous report?

474
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:29,100
It's Yang Mi Ok, the first witness to the murder scene and the housekeeper of Chairman Ju's residence.

475
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:35,740
So you're saying on her words alone, you dragged me in here. Right?

476
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:39,370
I sure hope you're ready to brace yourselves for the repercussions of the ridiculous position you put me in.

477
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:44,850
I can't tolerate this forceful and inhumane way you conduct your investigation. I'll make sure you pay for this.

478
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:50,130
Where's Yang Mi Ok now? I request a cross-examination.

479
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,880
Yang Mi Ok is dead.

480
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,090
What?

481
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:05,830
She was found dead in her home just an hour ago. It appears she killed herself with a poison.

482
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:10,080
 I loved Chairman Ju Dan Tae. 

483
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,090
 If I can't have him, I'm going to have to destroy him. 

484
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,710
 That way, no one can have him. 

485
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:20,130
 It's him, Chairman Ju Dan Tae who killed Sim Su Ryeon. 

486
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,410
 I apologize to Oh Yun Hui. 

487
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:38,350
Yang pointed her fingers at you as the real murderer of Sim Su Ryeon.

488
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:43,300
She left a note to Oh Yun Hui saying she was sorry.

489
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,090
She clearly harbours resentment against you.

490
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:53,800
What nonsense. Housekeeper Yang just doesn't have it in her to destroy me.

491
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,800
- It's her. 
 - Pardon?

492
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,470
Oh Yun Hui orchestrated everything.

493
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,200
I'm sure it was Oh Yun Hi killed Housekeeper Yang.

494
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,130
Request for an autopsy to see if Yang indeed killed herself.

495
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:16,400
If the traces of someone entering Yang's house and fabricating her suicide note—

496
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,350
Wait.

497
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,080
Oh Yun Hui?

498
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,370
Oh Yun Hui,

499
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,780
why is Oh Yun Hui here?

500
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,790
Oh Yun Hui!

501
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:09,410
Tell me!  Why are you here?

502
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:12,890
What happened, Oh Yun Hui? Where have you been hiding all this time to show up only now?

503
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:16,180
Who were you trying to screw over with what you did?

504
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,320
No, you mustn't act this way.

505
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,490
You did this, didn't you? You killed Housekeeper Yang, didn't you?

506
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:24,890
You schemed this nonsense. Tell it this instant!

507
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:30,030
That's enough. Oh Yun Hui turned herself in already.

508
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,180
Turned herself in?

509
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,000
I really did not kill Sim Su Ryeon.

510
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,930
Regardless how many times you ask,

511
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:06,310
I'll answer just the same.

512
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:13,070
I can swear this on my daughter's life.

513
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:19,040
Goodness. Housekeeper Yang committed suicide and left a note?

514
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,930
And the culprit is Chairman Ju? What are you talking about?

515
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,900
Does it mean Oh Yun Hui isn't the culprit?

516
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,520
That makes no sense. Words alone shouldn't turn a person into a muderer.

517
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:36,580
How appalling. Could Chairman Ju have really killed his own wife?

518
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:42,070
If he did, Oh Yun Hui was put in prison unjustly, and she's been living as a fugitive all this time.

519
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:47,320
So, in short, Yang said Chairman Ju was the culprit.

520
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,590
Then she died. That's what you're saying, right?

521
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:54,990
Though I'm bringing this up now,  that Oh Yun Hui killed Sim Su Ryeon

522
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:59,480
never made sense to me. But if it was Chairman Ju, that's another story.

523
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:05,220
After Sim Su Ryeon died, her vast wealth fell into the hands of Chairman Ju.

524
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:13,190
Oh Yun Hui requested Yang to be cross-examined as she was the witness to what happened.

525
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:18,270
But when the police went to Yang's house, she was already dead.

526
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:22,100
Oh Yun Hui, that bitch killed her. Or, she got someone to do it.

527
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,210
We may suspect her, but the situation isn't good for you.

528
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:31,220
Since Yang died accusing you of your late wife's murder, there'll be a reinvestigation.

529
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,780
We can't help that you're now a new suspect.  Not only that,

530
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,810
once the fact that you used violence against Yang becomes known,

531
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:41,670
you could be branded as the murderer who killed her.

532
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:46,570
So what am I supposed to do? Do nothing and let myself be screwed?

533
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:53,110
One thing that gives us hope is they found in Yang's house the pictures of her stalking you,

534
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:56,740
and the evidence that shows her intense hatred against your wife.

535
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,210
She's a nutcase, not knowing her place until her last breath.

536
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,640
But for us, this is an opportunity.

537
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,260
Let's do this.

538
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,310
 This just came in. The real culprit of the murder at Hera Palace was revealed.
 True Culprit of the Murder at Hera Palace Has Been Revealed 

539
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:25,860
 The culprit is Ms. Yang, and she worked as a domestic helper at  the home of the victim. 

540
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,680
 Not only did she stalk the victim's husband, Chairman Ju Dan Tae, 

541
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,770
 but she had deep resentment against the victim on account of  her feelings for the victim's husband. 

542
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:37,110
 These facts came to light, owing to Oh Yun Hui, previously considered as the murder suspect 

543
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:40,370
 turned herself in yesterday after a year of living on the run. 

544
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:43,440
No way that Ms. Yang did it.

545
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,310
  Ms. Yang left behind a suicide note in which she apologized to Oh Yun Hui before her death. 

546
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:51,700
What is going on?

547
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:56,520
Dad, is this true? Ms. Yang was the one who killed mom? Did she really?

548
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,870
 They will reinvestigate this case. 

549
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,750
What's going on? How can Yang be the killer?

550
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,270
How can you turn Yang into the murderer?

551
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:24,340
- Don't talk. I didn't sleep a wink.
 - Explain this!

552
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,330
I'm going crazy, too. If things went wrong, I was about to be the target.

553
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:32,470
Things barely worked out they way they did, thanks to Yang's records of previous mental illnesses.

554
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,680
Guess how much money I had to spend for the five lawyers I worked with to turn Yang into a murderer.

555
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,000
- But Oh Yun Hui survived.
 - So what?

556
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,710
This was our only chance to finally get Oh Yun Hui out of our sight.

557
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:45,390
But now, she's been found innocent again.

558
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:50,080
So what was I supposed to do? If I didn't make Yang into a crazy bitch, I'd be screwed and become a murderer.

559
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:55,380
- Will you be satisfied if I go to prison?
 - That's not what I'm saying!

560
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:00,230
What if Yang didn't commit suicide?

561
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:06,030
Even if Oh Yun Hui did kill Yang, when the police dig further, I'll only go deeper into trouble.

562
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:11,940
I'm just thankful Oh Yun Hui didn't dig her heels in and set out to find the real murderer who killed Sim Su Ryeon.

563
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,460
Even the public opinion is rallying in favor of Oh Yun Hui.

564
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,960
I feel like someone is helping her.

565
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,010
Who can that be?

566
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:29,170
 But this isn't the end of the suspicions surrounding the murder at Hera Place. 

567
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:35,370
 Oh Yun Hui's fingerprints weren't found on the altered family photos found at her home. 

568
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:41,030
Is this real? Was Oh Yun Hui framed? Is she really innocent?

569
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,460
You startled me.  Why are you watching TV at our home?

570
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,700
When did you get here?
   Yang harboured strong envy and jealousy toward Sim Su Ryeon 

571
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:52,160
 and she behaved as if she were the owner of the penthouse. 

572
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,490
 We were able to confirm the validity of such comments from the merchants we've talked to through our investigative report.  

573
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:01,860
 What's more surprising is, Sim, the deceased was the last person Yang spoke to on the phone.  

574
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:06,920
 The question is why the police overlooked the facts of such importance. 
  Gangnam Police Station  

575
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:13,410
 We've learned that Oh Yun Hui is now appealing for a retrial after having lived a year as a murderer. 

576
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:16,330
 Since the true culprit of this incident is now revealed, 

577
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:20,720
 it is predicted that she will be found innocent. 

578
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,740
 The police, the  prosecution and the judiciary are under scrutiny for their incompetence in investigation and judgment. 

579
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,920
 It won't be easy for them to avoid public criticism. 

580
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,600
I saw you in my dreams every night.

581
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,370
You look exactly the same.

582
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,490
You too, Mom.

583
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:36,950
I knew you didn't do it, Mom.

584
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:42,650
I'm sorry, Ro Na. I'm so sorry.

585
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:45,910
I'm so, so sorry.

586
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:49,930
Mom. Mom.

587
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:54,500
Mom. Mom.

588
00:52:54,500 --> 00:53:01,520
Mom. Mom.

589
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:50,350
 Are you home? I got your call earlier. 

590
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:53,820
 You said you were hiring a part-timer? 

591
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:11,530
 Just a moment. 

592
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,490
 Hello. 

593
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:24,660
 This is all because of your mom. Chairman only wants her because she helped him. 

594
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,370
 If you die, your mom will show up again, won't she? 

595
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:32,290
 She will definitely show up if she finds out her daughter died because of her. 

596
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:37,600
 - Die! Die! Die!
 - Stop! 

597
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,800
 So you were alive, Oh Yun Hui. 

598
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:59,100
 It wasn't enough to frame me? Why are you trying to kill my innocent daughter? Why? 

599
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,280
 So that you'll show up. 

600
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,560
 If your daughter died because of you, 

601
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,840
 you'd show your face even if you're in hell.  

602
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,250
 Did Ju Dan Tae tell you to kill me? 

603
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:20,750
 Goodbye. 

604
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:24,530
 Oh Yun Hui. 

605
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:41,150
 - Logan.
 - I told you to not go anywhere by yourself. How can you show up without my permission? 

606
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:45,270
 - Ro Na was in danger, I had no choice.
 - I will protect Ro Na. 

607
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:49,400
 Anyone who touches a child will die in my hands. 

608
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:59,740
 Yang! Yang, what do you think you're doing? 

609
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,330
 Yang. 

610
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:13,330
 I should've taken that bitch with me. 

611
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:24,580
 I'll go ahead of you and wait for you, Chairman. 

612
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:29,930
 From there- 

613
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,410
 Did she die? 

614
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,610
 Go to the police immediately and turn yourself in. 

615
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:49,190
 Go and request for Yang to be cross examined. 

616
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,580
 I'll take care of the rest. 

617

 Suicide Note
  Ju Dan Tae  

619
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:59,340
 Suicide Note: Chairman Ju Dan Tae, I loved you, but 

620
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,530
 Suicide Note 

621
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,690
 I loved Chairman Ju Dan Tae all my life. But love that cannot be is torture. 

622
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,580
 If I couldn't have him, I had to destroy him, so no one else could have him. 

623
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,400
 The one who killed Sim Su Ryeon is Ju Dan Tae. 

624
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,550
Mom!

625
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:16,050
Really? Make sure to keep an eye on her till she departs.

626
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,900
Is she leaving the country? Oh Yun Hui?

627
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:27,170
What if she comes back?

628
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,450
Stop worrying about Oh Yun Hui.

629
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:35,480
After having gone through all that she had,  her wanting to leave is understandable.

630
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,930
We just need to carry on with our lives now.

631
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:47,040
We'll get engaged as we planned and finish the merger with Cheong Ah Group.

632
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:52,140
And you'll perform all over as the ultimate primadonna.

633
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:57,610
We'll build the happy family that's the envy of all and live happily as we love each other.

634
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,740
What's wrong?

635
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:18,350
Nothing. I should get going, Eun Byeol's lesson is ending.

636
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:22,170
Eun Byeol isn't a child. Aren't you coddling her too much?

637
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:25,580
If you intend to be jealous of Eun Byeol, no thanks.

638
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:29,770
Let's not meddle in the matters concerning our respective children, okay?

639
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,670
So crazy.

640
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,790
You've gone crazy, Cheon Seo Jin.

641
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,890
Get it together.

642
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:07,980
Get it together.

643
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,730
 Three months later 

644
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:56,410
 Wedding 

645
01:00:56,410 --> 01:01:00,110
♫  We ask that life be kind ♫  

646
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:05,560
♫  È il desiderio che  ♫

647
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:26,010
Oh, Teacher Cheon, you are too beautiful.

648
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:30,990
Who would think that you're getting remarried? They'd think you're in your 20s!

649
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:33,730
Chairman Ju is such a lucky guy.

650
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:37,430
At your age, you should just get married. Why bother getting engaged?

651
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,550
It's an important time for the kids right now.

652
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:42,170
Besides, my schedule is packed with performances, so I don't have much time.

653
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:44,040
Of course, we know.

654
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,950
Marriage is also a business. You have to be cautious.

655
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:51,800
Once both your companies merge, you'll have to work out the matters concerning stocks and alimony, too.

656
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:57,130
Do you know how much Teacher Cheon had to pay in alimony when she divorced Dr. Ha?

657
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,240
Why would you bring up a thing like that today?

658
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,600
It's just us, why not?

659
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:06,090
To be blunt, Teacher Cheon is too good for her partner.

660
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,600
Is there anyone in our country who doesn't know about Cheong Ah Foundation?

661
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,980
Chairman Ju just ended up with a windfall.

662
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:18,610
So when do you plan to have your actual wedding?

663
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,960
We don't have firm plans yet.

664
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,340
We plan to experience each other and take our time before we get married.

665
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,830
Or,  maybe, we won't.

666
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,430
Congratulations, sir.

667
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:24,370
Thank you.

668
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:37,380
Here is filled with beauty.

669
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:17,670
What is that?

670
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:42,790
Has everyone been well?

671
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:45,090
You were in the middle of something.

672
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,140
Why are you all so surprised?

673
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,880
Am I not allowed to be here?

674
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:02,360
Say hello to my wife.

675
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,390
Oh Yun Hui.

676
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:20,390
It's been a while.

677
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:22,830
Congratulations on your engagement, Seo Jin.

678
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:52,610


679
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:57,030
 Penthouse II 

680
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:59,250
 Did those two really get married? 

681
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,860
 Don't talk about my woman like that. 

682
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,580
 You're not the same Ha Yun Cheol I know. 

683
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:04,800
 It's an honor to be invited into Hera Club. 

684
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,290
 Are you here to see Ro Na? 

685
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:08,350
 Did you forget who died in the penthouse? 

686
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:11,070
 Let us both live good lives as we take care of our families. 

687
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:13,270
 If you keep up like this, you may not be able to sing ever again. 

688
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:16,890
 I have to make sure this performance goes perfectly. 

689
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:18,950
 When will you stop talking about Ha Yun Cheol? 

690
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:19,920
 He's not your man anymore. 

691
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,280
 Doesn't it feel like there will be bloodshed all over again?
