1
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,375
How many times do I have to tell you?

2
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,250
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:35,916
Don't be scared.

4
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,208
Sorry.

5
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,291
Why do you always make me do this?

6
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,750
I can't handle it, and then…

7
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,250
I don't want this either, all right?

8
00:00:56,375 --> 00:01:00,000
How many years? Seven years…

9
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,125
Sorry, it's my fault.

10
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,000
Jin Jin.

11
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,375
I can't face her.

12
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:37,750
Hi.

13
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,791
Mom, what're you up to?
What took you so long to answer?

14
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,166
Nothing, I was just busy.

15
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,375
I'm at the hotel pool.
Let me show you the night view.

16
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,958
It's stunning.

17
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,291
I'm with An Chi.

18
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,291
Hello, An Chi.

19
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,583
Hello.

20
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,916
You two be careful over there.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
Don't worry. We're not kids anymore.

22
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,583
Mom, I've got to go.
I just called to let you know I'm fine.

23
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:01,583
Okay.

24
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,416
And I uploaded a new video on YouTube.

25
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,916
Remember to hit like.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,125
Okay.

27
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,041
I'm hanging up. Bye.

28
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,791
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

29
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,500
JIN JIN

30
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,125
Come join us!

31
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,458
Hsin-yi, are you coming or not?

32
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,375
Just tell your mom
you're going to shoot videos with me.

33
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,416
We can split the earnings
from videos and ads.

34
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,916
You can have fun and get paid.
How cool is that?

35
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,708
Mom, I want to go to Benkha.

36
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,750
What for?

37
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,291
Jin Jin is there already.

38
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,166
She keeps asking me to join her.

39
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,791
There's still time before school starts.

40
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,000
I can go on vacation.

41
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,500
And I can film some content with them
and make some money.

42
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,875
I told you not to worry about money.

43
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,208
I'll handle it.

44
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,500
But…

45
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,750
-Go back inside.
-Okay.

46
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,833
I'll finish up here.

47
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:46,166
SCAMMERS GO TO HELL

48
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,541
Officer Li!

49
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,791
PRESENT DAY, BENKHA

50
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,083
You want me to steal a corpse?

51
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,500
Mm.

52
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,708
Please. You think too highly of me.
I can't pull that off.

53
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,958
You can, Mr. Li.

54
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,583
Everyone in Chinatown knows
you're the go-to-guy.

55
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,333
You're handsome and kind-hearted.

56
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,291
Help us out.

57
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,750
If you can meet this price,

58
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,708
I'll do it.

59
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,791
That's way too much.

60
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,583
No bargaining.

61
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,541
Don't give me that look.

62
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,750
Any idea how many people
I'll have to bribe?

63
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,041
Most of that will go to the morgue.

64
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,208
I'll barely have anything left.

65
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,375
If you didn't look so desperate…

66
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,708
Whatever.
You've got time to think it over.

67
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,750
Wait, fine…

68
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,208
We'll pay.

69
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,375
We'll find the money.

70
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:54,708
We will.

71
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,083
Good.

72
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,166
Come up with the money quickly.

73
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,708
The body will be cremated in 72 hours.

74
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,333
Okay?

75
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,916
Don't you want to know why
we want to steal Chang Shih-kai's corpse?

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,750
If I ask you, will you tell me?

77
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,125
If we do, can you lower the price?

78
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,041
What do you think?

79
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,375
In any case,

80
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,083
you pay the money

81
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,666
and I'll do the job.

82
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,458
All right, you can go now.

83
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,541
See yourselves out.

84
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,333
Get the money quick. Time's running out.

85
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,041
Who is it?

86
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,458
Hsiang.

87
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,166
Stop coming here.

88
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,458
-Sorry.
-Don't apologize to me.

89
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,958
If you're really sorry,
tell them to pay up.

90
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,958
I thought of you as a friend.

91
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,458
So I listened to you
and bought that life insurance for my mom.

92
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,875
Now my mother's in the ICU
and desperately needs the money!

93
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,500
But your company won't pay out!

94
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,833
I tried to get it back

95
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:31,250
but they said it's an investment-based
policy and it's all gone!

96
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,458
You know what you are?

97
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,541
-You're a scammer!
-I'll make it up to you. Here's some…

98
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,166
-No, I don't want it!
-Don't be so mean.

99
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,666
-I'm suing your company!
-She has it hard too.

100
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,750
Karma will get you!

101
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,500
Chao Ching, ignore him.
He doesn't mean it.

102
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,666
She scammed us.

103
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't say that.

104
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,833
-It's not her fault.
-No?

105
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,958
Karma will get her! Serves her right!

106
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,291
Ching, there you are.

107
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,208
Have a seat.

108
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,208
Things must be tough for you lately.

109
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,375
I'm fine.

110
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:16,333
Why don't I transfer your clients
to Hsiao-chou for the time being?

111
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,416
I found those clients.
Why should I give them to her?

112
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,750
Precisely because
you worked so hard to get those clients.

113
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,041
We should do our best to keep them.

114
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm worried
you're spreading yourself too thin,

115
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,000
so I want Hsiao-chou to help you out.

116
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,083
Without any clients,
how will I reach my sales target?

117
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,333
Don't worry about that.
The company's taken it into account.

118
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,833
With your family's situation, the lawsuit,

119
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,875
and dealing with those pesky reporters,

120
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,333
it must be hard to focus.

121
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,000
So we've decided to transfer you
to General Affairs.

122
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,750
This will reduce your workload.

123
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,791
You're demoting me?

124
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,166
How will I survive on that salary?

125
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,250
Don't worry.

126
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,125
Once this matter is over,
you can transfer right back.

127
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,791
I need money now more than ever.

128
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,541
And the company
needs sales more than ever.

129
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,458
The company always needs sales.

130
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,333
To reach my sales targets
these past few years,

131
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,541
I sold insurance policies
to many of my friends and family.

132
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,541
But the company refused to pay up.

133
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,583
Now everyone calls me a scammer.

134
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,791
I gave a lot to this company.

135
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,083
Now I'm being transferred
to General Affairs?

136
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,041
Ching,

137
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,458
that all happened
before I joined the company,

138
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,083
so I know nothing about it.

139
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:49,458
Besides, all of our products
comply with legal regulations now.

140
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,250
-Are you saying
-This--

141
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,875
the old products were illegal?

142
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,500
Don't take it out on me.

143
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,416
The company decided to transfer you.

144
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,416
It had nothing to do with me.

145
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,666
To put it bluntly, you want me to resign.

146
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,916
That's nonsense.

147
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,041
Look at all
that's happening to you right now.

148
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,000
It must be hard to focus on your job.

149
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,583
And our company
has always been very accommodating.

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,416
Think about it some more.

151
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,875
Where will you find another company

152
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,166
as good as this one?

153
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,166
You know I'm right.

154
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:51,916
What are you doing?

155
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,875
The manager
asked me to sort your client files.

156
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,208
Hsiao-chou.

157
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,541
-Yes?
-Come here.

158
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,833
Sorry.

159
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,750
-Do it later.
-Didn't you tell Ching?

160
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:09,791
It was so awkward.

161
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,916
Did you just get back?

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,125
Traffic was terrible.

163
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,958
I was swamped with work.
No time to pick you up.

164
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,958
You don't need to take me
to the airport tomorrow.

165
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,291
I don't trust a caregiver with Jin Jin.

166
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,791
I'll go and renew my visa.

167
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,250
I'll just get a taxi
and head over from there.

168
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,333
Oh, okay.

169
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,541
I'll just drop my things off.

170
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,833
Don't you ever clean?

171
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,416
I've been pretty busy lately.

172
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,500
-Hey.
-I'm gonna shower.

173
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,750
I have a meeting later.

174
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,250
TAIWAN WATER CORP.

175
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,458
APBANK

176
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,791
QIAN'AN RD., TAIPEI

177
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,250
QIONGYU ST., TAIPEI

178
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,833
TOTAL PAYABLE: 36,875 TWD

179
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:17,958
Hey.

180
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,333
Look, I have to entertain clients tonight.

181
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,916
You're on your own tonight.

182
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,041
Don't wait for me.

183
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,083
Did you hear me?

184
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,791
I heard you.

185
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,916
TING: I'M HEADING OUT

186
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
ENTER PASSCODE

187
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,666
TING: I'M HEADING OUT

188
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,166
Miss, are you getting out here?

189
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,958
QIONGYU ST., TAIPEI

190
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,041
Please take me
to Qiongyu Street in Tianmu.

191
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:58,291
CHOU SHU-TING
ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AWARD

192
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,500
KUO CHIH-CHIEH'S CAMPAIGN STAFF MEMBER
GOES VIRAL FOR HER BEAUTY

193
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,958
CHOU SHU-TING
ADMITS POLITICS IS STRESSFUL,

194
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,458
SUSPENDS WORK
FOR A YEAR-LONG STUDY TOUR

195
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,291
I'm Hsu Yung, from Super News.
I'm doing an exclusive on fraud…

196
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:22,875
Hello?

197
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,708
Is this Hsu Yung,
the reporter for Super News?

198
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,291
It's Chao Ching.

199
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,333
I'm back in Taiwan.

200
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,958
Were you drinking again?

201
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,416
Sentenced to death.

202
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,791
I wonder
what'll happen to the civil damages.

203
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,333
-I'm feeling down.
-Give me a hand.

204
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,166
Come and give me a hand.

205
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,083
Oh.

206
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,250
-Like this?
-Yes.

207
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,541
One, two, three.

208
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,958
Hey.

209
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,291
Sorry.

210
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,041
Help me contact a medical flight.

211
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,208
I'm going to send Jin Jin back to Taiwan
in a few months.

212
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,875
No problem. I'll arrange it right away.

213
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,708
You haven't given me
this month's living expenses yet.

214
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,208
Can we talk about this?

215
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,750
Jin Jin made a lot
from that sponsored content.

216
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,791
I don't think I need to keep paying.

217
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,750
-I have lots of expenses myself.
-What kind of expenses?

218
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,125
I'm doing business with a friend.

219
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:55,416
I take care of all our household expenses
in Taiwan, don't I?

220
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,375
Don't I contribute enough?

221
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,041
I'm heading back to Taiwan tomorrow.

222
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,333
-When will you be back?
-We'll see.

223
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,083
Doubt I'll be in Southeast Asia
for work anytime soon.

224
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,791
So you're saying

225
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,708
I won't be seeing you or any money?

226
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,458
That's not what I said. Or what I meant.

227
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,500
I knew you'd get upset.

228
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:27,625
I think we should make plans
for the future.

229
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,791
He's dead now.

230
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,958
Just let things come to an end.

231
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,416
We need to let go
and stop punishing ourselves.

232
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,875
We should move on.

233
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,916
I think we should move on too.

234
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,166
That's right.

235
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,750
So, can we discuss
what I mentioned last time?

236
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,000
Sure.

237
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,625
Good. I want to make things clear.

238
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,666
-So if we separate in the future--
-Not in front of Jin Jin.

239
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,541
Okay, not now.

240
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,291
-I'll do it.
-No, I'll do it myself.

241
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,166
Okay, then let's talk at my hotel.

242
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,208
Hua Hsin!

243
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,666
-Hua Hsin makes dirty money!
-You scammers!

244
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,833
-Swindlers!
-Scammers!

245
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,375
-You exploit people!
-Pay us back!

246
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,208
-Hua Hsin, pay up!
-Scammers, pay up!

247
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,500
-Hua Hsin, pay up!
-Hua Hsin, give us back our money!

248
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,333
Pay us back!

249
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,333
-Come out and face us!
-Scammers!

250
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,166
-Scammers!
-Hua Hsin, pay us back!

251
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,791
Ching, you have a guest.

252
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,875
Yes, I know your show
is incredible at exposés.

253
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,833
My business card. Hsu Yung, Super News.

254
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,333
You can just call me Yung.

255
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,666
To help Super News get the truth,
I go super.

256
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,958
Ching, there you are.

257
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,541
-Mr. Hsu.
-Ching.

258
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,583
Congratulations.
Justice has finally been served.

259
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,500
By the way,

260
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,083
Mr. Hsu said you two
have something to discuss today.

261
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,875
Yes. But first,
I have to tender my resignation.

262
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,333
What?

263
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,500
Resignation?

264
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,500
But…

265
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,791
You're doing great.
Why would you resign?

266
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,958
I feel the company's
been too accommodating.

267
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:15,375
-I don't want to implicate the company.
-How can you say that?

268
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,875
We're a family.

269
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:21,041
And the company has always had your back.

270
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,250
Hey.

271
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,333
Don't rush things.

272
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,208
Let's talk about it.

273
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,583
Let's talk.

274
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:28,750
Ms. Chou.

275
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,166
Hsiao-chou, she called for you.

276
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:37,458
-Mr. Hsu, please give me a moment.
-Take your time.

277
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,416
Take good care of Mr. Hsu for me.

278
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,833
Oh, remember to make some coffee.

279
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,125
Go and make some coffee.

280
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,750
-Mr. Hsu. Have a seat.
-Yes, yes.

281
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:08,958
On the left.

282
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,166
Sit anywhere you like.

283
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,125
I'm gonna take a shower.

284
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:08,416
Do you remember?

285
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,833
I told you before

286
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,208
how I wanted a fresh start

287
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,375
once the lawsuit was over.

288
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:16,708
Did you?

289
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,333
When was that?

290
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,375
It doesn't matter.

291
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,125
Anyway, now everything's wrapped up,

292
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,916
I don't want to drag things on.

293
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,208
I'm glad you think that way.

294
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,125
At least Jin Jin won't suffer so much.

295
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,125
The sooner her suffering ends,
the better for us, no?

296
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,041
What do you mean?

297
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,875
Aren't we talking about
turning off Jin Jin's life support?

298
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,166
What were you talking about?

299
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,750
For years,
we've been apart more often than not.

300
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:52,416
We're married in name only.

301
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:54,625
So you're aware?

302
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,000
You finally realized.

303
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,583
Let's get divorced.

304
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:03,875
Divorced?

305
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:04,833
Fine.

306
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:06,125
What about Jin Jin?

307
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,583
I'll take care of Jin Jin.

308
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:10,375
Good. It's better for a child
to be with their mother.

309
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,250
We'll do the paperwork back in Taiwan.

310
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,458
Not so fast. I have a few conditions.

311
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:20,375
What conditions?

312
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,666
Ching, what do you want
to talk to that reporter for?

313
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,083
He wants to interview me.

314
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:35,500
Don't you always refuse interviews?

315
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:37,208
I need the money.

316
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,166
That's true.

317
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,208
Super News has really high ratings.

318
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,041
Remember to get a good price.

319
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,958
-You must be having a hard time lately.
-What? No.

320
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:51,125
Ever since you transferred me
to General Affairs,

321
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:53,375
I've had a lot of time
on my hands at work.

322
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,000
Sometimes, I'd get so bored

323
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,958
that I'd dig out
the company's past internal records

324
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,125
for a look.

325
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:04,291
I discovered
that Fukang Universal Life Insurance

326
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,458
was deemed high-risk.

327
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,541
But when we promoted it externally,

328
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,750
we labeled it a low-risk product.

329
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:14,375
And customers were never told
of the possibility of loss of capital.

330
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,333
This is straight-up fraud.

331
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:19,041
What fraud?
Be careful about what you say.

332
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:20,958
-This was before I joined--
-I know.

333
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:23,250
That was before you joined the company.

334
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,666
But now,
you'll have to take all the blame.

335
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,000
It's so unfair on you.

336
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,708
That's why I'll go on that show

337
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:33,041
and apologize to everyone I scammed.

338
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:36,708
I'm sure my unethical conduct

339
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:38,750
-led to my daughter's tragic death.
-No.

340
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,791
-Chao Ching--
-It's my karma.

341
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,875
Chao Ching, what are you talking about?

342
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,791
Do you know how much
this'll affect the company

343
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:47,458
if you spout this crap on TV?

344
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:48,541
Yes, I know.

345
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,291
That's why I came in today to resign.

346
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,208
But--

347
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,416
I don't want to implicate the company.

348
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:03,875
The money in our joint account
is from fundraisers for Jin Jin,

349
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:06,125
so it should go towards for her expenses.

350
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,583
How can we do that?

351
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:10,083
That's a joint account.

352
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:12,083
By law, we should split it, right?

353
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:16,833
Then let's follow the law.

354
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,458
This is Hsiao-pao when he was born.

355
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:28,666
Haven't you always wanted a son?

356
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,500
His nose is just like yours.

357
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,750
This is him at one year old
out shopping with his mother.

358
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,625
He doesn't make a fuss. So cute.

359
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,375
And this is him at two years old.

360
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,666
You guys celebrated his birthday
at the amusement park.

361
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,666
He's a Sagittarius just like you.

362
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,583
He'll grow up to be a scumbag too.

363
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,875
Hsiao-pao is so cute.

364
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:52,791
At five or six years old,

365
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,750
he'll start elementary school.

366
00:27:57,916 --> 00:28:00,166
The apartment you bought is in Tianmu.

367
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,541
Near an international school, no?

368
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:05,208
I'll pay him a visit when I have time.

369
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:12,750
When he's 12 or 13 in a few years,
he'll go online.

370
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:15,875
Then he'll learn
that his sister is a famous YouTuber.

371
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,958
Since I took over,
I think we've reached 500,000 subscribers.

372
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,375
And then,

373
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,750
I'll tell the whole world

374
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:27,000
that his father is a scumbag
and his mother is a homewrecker.

375
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:28,291
By the way,

376
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,000
will this affect
Kuo Chih-chieh's election prospects?

377
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,916
If you want to resign,

378
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,750
you need to sign
a non-disclosure agreement.

379
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,166
-A non-disclosure agreement?
-Yes!

380
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,625
After you sign it,

381
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:45,791
you can't tell anyone
about anything related to the company.

382
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,125
Do I have to sign it?

383
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,416
Of course.

384
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,791
What if I don't sign it?

385
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:51,916
That's…

386
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,291
What exactly do you want?

387
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,375
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

388
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,000
I want all of your money

389
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,333
and the apartment in Tianmu.

390
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,625
Well,

391
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,208
if you sign it,

392
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:16,500
the company will compensate you.

393
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:17,916
How much?

394
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:22,166
I'll try my best, okay?
I'll try my best!

395
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:27,875
Remember to get a good price.

396
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:29,583
You said before

397
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:31,708
that Super News has really high ratings.

398
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:35,958
Hi.

399
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,708
Please sign here.

400
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,208
The apartment is in her name.

401
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,166
-She won't agree.
-She will agree

402
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,291
because she's also a mother now.

403
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,083
For her child's sake, she'll compromise.

404
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,375
I have to discuss it with her
back in Taipei.

405
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,458
-I'll also need a lawyer--
-I don't have time for that.

406
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:10,333
Do everything I've told you
as soon as possible.

407
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:13,541
Sign this agreement tonight
and send it to me.

408
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,791
Did you hear me?

409
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:17,208
Yes.

410
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:18,541
Her signature too.

411
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:26,375
Take care of yourself
for the next two days.

412
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,500
If you get into an accident on the road

413
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,041
or get hit by a car,

414
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,541
I'm still your insurance beneficiary.

415
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,916
Didn't you say
not to touch Jin Jin's money?

416
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:56,625
It's my ex-husband's.

417
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,458
We got divorced.

418
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,500
Let's make a to-do list.

419
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:09,000
Then we'll see
what's missing and figure it out.

420
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:12,083
First is money.

421
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,833
Chang Shih-kai.

422
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:16,875
Where to hide him?

423
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,458
Transport.

424
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:23,125
We need to control him once we have him.

425
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:31,041
TO-DO LIST: MONEY, CHANG SHIH-KAI,
LOCATION, TRANSPORT, CONTROL

426
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,250
We have to pay Mr. Li tonight.

427
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,750
Do you think we can trust him?

428
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,083
I've asked around.

429
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:48,333
As long as he's paid,
he gets the job done.

430
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:50,000
He has an excellent reputation.

431
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,541
CHANG SHIH-KAI

432
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:00,250
Here.

433
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:17,500
Okay.

434
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,041
Okay.

435
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,791
Up. Okay.

436
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:27,500
That's it. Okay.

437
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,083
CHANG SHIH-KAI

438
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:50,541
All done.

439
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:57,000
CHANG SHIH-KAI

440
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,583
After we get Chang Shih-kai,

441
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:00,000
where should we hide him?

442
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:13,666
This place is big
and seems private enough.

443
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:17,000
This side is Pong's pharmacy.

444
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,041
On the left is a bar.

445
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,041
Wonder how soundproof it is.

446
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:36,125
Fuck you!

447
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,458
-Hey!
-Hi!

448
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,916
Hey! You came!

449
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:54,041
CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING

450
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,833
Hui-chun!

451
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:09,708
Hui-chun!

452
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,208
Hui-chun!

453
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:15,375
Hi, Pong.

454
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:16,500
What happened?

455
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,500
I hear Hui-chun screaming all the time.

456
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:19,875
I don't know what happened.

457
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,250
What is it, Pong?

458
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:30,416
What happened?

459
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:32,458
What happened?

460
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,041
Nothing.

461
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,833
Nothing.

462
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:42,791
Okay.

463
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,375
Okay.

464
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:47,166
Good night.

465
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,250
The bar is fine.

466
00:34:56,833 --> 00:35:00,375
The last thing is Pong's pharmacy.

467
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:03,291
What do we do?
That'll cost a ton of money.

468
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,083
We're burning through it too quickly.

469
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,791
Now we…

470
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:14,666
Hey, Pong.

471
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,541
Hey.

472
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:24,916
I've got a cheap alternative.

473
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,208
Pong!

474
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:33,791
-No--
-It's okay. Don't worry. Just a few days.

475
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,916
Please take care of my store for me, okay?

476
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,125
-Okay.
-Thank you.

477
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,125
Are you sure about this?

478
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:47,041
I've asked.

479
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:50,291
Drug offenses
just get a few days in detention here.

480
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,375
All clear. Let's go. Okay.

481
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:54,500
Let's go.

482
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,125
Let's get started.

483
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,875
LOCATION

484
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,041
TRANSPORT

485
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,708
Getting there is fine.

486
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:40,625
Bringing him back will be tricky.

487
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:42,833
There's got to be a way.

488
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,041
ESTAZOLAM

489
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,333
More, more, more.

490
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:00,541
How about now?

491
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:12,041
Up, up.

492
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,291
Everything is ready.

493
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:46,291
We can begin.

494
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,916
LOCATION, TRANSPORT, CONTROL

495
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:57,625
AN EYE FOR AN EYE,
A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH

496
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,250
Is anyone here?

497
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:39,541
What is it?

498
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:42,750
Go!

499
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:43,666
Go, go!

500
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,625
I want a glass of juice.

501
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,541
No. We're closed already.

502
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,291
This. Orange juice.

503
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,666
-No.
-Drink.

504
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,250
Tell him to quiet down.

505
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,000
-Okay. Go.
-Cup.

506
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,291
Cup!

507
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,333
Hurry, I'm thirsty.

508
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:05,500
Go, go, go.

509
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:08,083
Where's the ice?

510
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Ice!

511
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,833
I want to drink something cold with ice.

512
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:13,916
Hey!

513
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
What the hell?

514
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,125
-Okay.
-What kind of place doesn’t use ice?

515
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,833
How am I supposed to drink this?
Who sells drinks without ice?

516
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,125
Hey! I want to drink something cold!

517
00:40:27,916 --> 00:40:29,000
I'm thirsty!

518
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,500
Hurry up, I’m thirsty.

519
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:53,833
Thank you.

520
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,375
Bye!

521
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,416
Oh, my God.

522
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,166
Think he'll get diarrhea?

523
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:11,125
Who cares?

524
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,791
I can't. This kind of music makes me cry.

525
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:39,125
Why would a song make you cry?

526
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,958
I hardly ever see you cry.

527
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:45,708
Of course I cry.

528
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:47,833
When?

529
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:52,625
When Hsin-yi died.

530
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:55,125
And…

531
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,458
when my husband died.

532
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,375
I rarely hear you talk about your husband.

533
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:04,833
It wasn't some passionate romance.
It's not worth mentioning.

534
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,083
How did you two meet?

535
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:12,708
He used to come to Kuala Lumpur for work.

536
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,041
I thought he was quite nice.

537
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,750
He gave me a sense of security.

538
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,291
And then we got together.

539
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,166
And then?

540
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,000
I dropped everything,
got married and moved to Taiwan.

541
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,458
Then what happened?

542
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,833
I had Hsin-yi
and the three of us lived our lives.

543
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:29,958
That's it.

544
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:33,791
How did he die?

545
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,916
Cancer.

546
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:46,916
Ever since I learned about the Goddess,

547
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,666
the person I wanted
to revive the most wasn't Hsin-yi.

548
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:51,750
It was my husband.

549
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:54,500
Why not Hsin-yi?

550
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:00,208
Even if she was revived,
she'd only have seven days.

551
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,666
The burden of knowing
your death is imminent

552
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:06,708
is too cruel…

553
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:09,916
for a young girl.

554
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,208
But my husband was different.
He was amazing.

555
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:18,333
When he found out he had cancer,

556
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:21,000
the doctor told him
he had three months left.

557
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,750
He actually kept it from me.

558
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:25,833
He happily got on with life

559
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,375
as if nothing had happened.

560
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:32,000
Then one day, he passed out at home.

561
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:35,208
I took him to the hospital and found out.

562
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:37,625
After that,

563
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:39,583
he never

564
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,625
woke up again.

565
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:46,583
I didn't get the chance
to speak to him one last time.

566
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:49,625
Why did he keep it from you?

567
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:53,333
He was probably worried
I couldn't take it.

568
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:56,416
He kept working hard,

569
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,500
hoping to save enough money
for me and Hsin-yi.

570
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,750
So he refused treatment.

571
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:05,375
Your husband was such a good man.

572
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:11,041
But I couldn't fulfill his wishes.

573
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:13,166
When he was dying,

574
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:16,125
I spent all of our money on his treatment.

575
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:20,166
Even my mother-in-law
urged me not to waste money.

576
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,208
The doctor said his chances were slim.

577
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:24,250
But I wouldn't listen.

578
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:27,125
I wanted him to wake up.

579
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:33,375
If he woke up,

580
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:35,083
what would you say to him?

581
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:39,666
I'd probably yell at him for a bit.

582
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:07,916
If you can't help them, let them die.

583
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:14,500
The Goddess says she cannot
feel the living's longing for him

584
00:47:14,583 --> 00:47:16,166
and cannot resurrect him.

585
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,208
What?

586
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:18,416
How can that be?

587
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:20,041
Please leave.

588
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:21,291
Goddess,

589
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:23,500
please, try--

590
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:48,166
Sorry.

591
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:57,291
I got our daughter killed.

592
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:01,625
Back then,

593
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:03,333
if I had listened to you

594
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:05,416
and not spent all that money,

595
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:11,583
our lives wouldn't have been so tough…

596
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,291
and this wouldn't have happened to
Hsin-yi.

597
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:20,541
I'm so scared.

598
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,125
That's why

599
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:26,166
I need you to wake up.

600
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:32,166
So I can say goodbye to you properly.

601
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,750
I'm all on my own now.

602
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,458
I miss you so much.
