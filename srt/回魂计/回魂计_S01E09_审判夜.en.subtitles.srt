1
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,208
You almost escaped.

2
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,416
You were so close.

3
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,375
But you're doing so well here,
so I'll give you a chance.

4
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,958
Look at your two friends.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,916
One of them snitched on you.

6
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:27,916
Guess who.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,416
Guess.
If you're right, I'll let you kill her.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,000
A life for a life, okay?

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,666
I don't want to.

10
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,541
I was just kidding.

11
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,791
We don't kill people.

12
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,916
We don't just kill people here,
do we?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,416
Okay, just stab her.

14
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,916
Go on, stab her.

15
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:00,750
Here.

16
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,458
One cut and you can go.

17
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,333
Hurry up. Who will do it?

18
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,833
-Hurry up.
-Quick.

19
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,208
One cut won't kill her.

20
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:12,625
Don't be scared.

21
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,458
No.

22
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,166
Fuck, what's up today? I'll do it.

23
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,083
Are you done?

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,916
Let's just say I snitched.

25
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:26,583
Okay?

26
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,625
Otherwise, someone will die.

27
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,125
Come in.

28
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:18,250
Kai.

29
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,208
Can you let Hsin-yi go?

30
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,375
Turn over.

31
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,416
Are you withdrawing everything?

32
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,333
Yes.

33
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:03,791
Sign here.

34
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,541
If you want to close the account,

35
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,583
you must pay the annual fee of 1,800.

36
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,833
Give her 1,800.

37
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,041
Can I get the money now?

38
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,625
It's quite a large amount,

39
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:18,291
so you'll have to collect it
from the VIP counter.

40
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,833
I'll take you there.

41
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,250
Look after this customer.

42
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,500
Who has 200 in cash?

43
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,041
Get their basic information.

44
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,833
I do. I've got it.

45
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,083
Here.

46
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,500
What's the problem?

47
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,458
-How's it going?
-Should be done soon.

48
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,666
You can collect your money now.

49
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,583
Okay.

50
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,250
Kai, we're done.

51
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,416
Let's go.

52
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,375
Hsin-yi.

53
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:39,875
Come on.

54
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,041
Have some water.

55
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,166
Sorry.

56
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,208
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,083
Wait for me.

58
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,000
Hsin-yi.

59
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,375
Hsin-yi.

60
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,041
We can go home now.

61
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:26,916
Hsin-yi.

62
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,583
Let's go.

63
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,416
Hsin-yi.

64
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:36,916
Hsin-yi.

65
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,208
Hsin-yi.

66
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,791
Hsin-yi.

67
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,250
Hsin-yi.

68
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,708
-Hey.
-Go, go! Go already.

69
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,416
Quick!

70
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,166
Kai, there's no time.

71
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,541
Let's go. There's no time. Come on!

72
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,416
Now!

73
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:00,708
09 JUDGEMENT NIGHT

74
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,166
Take a sip.

75
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:22,000
I had planned
to kill Chang Shih-kai today.

76
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,041
But I failed.

77
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,708
It's been five years.

78
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,208
I still can't be as brave as Hsin-yi.

79
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,125
I just don't understand
why Hsin-yi had to die.

80
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,583
Why'd Chang Shih-kai get to live?

81
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,625
How come he still gets to threaten me?

82
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,208
-Why--
-How'd he threaten you?

83
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,500
Hello?

84
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,166
Eason may die.

85
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,250
What?

86
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,375
Wallet. They took the wallet.
What should we do?

87
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,916
Maybe you should leave.
It's too dangerous.

88
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,541
I'll call you later.

89
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,958
I'm done with his threats.

90
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,125
Chang Shih-kai said he'd tell everyone

91
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,875
that I pushed Jin Jin off the building.

92
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,083
I didn't mean it.

93
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,875
It was because

94
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,000
Chang Shih-kai said

95
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,750
that the day we tried to escape,

96
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,000
we only got caught

97
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,833
because someone told him.

98
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,208
I always thought it was Jin Jin.

99
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,541
That night the police came,

100
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,791
we were arguing about it.

101
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,500
Jin Jin!

102
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,500
Jin Jin, where're you going?

103
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,666
Hsin-yi's still in a cage. She needs us.

104
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,083
Don't touch me.

105
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,583
I don't know what'd gotten into her.
I was so mad

106
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,541
because she wouldn't admit it.

107
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,625
Are you going to betray us again?

108
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,291
It was you who told him

109
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,375
about Hsin-yi's escape plan, wasn't it?

110
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,291
You're a murderer just like him.

111
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,750
If I'm a murderer, what are you?

112
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,500
Chang Shih-kai's sex slave?

113
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,208
Then I…

114
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,041
But I only just found out

115
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,833
that Jin Jin got Hsin-yi to go there

116
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,125
so she could save me.

117
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,708
Why did I believe
Chang Shih-kai back then?

118
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,333
They were my closest friends.

119
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,208
But I never trusted Jin Jin.

120
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:52,166
At least you alerted the police
and saved a lot of people.

121
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,833
It wasn't me.

122
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,583
It was Jin Jin.

123
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,208
My mom said the banknote had gotten lost

124
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,375
and Jin Jin was in a coma,

125
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,333
so she forced me to play the hero.

126
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,291
Can I still say it was me?

127
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,791
CHAO CHING

128
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,333
The Tai Chi Association got the wallet.

129
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,416
I'll still keep my promise.

130
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,583
I don't know why.

131
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,583
I should hate you more than anyone.

132
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,833
But when I see you now,

133
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,833
I don't feel a thing.

134
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,416
You hate Chao Ching right now.

135
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,250
You never wanted revenge.

136
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,416
You just wanted to help her

137
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,833
because you cared about her.

138
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,250
I'll be honest.

139
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,125
I could accept the death penalty.

140
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,333
But I can't accept
Chao Ching's punishment.

141
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,875
Who gave her the right to punish me?

142
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,500
Who does she think she is?

143
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,041
It's not her place.

144
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,000
Then whose is it?

145
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,625
God.

146
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,666
God dictated I was born an orphan.

147
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,208
He decided
that I'd have her for a mother.

148
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,583
He saw everything I went through.

149
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,375
Only he knows

150
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,916
that anyone in that situation

151
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,916
would do exactly the same thing.

152
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,416
No matter what Jin Jin and I did…

153
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,041
…Chao Ching has no right to judge us.

154
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,250
If it had been Hsin-yi who hurt Jin Jin,

155
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,958
I know you wouldn't hurt her.

156
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,333
Because she's Chao Ching's daughter.

157
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,166
Tonight,

158
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,208
your mom will use that charity event

159
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,208
to launder all the money
in the crypto wallet.

160
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,375
I can help you.

161
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,083
Hello, Hsu Yung from Super News.

162
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,125
This is Chao Ching.

163
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,000
I have a big scoop.

164
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,041
Are you interested?

165
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,083
This way please. This way.

166
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,666
Welcome. Thank you for coming.

167
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,833
Thank you.

168
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,875
-So pretty.
-Thank you. Thank you.

169
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,458
-Am I late?
-Not at all.

170
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,708
Hello, Mr. Kuo.

171
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,208
-Thank you.
-You've done a good job.

172
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,416
It all looks so good.

173
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,750
I knew you could get this done.

174
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,625
You deserve this.

175
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,000
Mr. Yuan, let me introduce Mr. Kuo.

176
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,291
-Hello.
-Hi, Mr. Yuan.

177
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,875
-Wow.
-We completely redecorated.

178
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,041
That's where the pardoning takes place.

179
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,041
You've created such a unique ambiance.

180
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,541
We put a lot into this event.

181
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,458
What's that?

182
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,208
Sanching water. Have you tried it?

183
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,291
Try some. It will protect you.

184
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,416
To prosperity.

185
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,541
-Drink up.
-Excellent. To health and prosperity.

186
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,166
Hello, please try some.

187
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,958
Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. Hsu.
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

188
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,000
You look beautiful today.

189
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,291
-Sir. Have some water.
-Let me introduce you.

190
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,583
Mr. and Mrs. Yang,
this is Mr. and Mrs. Hsu.

191
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:54,916
Thank you for coming.

192
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,166
Sir, is there a problem?

193
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,958
This water grants protection,
wellness, and prosperity.

194
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,083
It's classy in here.

195
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,250
Mr. Kuo.

196
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,833
Wow, what a coincidence.

197
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,208
What brings you here?

198
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,666
They asked me to come

199
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,708
and witness your act of generosity.

200
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,625
I see.

201
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,416
Mr. Kuo, I've got an idea.

202
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,000
Since you've become
a major player in the party,

203
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,333
why don't you come on Super News?

204
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,500
We had great ratings
last time you came on.

205
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,250
I'm just messing.

206
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,166
I know.

207
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:02,708
Okay, see you.

208
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,250
Thank you. Mr. Kuo.

209
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,166
Yes?

210
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,583
-Don't you need to go?
-No.

211
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,875
I'm just kidding.

212
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,000
Come. It's free now.

213
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,875
-We'll chat later.
-Okay.

214
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,500
Go ahead.

215
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,250
It's always great seeing you.

216
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,208
Just a minute.

217
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:31,958
This is the men's.

218
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,083
Ladies' is next door.

219
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,625
Hello, Mr. Kuo.

220
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,083
What's this?

221
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,250
I'd like to do you a favor.

222
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,625
We must practice self-reflection
and cultivate the three virtues:

223
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,000
patience, perseverance,
and inner peace.

224
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,708
We must learn to overcome adversity
and transcend our karma.

225
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,291
Heavy karma often breeds

226
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,750
greater delusions.

227
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,916
We cultivate to transcend life and death.

228
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,125
That is the Sanching way.
You are all Good Samaritans.

229
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,208
You are all Good Samaritans.

230
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,666
Where's Mr. Kuo?

231
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,666
Get Ms. Chou.
Find out where Mr. Kuo is.

232
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,583
Ms. Chou left.

233
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,166
-She left?
-We must practice…

234
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,666
She went to the hotel.
I called a car for her.

235
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,583
-Find Mr. Kuo.
-Okay.

236
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:16,583
We must learn to overcome adversity
and transcend our karma.

237
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,125
Heavy karma often breeds

238
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,083
greater delusions.

239
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,375
Mr. Kuo, there you are.

240
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,291
Please come up.

241
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:26,041
It's almost time.
Get ready to say your part.

242
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,666
-Come.
-Where's Ms. Chou?

243
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,333
Didn't you send her to the hotel?

244
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,416
To the hotel?

245
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,916
Today marks the creation

246
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:38,333
of the Sanching Tai Chi
Association Charity Fund.

247
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,625
We're most honored
to have Mr. Kuo Chih-chieh with us

248
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,250
to say a few words.

249
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,000
-Mr. Kuo.
-Mr. Kuo.

250
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,458
-Mr. Kuo.
-Please.

251
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,833
I'd like to do you a favor.

252
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,916
When you go up on stage,

253
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,833
make all the Sanching Tai Chi
Association's illegal activities public.

254
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,208
What illegal activities?

255
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,583
What're you talking about?

256
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:10,958
Take a look.

257
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,750
Your secretary gave them to me.

258
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:17,166
I'd like to give you a chance.

259
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,375
Do you want the news to report

260
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,208
how you're a hero
who uncovered money laundering?

261
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:26,250
Or do you want me to give
this information to that reporter

262
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,625
and seal your reputation
as a corrupt politician?

263
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,333
Your choice.

264
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,333
Hey. Hey!

265
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,333
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Hey.

266
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:15,250
Nothing.

267
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,416
Intrusion. Intrusion.

268
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,541
Intrusion. Intrusion.

269
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,500
What're you doing here?

270
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,041
I said I'd take care of it.

271
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,791
This mission can't go wrong.

272
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,208
Don't worry about that.

273
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:44,375
And stop interfering in this.

274
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,125
-Hey. Hey.
-Get off. Let go of me.

275
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:02,583
Who are you?

276
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,208
Charity funds

277
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,875
are business organizations

278
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,000
that raise and manage funds

279
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:19,250
to help disadvantaged groups

280
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,208
and promote public welfare
and social causes.

281
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,333
They are a collective expression

282
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,500
of human kindness and spirit.

283
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:32,958
And they should enjoy widespread support
and praise from all walks of life.

284
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,625
Are you okay?

285
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,166
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

286
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,083
Can you manage?

287
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,833
But some people

288
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,208
use charity as a front

289
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,083
to cover illicit transactions,
launder money,

290
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:16,250
and transfer funds to fraud syndicates.

291
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,833
Mr. Kuo isn't well.
He needs to take a rest.

292
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:20,875
Help him down. Thank you.

293
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:22,500
I'm sorry. It's all right.

294
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,041
Sorry, he isn't feeling well.

295
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,083
It's fine. Everything's fine.

296
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:27,333
It's okay. It's fine.

297
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,541
Stop filming!

298
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,250
DELETE
NO PHOTOS OR VIDEOS

299
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,125
Silence!

300
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:47,500
Silence!

301
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:48,916
-Silence!
-Sit down.

302
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,500
-Sit down.
-Everyone, stay here.

303
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,750
Seal the place.

304
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,708
What the hell is going on?

305
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:58,625
Calm down. Everything's fine

306
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:01,000
-Sit down.
-Stay where you are.

307
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,000
Stay calm.

308
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,833
-Sit down.
-Sit down.

309
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:05,916
What's going on?

310
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:07,458
Sit down!

311
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,916
Sit down! Sit down!

312
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,083
Sit down! Sit down!

313
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:16,833
Sit down! Sit down!

314
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:26,375
Mother fuckers.

315
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,583
I'll deal with you later.

316
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,291
It's all right. Everyone, it's fine.

317
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,416
It's all right, it's…

318
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,708
What is going on?

319
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,666
Why has everyone passed out?

320
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,541
Someone drugged the Sanching water.

321
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:29,333
Hurry up and get the donations.

322
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,583
My fellow Good Samaritans.

323
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,875
I'll set an example
by donating all my assets.

324
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:38,875
I hope everyone will follow suit. Here.

325
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,666
Sister Yueh-hsin
has donated all her assets.

326
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:45,250
I hope you will all support the fund.

327
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:46,458
Thank you.

328
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:49,541
Don't let
Mr. Kuo's behavior trouble you.

329
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:52,500
Everyone, listen to me. Listen to me.

330
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:54,041
-Be quiet!
-How can you--

331
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,750
Let's stick to the schedule!

332
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,375
Start with the donations, okay?

333
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,833
I promise
that none of this will get out.

334
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,833
Let's get these donations made.

335
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:03,958
-Yes.
-Yes.

336
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:07,000
May the heavens bless all Good Samaritans.

337
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,791
May the heavens bless--

338
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,958
Get off!

339
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:44,291
This way.

340
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,458
-Let me in.
-Get lost!

341
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:12,291
Mom.

342
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,708
Kai.

343
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:09,875
Remember

344
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,208
how much I--

345
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:36,166
Kai. Kai.

346
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:50,833
Give me the wallet.

347
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:51,750
Kai.

348
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,625
For old time's sake.

349
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,958
We've almost finished
laundering the money.

350
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:59,125
You can manage the new resort

351
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:01,208
once we've purchased the land.

352
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,500
Give me the wallet.

353
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:17,666
Don't worry.

354
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:19,291
It's still yours.

355
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,791
-Passcode.
-Everything is still yours.

356
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:25,750
Tell me the passcode

357
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:30,458
or I'll put
everything you taught me into practice.

358
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,291
736041.

359
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:50,583
ENTER PIN TO UNLOCK

360
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,333
Do you remember teaching me

361
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,208
to leave no survivors?

362
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:50,541
Pong.

363
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,291
Wake up.

364
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:54,416
Pong.

365
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:57,583
Wake up.

366
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,000
Wake up.

367
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:03,625
Wake up.

368
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:54,875
Hey.

369
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:55,791
Hey!

370
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:57,166
Come back!

371
00:39:57,791 --> 00:39:59,333
Think you can get away?

372
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,250
See where you run to!

373
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,583
Come out here. Hey.

374
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,458
You knew this day would come
after you released me, right?

375
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:25,750
Hey.

376
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,166
I'm down to one bullet.

377
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:44,875
I promised Hui-chun
I'd save it for you.

378
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:46,833
How do you feel right now?

379
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,166
How does betrayal feel?

380
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,750
Did you kill Jin Jin?

381
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:48,541
She's lying to you.

382
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:00,583
There's only one bullet left.

383
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:04,000
Don't waste it on me.

384
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:07,083
I've got what I wanted.

385
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,500
I promise you.

386
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,625
If you let me go,

387
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:13,125
you and your daughter
will never see me again.

388
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:15,583
It'll be over.

389
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:19,625
But not for her.

390
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:21,875
As long as she's alive,

391
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:23,000
she'll come for you.

392
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,875
As long as she lives,
she'll come for you and Jin Jin.

393
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,458
I played you all.

394
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,250
None of them

395
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:58,000
snitched about the escape.

396
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:00,791
Kai.

397
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,375
I will get you out of here.

398
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,916
Can I bring my friends? Just two.

399
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:15,166
You're as dumb as your daughters.

400
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:16,833
There's zero trust.

401
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:22,000
I told you
there's no real trust between people.

402
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,000
I disagree.

403
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,208
I trust Chao Ching.

404
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,166
Eason may die.

405
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:52,333
Chao Ching needs to speak to you.

406
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:55,750
I'll tell you everything I know.

407
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,791
Can you still trust me?

408
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:01,541
I can help you tonight.

409
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:12,916
Did you really think
you had a second chance?

410
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:21,000
You done yet?

411
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:40,250
You think once you're dead,

412
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:41,750
it will all be over?

413
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,166
We can resurrect him.

414
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:47,958
-Let's use those seven days…
-40 million in cash.

415
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,375
to get the justice we deserve.

416
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:55,333
Now you've agreed to help us,
we'll give you a life full of hope

417
00:44:55,416 --> 00:44:56,333
and freedom.

418
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:57,833
I'll take you to Myanmar.

419
00:44:57,916 --> 00:44:59,166
I'll get them all together

420
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,500
and make a comeback.

421
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,041
It isn't the despair that hurts the most…

422
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:08,666
it's the endless hope.

423
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:43,791
Is it over?

424
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:48,541
Is it all over?

425
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:02,791
In two hours' time,

426
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:06,250
the medical flight
will take Jin Jin back to Taiwan.

427
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:09,583
Go with her.

428
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:46,958
Have a look.

429
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,833
Hey.

430
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:21,833
Give me the wallet.

431
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:26,125
No.

432
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,625
We got it. Let them go.

433
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,875
If anything happens,
I'll take responsibility.

434
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:04,958
Go now!

435
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,500
-Get out of the vehicle.
-Get out!

436
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,500
-Hurry up!
-Hey, over there!

437
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:33,208
Over there!

438
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:35,541
Hey, stop!

439
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:37,208
Get out!

440
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:38,791
Quickly!

441
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,208
I told you to hurry, now!

442
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:41,666
Hurry up! Move!

443
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,500
Yang, we shouldn't
underestimate these influencers.

444
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:47,833
They've got thousands of followers.

445
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:50,708
Since we started
using social media to recruit people,

446
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,583
our sales have increased so much.

447
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:56,125
You wanted a way
to close this compound, right?

448
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:57,958
I've been thinking,

449
00:48:58,041 --> 00:48:59,333
why not take this chance

450
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:02,208
to get my mom to retire?

451
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,291
Kai, someone like your mom

452
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:05,791
is never going to step down.

453
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:08,375
If she doesn't,
then Yang can just get rid of her.

454
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:12,041
Nice shot! Round of applause!

455
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:21,125
Look at Kai.

456
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,750
You want the compound shut down,

457
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:25,125
but all he thinks of
is getting rid of his mom.

458
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:27,625
If he's happy to betray his mom today,

459
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:29,541
then what about you someday?

460
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,791
I'm just kidding.

461
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:37,458
If you want the compound shut down,

462
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,625
I have an idea.

463
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:44,750
I can go to the police as a victim

464
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,875
and get rid of him and his mother.

465
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:52,958
You want to give
young people a chance, right?

466
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,375
Well I'm younger than Chang Shih-kai.
