1
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,000
Is everything there?

2
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,208
Don't worry. There's plenty.

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,791
The vegetables aren't very fresh.

4
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,458
It's too hot.

5
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:31,791
-Still complaining?
-Help me! Help me, please!

6
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,166
Help me!

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,583
Please help me!

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,125
Hey, stop that kid!
What the hell? Damn it!

9
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,833
Come here. Hey! Pong, get out the way!

10
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,416
Move. Out the way!

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,041
Come here.

12
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,875
-Come here.
-Hey, hey, easy, man.

13
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,291
Come here quickly.

14
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,583
Get out here. Go!

15
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,250
-Hey, take it easy! Take it easy.
-No!

16
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,041
-What are you looking at?
-Go!

17
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:53,916
Take her away!

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,791
What are you waiting for?

19
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:00,958
Get back to work.

20
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,583
Stay out of it.

21
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,666
Hurry up! Come on, hurry!

22
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,083
-Quick!
-Go!

23
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,000
Move faster!

24
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,791
Hurry up!

25
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:19,791
Hurry!

26
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,750
-Go, go quickly!
-Keep walking.

27
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,291
-Keep moving.
-Go!

28
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,666
-Hurry up, hurry. Behind, faster!
-Go faster!

29
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,833
Hurry!

30
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,416
-Walk faster!
-Hurry, go!

31
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:32,666
What was that?

32
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,041
-Keep walking.
-Go! Keep moving.

33
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,083
Hurry!

34
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,208
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

35
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,250
-Keep walking.
-Those behind, faster!

36
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,375
-Hurry!
-Go!

37
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,708
Walk faster!

38
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:03,625
Go!

39
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,875
Tell him to take her and bury the body.

40
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,041
Get rid of her.

41
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:09,958
Hey.

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,583
Take her away.

43
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,375
Go!

44
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,750
Clean this up.

45
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,083
No, don't run! Don't run!

46
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,166
No, no. No, no…

47
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,541
There are many guards outside.
Many guards over there.

48
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,541
Come here. Come here.

49
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,500
It's okay. I won't hurt you.

50
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,250
Calm down.

51
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,833
Listen to me.

52
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,250
You see that wall?

53
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,416
There is electricity up there.

54
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,166
You cannot cross it.

55
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,208
There's still a higher wall outside

56
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,666
and many guards outside.

57
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,208
So you will be taken back.

58
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,416
If you run,

59
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,833
you die.

60
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,958
But if I stay, I die.

61
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,500
Okay.

62
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,625
Come with me.

63
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,291
I will get you out of here.

64
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,291
I come here to work every day.

65
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,375
They don't check me.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,833
Okay?

67
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,708
You just…

68
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
You just hide inside my car

69
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,083
and keep quiet.

70
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,416
You are definitely okay.

71
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,875
Okay?

72
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:38,958
Let's go.

73
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,250
Wait.

74
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,250
Can I bring my friends?

75
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,166
Just two.

76
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,083
-No.
-Please.

77
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,291
Tomorrow, same time.

78
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,583
Please.

79
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:53,875
Hey.

80
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,250
Hey.

81
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,958
Okay.

82
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,541
Be careful.

83
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,833
You lie low.

84
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:26,750
Keep quiet.

85
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,250
I will tell you

86
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,000
when it's safe
by knocking on the car four times.

87
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,500
Then you can come out, okay?

88
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,625
Done for the day?

89
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,541
Yes.

90
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,166
You guys sure have a tough job.

91
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,125
Have a cigarette.

92
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,041
Sure.

93
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,708
Okay, you can go.

94
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,458
Are we there?

95
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,125
Shh.

96
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,750
What do you want?

97
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,750
The girls are so happy.

98
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,500
Give them some hope.

99
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,791
06 Chaos Day

100
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,833
I never believed they'd actually manage

101
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,916
to get Chang Shih-kai out.

102
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,583
I didn't either. He was on death row.

103
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,875
Exactly.

104
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,375
How'd they pull it off?

105
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,458
Who knows?

106
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,333
What're you talking about?

107
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,875
We're just wondering

108
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,333
how you managed
to get Chang Shih-kai out alive.

109
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,666
Well…

110
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,708
How do I put it?

111
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,375
It was so complicated,

112
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,625
you know?

113
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,000
So, we…

114
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,208
Paid lots of money.

115
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,666
Right. We bribed the guards,

116
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,416
switched the injections

117
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,500
and faked his death.

118
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,541
Then we bribed the crematorium staff

119
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,708
and got him out.

120
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,583
They used money…

121
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,500
Paid money.

122
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,041
…bribed the guards,

123
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,458
and faked his death.

124
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,750
They stole a person…

125
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:38,875
From the crematorium.

126
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,916
That's what happened?

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,875
Yes.

128
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,333
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

129
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,666
We spent loads of money.

130
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,583
Right.

131
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,041
Okay.

132
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,875
It's not bad. Pretty spicy.

133
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,958
This broth's good.

134
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,083
We've got work to do.

135
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,750
Hurry up and eat.

136
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,250
The paperwork's done.

137
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,833
Can I have my passport back?

138
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,333
What's the rush?

139
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,166
I'll contact you after I've checked them.

140
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,125
Checked what?

141
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,041
SUN KUO-CHIANG

142
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,250
How long must I wait?

143
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,291
Until I'm happy.

144
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,458
Fine.

145
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,541
Aren't you going to say hi to Jin Jin?

146
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,500
I have lots going on.
The caregiver can't come at night.

147
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,166
I want you
to look after Jin Jin in the evenings.

148
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,166
She is your daughter.

149
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:59,458
I trust you won't
let anything happen to her.

150
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,083
You're awake?

151
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,166
Want some breakfast?

152
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,833
What are you doing?

153
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,416
Trading cryptocurrency.

154
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,375
You're angry?

155
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,208
Well?

156
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,000
Here.

157
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,416
I bought you a present.

158
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,833
What for?

159
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:11,041
It's your favorite color.

160
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,041
-A dress?
-Yeah.

161
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,125
Mom wants to have dinner with us.

162
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,333
I know.

163
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,416
-When?
-Tonight.

164
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,875
-Tonight?
-Yes.

165
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,250
What's wrong?

166
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,666
No need to worry.

167
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,625
She just wants to get to know you.

168
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,125
And I want to let her know

169
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,500
that we're thinking of getting married.

170
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,375
Married?

171
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,000
You'd better answer.

172
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,291
Who is it?

173
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
My mom.

174
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,041
Hey, Mom.

175
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,416
Come and get your money.

176
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,583
Just transfer it to my account.

177
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,708
I can only give you cash.
But I'm warning you

178
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,750
keep your mouth shut.

179
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,041
Okay. Thank you, Mom.

180
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:36,125
Those who emulate the sages
are kind and talented.

181
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,541
As we live our lives,

182
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,166
we must practice cultivation.

183
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,458
Not to pursue perfection,

184
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,875
but to accept our own imperfections

185
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,375
and face the world with impartiality.

186
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,458
Follow the path, worship,

187
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,000
and study with devotion.

188
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:55,708
We…

189
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,833
-What's wrong?
-We…

190
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,958
The gods appeared to me in a dream.

191
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,500
I was told

192
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,375
if I let go of the resentment in my heart,

193
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,708
my daughter would wake up.

194
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,125
But my daughter still hasn't woken up.

195
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,458
Can you perform
another ritual for my daughter?

196
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,916
If my daughter could just wake up,

197
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,791
I'd commit to doing good

198
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,583
and donate lots and lots of money.

199
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,875
Master, you are powerful.
Please help her.

200
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,041
Yes, please help her.

201
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,583
Please help me.

202
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,333
Okay.

203
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,583
I'll perform a ritual for you.

204
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,333
Thank you.

205
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:54,833
Thank you, Master.

206
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,500
A ritual won't work.

207
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,875
You still haven't let go
of the resentment in your heart.

208
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,333
Yueh-hua, Yueh-chia,

209
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,416
we're short on staff.

210
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,000
Go help out in the cafeteria.

211
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,958
-Let's go to the cafeteria.
-We'll all go.

212
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,375
-I'm sure he'll help you.
-Things will improve.

213
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,916
Thank you, thank you.

214
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,291
Drop the act.

215
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,375
Tell me.

216
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,958
What exactly do you want?

217
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,541
To pray for the gods' blessings.

218
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:58,625
Don't be dumb.

219
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,166
I don't believe this religious baloney.

220
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,125
No matter how much I pray,

221
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,916
my son's never coming back.

222
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,833
And your daughter won't wake up.

223
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,333
I don't know if she will ever wake up,

224
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,875
but your son really has come back to life.

225
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,375
Mom, this is Chang Shih-kai.

226
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,833
It's April 10th, 2024.

227
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,333
This is today's newspaper.

228
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,041
It's proof I'm still alive.

229
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,250
I'll explain
what happened after I get out.

230
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,250
Prepare 40 million right away.

231
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,791
How is he alive?

232
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,041
Are you happy?

233
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,875
There's a blue van outside.

234
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,000
Put 40 million in cash

235
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,833
in the trunk.

236
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,541
Go to the address in the GPS

237
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,208
at 8 p.m. tonight

238
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,333
and you'll be able to see him.

239
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,083
Remember. No guns or bodyguards.

240
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,208
If my partner
isn't back by the specified time,

241
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,083
I'll reveal to the world
everything Chang Shih-kai has told us.

242
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,750
May the gods bless you.

243
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,208
Welcome.

244
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,250
-Hey.
-Hey.

245
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,208
Everyone, get out.

246
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,291
Turn off the music.

247
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,208
You can stay.

248
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,708
Sit there.

249
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,291
Who said you could leave?

250
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,791
I told you to stay in Taiwan.

251
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,083
If it goes to court,
we'll get a top lawyer.

252
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,375
You'll be out in a few days.
Why run?

253
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,625
I'm not running.

254
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,125
I'm taking care of something.

255
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,291
Don't worry.

256
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,208
Yang's arranged everything.

257
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,750
Kai.

258
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,625
It's almost time.
You'd better go and pack.

259
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,958
Don't worry.
I'll call when I get there.

260
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,041
So you knew he was leaving?

261
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,250
I only just found out.

262
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,750
I woke up in the middle of the night
and An Chi was missing.

263
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,166
I was worried about her,

264
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,916
so I tracked her phone's location
and called the police.

265
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,458
Sorry, don't hold it against me.

266
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,625
It was just a misunderstanding.

267
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,291
You didn't ask me here

268
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,833
just to say that, did you?

269
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,000
I have a favor to ask.

270
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,583
If the evidence holds up

271
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,958
and the court accepts it,

272
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,000
can you return Chang Shih-kai…

273
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,750
…return Chang Shih-kai
to his original state?

274
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:38,916
What state?

275
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,375
Legally speaking,

276
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,750
Chang Shih-kai is dead.

277
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,208
As long as he's alive,

278
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,208
he's a threat to you and Hui-chun, no?

279
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,500
I'm only asking this for your sake.

280
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,125
You're such a hypocrite.

281
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,250
If that's all, I'm leaving.

282
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,125
Okay, I admit it.

283
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,958
I want Chang Shih-kai dead.

284
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,958
I don't want An Chi and her baby…

285
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,375
…living in his shadow.

286
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,833
Are you sure An Chi was raped?

287
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,208
What do you mean by that?

288
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,708
I think there was more
going on between them.

289
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,583
Did Chang Shih-kai tell you that?

290
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,833
One thing keeps bothering me.

291
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,416
Jin Jin got Hsin-yi to come here.

292
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,166
Jin Jin told Hui-chun

293
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,791
that An Chi asked her to come.

294
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,250
So who asked An Chi

295
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,208
to come here?

296
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,583
Think about this rationally.

297
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,500
An Chi told me
that Jin Jin asked her to come.

298
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,833
And if An Chi
was Chang Shih-kai's girlfriend,

299
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,750
why would she alert the police?

300
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,250
Besides, she'd never
fall for someone like him.

301
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,291
-Have proof of that?
-Have you got any?

302
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,000
How do you know
Hui-chun and Jin Jin weren't lying?

303
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,083
I had a case once.

304
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,458
Some high school students
were doing drugs together.

305
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,666
One of them died of an overdose.

306
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,250
His mother filed a lawsuit

307
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,291
against all his friends that were there

308
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,583
because she believed

309
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,083
that her son was led astray

310
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,375
and they killed him.

311
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,375
Do you know what the outcome was?

312
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,916
The guy who overdosed

313
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,416
was a drug dealer.

314
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,541
He had supplied all the drugs.

315
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,166
What are you trying to say?

316
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,333
That not everyone

317
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,875
who appears to be the victim actually is.

318
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:13,625
Just because
Jin Jin is lying in a hospital bed

319
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,958
doesn't make this An Chi's fault.

320
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,916
Even if it was Hsin-yi's fault,

321
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,250
I still want the truth.

322
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,250
You should concentrate
on proving they're laundering money.

323
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,375
Once this is all over, I will…

324
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,500
How did you put it?

325
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,125
"Return Chang Shih-kai

326
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,666
to his original state."

327
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,458
SANCHING TAI CHI ASSOCIATION

328
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,500
Is Kai really still alive?

329
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,041
Couldn't the video be fake?

330
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,958
That's why I need to see for myself.

331
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:24,125
If it's true, we're in big trouble.

332
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,375
Don't give them any money.

333
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,250
Just get someone to kill them.

334
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,208
Bidding on that land will start soon.

335
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,125
I don't want bloody hands

336
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,208
at such a crucial time.

337
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,833
That's all the money we have.

338
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:38,208
We'll have plenty more
once the fund's set up.

339
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,791
This is nothing in comparison.

340
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,125
Is that all for me?

341
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:46,958
Damn.

342
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,875
I forgot to tell you
that it'll take a few days.

343
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,708
A few days?

344
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:55,041
You promised to have it today.

345
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,958
-Well I don't.
-What's that then?

346
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:57,916
She needs that.

347
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,208
I'm not talking to you.

348
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,166
Where's the rest?

349
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,666
Where'd you hide Kai's money?

350
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,291
That's enough. Get out!

351
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,333
Why should I? That money's mine.

352
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,833
You promised Kai.

353
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,875
You can have it after the wake.

354
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,875
-Just wait until then.
-I need it now!

355
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,041
Chang I-ting!

356
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:18,958
You've got one hour

357
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,000
to get me that money

358
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,458
or who knows what I'll do.

359
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,916
I might just take us all down.

360
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,291
What're you doing? Let go!

361
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,458
Lock her up!

362
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:45,833
Fuck you!

363
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:16,041
Okay, okay.

364
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,000
Okay.

365
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,333
Guess who I saw in jail?

366
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,583
Here.

367
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,333
Hey, hurry up! Faster!

368
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,375
What are you doing? Huh?

369
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,250
Get going! Eat up!

370
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:15,875
-Let's go!
-It's not our business.

371
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:17,708
-Go!
-Hurry up!

372
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:20,208
Come on.
It's none of our business. Keep going!

373
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,416
I met Chung in jail.

374
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,291
He told me

375
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,916
it was no accident that you were arrested.

376
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,458
Someone wanted him to kill you.

377
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,500
Be careful.

378
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:09,958
Okay. You too.

379
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,791
What is this? Open up!

380
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:22,708
What is this?

381
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:01,083
Hello? Eason? What's up?

382
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:04,000
Nothing, I just wanted to tell you

383
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,625
I've paid for the bangles.

384
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,375
I'll bring them tonight

385
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:08,875
as a gift from you.

386
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,583
No, I wanted to pay for them.

387
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,083
I get why you wanted to.

388
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:15,916
And I know the money
doesn't matter to you.

389
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,083
Of course it doesn't.

390
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:18,833
But this is my first gift to her.

391
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:20,458
I can't have you pay.

392
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:23,375
It's fine.
It doesn't matter who pays for what.

393
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:26,375
Just remember to be on time tonight.

394
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,875
Mom's going to love you.

395
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,041
Okay.

396
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:31,208
I'll be there.

397
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:32,666
Hurry.

398
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,083
Get the lighter.

399
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:00,958
Looks like Chung wasn't lying.

400
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,583
The person who wanted you dead.

401
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:30,166
Give me your phone.

402
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,000
And all your money.

403
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,041
I'll give it to you. Here's one million.

404
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,083
Kill him for me.

405
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:56,625
Okay.

406
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,125
Get him into the car.

407
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,625
I will help you.

408
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:22,625
Go.

409
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:49,291
Shit.

410
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,041
-Here.
-Okay. Okay.

411
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,375
This way, please.

412
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:11,541
Sorry, I'm late.

413
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,458
What is it? Where's your mom?

414
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,250
She already left.

415
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:20,125
Eason, I'm sorry.

416
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:22,666
Something really important came up.
Wait for me.

417
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,458
My mom just gave this to me.

418
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:50,333
Is that you in the photo?

419
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,833
Chang Shih-kai's your brother.

420
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,833
MURDERERS FORFEIT THEIR LIVES.
JUSTICE IS DONE.

421
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,666
What have you got to say?

422
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,208
Eason.

423
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:21,791
Eason!

424
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:48,375
Hello, Kevin?

425
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,291
I've exchanged the Bitcoins.
You got the money?

426
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:57,583
This may not follow the rules,
but I need to cancel the bangle deal.

427
00:36:57,666 --> 00:37:00,166
Just refund the money
to Ms. Chang's credit card.

428
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,125
Thank you.

429
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,250
I returned the bangles.

430
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,833
You don't need to pay.

431
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:20,750
Look, I'm not angry
about your family's background.

432
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,208
I'm angry you kept it from me.

433
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:29,166
You think my feelings for you
would change because of this?

434
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,208
What your brother did

435
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,125
had nothing to do with you.

436
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,125
You have your own life.

437
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:48,083
Come with me.

438
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:53,833
We'll go somewhere no one knows us.

439
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,416
Give me two years.

440
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,958
Then I won't need my mom's permission

441
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,916
to access the family trust fund.

442
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,000
But until then,

443
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,541
life with me isn't going to be easy.

444
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:19,375
I can fix all that.

445
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:43,625
You were right.

446
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:44,541
Shh.

447
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,416
Is she sleeping?

448
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,375
Yes.

449
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,041
Thanks for looking after her.

450
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,083
Chang Shih-kai's mother

451
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,500
does have a crypto wallet.

452
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,208
Chang I-ting's gone
to the Tai Chi Association to get it.

453
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:02,416
Once she gets the crypto wallet,

454
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,916
make sure she leaves it with you.

455
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:06,125
Okay.

456
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,000
She really trusts you now, right?

457
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:10,583
Absolutely.

458
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,041
That's good.

459
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,166
Once you get the wallet,

460
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:29,166
this will all be over.

461
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:31,666
Thanks for everything you've done.

462
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:46,166
I've been meaning to ask you something.

463
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:51,041
After I give you the wallet,

464
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,375
will you have no more use for me?

465
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:02,666
I'm kidding.

466
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,375
I know you're stressed out.

467
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:06,083
Just trying to lighten the mood.

468
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,666
It's not like I like you.

469
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,333
We have a working relationship,

470
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:12,041
so I'm happy to be useful.

471
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,708
-I…
-I was never trying to use you.

472
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,125
You're amazing.

473
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,750
Actually…

474
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:50,041
Jin Jin,

475
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:53,166
An Chi finally came to see you.

476
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:57,125
Ms Wang,
can I talk to you about something?

477
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:03,750
What is it?

478
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,458
One million.

479
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:13,750
Hui-chun.

480
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:15,541
We're done. Heading back now.

481
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:35,666
What happened?

482
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,666
There is something you need to know.

483
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:48,208
How'd Chang Shih-kai know
I was helping those girls escape?

484
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:51,041
Because someone snitched.

485
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,541
One of the girls is…

486
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,333
Kai's girlfriend.

487
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:16,291
Jin Jin asked me to come.

488
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,083
Jin Jin said you asked her.

489
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,333
She wasn't telling you the truth.

490
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,666
Jin Jin had been to Benkha before.

491
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:27,625
And she met Chang Shih-kai before I did.

492
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:28,791
How can that be?

493
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:30,125
It's true.

494
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,333
I never mentioned it,

495
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:35,208
because she was my friend.

496
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:38,083
I didn't want people
thinking she was involved.

497
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:40,291
And if Chao Ching knew,

498
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,875
she'd never have forgiven her.

499
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:56,333
How dare you
say that in front of Jin Jin.

500
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:00,125
Did your mom get you to say this?

501
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:01,250
Well?

502
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,916
I'm not lying.

503
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,541
Jin Jin already knew Chang Shih-kai.

504
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,750
-And she started all this.
-That's enough.

505
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,083
Leave.

506
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,208
Leave!

507
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:42,041
Hello, I'm Jin Jin.

508
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:45,250
It's June 1st, 2 p.m.

509
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,583
I just got off the plane.

510
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,666
This is my good friend, An Chi.

511
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:49,916
Hello!

512
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:53,000
Guys, honestly,
the weather here is so…

513
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:56,958
I'm Jin Jin. It's June 1st…

514
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:01,958
JUNE 1ST, 2 P.M.

515
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,916
DEPARTED 22ND FEBRUARY, 2019

516
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,208
I bought some noodles.

517
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:54,125
Okay.

518
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:14,583
Are you okay?

519
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,125
I'm fine.

520
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:17,708
Just a bit tired.

521
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:30,208
An Chi came to the hospital today.

522
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,875
She told me it was Jin Jin

523
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,875
who tricked her into coming to Benkha.

524
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:40,541
And that Jin Jin
and Chang Shih-kai had a thing.

525
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,625
What a joke.

526
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,208
She had Chang Shih-kai's baby

527
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:46,583
and bad mouths Jin Jin.

528
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:47,875
What's she up to?

529
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:51,250
Jin Jin can't even defend herself.

530
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,458
What if she could?

531
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:00,041
What do you mean?

532
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:06,375
If Jin Jin does die,

533
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,791
we can resurrect her
like we did Chang Shih-kai.

534
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:13,708
Do you know what you're saying?

535
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:15,875
Then we'll find out the truth.

536
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:18,208
So we kill my daughter
to find out the truth?

537
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,333
What if she wakes up

538
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:26,333
and it wasn't her?

539
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:32,416
At least you'll have seven days

540
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,208
to say goodbye to her properly.

541
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,541
Hsin-yi never got the chance.

542
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:04,916
Are you happy?

543
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:08,416
Feel some hope?

544
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:24,333
The wallet and gun are gone.

545
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:27,583
The invites are out. We can't delay.

546
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:29,291
Who cares about that?

547
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:31,458
She's stolen my life savings!

548
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:33,000
Find her.

549
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:36,041
If we don't get it back before the event,
we're dead meat.
