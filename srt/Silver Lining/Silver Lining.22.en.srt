1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya

2
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,440
Luo Xun

3
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,740
I suspect I've actually killed someone before.

4
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,700
Taking personal revenge.

5
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,200
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,400
Well,

7
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,400
the fact that you're saying this

8
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,000
means you definitely don't believe it's true.

9
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,400
Actually, I've recovered quite a bit of my memory.

10
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
The fox and I

11
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,560
come from the same place.

12
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,400
Or rather,

13
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,920
I am the real fox.

14
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,760
In my memory,

15
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,840
though it's blurry,

16
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,920
I still feel it was hell.

17
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,440
A group of children and I

18
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,570
struggled in a hopeless elimination system.

19
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,520
[Survival]

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,920
In punishment

21
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
and increasingly brutal training,

22
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,840
over and over again.

23
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,320
They were a criminal organization.

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,640
They forced me.

25
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,960
They forced me to kill.

26
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,240
I don't know if I actually

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,960
carried out such acts

28
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,570
to complete my missions back then.

29
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,570
I don't remember how I escaped either.

30
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,770
If it weren't for my parents

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,040
adopting me

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,860
and taking good care of me,

33
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,010
I wouldn't just be where I am today,

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,860
I might even be standing against you.

35
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,210
That's not true.

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,260
I have a feeling

37
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,900
you wouldn't kill anyone.

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,090
You have high moral standards.

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,079
Although

40
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,480
you speak eloquently

41
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,610
when analyzing criminal psychology,

42
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,360
if it were actually you,

43
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,840
you could never cross that moral line.

44
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,640
Listen,

45
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,040
stop thinking about that criminal organization.

46
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,800
You're nothing like them.

47
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,120
Whether you resent it

48
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,320
or hate it,

49
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,730
just bring it down with your own hands.

50
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,930
But my memory is still quite fuzzy now.

51
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
Sometimes I'm completely lost.

52
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,200
The point is, our enemy is hiding in the shadows,

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
while we're exposed.

54
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,800
Be careful.

55
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,920
I'll be fine.

56
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,450
It's you I'm worried about.

57
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,920
Don't get trapped

58
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,320
in those insignificant memory fragments.

59
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,610
Don't borrow anxiety from the future,

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,850
and don't let them lead you by the nose.

61
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,560
Break free.

62
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,880
For everything else,

63
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,970
let's just go with the flow.

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,530
Chief Chang.

65
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,000
I've already faxed you the case files from here.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Yes.

67
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,320
I see.

68
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,080
Although Qu Feiyu has been caught,

69
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,480
there are still some details of this case that aren't clear.

70
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,640
The Wang Sheng that Tu Guolin mentioned

71
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,960
hasn't been found yet.

72
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,210
The business card matter isn't resolved either.

73
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,720
I'm requesting to stay in Yuji with Chi Xia for a few more days.

74
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,320
Don't worry,

75
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,980
we'll definitely be careful.

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,040
Okay.

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,820
Who's that?

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,060
Who is this person?

79
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,720
Stop!

80
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,840
Stop right there!

81
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,320
Who are you?

82
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,000
Stop!

83
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,610
Why are you running?

84
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,720
Don't move! Let me go!

85
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,560
Why are you running?

86
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,880
You're not from our Wang Village either.

87
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,280
Tell us how you got in here.

88
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,680
Tired of living, are you?

89
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,920
Brother,

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
brother, you've misunderstood me.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,520
I'm here to do research.

92
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,680
Research?

93
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,880
You're talking nonsense.

94
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,610
What's there to research here?

95
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,760
It's getting dark,

96
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,440
I

97
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,640
should be heading back.

98
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,960
Like hell you are!

99
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,920
Why are you hitting me?

100
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,680
I'll hit you.

101
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,320
What's wrong with me hitting you?

102
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,200
Let me tell you.

103
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,080
If you dare come again,

104
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,680
I'll beat you every time I see you,

105
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,600
baldy.

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,130
Let's get out of here quick!

107
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,330
Get out! Go away!

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,880
Alright, go back!

109
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,920
Get lost!

110
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,560
Captain Luo.

111
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,000
I suspect Wang Sheng is hiding in Wang Village.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,680
The villagers aren't cooperating.

113
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,140
I don't dare to act rashly.

114
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:28,960
Okay.

115
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,960
Find a place first.

116
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,080
Don't alert them.

117
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,210
We'll be there soon.

118
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,360
Alright.

119
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,280
Heizi must be right.

120
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,240
This Wang Sheng

121
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,320
must be hiding somewhere in this village.

122
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,080
Juanmao has confirmed the evidence.

123
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,280
We'll arrest him on sight.

124
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,920
Okay.

125
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,880
Last night,

126
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,720
these little punks beat me up.

127
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,520
So what if we beat you?

128
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,680
We went easy on you.

129
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,520
Calm down.

130
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,600
He's not even a cop.

131
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,040
Everyone calm down.

132
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,570
Is it wrong to catch a thief?

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,800
Thief?

134
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,480
What did he steal?

135
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,880
Do you have any evidence?

136
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,980
Beating someone up for no reason.

137
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,520
All of you,

138
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,720
each and every one,

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,130
are coming back to the station with me.

140
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,840
If you don't want to go to the station,

141
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,360
then tell us everything right here.

142
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
Is Wang Sheng from your village?

143
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,120
Where are you hiding him?

144
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,560
Officer,

145
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,040
it's not a holiday or anything,

146
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,240
why would he come back to the village?

147
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,600
Did you see him yourself?

148
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,120
That's right.

149
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,520
We haven't seen him.

150
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,780
Haven't seen him, huh?

151
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,520
We'll search ourselves.

152
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,960
What are you doing?

153
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,370
What's the meaning of this?

154
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,890
What do you think you're doing?

155
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,180
You dare to get physical even though you're police?

156
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,530
You think being police makes you special?

157
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,680
I'm Chi Xia.

158
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,560
It's like this.

159
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,760
We have a suspect.

160
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,080
He's hiding in Wang Village now.

161
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,000
But the villagers aren't being cooperative.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,640
So our search is quite difficult.

163
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,120
I saw at the village entrance

164
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,360
a construction team with your company's name.

165
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,200
Then I remembered

166
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,720
you mentioned having cooperation with them.

167
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,360
Right?

168
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,680
Could you help us?

169
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,120
The project in Wang Village

170
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
is indeed contracted by my company.

171
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,160
The clan influence is very strong in that village.

172
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,960
It's not surprising they protect each other.

173
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,760
However,

174
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
you can look for the head of the Third Branch.

175
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,480
He's asked me for many favors.

176
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,400
I'll put in a word,

177
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,960
and he'll fully cooperate with your work.

178
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,680
Great,

179
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,000
thanks.

180
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,770
I'm only telling you this because of Director Qu.

181
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't tell them everything.

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,240
But you must promise me

183
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,800
never to tell anyone

184
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,920
that I was the one who told you.

185
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
Otherwise, in this village,

186
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,380
I won't be able to stay.

187
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,320
Don't worry.

188
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,039
East Village Road, Number 12.

189
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,400
That's Wang Sheng's uncle's house.

190
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
I'll have my son

191
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,919
take you there shortly.

192
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,200
Go get my son quickly.

193
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,360
Hurry up!

194
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,480
It's that house up ahead

195
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,410
where someone is washing clothes.

196
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,760
I'd better not show my face.

197
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,020
I'll wait for you here.

198
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,760
It's fine.

199
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,600
You don't need to wait here either.

200
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,480
You can go back first.

201
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,120
Thank you.

202
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,920
No problem.

203
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,520
Let's go.

204
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,160
Move.

205
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Captain Luo,

206
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,760
Wang Sheng isn't at his uncle's house.

207
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,440
He's hiding at the neighbor's house across the street.

208
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,240
What?

209
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,080
How do you know?

210
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,720
That homeowner wasn't lying,

211
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,240
but they had a backup plan.

212
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,840
His wife just quietly used their dialect

213
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,040
to tell Wang Sheng to hide at the neighbor's house across the street.

214
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,100
Someone's coming.

215
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,000
Listen to me.

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,330
I guarantee it's right.

217
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,760
Don't stay at your uncle's house.

218
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,920
Quickly find somewhere to hide.

219
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,440
Just do as I say.

220
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,120
Don't come out until I call for you.

221
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,450
But I didn't expose him.

222
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,520
I thought we could trap him inside.

223
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,520
Turn the tables on him.

224
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,280
I was wondering

225
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,920
why his son was so nervous on the way here.

226
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,780
So he was trying to keep tabs on us.

227
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,520
What are we waiting for?

228
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,400
Let's get him!

229
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,200
Don't move!

230
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,240
Police!

231
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,770
Get down!

232
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,020
Hands on your head!

233
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,260
Are you Wang Sheng?

234
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,080
Mr. Tu,

235
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,680
what's the plan?

236
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,600
Why such a hurry?

237
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,320
Wang Sheng has been arrested.

238
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,720
I need to hide in the mountains for a few days.

239
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,480
You have to come with me.

240
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,360
We leave now.

241
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,040
But

242
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,970
our car is still at the repair shop.

243
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,040
Why don't I make a call now?

244
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,970
There's no time.

245
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The police could be here any minute.

246
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,000
Let's go straight to the shop and take it.

247
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,640
Let's go.

248
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,440
Mr. Li.

249
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,720
Mr. Tu is here.

250
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
The car is fixed.

251
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,480
It's ready for you.

252
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:17,840
Take a look.

253
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,440
Good.

254
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,280
Why are there so many people today?

255
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,840
It's fine.

256
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,970
They're our people.

257
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,760
Mr. Tu.

258
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,160
I finally caught you.

259
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,760
Help me out.

260
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,760
Ten times the medical expenses.

261
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,560
Through the back door.

262
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,200
Thanks.

263
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Boys,

264
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,400
troublemakers are here.

265
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,200
Come over.

266
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Don't move!

267
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,880
Nobody move!

268
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,640
Freeze!

269
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,480
Tell me the truth

270
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,210
about Mo Laoqi and Tu Guolin's secret collusion.

271
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,160
That's good.

272
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,280
Well done.

273
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,320
You're trying to make up for your mistakes.

274
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,320
At least

275
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,610
the group's efforts

276
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,880
invested in you weren't wasted.

277
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,920
I've invited them over for a meeting.

278
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,090
I'm here to see K.

279
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,440
Please wait outside.

280
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,370
K is still handling some business.

281
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,600
Mr. Qu.

282
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,440
De.

283
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,820
Brother Seven.

284
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,520
K rarely invites us to this place.

285
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,180
Why did he suddenly ask us to come here today?

286
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,480
No idea.

287
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,340
Is it just the two of us?

288
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
Has Chi Xiao arrived?

289
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,520
Probably.

290
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,840
Recently,

291
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Chi Xiao and K have been meeting more and more frequently.

292
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,960
Their private dealings haven't stopped either.

293
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,120
I knew it.

294
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,720
She's been so secretive these past six months.

295
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,640
I get angry just hearing about her.

296
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Damn it.

297
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,760
K wouldn't make her his successor, would he?

298
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,880
All these years,

299
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,600
even if I haven't made great achievements,

300
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
I've still put in the hard work.

301
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,520
And now I end up being her errand boy.

302
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,240
Don't tell me you're still in the dark.

303
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,090
What's really going on?

304
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,170
Tell your brother everything.

305
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,320
Besides me,

306
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,600
no one will know.

307
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,760
The details...

308
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,970
I'm not sure either.

309
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,960
But a few days ago at the Yuji Hotel,

310
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,600
Chi Xiao tried to assassinate Chi Xia.

311
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,120
She wants to kill Chi Xia?

312
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,410
Isn't Chi Xia...

313
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,360
Does she dare?

314
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,520
Right under my nose,

315
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,440
she's being so arrogant,

316
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,770
without any restraint.

317
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,240
I advise you

318
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
to be careful.

319
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,680
If she dares to touch Chi Xia,

320
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,000
who knows when

321
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,840
she'll see us as obstacles too.

322
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,970
Don't you think?

323
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,360
You two got here quite early.

324
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,280
Why don't you go in?

325
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,920
Wait for me!

326
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,600
Qubai.

327
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,440
You may go in now.

328
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,080
De.

329
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,220
Go back and wait for me.

330
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,280
This is

331
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,170
trying to kill this person!

332
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,730
Just crippling one leg.

333
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,680
Qubai.

334
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,490
I was hoping you would take more care of the group.

335
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,600
But instead,

336
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,880
you're always out there taking it easy.

337
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,340
I have to deal with all these random people who sneak in myself.

338
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,700
Isn't it time you got serious?

339
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,720
This is your group.

340
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,080
I work under you.

341
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,320
So naturally I don't care about it as much as you do.

342
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You certainly know where you stand.

343
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,680
Doing business with Tu Guolin behind my back.

344
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,520
I really underestimated you,

345
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,320
Mo Laoqi.

346
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,200
After so many years in the group,

347
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,330
if you want to leave,

348
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,720
just say so.

349
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,760
Yes,

350
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,280
I was greedy.

351
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,920
You punishing me

352
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,960
is justified.

353
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,370
But you must believe me,

354
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,500
at least I would never betray you.

355
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,320
Unlike some people.

356
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,360
Loyal on the surface.

357
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,320
But behind

358
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,180
the scenes, stabbing Chi Xia in the back.

359
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,560
No denial?

360
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,580
So you admit it.

361
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,040
I...

362
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,970
I was just catching up with her.

363
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,560
The same thing.

364
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,880
I don't want to hear it again.

365
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,600
Understand?

366
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,400
Yes.

367
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,770
Everyone get up.

368
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,000
Your old friend at the police station

369
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,360
has something I need.

370
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,920
You all know

371
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,080
what to do, right?

372
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,200
Understood.

373
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,020
If there's a next time,

374
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,220
you'll get more than just a whipping.

375
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,160
You may go.

376
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,280
Mo Laoqi,

377
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,640
stay.

378
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,200
Lin Yushan, male.

379
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,000
Lin Yushan.

380
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,720
Female.

381
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
You know what to do

382
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,160
now, right?

383
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,680
Don't worry.

384
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,720
Here,

385
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,520
take a look.

386
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,800
This is evidence of you taking kickbacks

387
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,320
and transferring assets at Tu Guolin's company.

388
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,000
We've also confirmed with the workers

389
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,520
that you attempted to destroy

390
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,450
the crime scene at Bailong Resort.

391
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,920
Officer,

392
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,680
if I confess everything now,

393
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,920
would it still count as turning myself in?

394
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,720
It's too late,

395
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,720
but if you make a significant contribution,

396
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,840
you could get a reduced sentence.

397
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,640
Listen,

398
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,010
I had nothing to do with the murder.

399
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,800
Someone forced me to do it all.

400
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,640
Speak up.

401
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,440
Make it clear.

402
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,040
When Mr. Tu first asked me

403
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,240
to develop the Yuji Adventure project,

404
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,640
I did get greedy

405
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,329
and handed the project operations to Liu.

406
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,400
I made quite a profit from it.

407
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,119
But I was very discreet about it.

408
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,359
Who would have thought

409
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,359
a woman would suddenly show up at my door a few days ago.

410
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,920
She knew everything

411
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,680
and threatened me to follow her orders.

412
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,200
Then...

413
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,460
What did she look like?

414
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,520
I don't know.

415
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,130
She was wearing sunglasses and a mask.

416
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,360
But she must be pretty

417
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,360
and had a nice figure.

418
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,800
And...

419
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,400
What are you mumbling about?

420
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,080
Do you know

421
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,840
her name?

422
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,040
No.

423
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,120
Is it her?

424
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,520
I'm not sure.

425
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,210
But it looks quite similar.

426
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,620
Continue with your story.

427
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,640
Then she asked me to tell Mr. Tu

428
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,820
that someone had died at Bailong Resort.

429
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,280
She claimed the corpse was holding Mr. Tu's business card.

430
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,410
She insisted I must lure Mr. Tu to Yuji.

431
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,080
I didn't believe it at first.

432
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,760
But I couldn't just lie to Mr. Tu, right?

433
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,080
So I went to Bailong Resort to check.

434
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,160
That abandoned building,

435
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,720
the door was half open.

436
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,000
The room inside was locked from within.

437
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,080
I peeked through the small window.

438
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,840
To my surprise, there really was a dead body inside.

439
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,920
After telling Mr. Tu, I got more and more scared.

440
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,800
So I...

441
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,160
I just ran away.

442
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,280
Did this woman contact you afterward?

443
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,080
No.

444
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,680
But she lied to me too.

445
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,480
What the corpse was holding

446
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,200
wasn't Mr. Tu's business card at all.

447
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,360
It was a fox-shaped keychain.

448
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,400
Are you sure it was a fox-shaped keychain?

449
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,920
Absolutely certain.

450
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,080
It seems now

451
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,120
that Fox's plot in Yuji

452
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,080
was meant to kill two birds with one stone.

453
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,640
The criminal organization behind Chi Xiao

454
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,170
must be quite substantial.

455
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,280
This afternoon I saw Old Mo Seven go to Bailong Resort.

456
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,680
He said he installed a homemade bomb in the room.
