00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,980
Director Chang

3
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,400
Please look at these two blackboards.

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,640
This row of numbers at the top

5
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,920
was left by Comrade Zhang Jinguo

6
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,600
in the opera text.

7
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,880
It shows the mapping rules

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,680
between numbers and letters

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,080
which is part of the encryption code.

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,960
And this row below

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,360
is the array that appeared

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,920
in Chi Xia's memory.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,680
Based on our analysis,

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,280
we can draw a conclusion.

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,920
Comrade Zhang Jinguo and Comrade Fu Gang

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,480
used 26 numbers

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,960
to correspond with 26

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,880
scrambled letters.

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,120
In other words,

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,120
if we can find

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,250
the exact correlation between the numbers and letters,

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,120
we can decode the message

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,060
that Comrade Fu Gang left behind.

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,240
This is easy to understand.

25
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,320
They hid the encryption rules

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,320
in the opera script.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,440
But for the remaining 23 numbers,

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,840
how did you figure out

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,320
which letters they correspond to?

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,039
Director Chang,

31
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,770
look at this.

32
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,800
The entire script is clean.

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,600
However,

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,200
only these three letters

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,080
are separately marked.

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,160
Because these three letters

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,600
cannot exist as

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
initial pinyin letters in Chinese.

39
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,360
And in the entire text,

40
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,520
there are only Chinese characters,

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,680
no letters at all.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,040
So conversely,

43
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
this precisely indicates

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,199
that from 1 to 23,

45
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,000
these 23 numbers

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
each correspond to specific letters.

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,520
23 Chinese characters with different initials YNO

48
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,250
23 Chinese characters with different initials.

49
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,040
Using numbers to derive Chinese characters

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,400
can be done in countless ways.

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,200
However,

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,600
if we only use

53
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,840
single digits up to 23,

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,060
to correspond with characters of different initials,

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,320
then there are limited possibilities.

56
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,120
From a logical perspective,

57
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,680
if it's a completely random encryption rule,

58
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
then both of them

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,040
would need to memorize

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
all 23 numbers.

61
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,360
This would be very risky.

62
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,720
So I believe

63
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,880
that within this opera text,

64
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,720
there must be a simple

65
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,640
and efficient encryption rule,

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,640
allowing both people to quickly

67
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,760
and accurately

68
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,320
encrypt and decrypt information.

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,400
Therefore, in conclusion,

70
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,560
I've listed all the lyrics in order,

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
writing down their initials

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,600
and first letters as well.

73
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,920
But pay attention here.

74
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Kill the traitor.

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,480
For characters that are repeated,

76
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,800
we'll hide them.

77
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,840
For example, 'zan' is Z.

78
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,040
This is also Z.

79
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,760
So we don't need it.

80
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,560
'Na' is N.

81
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,120
[Jiao Zan (Moth brand, body

82
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
This is also N.

83
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,940
So we don't need it either.

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,280
From 1 to 23.

85
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,560
We will write out these 23 numbers

86
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,760
using the letters

87
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,930
that have appeared.

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,400
This is 6.

89
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,480
This is 7.

90
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,200
We'll write out

91
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,880
all these numbers in sequence.

92
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,280
We can draw a conclusion.

93
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,540
[Zhuxianxian Moth Brand]

94
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,960
Comrade Zhang Jinguo emphasized this.

95
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,440
It's 1.

96
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,960

99
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,320
Let's write it again.

100
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
So finally,

101
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,000
we've reached an

102
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,700
accurate conclusion.

103
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,089
Director Chang,

104
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,260
please give us instructions.

105
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,080
Luo Xun.

106
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,320
I didn't expect you

107
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,440
to be so good at cracking patterns.

108
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,450
Verify it immediately.

109
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,560
If we follow this lead

110
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,880
and find evidence,

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,800
then we

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,080
will truly gain the upper hand.

113
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Okay.

114
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,680
It matches.

115
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,480
Captain Luo,

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
take a look at this.

117
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,840
Jue.

118
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,880
Considering Fu Gang's

119
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,360
limited freedom of movement,

120
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,720
his hiding place shouldn't be far from

121
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,920
Lawa Village.

122
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,680
So we can only search

123
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,920
in Mengkunbang near Lawa Village,

124
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,640
Dongzhou City bordering Mengkunbang,

125
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,560
and Yuhe City.

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
The possible location

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
these eight letters.

128
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,400
Divided by initials and finals,

129
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,000
they represent at most four Chinese characters.

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,800
I tried searching for four-character locations

131
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,280
but found none that matched.

132
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,560
Then I tried three characters,

133
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,480
still nothing.

134
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,560
Finally, I tried two characters

135
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
and found 16 possibilities.

136
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,200
But

137
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,640
locations that have existed for over 15 years.

138
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,320
Look,

139
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,720
first page, fourth line,

140
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,440
Jile.

141
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,680
There's a cemetery in our Dongzhou City

142
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,940
called Jile Cemetery.

143
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
As for this LIZE,

144
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,800
I think it could be someone's name,

145
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,130
likely with surname Li.

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,560
And this ZE at the end,

147
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,280
which tone it is exactly,

148
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,920
we need to go to the cemetery to investigate.

149
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,520
The item might be hidden in this person's grave,

150
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,360
or even in their urn.

151
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,960
How's it going, Cui?

152
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,800
It's not possible.

153
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,060
We can't force it open.

154
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,920
It has a self-destruct program inside.

155
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,400
If we try to force it open,

156
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,320
it will destroy all the criminal evidence inside.

157
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,720
I believe the original intention of its design

158
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,120
was that even if a suspect

159
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,480
gets hold of this urn,

160
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,800
without the password,

161
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
forcing it open

162
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,730
would still destroy all the formulas inside.

163
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,159
But the problem is,

164
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,120
according to Chi Xia's feedback,

165
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,840
Old K is extremely confident that

166
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,600
as long as he can find the location,

167
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,040
he can get what's inside.

168
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,650
He must already know the password.

169
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,120
Can you make a device?

170
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,159
What kind of device?

171
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:57,920
One that looks exactly like

172
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,360
this urn,

173
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,520
a perfect one-to-one replica.

174
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,280
But whenever someone enters the password,

175
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,540
we can simultaneously obtain that password information.

176
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,920
It should be possible.

177
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,600
However,

178
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
I'll need some time.

179
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,720
Good.

180
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,360
Thanks for your hard work,

181
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,620
but we need it quickly.

183
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,960
You can contact Chi Xia now.

184
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,040
Tell her

185
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,880
we've already applied technical processing to the urn

186
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,440
and will set up surveillance here.

187
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,200
She can now use the data array to exchange for Fu Gang.

188
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

189
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,200
Make sure Fu Gang returns to the country safely.

190
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,120
Tell her

191
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,740
to be careful herself too.

192
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,360
Okay.

193
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,480
Captain Luo,

194
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,200
it's me.

195
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,640
Old K is coming back tomorrow.

196
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,160
The operation time is 6 PM.

197
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,040
He's using a fake address

198
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,700
to test if I've really turned.

199
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,000
So send your people to the Lizang Museum

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
to put on a show for him.

201
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,200
Make him believe that Jile Cemetery

202
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,760
hasn't been discovered by the police

203
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,000
and think it's still safe.

204
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,720
No.

205
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,880
You'll definitely be exposed this way.

206
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,520
Have you considered your own situation?

207
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,720
Luo Xun, listen to me.

208
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
I won't be with Old K tomorrow.

209
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,539
He gave me another assignment

210
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,080
also at 6 PM.

211
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,400
He wants me to follow people from the Kete Group

212
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,260
to the Lilong Hotel at the border.

213
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,050
Negotiating with a pharmacist

214
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,720
who can't deliver the goods by the 8th of next month.

215
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,160
He's also in a dead-end situation.

216
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,080
He wouldn't dare offend the Special Division at this point.

217
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,040
So when we arrest him

218
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,500
at the Paradise Cemetery,

219
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,960
you won't need to worry

220
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,360
about my presence there.

221
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,120
Just set up the operation with confidence.

222
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,180
I know what you're worried about.

223
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
At the hotel,

224
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,200
Old K has no way to control the people from the Kote Group.

225
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,530
So don't worry about me.

226
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,480
Chi Xia.

227
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,680
Tomorrow you'll be facing

228
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,520
a group of desperate criminals with nothing to lose.

229
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,320
Rest assured,

230
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,240
I'll definitely set up an operation at the Lilong Hotel to support you.

231
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,320
Don't try to be a hero.

232
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
You must stay safe.

233
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,280
If we lose the Kote people,

234
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,520
I can catch them again.

235
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,240
But tomorrow I need you to come home safely.

236
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,120
Do you hear me?

237
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,400
I understand.

238
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,320
This operation

239
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,360
is highly prioritized by the provincial department.

240
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,490
The criminal organization led by Old K

241
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,800
has been entrenched in Dongzhou for years.

242
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,060
Their power is immense

243
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,640
and their reach is extensive,

244
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,040
neither can be underestimated.

245
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,000
Now they've even entered the drug market,

246
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,440
posing a severe threat

247
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,480
to people's lives and property.

248
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,280
Therefore,

249
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,120
this operation must succeed in one strike,

250
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,200
and we cannot let him retreat back to Lawa Village.

251
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,880
Understood.

252
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,100
Please rest assured, Director Qiao.

253
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,120
Good.

254
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,800
Now for the assignments.

255
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,560
Cui,

256
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,840
lead the security team

257
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,300
to set up surveillance at the Lizang Museum.

258
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Don't be too discreet.

259
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,640
Make sure you're noticed.

260
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,370
Understood.

261
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,600
Lin Wenjue,

262
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,680
take your team to the Lilong Hotel

263
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
to support Chi Xia.

264
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,480
Take more people with you.

265
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,210
Understood.

266
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,560
Luo Xun,

267
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,850
the arrest at Jile Cemetery

268
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,560
will be entirely your responsibility.

269
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,720
I'll make sure the mission is accomplished.

270
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,520
Comrades,

271
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,720
The foreign criminal organization from Lawa Village

272
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,640
has already infiltrated Dongzhou.

273
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,680
The organization's leader, Huang Weisheng,

274
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,240
will stop at nothing

275
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,800
to achieve his goals.

276
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,360
In the past six months,

277
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,960
several serial killings

278
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,400
have terrified the people of Dongzhou.

279
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,480
And now,

280
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Huang Weisheng has set foot on Dongzhou soil.

281
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,160
In this operation,

282
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,720
we must catch him red-handed.

283
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,040
It's time to free our people

284
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,200
from their fear.

285
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,440
We must let them

286
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,240
live in a land protected by law.

287
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,760
Our country

288
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,000
will not tolerate

289
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,560
infiltration by foreign criminal organizations.

290
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,490
For our country,

291
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,640
for our people,

292
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,180
and for the honor of the police force,

293
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,680
we must eliminate this cancer

294
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,690
and root it out completely.

295
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,160
Understood?

296
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,040
Understood.

297
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,200
Luo Xun.

298
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,840
Yes, sir.

299
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,320
For this operation,

300
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,680
you'll be in full command.

301
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,440
Yes, sir.

302
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,000
Let's go.

303
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,760
Yes.

304
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,680
Captain Luo,

305
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,120
it's been 15 minutes past the agreed time.

306
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,200
There's no sign of Chi Xia,

307
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,330
and no pharmacist has shown up either.

308
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,490
I made a mistake.

309
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,760
The Lilong Hotel was just a front.

310
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,840
Chi Xia must be with Old K now.

311
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Jue,

312
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,400
get everyone out of there now.

313
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,720
Understood.

314
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,400
Got it.

315
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,840
Everyone,

316
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,640
fall back now!

317
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,280
Mobile unit,

318
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,480
stand by.

319
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,520
Copy that.

320
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,040
Qu Bai's car.

321
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,440
Chi Xia

322
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,000
All units,

323
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,970
await my orders.

324
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,080
Be ready to surround and arrest the target.

325
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,760
Team One, copy.

326
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,620
Team Two, copy.

327
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,320
Mountain road interception team in position.

328
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,160
Block all roads

329
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,640
and stop all passing vehicles.

330
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,240
Copy that.

331
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,040
The urn is here.

332
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,060
Secure the password lock.

333
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,800
Got it.

334
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,080
Done.

335
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,840
Collect evidence.

336
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,480
Got it.

337
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,760
Captain Luo.

338
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,440
Okay.

339
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,040
Everyone,

340
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,240
move in and surround.

341
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,210
Team two, take the left.

342
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,460
Assault team, move in.

343
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,720
Rear team is in position.

344
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,040
Team one, leapfrog forward.

345
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,860
Don't move.

346
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,720
Freeze!

347
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,200
Police!

348
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,800
Don't move!

349
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,520
Police!

350
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,420
Freeze!

351
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,160
Drop your weapons.

352
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Put all guns down.

353
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,040
Nobody move.

354
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
This is a pressure-triggered bomb.

355
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,840
If it drops to the ground even slightly,

356
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,680
the bomb on Chi Xia

357
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,000
will detonate immediately.

358
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,400
The bomb isn't powerful,

359
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,930
but it's enough to kill her.

360
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
Remove the blockade.

361
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,200
Or Chi Xia

362
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,840
dies with us.

363
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,960
Captain Luo,

364
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,280
don't worry about me.

365
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,020
Arrest them first.

366
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,800
Everyone,

367
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,520
fall back.

368
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,760
Find a clear shot.

369
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,880
Copy that.

370
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,480
Back off!

371
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,160
Step back!

372
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,440
There's a dragnet outside.

373
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,960
Even if you fight like a cornered beast,

374
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,760
you can't escape justice.

375
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,320
In my life,

376
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,420
I've seen too many smart-aleck kids.

377
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,080
When the tide washes away the sand,

378
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,520
only I remain standing.

379
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,600
Chi Xia,

380
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,440
do you dare to die with me?

381
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I understand now.

382
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,200
Old K is holding Chi Xia hostage

383
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,560
so he can escape

384
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,720
while forcing us to hand over the formula.

385
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,780
There's no time to find a bomb expert.

386
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,800
Everyone,

387
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,810
stay in position

388
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,180
and be ready to surround and capture him.

389
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,119
Captain Luo.

390
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,250
It's not your fault.

391
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,520
Captain Luo.

392
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

393
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,680
Let's begin.

394
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,599
Tell me the chemical formula

395
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,690
in exchange for Chi Xia's life.

396
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,490
Don't say I didn't warn you.

397
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,320
If you try to defuse the bomb,

398
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,410
you'll be collecting a corpse.

399
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,640
Chi Xia.

400
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,800
This is the chemical formula.

401
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Memorize it quickly.

402
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,000
I trust your memory.

403
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,820
I've memorized it.

404
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,440
K.

405
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,060
Listen carefully.

406
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,800
Chi Xia is the only one who knows this formula now.

407
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,200
If she dies today,

408
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,640
even if you escape the police,

409
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,450
on the 8th of next month,

410
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,520
you'll die even more miserably.

411
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,320
You're asking for death.

412
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,120
I'll count to ten.

413
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,480
If you don't hand over the formula within ten seconds,

414
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,140
both of you will die together.

415
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,520
Luo Xun,

416
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
stay away from me.

417
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,960
Go away.

418
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,560
Nine.

419
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,240
Seven.

420
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,720
You're such an idiot.

421
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,720
Five.

422
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,360
It's already dark now.

423
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,680
Old K is hiding in the dense forest.

424
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,800
If something goes wrong,

425
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,520
we'll be letting the tiger back to the mountain.

426
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,760
He must have a backup plan.

427
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,220
I might as well be the bait.

428
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,660
Playing double agent.

429
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,260
You're not clever enough.

430
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,840
I have ten thousand ways

431
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
to make you talk.
