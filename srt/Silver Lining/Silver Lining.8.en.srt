1
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya

2
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,880
Based on the victim's condition,

3
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,280
we can basically confirm

4
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,460
she was in a hypnotic state when she committed suicide.

5
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,120
Although her consciousness was blurred,

6
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,400
her focus was highly concentrated.

7
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,320
Her suicide was performed with intense focus,

8
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,120
unaffected by external forces.

9
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,080
Furthermore, the autopsy shows

10
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,539
she hadn't taken any hallucinogenic drugs.

11
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,220
This indicates the killer relied solely on hypnosis to commit the crime.

12
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,680
How could the hypnotist ensure

13
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,160
the victim would definitely commit suicide?

14
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,400
Mental anchoring. People under hypnosis

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,530
are highly responsive to the hypnotist's suggestions.

16
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,160
If there's a significant level of trust

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,289
between the hypnotist and the victim,

18
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,080
During long-term hypnosis, a hypnotist can

19
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,120
plant mental anchors,

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,180
which can guide the deceased to take specific actions.

21
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,840
What was Liang Ruqing's mental anchor?

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,280
That's difficult to determine right now.

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,120
These past few days,

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,160
I've been watching the surveillance footage of Liang Ruqing's suicide.

25
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,400
These images keep replaying in my mind.

26
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,480
I'm wondering if we were in a hypnotic state,

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,960
could we possibly find some clues?

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,560
Hypnosis cannot allow you to enter

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,680
the memory scenes of the person involved.

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,280
Nor can it help you recreate the situation at that time.

31
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,079
At most, it can only put you into a deep sleep.

32
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,640
If you have too many images in your mind,

33
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,760
you might during the hypnosis process

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,960
mistakenly identify yourself as the person involved.

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,160
Also, mental anchors cannot be planted in a short period.

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,600
However, if you want to experience psychological suggestion

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
and find some inspiration from it,

38
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,079
that's certainly possible.

39
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,960
I just can't guarantee

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,160
that you'll definitely find any clues.

41
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,079
I actually want to...

42
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,920
Let me do it.

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,440
This kind of thing isn't appropriate

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,600
for a young girl like you.

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,920
Alright, get ready,

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,250
we'll start right away.

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,040
Captain Luo, look at the spinning top.

48
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Close your eyes.

49
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,080
Relax.

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,160
Imagine you're in the most familiar environment.

51
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,760
You see someone you trust completely.

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,420
You feel incredibly relaxed.

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Completely comfortable and at ease.

54
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,440
Until I say 'Captain Luo, action,'

55
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,920
you will wake up.

56
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,920
Luo Xun.

57
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,520
Luo Xun.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,000
Mr. Ning wants to see you.

59
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,640
Sis.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,800
Sis.

61
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,840
Sis.

62
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,200
Relax. When I wake you up,

63
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,840
you'll call the person you trust the most.

64
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,760
Luo Xun.

65
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,480
Luo Xun.

66
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,200
I'm your sister.

67
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,560
Luo Xun.

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,760
Luo Xun.

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,159
Sis.

70
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,400
Luo Xun.

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,520
Luo Xun.

72
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,159
Sis.

73
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,680
Sis.

74
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,000
Sis.

75
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,160
Captain Luo, proceed.

76
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,760
Your guard is too high.

77
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,160
Plus you've always been skeptical about hypnosis.

78
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,040
So even with enough trust,

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,840
it's hard for you to be psychologically influenced.

80
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,160
Let me try.

81
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,200
I studied criminal psychology.

82
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,560
I have some basic knowledge of hypnosis.

83
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Maybe we can build better trust.

84
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,320
It's just hypnosis.

85
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,140
Not suggesting suicide or anything.

86
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,159
Just give it a try.

87
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,800
Okay. If there's any problem,

88
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,020
stop immediately.

89
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,360
Come, Chi Xia.

90
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,160
Let's look at this spinning top.

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,090
Close your eyes.

92
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,800
Relax and focus on my voice.

93
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,000
Imagine you're entering a warm world.

94
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,600
When you hear me say 'wake up'...

95
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,490
You'll wake up and drink water.

96
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,800
Wake up.

97
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,700
Is there any water?

98
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,960
It worked.

99
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,200
What worked?

100
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,280
Waking up to drink water

101
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,360
was the psychological suggestion I just gave you.

102
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,160
But your nerves are too tense,

103
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,360
and your self-awareness is too strong in the hypnotic state.

104
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,280
So I had to wake you up early.

105
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,100
We'll have to take it slow.

106
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,400
Chi Xia.

107
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,559
A man named Qu Bai was just looking for you.

108
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,419
He says he has information about Sun Xiangbo for us.

109
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,200
I've asked him to wait in the meeting room.

110
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
That was quick.

111
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,680
Who did you find?

112
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,160
Is he reliable?

113
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,050
Don't you have any discipline?

114
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,240
Go back. No need to see me off.

115
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,160
You came all this way.

116
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,690
Why shouldn't I see you off?

117
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,280
Not many people get along with me.

118
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,160
You're one of them.

119
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,360
Thanks for this time.

120
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Don't mention it.

121
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,800
I'll be going now.

122
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,080
You can go. I won't take up any more of your time.

123
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,320
Oh, and keep more of those candies in your store.

124
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,120
I love them.

125
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,040
Okay.

126
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Drive carefully.

127
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,560
Sure.

128
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,240
Bye.

129
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,720
What lead?

130
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,920
I had a friend investigate secretly.

131
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,380
Sun Xiangbo's Hongtai Biological Company.

132
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,440
Some supply orders and delivery receipts we didn't have access to.

133
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,160
And he's been manipulating prices on contracts.

134
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,290
This pattern looks like wash trading.

135
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,200
The money only circulates domestically.

136
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
While assets flow overseas.

137
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,320
Good. Let's focus on investigating.

138
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,160
The supply sources of Hongtai's partner companies.

139
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,640
If we can find issues there,

140
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,840
we'll establish Sun Xiangbo's motive.

141
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,280
You said Chi Xia's case is related to hypnosis.

142
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,900
Sir, it's just a speculation for now.

143
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,520
The victim stabbed himself 12 times

144
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,880
and then fell to his death.

145
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,200
Twelve.

146
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,800
It feels so familiar.

147
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,960
Sun Xiangbo's business partner

148
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,560
has confessed that they falsified contracts.

149
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,320
Cao Bin and I also secretly investigated

150
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,450
Hongtai Biotech's source companies.

151
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,800
They're all small workshops

152
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,000
with supply volumes far below their production scale.

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,200
I asked Captain Luo to help me contact the provincial office

154
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,320
to verify Nie Qianyu's brother abroad.

155
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,440
Indeed helped Sun Xiangbo transfer his assets.

156
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,500
So that's how it is.

157
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,200
It's been confirmed now.

158
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,280
Sun Xiangbo's company definitely has financial issues.

159
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,800
Although we can't yet prove he hypnotized and killed his wife,

160
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,060
I believe arresting this man is definitely the right move.

161
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,380
Let's confront him directly.

162
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,200
Cao Bin, Curly,

163
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,520
you two take some officers and find him.

164
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,000
Got it.

165
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,940
Go ahead. Meeting adjourned.

166
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,200
Oh, right.

167
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,200
I brought breakfast for you two.

168
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,130
Eat it on the way.

169
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,520
Without Brother Jue, who would treat us like humans?

170
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,800
Brother Jue.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,640
Alright, alright.

172
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,840
Thanks, Brother Jue.

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,600
Thank you.

174
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,770
Let's go.

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,800
Chi Xia.

176
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,440
The case has progressed to this point

177
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,800
thanks to your invaluable contribution.

178
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Good work.

179
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,440
Why so formal?

180
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,880
But next time if something like this happens again,

181
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,640
you need to discuss it with everyone.

182
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,400
What if the person you find isn't trustworthy

183
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,960
and tips off Sun Xiangbo?

184
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,960
Don't let this happen again.

185
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,180
Nobody's here.

186
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,450
No one's around.

187
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,840
Hello. We're police officers.

188
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
We'd like to ask you some questions.

189
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,360
Okay.

190
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,570
Please go ahead.

191
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,000
Since we have no feelings left,

192
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,530
why won't you just let me go?

193
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,600
Sun Xiangbo, do you have any conscience left?

194
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,200
Ruqing.

195
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,000
I've really changed,

196
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,800
believe me.

197
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
We still have feelings for each other,

198
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,520
even if there's no romantic love,

199
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,720
we still have family bonds,

200
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,920
we still have Linlin.

201
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,580
Linlin is still young,

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
she needs a complete family.

203
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Stop pretending.

204
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,360
Linlin doesn't need a father like you.

205
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,020
I can raise her well by myself,

206
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
all I ask now is for you to set me free.

207
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,330
I can't live like this for another day.

208
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,840
Ruqing.

209
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,720
I know,

210
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,880
I know you've been having trouble at work lately.

211
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,000
That's why you're so emotionally unstable,

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,800
and your family has been asking for money again.

213
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,680
I can help.

214
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,440
I'm not childish enough

215
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,320
to mix up work and personal life.

216
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,040
My emotional breakdown is all because of you.

217
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,200
Only because of you.

218
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,620
Go find your mistress,

219
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,280
I'll live freely with Linlin,

220
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,340
isn't that better?

221
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,600
Haven't you made any mistakes all these years?

222
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,600
Your temper,

223
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,560
your personality,

224
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,360
do you know how suffocating you've made this home?

225
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,730
Do you think Linlin even likes you as a mother?

226
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,620
She's just too sensible to say anything.

227
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
You always

228
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,000
bring the pain from your original family to everyone else.

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,880
Your students,

230
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,200
your colleagues can't stand you.

231
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,720
Don't you understand?

232
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,840
Don't you get it?

233
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,520
No one will catch you time after time.

234
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,880
Ruqing.

235
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,360
Ruqing.

236
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,560
But I can,

237
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,400
I'm the one willing to always catch you.

238
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Ruqing.

239
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,680
I was just confused for a moment.

240
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,200
I know I was wrong.

241
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,290
Can we not get divorced?

242
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,040
Please don't divorce me.

243
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,320
You might as well have let me fall.

244
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,040
And become a pile of mush.

245
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,840
That guy got away.

246
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,080
Captain Luo.

247
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,700
Don't move.

248
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,970
Why are you running?

249
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,720
I knew something was wrong.

250
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,920
Where is Sun Xiangbo?

251
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,080
Tell me the truth.

252
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,680
I don't know.

253
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,340
I really don't know anything.

254
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,860
I'm Chi Xia.

255
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,520
That bastard Sun Xiangbo turned himself in.

256
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,000
What?

257
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,720
That's all.

258
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,440
I follow the law in everything else.

259
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,400
Let me remind you.

260
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,960
While you were transferring marital assets during your marriage,

261
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,720
Liang Ruqing discovered financial issues in the company.

262
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,180
So you subjected her to long-term hypnosis.

263
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,960
After she fell to her death,

264
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,800
you put on a show of deep affection.

265
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,240
But secretly, you sneakily disposed of her personal belongings.

266
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,760
You misled the police with a suicide narrative.

267
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,760
You attempted to cover up the truth.

268
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,560
You destroyed the evidence she had gathered.

269
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,240
No,

270
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,320
what hypnosis?

271
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,440
What hypnosis are you talking about?

272
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,640
You planted an anchor in her mind,

273
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,960
creating the illusion that she committed suicide.

274
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,840
You've got it all wrong.

275
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,520
Yes,

276
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,160
I did find her a therapist.

277
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
But that was just to keep her calm.

278
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,800
She only saw that therapist once.

279
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,520
Besides, I'm not stupid.

280
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,080
Money laundering only gets you a few years,

281
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,810
but murder costs you your head.

282
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,440
If I really killed someone,

283
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,220
would I dare to turn myself in?

284
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,890
Feel free to investigate that therapist.

285
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,500
He can prove my innocence.

286
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,380
If that's the case,

287
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
why did you mislead the police?

288
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,660
Liang Ruqing committed suicide.

289
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,640
I was afraid her death

290
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,800
was really triggered by me.

291
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,720
So I hoped you would close the case quickly

292
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,560
without digging up my money laundering activities.

293
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,260
I originally planned to go abroad to lay low.

294
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,760
But

295
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,839
I just couldn't leave Qianyu and the child behind.

296
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,020
So you're saying you turned yourself in for their sake?

297
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,160
Officers,

298
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,220
I'm telling you the truth.

299
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,760
Qianyu is about to give birth.

300
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,040
I can't drag her down with me.

301
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,970
If nothing else,

302
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,240
for her and the child,

303
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,599
I want to reform myself

304
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,730
and start a new life.

305
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,740
What about her?

306
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,400
Isn't she your child too?

307
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,000
How did you treat her?

308
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,120
Cold. Neglectful.

309
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,960
Hypocritical and heartless to your first wife.

310
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,560
You abandoned your wife and child, and now you're pretending to be a model husband?

311
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,000
This is Liang Ruqing's autopsy report.

312
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,480
Look.

313
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,280
It's been so many days

314
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,720
and you haven't even asked once about it at the station.

315
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,800
She was your wife for over 20 years.

316
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,960
You're not heartbroken,

317
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
not even sad.

318
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,530
You're using all your energy to escape the law

319
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,020
and transfer your assets.

320
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,040
What kind of man are you?

321
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,240
But

322
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,400
I love Qianyu.

323
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,200
Liang Ruqing is pitiful.

324
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,040
But after all these years together,

325
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,970
we only have resentment and disgust left between us.

326
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
Linlin is a girl.

327
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,840
She'll get married sooner or later.

328
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,170
She can't inherit the business I've worked so hard to build.

329
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,040
Officer, I've explained everything clearly.

330
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,280
I believe

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,600
the law will give me justice.

332
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,570
Sun Xiangbo.

333
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Watch your words.

334
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,840
Someone like you doesn't deserve to have a family.

335
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,220
You don't deserve to be loved.

336
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,400
You should be all alone,

337
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,690
living as a beast in human clothing for the rest of your life.

338
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,320
I should undergo a targeted hypnosis session

339
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,520
to see if there's anything in my mind

340
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,650
that could provide more useful clues.

341
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,680
So behind all this,

342
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,320
there must be clues we haven't discovered yet.
