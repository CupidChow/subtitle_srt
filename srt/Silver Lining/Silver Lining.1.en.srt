1
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya.

2
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,480
Mom.

3
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,240
Dad.

4
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,600
Let me out.

5
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,960
Accept your inner self.

6
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,320
You're a born criminal.

7
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,840
I'm not.

8
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:21,960
I'm not.

9
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,920
Help me.

10
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,800
Captain Luo, down there.

11
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,120
It's a clay sculpture this time.

12
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,520
A clay sculpture covering from head to toe.

13
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,600
Stop looking.

14
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,200
I've already taken one down.

15
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
It's Liuli again.

16
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,520
Initial assessment indicates the victim is a young female.

17
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,200
Likely similar to the previous two cases.

18
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,840
But the crime scene has been severely compromised.

19
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,000
As for the exact cause of death,

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,880
I'll need to take the body back.

21
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,120
I can only give you answers after the autopsy.

22
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,600
This is the third case in a month.

23
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,240
The first two were a doll and a mummy.

24
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,480
And now we have this clay figure.

25
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,120
And it was pouring rain last night.

26
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,520
This killer must be a complete psychopath.

27
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,120
Never mind being a psychopath.

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,780
Even if the sky falls, we still have to catch him.

29
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,800
This guy is pretty cunning.

30
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,280
Deliberately chose a rainy day to dump the body.

31
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,410
All the evidence has been washed away.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,130
The killer has a unique artistic aesthetic for corpses.

33
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,840
He probably sees the victims

34
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
as masterpieces worth showing off.

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,520
I actually think

36
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,680
sometimes you should

37
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,920
think outside the police mindset.

38
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
What are you standing there for?

39
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,980
Clear the area.

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,480
Send all non-essential personnel home.

41
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,800
Move the police line back.

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,060
Move along, everyone.

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Police investigation in progress.

44
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,080
Another public place.

45
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,120
Glass eyes.

46
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
Who is this meant for?

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,460
[Public Security POLICE]

48
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,820
[Homicide]

49
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,920
The person who reported this is quite elderly.

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,120
They were terrified.

51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,970
What are you doing here?

52
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,600
Everyone's back.

53
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,120
Chief Chang.

54
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Let me introduce.

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,440
Chi Xia.

56
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,600
Top graduate from Yuhe Police Academy.

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,920
Criminal psychology expert.

58
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,440
Transferred from the provincial department.

59
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,720
Here to work with us.

60
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,640
Criminal psychology is a new field in our criminal investigation work.

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,440
The provincial department is promoting it at the grassroots level.

62
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,880
So learning and applying this new discipline

63
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,240
is both a political necessity

64
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,640
and a professional requirement.

65
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,480
I hope everyone will learn from each other,

66
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,440
trust one another,

67
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,570
and take our criminal investigation work to a new level.

68
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,840
Luo Xun, Major Crimes Unit Captain.

69
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,840
Lin Wenjue,

70
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,400
interrogation expert.

71
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,240
Hello.

72
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,080
Hello.

73
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,520
Yu Lei,

74
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,360
everyone calls him Curly,

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
computer expert.

76
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
Cao Bin,

77
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,940
combat expert.

78
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,320
Chief Chang,

79
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,760
why are you throwing another young girl into the fire pit?

80
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,840
Look at her delicate skin,

81
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,900
thin arms and legs.

82
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,120
Can she withstand the brutality of the Major Crimes Unit?

83
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,080
Luo Xun,

84
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,640
as criminal investigators,

85
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,970
stereotypes are absolutely not allowed.

86
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,320
Whether she's capable or not,

87
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,520
we'll see on the case.

88
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,800
Instead of wasting time, hurry up and study the case.

89
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,920
It's already the third incident.

90
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,640
The provincial department has been blowing up my phone.

91
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,960
- Let's go to the meeting.
- Come over here.

92
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,820
Come over here.

93
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,200
Hold my cup.

94
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,240
October 16th.

95
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,700
We received a case report.

96
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,340
The victim, Zhang Wen,

97
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,680
25 years old,

98
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,610
a bank employee.

99
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,640
Her husband, Zhao Ziqiang, due to frequent business trips,

100
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
the couple was

101
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,300
living apart from each other.

102
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,480
After Zhang Wen's death,

103
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,360
she was turned into an exquisite doll by the killer.

104
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,960
Abandoned at the entrance of a clothing store.

105
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,640
Call the police! Let's go!

106
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,600
November 5th.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
We received the second case report.

108
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,040
This case was reported

109
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,240
20 days after the first one.

110
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,560
Victim: Lin Wei, female,

111
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,120
25 years old, teacher.

112
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,640
Also a single woman who lived alone for a long time.

113
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,240
After being killed, she was mummified by the murderer

114
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,700
and dumped in a reservoir.

115
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,570
What is that?

116
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,320
Is it a body?

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,040
Call the police! Let's go!

118
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,360
November 15th,

119
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,400
which is today.

120
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,880
We received the third case report:

121
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
a body dumped in the park square.

122
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,800
This case was reported

123
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,659
just 10 days after the second one.

124
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,380
The victim is also female.

125
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,720
She was turned into a clay sculpture.

126
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,920
Both eyes of the victim were removed,

127
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,160
replaced with spherical

128
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,640
or rhombus-shaped objects of similar size and color.

129
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,280
All made of colored glass.

130
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,120
Judging from the incisions around the eyes,

131
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,780
the killer's technique is skilled and precise.

132
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,360
Looking at the timing of the crimes,

133
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,840
if it's the same person

134
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,600
or the same group,

135
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,600
committing three crimes in a single month

136
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,050
it's extremely brazen.

137
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,960
Through surveillance footage, we discovered

138
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,160
that the first two victims had one thing in common:

139
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,039
they both visited the Huixin Shopping Center.

140
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,679
We've interviewed many shop owners,

141
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,809
but no one indicated

142
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,840
having any recollection of the two victims.

143
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,700
Additionally,

144
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,159
in both victims' homes,

145
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,800
we found paintings signed by someone called 'Mr. D'.

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,160
There might be some connection.

147
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,640
The biggest challenge we're facing now is that

148
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,120
due to the clay sculpture causing disfigurement,

149
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
we cannot quickly

150
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,560
identify the third victim,

151
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,960
which means we temporarily can't find

152
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,220
any connection to the first two victims.

153
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,320
Chi Xia.

154
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,930
What are your thoughts?

155
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,280
Jue.

156
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,200
Thanks.

157
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,840
The body is relatively intact,

158
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,160
with no visible impact injuries on the surface.

159
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,420
This proves that when handling the body,

160
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,280
the killer has considerable strength and physical ability.

161
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,440
The victim's hair,

162
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,640
nails and other details have been carefully processed,

163
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
proving the killer is quite appearance-conscious

164
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,600
and has some obsessive tendencies.

165
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,640
The body has a unique artistic quality,

166
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,960
suggesting the killer may have received formal aesthetic education.

167
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,920
The traditional glass inlaid in the victim's eyes

168
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,920
indicates the killer has significant financial resources.

169
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
Based on all this,

170
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,320
I believe we can preliminarily determine

171
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,440
that the killer is a young to middle-aged male.

172
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,900
Outstanding appearance.

173
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,080
Has certain cleanliness issues or OCD.

174
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,800
Comes from a well-off family,

175
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,920
received higher education,

176
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,200
even studied abroad,

177
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,880
and has a flexible lifestyle.

178
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
With relatively unrestricted movement patterns.

179
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,640
I just took a look

180
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,000
at Mr. D's paintings in the first two victims' homes.

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,320
I don't think it's a coincidence.

182
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,640
The third victim's home

183
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,080
might also have similar items

184
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,120
or items with the same significance.

185
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,720
I think everyone should pay attention to this.

186
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,280
Does anyone have any questions?

187
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,360
If not,

188
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,320
I'll ask one.

189
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,880
Luoxun.

190
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,360
How many days to solve this case?

191
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,130
Whatever you say, boss.

192
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,600
Alright.

193
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,920
10 days.

194
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,180
Getting impatient again.

195
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,800
You're the captain now,

196
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,200
why can't you keep your cool?

197
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,440
A well needs pressure to produce oil.

198
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,240
A cop needs pressure to solve a case.

199
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,520
You, Luoxun, are best at tough battles.

200
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,880
I believe in you.

201
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,640
Fine.

202
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
10 days it is.

203
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,440
Here's the autopsy report.

204
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,200
Take a look.

205
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,640
Based on our preliminary assessment,

206
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,880
the victim's time of death

207
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,920
was between 12 and 18 hours ago.

208
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,480
Although sleeping pills were found

209
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,320
in the victim's system,

210
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,920
there was also

211
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,560
a significant amount of soil in her mouth and nose.

212
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,160
Therefore, the actual cause of death

213
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,880
was most likely mechanical asphyxiation.

214
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,720
So...

215
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
If it was mechanical asphyxiation,

216
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,440
but there aren't many signs of struggle on her body.

217
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,400
This indicates that before she suffocated,

218
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,760
she had already lost the ability to resist.

219
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,320
But I just noticed

220
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,400
there's soil under her fingernails.

221
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,640
These two points contradict each other.

222
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,400
So next,

223
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,960
we need to test

224
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,280
the soil composition under the victim's nails.

225
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Give me some time.

226
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,920
And the scratches on her arms

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,040
weren't found on the first two victims.

228
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,560
If the test results can prove

229
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,840
these marks were made during a struggle

230
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,960
from scratching...

231
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,560
Wait.

232
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,530
What's her name?

233
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,880
Chi Xia, right?

234
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,160
Your analysis is all just speculation.

235
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,880
Can we hear the medical examiner's professional conclusion?

236
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,760
Before the detailed autopsy report

237
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
and DNA comparison results come out,

238
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,120
let's intensify our investigation

239
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,200
to confirm the victim's identity. Let's go.

240
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,000
Captain Luo.

241
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,520
I don't think going out to investigate without any leads

242
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,560
is a wise choice.

243
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,620
We don't have that much time to waste.

244
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,600
Then tell me how I should investigate.

245
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,320
It's not about me teaching you how to investigate.

246
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,280
At least I think

247
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,120
we should use the characteristics of the third victim

248
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,760
and the commonalities with the previous two victims

249
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,160
to narrow down the scope.

250
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,280
You make it sound so easy.

251
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,090
How do we narrow it down?

252
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,970
Based on your wild guesses?

253
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,420
You don't trust me.

254
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,800
Then let's have a competition.

255
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,880
Let's see who can find information on the third victim first

256
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,920
and their connection to the previous two victims.

257
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,280
If I lose,

258
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,280
I'll leave the Major Crimes Unit immediately.

259
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,160
Deal?

260
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,770
[Victim's clothing detail photo (with pollen)]

261
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,400
Ning, listen.

262
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,800
There's a new discovery.

263
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,200
The third victim's heart

264
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,600
had coronary intervention surgery

265
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,360
in our area.

266
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,920
Only the City Central Hospital can perform this surgery.

267
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,760
Okay, got it.

268
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,920
Let's go to City Central Hospital.

269
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,250
Okay.

270
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,720
Cao Bin, Curly, let's go.

271
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,740
Sure thing.

272
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,760
Thank you both.

273
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,420
No problem.

274
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,640
Sorry, I was in such a hurry with the delivery.

275
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Are you okay?

276
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,200
Are there really flower shops that offer delivery service?

277
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,080
They're rare,

278
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,250
but such flower shops do exist.

279
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,680
I know a colleague who runs one.

280
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,960
To save money,

281
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,680
she opened her flower shop in a warehouse.

282
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,340
It's called Lili Flower Shop.

283
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,880
Do you have her contact information?

284
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,560
No,

285
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,920
but I know the owner's name is Chen Li.

286
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,600
Chen Li,

287
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,650
the Chen with 'ear' on the left.

288
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,120
These four people best match the criteria.

289
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,520
What's up, boss?

290
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Found something?

291
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,680
Is it possible?

292
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,860
This is the most likely match.

296
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,720
Rich kids,

297
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,760
always trying to prove themselves in unusual ways.

298
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,600
Why don't we provoke him to commit a crime?

299
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,280
Do you realize

300
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,940
you're playing with potential victims' lives?
