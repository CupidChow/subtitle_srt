1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunyue.

2
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,890
Who chose this hotpot restaurant?

3
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,120
Separate.

4
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,000
You don't eat spicy food.

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,160
I'll remember that next time.

6
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,800
They don't have split pots here.

7
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,600
So I just...

8
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,960
I'll eat it.

9
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,120
You probably don't know me well.

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,400
I often take them to eat spicy food.

11
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,460
They all know that.

12
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,759
Let's talk business.

13
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,920
The forensics department has news.

14
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,280
The handwriting analysis is a match.

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,960
And

16
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,400
the surveillance footage is very clear.

17
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,280
So I think

18
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,320
this kid Xu Yang

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,960
is definitely involved with Liang Ruqing

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,560
and the hypnotic anchoring.

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,210
The direction is right,

22
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
but the current evidence isn't enough.

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,440
First,

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,340
the motive is unclear.

25
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,440
Second,

26
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,770
does this kid Xu Yang

27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,810
really have such strong hypnotic abilities?

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,560
I think Brother Jue is right.

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
About Xu Yang's family situation,

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,450
I've looked into it.

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,640
It's terrible.

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,320
His mother

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,360
committed suicide by jumping.

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,120
And his father

35
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,640
is never around.

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,000
But this Xu Yang,

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,370
he's very independent.

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,640
He always cooks for himself

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,100
and brings food to school.

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,850
He's extremely frugal.

41
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,320
But I'm confused.

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,200
I mean,

43
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,180
why would he kill his own teacher?

44
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
What's the point?

45
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,120
Chi Xia,

46
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
what do you think?

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,000
First, I think

48
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,240
the expensive pen

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,400
and his mother who also committed suicide by jumping

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
are both suspicious points.

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,160
Another thing is his greeting message.

52
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,680
It sounds sarcastic to me,

53
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,340
especially the last line:

54
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,000
'Wishing you a good journey ahead.'

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,260
It's like saying 'rest in peace,' right?

56
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,440
So young,

57
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,600
yet so dark-minded.

58
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,060
Xu Yang is mentally tough,

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,160
which is completely different

60
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,840
from his behavior after

61
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,080
Liang Ruqing's suicide

62
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,320
when he appeared vulnerable.

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,040
Besides, when someone

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,920
has suffered

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,450
through life's hardships,

66
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,400
their mentality

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,360
becomes more rational than others.

68
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,640
So I'm wondering

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,240
if it's possible that

70
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,080
Xu Yang's previous emotional distress

71
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,240
was all an act,

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,760
not genuine at all.

73
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:22,760
Eat up.

74
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,890
Don't overthink it.

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,840
Chi Xia's reasoning makes sense,

76
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,040
but these deductions

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,500
can't be used as evidence.

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,000
We still need to figure out how to convict him.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,400
If we want to legally

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,800
prove hypnotic murder.

81
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,840
It's exceptionally difficult.

82
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,320
Difficult or not, we have to handle it.

83
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,600
We can't let some kid get the better of us.

84
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,320
We must get to the bottom of this,

85
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,450
right, Captain Luo?

86
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,680
Doesn't Old Ning always say,

87
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,880
'Even in your coffin,

88
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,480
you must save face'?

89
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,040
Everyone keep your dignity intact.

90
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,760
Bin,

91
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,320
go stake out Xu Yang's house.

92
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,280
Keep a close eye on him.

93
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,680
The rest of you, split up.

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,920
I refuse to believe he won't slip up.

95
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,240
Sun Lin,

96
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,040
think carefully.

97
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,760
Do you remember anything about your mother's tutoring student,

98
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,040
Xu Yang?

99
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,800
This person.

100
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,120
The person in this photo,

101
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,019
I don't recognize him.

102
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,360
However,

103
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,200
I've heard my mom mention

104
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,920
the name Xu Yang before.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,120
She said one of her students had a mother

106
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,260
whose situation was similar to hers.

107
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,480
My mom tried to help him.

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,330
But what exactly happened,

109
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,200
she never told me.

110
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,600
These are the suspicious bank records

111
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,200
of Xu Yang's father.

112
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,720
And these

113
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,840
are surveillance screenshots of his father's suspicious activities.

114
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,960
On the surface,

115
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,600
Xu Yang's father, Xu Xiaodao,

116
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,400
appears to be just an ordinary small business owner.

117
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
But behind the scenes,

118
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,760
he's likely involved in

119
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,640
some kind of illegal activity.

120
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,200
I've been asking around,

121
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
and they say Xu Xiaodao has connections

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
to an illegal gambling den in North City Street.

123
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,530
Most likely he's in gambling debt.

124
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,840
Hello.

125
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,800
We're police officers.

126
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,880
We've met before.

127
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,600
About Xiao Yan's suicide,

128
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,320
didn't you police already investigate it?

129
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,720
Why are you asking again?

130
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
There are new developments in the case.

131
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,680
Please cooperate with our investigation.

132
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,880
She's already gone,

133
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,240
yet you're still digging into

134
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,800
these shameful matters.

135
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,730
Can't you leave Xiao Yan some dignity?

136
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,920
Mrs. Yang,

137
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,720
we understand your concerns,

138
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,120
and we don't want to invade anyone's privacy.

139
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,720
But Liu Yan's suicide

140
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,900
is connected to another murder case.

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
We also want to resolve this quickly

142
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,080
so we can put it behind us.

143
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,010
Don't you agree?

144
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,560
Let me tell you.

145
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,250
I'm doing you a favor

146
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,560
by letting you sell.

147
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,800
If you don't make money,

148
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,720
how am I supposed

149
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,780
to pay off my debts?

150
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,880
You're listening to that Liang woman's instigation.

151
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,740
You want to divorce me, don't you?

152
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,280
You can't divorce me even if you want to.

153
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,640
Let's go.

154
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,600
Let go of me!

155
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,520
Are you coming or not?

156
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,240
You beast!

157
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,160
Mrs. Yang,

158
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,920
I'm just disciplining my wife.

159
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,600
Mrs. Yang,

160
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,920
this is between me and my wife.

161
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,780
Get out of here!

162
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,520
Liu Yan,

163
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,159
you'll pay for this.

164
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,220
Beating your wife?

165
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,480
Aren't you ashamed?

166
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,200
You'll see.

167
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,000
This Xu Xiaodao

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
really is a beast.

169
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,000
Liu Yan's death

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,560
happened after Liang Ruqing tutored Xu Yang.

171
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,680
If Xu Yang didn't know

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,080
what Xu Xiaodao did to Liu Yan,

173
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
is it possible

174
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,760
that he blamed

175
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,680
Liang Ruqing's interference for Liu Yan's death?

176
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,340
That's his motive for murder.

177
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,840
From his perspective,

178
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,480
Liang Ruqing meddled in their family affairs

179
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,340
and intensified the conflict between his parents.

180
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,400
But Xu Xiaodao might not cooperate with us.

181
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,280
It's fine.

182
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,480
Curly has already confirmed

183
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,280
that Xu Xiaodao can't escape his involvement in running an illegal gambling den.

184
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,159
Let's go back

185
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,159
and prepare to trap him.

186
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,560
Time to smoke out the rat.

187
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,159
We've been playing for two hours

188
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,400
and haven't noticed anything unusual.

189
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,360
You two must have noticed it, right?

190
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,159
Two bamboo.

191
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,200
The bathroom inside

192
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,960
and the one outside are suspicious.

193
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,400
The outside bathroom is vacant,

194
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,460
but nobody uses it.

195
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,520
As for those who go inside,

196
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,440
the timing and number of people entering and exiting don't match up.

197
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,570
Everyone who goes in

198
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,600
greets the person at the door.

199
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,640
Since we first came in here,

200
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,960
26 people have gone inside,

201
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,820
6 have come out,

202
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,760
and 20 are missing.

203
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,890
I was wondering why I kept winning.

204
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,760
So none of you were even looking at your cards?

205
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,560
That's right.

206
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,560
There must be a secret door somewhere,

207
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,760
but I just looked for it,

208
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,820
and found nothing.

209
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,930
Did you notice that person?

210
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,000
He went in four times.

211
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,640
And every time he came out,

212
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,320
he would greet the person at the door.

213
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,400
And only he

214
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,039
doesn't need Xu Xiaodao to escort him in.

215
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,919
He's most likely a money handler.

216
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,010
A money handler.

217
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,520
That's someone at the casino

218
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,480
who collects commissions and gives out loans.

219
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,800
People like him usually don't dare to carry much cash.

220
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,000
So every now and then,

221
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,120
they need someone to take the commission money away.

222
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,050
That's perfect.

223
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,840
We can use him

224
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
as our way in.

225
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,880
Then I'll have Brother Jue put on an act.

226
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,080
I'll notify Team Two.

227
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,240
I know.

228
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,280
Weren't they short one player that day?

229
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
He came later.

230
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,920
Buddy.

231
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,480
Police!

232
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,280
Don't talk.

233
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,000
Stay still.

234
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,210
That's it. Caught red-handed.

235
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,760
Listen up.

236
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,040
You have a chance to redeem yourself.

237
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,300
This offer won't last.

238
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,080
What's the entry code?

239
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,720
Boss.

240
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,820
I want some tea.

241
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,010
What kind of tea?

242
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,300
Qiang recommended me.

243
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,600
Black tea.

244
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,280
Dark tea.

245
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,560
There are dozens.

246
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,280
Black tea.

247
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,650
How many pounds?

248
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,800
Stop looking.

249
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,720
That table.

250
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,240
All my brothers.

251
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,760
Been waiting forever.

252
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,440
Hurry up.

253
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,440
Come.

254
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,730
Come, follow me.

255
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,400
Alright.

256
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,640
You're betting small this time?

257
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,770
Get some chips for the boss.

258
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,200
How much?

259
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,600
Let's start with 50,000.

260
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,900
Hurry up with those chips.

261
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
What a damn coincidence.

262
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,880
He's a cop.

263
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,240
Police! Run!

264
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,650
Freeze! Don't move!

265
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
Get down! Get down!

266
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,640
Stay down!

267
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't move!

268
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,840
Everybody down!

269
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,370
Get down!

270
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,480
Nobody move!

271
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,060
Captain Luo, are you okay?

272
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,530
Take them all in.

273
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,360
Yes, sir.

274
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,440
I was forced to do it.

275
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,640
I owe so much money

276
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,840
that I can't pay back.

277
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm finished.

278
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,960
I had no choice.

279
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,800
We'll verify your situation.

280
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
But now we have other questions for you.

281
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,600
I'll confess.

282
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,080
I'll tell you everything.

283
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,400
Did Liang Ruqing tutor

284
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,730
your son Xu Yang at home?

285
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,160
Yes.

286
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,760
Before Liu Yan committed suicide,

287
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,320
did you throw her out of the house half-naked?

288
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,770
She deserved it.

289
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,120
Officer,

290
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,480
this isn't my fault.

291
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,760
It was all that Liang whatever-her-name-is instigating things.

292
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,640
My wife

293
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,920
was like she'd been brainwashed by her.

294
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,840
She kept bossing me around all day

295
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
saying she wanted a divorce

296
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,920
and would take my son away.

297
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,960
That worthless woman

298
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,040
didn't know her place

299
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,840
so she deserved to kill herself.

300
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
I'll handle this.

301
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,290
When it comes to making tea,

302
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,100
you really can't be too fussy.

303
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,800
So what if the tea leaves are a bit dirty?

304
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,090
Once you pour boiling water over them,

305
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,780
the bacteria will be gone anyway.

306
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,760
Captain Luo, your way of comforting people is quite unique.

307
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
I'm just sharing some simple life experience.

308
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,840
I think now

309
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,690
our theory is heading in the right direction.

310
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,480
Xu Yang did it for revenge,

311
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,000
that's why he plotted to kill Liang Ruqing.

312
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,240
So now

313
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,760
there's only one question left to complete our logical loop.

314
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,360
How did Xu Yang carry out the hypnotic murder?

315
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,960
Have you seen this photo?

316
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,440
Isn't this Liang Ruqing's photo from the morgue?

317
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,240
Hair tie

318
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,560
Red one.

319
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,080
This is its original color.

320
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,210
It has nothing to do with bloodstains.

321
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,840
Thank you.

322
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,920
It's burning hot!

323
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,600
Okay.

324
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,400
I'll hold it.

325
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,360
But do you remember

326
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
what Xu Yang told us before?

327
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,890
He repeatedly emphasized that this hair tie was yellow.

328
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,120
This kid...

329
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,040
I'm really surprised.

330
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,680
After knowing we suspected hypnosis was involved,

331
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,200
in such a short time,

332
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,010
he could use a hair tie to plant a suggestion on me.

333
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,520
He's too clever.

334
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,280
And

335
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,840
even if we investigate him later,

336
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,600
he can claim he was overwhelmed with grief

337
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,480
or simply misremembered.

338
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,660
Using that as an explanation.

339
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,960
A kid who hasn't even finished school

340
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,480
having such powerful hypnosis skills?

341
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,010
I have good news.

342
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,770
I checked overnight

343
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Xu Yang's surveillance records from the past six months.

344
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,200
You'll never guess what I found.

345
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,860
Xu Yang once took Liang Ruqing

346
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,420
to see a psychiatrist.

347
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,760
We checked the records in the psychology department's archives.

348
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,960
This patient named Liang Ruqing

349
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,760
did come here for insomnia treatment,

350
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,090
and visited many times.

351
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,880
Who was the attending physician?

352
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,680
Hu Li.

353
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,690
She's the only attending physician in the psychology department.

354
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,330
So there really is someone behind Xu Yang.

355
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,920
Do you have any specific identity information on this person?

356
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,400
This is an outsourced department that works with the clinic.

357
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,960
The registration information has mysteriously disappeared.

358
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,440
She always wore a mask,

359
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,360
almost no one has seen her face.

360
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,640
She hasn't come to work for a long time.

361
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,760
Planning everything so meticulously,

362
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,560
yet still putting a photo there.

363
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,120
What's that supposed to mean?

364
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,980
Does she think we can't catch her?

365
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,480
Provocation.

366
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,820
Then let's make her pay for it.

367
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,290
Please take us to the psychology consultation room.

368
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,960
Captain Luo,

369
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,920
Xu Yang just bought some spirit money

370
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,840
and white flowers.

371
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,640
He went home,

372
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,100
and now he's out again,

373
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,720
carrying a container

374
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,260
that looks like an urn.

375
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,120
I understand.

376
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,720
Today is Liu Yan's death anniversary.

377
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,320
Where is he taking the ashes?

378
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,240
Cao Bin,

379
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
stay close to him.

380

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,240
Let me go.

386
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,800
Let me go.

387
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,660
Just calm down.

388
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,640
What are you doing?

389
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,440
Let him go.

390
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,460
He's awake now.

391
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,640
Mom.

392
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,120
I've told you everything.

393
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,850
Why are you still bothering me?

394
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,320
Every one of you

395
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,780
is against me, aren't you?

396
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Xu Yang.

397
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,800
Everything you said,

398
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,000
we've checked it all.

399
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
After all our investigation,

400
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,120
you're still the prime suspect.

401
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,980
Let me tell you,

402
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,880
you might as well confess now.

403
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,450

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,480

00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,440

But she said everything was part of the plan.

410
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,200
Do you think in my subconscious

411
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm someone who desires to commit crimes?

412
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,599
