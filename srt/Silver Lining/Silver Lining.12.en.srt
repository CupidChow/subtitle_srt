1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya.

2
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Come, take notes.

3
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,240
30.

4
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,680
The deceased is female,

5
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,520
approximately 30 years old,

6
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,850
with time of death about three months ago.

7
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,400
The back of the skull suffered a severe impact.

8
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,760
I believe this was the fatal wound.

9
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,770
The wound is 2 centimeters.

10
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,840
Make a note of that.

11
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,160
The bone density doesn't seem right.

12
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,880
That's correct.

13
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,010
Her body was treated with some kind of special chemical.

14
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,610
Samples have been sent to the lab for testing.

15
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,520
These residues in the bone crevices,

16
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,640
as well as soil from the pit,

17
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,600
have all been sampled

18
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,320
and sent for testing.

19
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,720
We'll have results soon.

20
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,560
Go to the meteorological bureau

21
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,220
and inquire about recent rainfall in this area.

22
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,160
Captain Luo.

23
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,250
I just spoke with the village head.

24
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,480
Landslides frequently occur in this area.

25
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,520
During rainy season,

26
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,760
people aren't supposed to enter this area.

27
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,440
But this area is known for bamboo fungi and wild mushrooms,

28
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,360
which fetch a good price,

29
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,920
so villagers often sneak in to gather them.

30
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,600
Right.

31
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,920
Those villagers who found the body

32
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,960
also mentioned

33
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,400
they were here three days ago

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,280
but didn't notice anything unusual.

35
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,079
Captain Luo,

36
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,520
you're right.

37
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,920
There's a cemetery behind there,

38
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,980
and a road at the foot of the mountain.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,600
I got the information,

40
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,329
Captain Luo.

41
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,760
The rainfall in this area

42
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,880
has indeed been low,

43
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,740
much lower than previous years at this time.

44
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,320
Based on the current scene conditions,

45
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,240
does anyone have any thoughts?

46
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,040
Speak up.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,720
The soil in this area is loose,

48
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,600
making landslides quite common.

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,200
And with villagers frequently gathering wild produce here,

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,660
it's really not an ideal place to dump a body.

51
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,720
I see two possibilities.

52
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,760
First,

53
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,440
the killer was unfamiliar with the terrain.

54
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,240
Second,

55
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,040
they were in a hurry,

56
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,100
acting on impulse.

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,810
My thinking is completely opposite to yours.

58
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,400
The killer knows this area extremely well,

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,600
and deliberately exposed the remains.

60
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,730
What's your basis for that?

61
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,320
Look.

62
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,839
The victim's body

63
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,279
was chemically treated

64
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,740
before being buried here.

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,480
The information on this,

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,800
Old Ning is still collecting it,

67
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,880
but it should be accurate.

68
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,640
Also,

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,780
the burial depth is very shallow.

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,000
Based on previous case experience,

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,840
this doesn't match the psychology

72
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,640
of someone trying to hide a body.

73
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,980
But right now we can only prove

74
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,600
that they dumped the body.

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,320
Isn't there a cemetery over there?

76
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,760
The cemetery is close to the highway.

77
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,800
But this dump site is actually farther away.

78
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,240
Why would the killer go out of their way?

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,440
It makes no sense.

80
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,120
If I were the killer,

81
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,120
I would definitely dump the body in the cemetery area.

82
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,680
First, there are already many bodies there,

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,610
easy to blend in.

84
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,560
Second,

85
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,200
I could just dig a hole

86
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,400
and stuff it into someone else's grave,

87
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
and it would almost never be found.

88
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,960
Exactly.

89
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
That's the point.

90
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,920
Considering all factors,

91
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,240
the person who dumped the body chose

92
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,840
the most easily discoverable location and method.

93
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,040
They wanted us to find it.

94
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,300
Looking at it that way,

95
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,610
this just got interesting.

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,320
This is really fascinating.

97
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,080
The victim had given birth before death.

98
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,680
Time of death was approximately three months ago.

99
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,240
The body was treated with hydrofluoric acid.

100
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,120
The fatal wound matches our previous assessment.

101
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,600
Located at the back of the skull.

102
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
Caused by a blunt object.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,520
Most of the teeth in the oral cavity

104
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,240
were dislodged due to external force

105
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,240
impact.

106
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,000
Multiple fractures throughout the body.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Skull.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,800
Ribs.

109
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,640
Radius.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,760
Femur.

111
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,080
This is the detailed autopsy report.

112
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,440
I suspect

113
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,120
the victim suffered violent abuse before death,

114
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,480
but this is only what's evident from the bones.

115
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,880
Due to the extended time since death

116
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,440
and chemical treatment of the body,

117
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,280
muscles and other soft tissues have disappeared,

118
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,840
so many surface injuries can't be detected.

119
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,680
These remains.

120
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,940
If nobody reported a missing person,

121
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,880
then the likelihood of a crime by someone close to the victim increases.

122
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,200
Combined with what you mentioned

123
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,320
about the violent abuse before death,

124
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,180
could this be domestic violence?

125
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,120
That's hard to determine.

126
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,520
However,

127
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,850
in my personal opinion,

128
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,120
domestic violence seems unlikely.

129
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,600
Because domestic violence is typically

130
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
a prolonged pattern of behavior.

131
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,680
Since it occurs over time,

132
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,840
there would inevitably be signs of old injuries.

133
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,570
But these remains show no such characteristics.

134
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,040
This victim

135
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,770
must have had many stories in her life.

136
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,840
The body can speak to us.

137
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,720
Female,

138
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,380
with childbirth history.

139
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,800
According to the autopsy information,

140
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
Dongzhou City doesn't have any matching

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,240
missing persons.

142
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,200
I suggest we expand our search

143
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,260
to neighboring counties and cities.

144
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,320
Everyone,

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
the skull reconstruction is ready.

146
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,880
Zhou Wanrou

147
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,120
I was just as shocked as you when I first saw it.

148
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,450
This can't be possible.

149
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,200
Although she was reported missing two months ago,

150
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,360
the case was withdrawn that same day.

151
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
I even went to the police station to check the records.

152
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,090
She withdrew the case herself.

153
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,080
Do you have her contact information?

154
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,760
Let's verify it again.

155
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,600
Yes.

156
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,480
Here.

157
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,960
Hello.

158
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,490
The number you've dialed has been suspended.

159
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,680
Suspended.

160
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,400
What about her family's number?

161
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,200
Family.

162
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,040
Here.

163
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,360
Hello.

164
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,240
The number you've dialed is powered off.

165
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,970
Powered off.

166
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,840
Xiao Xia.

167
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Is that skull reconstruction technology of yours reliable?

168
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,960
I feel like

169
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,080
it doesn't match her ID photo.

170
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,000
Skull reconstruction is a new technology

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,360
that requires high scientific accuracy.

172
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,720
It's definitely reliable.

173
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,400
We can't contact Zhou Wanrou anyway,

174
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,440
so as an investigative lead,

175
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,300
it makes sense.

176
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,720
Alright.

177
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,640
Jue.

178
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,280
You and Cao Bin follow your line of thinking

179
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,400
and expand the search scope.

180
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,080
Curly.

181
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,840
Head to the police station

182
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,960
and verify the case withdrawal information.

183
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,600
Okay.

184
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,690
You come with me.

185
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,600
Last month's.

186
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,840
Let's go.

187
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,480
Our surveillance footage here

188
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,000
can only be kept for one month.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,320
As you just saw,

190
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,080
this family hasn't returned at all.

191
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,210
How much do you know about this family?

192
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,600
There are too many homeowners in this community.

193
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,880
I only remember they have a son.

194
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,840
I think

195
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,900
there was an issue.

196
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,000
About six months ago,

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,360
their young son was bullied by other kids.

198
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,320
When his mother found out,

199
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,040
she wouldn't let go of the other parents

200
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,480
and even brought the trouble here.

201
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,040
Later, those parents didn't want to escalate the matter,

202
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,440
so they apologized

203
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
and the issue was finally resolved.

204
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,220
Juanmao found something.

205
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,440
Zhou Wanrou has a son

206
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,170
named Pei Xi.

207
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,080
He's 8 years old

208
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
and has autism.

209
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,800
He's currently enrolled at Dongzhou Special Education Academy.

210
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,320
Pei Xi took a leave of absence three months ago.

211
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,450
Three months again.

212
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,890
Any contact after that?

213
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,760
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,320
Special education requires more effort than regular education.

215
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,120
I

216
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,380
haven't been in contact with them at all.

217
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,520
In your opinion,

218
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,280
what kind of person is Pei Xi's mother?

219
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,200
Here at our school,

220
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,730
we see all kinds of parents.

221
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,880
Pei Xi's mother

222
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,040
is the most patient

223
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,320
and loving parent I've ever met.

224
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,160
To be honest,

225
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,360
many parents, when they learn their child has issues,

226
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
as long as it's not a genetic defect,

227
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,360
usually choose to have a second child.

228
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,080
The national policy allows it too.

229
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,760
But Peixi's mother had no choice.

230
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,880
I've talked to her.

231
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,120
She said that with Peixi's condition,

232
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,440
she needs all of her love even more.

233
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,700
Does she have a job?

234
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,880
She used to be

235
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,760
an executive at a large

236
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,080
multinational company in China.

237
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,400
But later because Peixi

238
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,640
was diagnosed with autism.

239
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,960
She quit her job

240
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,880
to take care of her child full-time.

241
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,720
Her career was going so well.

242
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,520
Why didn't she just hire a nanny?

243
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,200
Obviously she felt a nanny wouldn't be attentive enough.

244
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,640
Only a mother

245
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
would be willing to make such sacrifices for her child.

246
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,200
I really admire her for that.

247
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,720
Doesn't she have any other family members

248
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,780
who could help out?

249
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,560
I'm not sure about that.

250
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,140
But I heard from Peixi that

251
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,370
his grandmother needs long-term care in a nursing home.

252
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,560
Juanmao has checked.

253
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,960
Zhou Wanrou's only living direct relative

254
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,560
is her mother, Zheng Lanshu.

255
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,640
She currently lives in Dongzhou Nursing Home.

256
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,720
A housewife's social connections

257
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,250
are usually quite limited.

258
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,860
What's wrong with you?

259
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,320
I'm fine.

260
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,320
Mrs. Zheng's condition is quite serious.

261
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,960
She can barely communicate normally.

262
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,000
When you question her, please be careful

263
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,440
not to trigger any resistance from the patient.

264
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,360
When was the last time

265
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,490
her daughter Zhou Wanrou visited her?

266
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,040
I think it was in September,

267
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,450
about three months ago.

268
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,280
Haven't you tried

269
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,610
to contact Zhou Wanrou?

270
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,720
We have,

271
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,960
but couldn't reach her.

272
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,440
It's strange, actually.

273
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,680
The mother and daughter had a good relationship

274
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,200
with no apparent conflicts.

275
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,880
But she suddenly stopped visiting.

276
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,360
And since then,

277
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,010
Mrs. Zheng's condition

278
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,130
has deteriorated significantly.

279
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,360
Ma'am,

280
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,840
when was the last time

281
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,640
your daughter came to visit you?

282
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,200
Every day.

283
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,200
Xiarou,

284
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,640
Mom has been waiting for you for a long time.

285
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,320
Xiarou,

286
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,160
wait.

287
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,620
This is what Mom prepared for you.

288
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,160
Eat up.

289
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,610
Mom prepared it for you.

290
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,040
Ma'am,

291
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,560
has your son-in-law Pei Xinlu

292
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,840
visited you recently?

293
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,800
Pei Xinlu.

294
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,040
Pei Xinlu.

295
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:39,920
Ma'am,

296
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,000
you must pay for Xiaorou's life!

297
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,960
Nurse!

298
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,520
Pei Xinlu!

299
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,480
Nurse! Nurse!

300
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,880
You must pay for my Xiaorou's life!

301
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
Mrs. Zheng! Mrs. Zheng!

302
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,080
Please calm down.

303
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,600
Mom!

304
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,360
Xiaorou!

305
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Quick, hide!

306
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,360
Don't let Pei Xinlu find you.

307
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,760
Mom!

308
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,480
Xiaorou!

309
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,400
I'm fine. I'm fine.

310
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,000
Quick, hide!

311
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
Don't let Pei Xinlu find you.

312
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,160
I'm fine.

313
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
He's not Pei Xinlu.

314
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,160
Don't let Pei Xinlu find you.

315
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,840
Look.

316
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,800
Xiaorou!

317
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,130
Look.

318
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,800
Let's sit down first.

319
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,160
Don't let Pei Xinlu find you.

320
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,160
Look.

321
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,360
You drew this,

322
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,440
you were holding me,

323
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,170
weren't you?

324
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,680
Xiarou.

325
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,840
Hide.

326
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
Don't let Pei Xinlu find you.

327
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,240
Okay.

328
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
I'll hide.

329
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,440
Thank you so much

330
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,240
officer.

331
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,240
Mrs. Zheng has been experiencing these episodes

332
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,080
several times recently.

333
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,360
For the sake of the patient's health

334
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,520
and your safety,

335
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,320
Perhaps

336
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,240
you could come back another day.

337
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,760
Alright.

338
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,360
Please take good care of Mrs. Zheng,

339
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,760
okay?

340
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,400
If you need anything,

341
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,520
contact the police anytime.

342
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,360
Certainly.

343
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,080
Are you okay?

344
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,960
I'm fine.

345
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,360
It was just quite sudden.

346
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,040
What do you think about Zheng Lanshu's reaction?

347
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,080
The old lady's reaction was definitely not normal.

348
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,560
She must have sensed something.

349
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,920
But if we only go by this reaction,

350
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,880
it can't be used as evidence that Zhou Wanrou was murdered.

351
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,540
We need to do a DNA comparison.

352
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,040
Pretty smart.

353
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,820
Is this following proper procedure?

354
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,640
Special cases require special measures.

355
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,480
Let's send it back for comparison first.

356
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,000
Then after Zheng Lanshu is more emotionally stable,

357
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,160
we'll do a formal extraction process.

358
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,900
Where are we going now?

359
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,680
To the station.

360
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,040
To deliver the DNA sample.

361
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,840
And then?

362
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,840
If the remains prove to be Zhou Wanrou's,

363
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,360
then her husband Pei Xinlu

364
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,890
becomes the prime suspect.

365
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,920
Their home would be the crime scene.

366
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,240
After delivering the DNA sample,

367
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,640
we'll get a search warrant

368
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,370
and look for clues at his house.

369
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,920
Just what I was thinking.

370
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,820
Take some photos here.

371
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
I'll go over here.

372
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,370
Where's the bag?

373
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Need to photograph this carefully.

374
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,680
Here.

375
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,520
Wu.

376
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,760
Come here, Wu.

377
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
What do you think?

378
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,240
It's too clean.

379
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,960
It looks like only Pei Xinlu lives here.

380
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,760
But that's clearly not the case.

381
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,760
Zhou Wanrou and her child's

382
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,080
traces of life have been deliberately erased.

383
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,280
I feel the same way.

384
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,840
Although we don't know where this family went,

385
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,040
Zhou Wanrou and her child

386
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,570
are likely in grave danger.

387
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Otherwise, someone wouldn't have

388
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,840
deliberately erased all traces of their existence.

389
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,160
In previous cases,

390
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,440
when a wife is harmed,

391
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,560
the husband is usually the prime suspect.

392
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
But there's a twist in this case.

393
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,040
Someone reported them missing

394
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,280
and then withdrew the report.

395
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,360
Looking at it this way,

396
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,490
Pei Xinlu seems even more suspicious.

397
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,400
Captain Luo,

398
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,930
what are you looking at?

399
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,800
It seems

400
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,960
Pei Xinlu left home in a hurry.

401
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,960
He even put on mismatched socks.

402
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,680
Let's go

403
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,800
back to the station.

404
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,960
The DNA test results

405
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,360
for Zheng Lanshu and Zhou Wanrou are ready.

406
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,640
Take me to see Wanrou.

407
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,080
Mrs. Zheng,

408
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,210
let's go see Wanrou.

409
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,120
See Wanrou.

410
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,800
See Wanrou.

411
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,320
Come.

412
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,520
Slow down.

413
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,640
Give me back Xiaorou.

414
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,480
I'll kill you. Give me back Xiaorou.

415
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,400
It's okay.

416
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,460
Dad, don't kill me.

417
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,440
Dad.

418
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,560
This Zhou Wanrou is fake.

419
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,840
Her appearance and body type

420
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,040
aren't they exactly like hers?

421
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,160
Actually, Pei Xi

422
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,140
fell to his death by accident.

423
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,840
How could Pei Xinlu possibly kill his own son?

424
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,240
12 and 25.

425
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,060
I've been watching since the case began,

426
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,010
but they haven't appeared yet.
