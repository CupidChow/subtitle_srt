1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya

2
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,200
Brother

3
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
We're back again.

4
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
That's awesome.

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,000
That's why you're our big brother.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,320
You casually won such a big prize.

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,519
Not only did we not spend a penny,

8
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,519
but we also got free food and accommodation.

9
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,320
Recently,

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
our project has been going well.

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,440
This is

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,000
heaven rewarding us.

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,600
Thank you, brother.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,360
Let's use water instead of alcohol

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,289
and have a drink.

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,440
Alright, cheers.

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,200
Great!

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,760
Conquering Death Mountain once again.

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,800
Life is but a few short autumns.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,000
We won't stop until we're drunk.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,039
My beauty over there.

22
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,120
Give it a rest.

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,200
Call me when we arrive.

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,560
Sure thing.

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,800
Qu Feiyu.

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,720
I confess.

27
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,720
So you admit

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,100
that you killed those four people

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,120
and uploaded that video online?

30
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,760
I admit it.

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,200
Don't be so quick to take the blame.

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,730
Forgive me for being blunt,

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,200
but you're blind.

34
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,770
It would be difficult for you to do all this

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,660
by yourself, wouldn't it?

36
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,900
Indeed, it was difficult.

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,690
Who's your accomplice?

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,320
Though I can't see her face,

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,040
from her voice,

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,760
she must be as beautiful

41
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,200
as you are.

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,840
Fox.

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
So you've already found out.

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,600
That's right.

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
She said she enjoys hunting,

46
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,560
especially hunting foxes,

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,920
so she asked me to call her Fox.

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,320
How did Fox help you carry out your revenge?

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
Tell us in detail how you planned it.

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,020
I'm being so cooperative.

51
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,760
Aren't you afraid I might be lying?

52
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,560
Would you lie?

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,400
Whether covering for the fox

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
or trying to exonerate yourself,

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,860
you haven't succeeded at either.

56
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,240
You were asking questions you already knew the answers to.

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,040
In that case,

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,700
I don't seem to have any reason to lie.

59
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,360
Qu Feiyu.

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,000
You weren't actually brainwashed by the fox.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,040
The lowest point of your life when you lost your sight

62
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
has forged you into someone more decisive

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,300
and resilient inside.

64
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,520
To be honest,

65
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,040
I was quite nervous before coming to see you.

66
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,760
Because all the details indicate

67
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,280
that ordinary interrogation methods

68
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,600
would hardly break through your psychological defenses.

69
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,360
But now I feel much more at ease

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,320
and relieved.

71
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,000
Because you've chosen to cooperate with us

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,930
instead of resisting till the end.

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,480
Actually, for me,

74
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,690
it makes no difference.

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,530
As long as we can clear the false accusations against us,

76
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,640
that's enough.

77
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,280
I didn't have much desire to live anyway.

78
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,780
Getting caught

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,960
is just another way to die.

80
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,320
To avenge Zhao Shengqian,

81
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,380
you became a murderer.

82
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,140
Was it worth it?

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,480
At that time,

84
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,360
I have bipolar disorder.

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,400
At my worst episodes,

86
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,520
it was Qian

87
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,000
who helped me survive.

88
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:34,920
Watch out!

89
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,440
Are you okay?

90
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,880
They're like family to me.

91
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,370
Their family-like atmosphere touched me

92
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,040
and gave my life meaning again.

93
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,120
So,

94
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,200
I decided to join them.

95
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,600
Captain,

96
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,520
do we still need more people in our rescue team?

97
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,000
I want to join.

98
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,600
Alright.

99
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,640
Then welcome Qu Feiyu

100
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,120
to our rescue team.

101
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,880
Thank you, Captain.

102
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,960
Let's have a toast.

103
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,160
Great, welcome!

104
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,800
Thank you.

105
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,520
Welcome.

106
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,840
But

107
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,480
Five years ago

108
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,840
that night when you and Zhao Shengqian went up the mountain for rescue,

109
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,800
four people led by Yao Lixing

110
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,280
stole your supplies.

111
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,120
From that moment on,

112
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,160
it completely destroyed your hope for life.

113
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,960
Right?

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,480
That day

115
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,600
it was raining.

116
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,840
While searching for them,

117
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,120
my brother Qian and I were already injured to varying degrees.

118
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,480
By the time we found those four scumbags,

119
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,880
they had no supplies left.

120
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,610
We barely kept them alive with what little we had.

121
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,360
Though the rain had stopped,

122
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,080
it was already dark.

123
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,720
The path down the mountain was very difficult to find.

124
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,320
Suffering from hunger and cold,

125
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,640
Qian decided to stop and take a rest.

126
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,180
As the rescue team leader,

127
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,720
you should know

128
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,480
one less person means one less burden.

129
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
This little food

130
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,760
isn't enough for anyone.

131
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
Everything on you,

132
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
in your bags,

133
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,250
hand it all over now!

134
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,520
Number Three,

135
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,280
go!

136
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,490
Hand it over!

137
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,000
Stop!

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,600
What are you doing?

139
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,159
Hand it over!

140
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,920
What are you doing?

141
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,720
Let go!

142
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,720
Heaven sees

143
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,080
what you do.

144
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,240
I'm here to save you.

145
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,700
Without us locals from Yuji Town,

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,880
none of you will make it out of Death Mountain alive.

147
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,360
Go to hell!

148
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,440
Give it to me!

149
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,680
I told you not to move!

150
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,760
Let her go!

151
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,320
Captain Zhao!

152
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,720
But I never expected

153
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
they would push Qian off the cliff.

154
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,680
Everyone saw it.

155
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,080
He fell down by himself.

156
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,970
It has nothing to do with us.

157
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,760
Nothing at all.

158
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,600
Pack up quickly.

159
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,680
Take everything.

160
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,320
Hurry!

161
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,960
Okay.

162
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,320
Give me that hat.

163
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
I said give me that hat!

164
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,320
What are you looking at?

165
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,120
Get moving!

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,800
Let's go!

167
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,120
Captain Zhao!

168
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,800
Captain Zhao!

169
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Captain Zhao!

170
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,360
Captain Zhao!

171
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,360
I wanted to save him then.

172
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,960
Then I realized

173
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,320
I couldn't even take care of myself.

174
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,720
When I woke up again,

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,760
it was three months later.

176
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
I contacted journalists

177
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,120
hoping to clear up the truth.

178
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,760
But the story had already gone cold,

179
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,560
nobody cared anymore.

180
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,440
If

181
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,240
your initial goal was revenge,

182
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,440
you wouldn't have waited five years.

183
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,240
That's true.

184
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,640
At first, I just wanted to clear up the truth.

185
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,210
After all, if it weren't for Brother Qian,

186
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I probably would have died long ago.

187
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,640
I promised him

188
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,440
I would live well.

189
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,840
But my illness

190
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,920
got worse day by day.

191
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,520
I thought about suicide more than once.

192
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,800
I was really afraid that one day

193
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,039
I wouldn't be able to hold on anymore.

194
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,799
While those four scumbags were still out there.

195
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,960
And that's when

196
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,880
Fox found you.

197
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,059
She said she could avenge you,

198
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,140
help you kill them.

199
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,160
Although you couldn't quite believe it,

200
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,220
you couldn't resist the temptation.

201
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,600
Because she knew everything about what happened to you

202
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,680
and was confident she wouldn't be caught by the police.

203
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,520
So you proposed

204
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,960
creating a low-temperature environment on Death Mountain,

205
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,760
frightening

206
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,720
and oxygen-deprived conditions.

207
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,760
To achieve your revenge against them,

208
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,000
a kind of ritual.

209
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,440
She agreed.

210
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,240
That's right.

211
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,170
Everything is just as you said.

212
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,120
So I cooperated fully with her plan.

213
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
We set up the location first.

214
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,600
Then

215
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,960
you posted fake adventure information

216
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,360
to lure them into the tour group.

217
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,320
And on the bus, you gave them

218
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,180
water laced with sleeping pills.

219
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,720
When they woke up,

220
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,520
they had been abandoned in a deserted house.

221
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,800
We are guilty.

222
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,300
These four characters

223
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,660
were deliberately carved on the victims by you, weren't they?

224
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,000
They are unforgivable.

225
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,680
Xiong Jing's body

226
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,880
was placed in a predetermined location by you.

227
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,320
The purpose of doing this

228
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,810
was to frighten Yao Lixing and the others.

229
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,960
Stop!

230
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,640
Help!

231
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,120
Don't run!

232
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,920
Help me!

233
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,160
Stop running!

234
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,890
Please help!

235
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,240
Save me!

236
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,280
Hurry!

237
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,320
Help!

238
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,960
It was also a targeted revenge

239
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,560
for her standing by and doing nothing back then.

240
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,360
That's right.

241
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,640
At that time,

242
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,360
although she didn't participate in looting supplies,

243
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,200
but

244
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,000
if she had just, after coming down the mountain,

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,760
told the rescue team about our situation and Brother Qian's,

246
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,420
Brother Qian wouldn't have died so tragically.

247
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,360
So

248
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,640
she had to die too.

249
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,540
Tape recorder.

250
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,160
Pulley.

251
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,080
And other crime evidence at the scene.

252
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,570
After the incident,

253
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,360
did you move anything?

254
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,760
Did Fox tell you

255
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,880
or contact you?

256
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,000
No.

257
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,000
After I was taken down from the mountain,

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't know

259
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,600
what happened next.

260
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,640
I never saw her again.

261
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,800
Why did you bring in extra sculptures

262
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,260
to make it exactly twelve?

263
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,440
Why was the video release time

264
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,080
set at 25 minutes?

265
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,720
Fox demanded it.

266
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,600
As for the specific reason,

267
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,920
I have no idea why.

268
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,640
Is there any evidence

269
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,940
that proves you worked together?

270
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,680
No.

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,680
She was confident the police wouldn't find her.

272
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,370
And that's exactly what happened.

273
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,360
You only know what she did,

274
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,040
but you can't

275
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,900
find evidence to convict her.

276
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,520
East E·80090.

277
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,320
East F·80090.

278
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,760
At least last time she left a photo.

279
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,410
This time she covered her tracks completely.

280
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,360
This fox is quite clever.

281
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,640
But we've made progress.

282
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,840
We figured out her crime pattern early.

283
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,880
Next time we'll set the trap in advance.

284
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,920
Let the fox feel what it's like to be hunted.

285
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,400
Just tell me what's bothering you.

286
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,600
Don't push yourself.

287
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,530
I'm thinking...

288
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,760
Looking at these recent cases,

289
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,090
if the Fox hadn't been manipulating things from behind,

290
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,760
those killers

291
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,300
might have feared justice would prevail

292
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,320
and wouldn't have had the courage to commit murder.

293
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,880
Without the Fox's help,

294
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,610
they would've lacked the ability to plan these murders.

295
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,920
Those victims

296
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,050
wouldn't have died so tragically.

297
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,860
You're not suggesting

298
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,120
that it was because of the Fox's

299
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,520
specific targeting and provocation of you

300
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,400
that caused those killers

301
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,810
to take that final step?

302
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,160
I think so.

303
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,280
In a way,

304
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,480
I indirectly contributed to

305
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,080
these tragedies happening.

306
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,120
I brought this upon them.

307
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,970
You feel guilty.

308
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,690
I'm not joking with you.

309
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,840
I increasingly feel that

310
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,410
the fox's provocations

311
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,000
must have some kind of

312
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,680
specific purpose.

313
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,360
She might know about my past.

314
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,680
It's just that

315
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,880
she's hiding in the darkness.

316
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,840
I can't see her

317
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,080
or find any connection.

318
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
And these numbers.

319
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,720
What does 25 really mean?

320
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,900
12 can't be a coincidence either.

321
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,320
What I've lost is

322
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,120
my memories from before I was 12.

323
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,300
So is this number 12

324
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,280
related to my memory loss?

325
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,220
I think you're carrying too much mental burden.

326
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,020
Don't see yourself as an accomplice to evil.

327
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
In my eyes,

328
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,480
you're also a victim.

329
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,340
If you really blame yourself,

330
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,050
You should pull yourself together now

331
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,840
and catch that fox

332
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,400
and those rats and whatever else

333
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,860
and bring them to justice.

334
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,040
As for those numbers,

335
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,560
there's no pattern yet.

336
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,810
Sometimes it's age,

337
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,400
sometimes jersey numbers,

338
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,760
and sometimes timestamps.

339
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,020
No matter what this fox

340
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,680
is really after,

341
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,120
once we catch the person,

342
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,580
we'll naturally find out.

343
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,520
Let's go.

344
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,020
Let's head back early.

345
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,570
Alright, get some rest.

346
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,040
You can't even seize the opportunities given to you.

347
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,840
You're still the same as before,

348
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,160
so boring.

349
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,920
A fake is just a fake.

350
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,840
Even if you kill me,

351
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,520
you fake fox,

352
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,380
you'll never become the real one.

353
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,000
It is you after all.

354
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So easy to trick.

355
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,640
I remember when you used to fight back,

356
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,240
weren't you quite decisive?

357
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,730
I was just thinking,

358
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,000
no matter how convincing your act is,

359
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,800
the insecurity and jealousy in your bones

360
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,930
can never be hidden.

361
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,040
You couldn't beat me before.

362
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,240
Don't even think about it in the future.

363
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,920
Chi Xia.

364
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,359
Chi Xia.

365
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,839
Are you okay?

366
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,640
Quick, go after it.

367
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,359
It's a fox.

368
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,120
Secretly doing business with Tu Guolin behind my back.

369
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,780
I really underestimated you.

370
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,400
I suspect I've actually killed someone before.

371
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,600
Whether you resent it

372
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,800
or hate it,

373
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,840
pull it out with your own hands.

374
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,520
Don't move!

375
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,560
Police!

376
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,090
Get down!

377
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,360
That old friend of yours at the police station

378
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,720
has something I want.

379
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,280
What to do

380
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,360
Is that clear?

381
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,960
Chi Xiao, Wang Yunhan

382
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,640
