1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya.

2
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,640
Come on, tell me

3
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,970
what do you really want?

4
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,540
I want Pei Xi to disappear.

5
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,280
He shouldn't exist in this world.

6
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,280
His autism is the best proof.

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,760
You know what this is?

8
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,600
This is karma.

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,800
You've gone to great lengths

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,000
to raise a son who can't even speak properly.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,280
Do you really expect him

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,360
to inherit your business when he grows up?

13
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,920
I want you to do it today.

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,560
How can you say such inhuman things?

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,160
Peixi is my own son.

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,520
What?

17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,600
You can't bear it?

18
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,440
What about all the suffering I've endured over these years?

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,770
How could you bear that?

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,720
Dad.

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,240
Xixi.

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,120
Don't kill me.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,720
It's okay.

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,520
Dad is here.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,080
Don't kill me.

26
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,720
Pei Xinlu.

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,080
This is what you and Zhou Wanrou owe me.

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,800
It's the retribution you deserve.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,960
You can't escape.

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,080
Don't move.

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,160
Dad, don't kill me.

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,200
Look at him.

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,479
He's suffering too.

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,720
Help him.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
I'll be good.

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,440
Don't kill me.

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,640
It's okay.

38
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,120
Dad, don't kill me.

39
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,180
Dad won't hurt you.

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't kill me.

41
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,920
Xixi.

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,479
Don't move.

43
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,000
Dad.

44
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,600
Xixi.

45
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,960
Look at this.

46
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,360
The kinship index between Zheng Lanshu and the bones matches.

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,320
We can confirm

48
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,160
the deceased is Zhou Wanrou.

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
The investigation at Zhou Wanrou's home is still ongoing.

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,420
We can't determine yet if it's the primary crime scene.

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,520
How's the investigation going?

52
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,079
We checked Zhou Wanrou's home

53
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,440
for recent utility usage.

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,900
For the past three months,

55
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,000
consumption has been extremely low.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,040
Almost zero for the past two weeks.

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
According to neighbors,

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,880
for the past six months,

59
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,320
the couple argued frequently.

60
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,680
Their relationship seemed troubled.

61
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,480
However,

62
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,280
during these three months,

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,640
they haven't heard any noise.

64
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,840
This matches the estimated time of death.

65
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,720
About the hydrofluoric acid situation,

66
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,280
it's really difficult to trace.

67
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,079
Because this substance

68
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,200
is a very common chemical product.

69
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,960
Plus, with advanced information technology nowadays,

70
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,620
even if the killer has no chemistry background,

71
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,520
they could easily look it up online

72
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,050
and figure out how to use it.

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,960
So now

74
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
we should focus

75
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,840
on Pei Xinlu.

76
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,160
I've been checking surveillance footage all day.

77
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,040
Just got back in time for your meeting.

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,680
What's this about dropping the case?

79
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,840
The victim isn't Zhou Wanrou.

80
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,160
Do you have any new suspects?

81
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,120
No, wait.

82
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,120
The DNA comparison results are already in.

83
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,380
It confirms the deceased is Zhou Wanrou.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
What?

85
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,700
Why are you backtracking now?

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,820
Dead for three months.

87
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,720
How is that possible?

88
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,680
The surveillance footage shows it was two months ago.

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,360
Zhou Wanrong went to the police station to withdraw the case herself.

90
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,600
That was definitely Zhou Wanrong.

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,329
I've watched it several times.

92
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,840
Thank you.

93
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,480
Officer,

94
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,160
hello.

95
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,960
We're here to withdraw our case.

96
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,760
We called about it this morning.

97
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,960
You're Zhou Wanrong, right?

98
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,600
Yes.

99
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,960
Where is she?

100
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,680
That's me.

101
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,640
Is this you?

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,370
Yes, it's me.

103
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,200
Glasses.

104
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,880
What's your mother's name?

105
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,760
Zheng Lanshu.

106
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,440
[Signature: Ji]

107
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,560
When is your mother's date of birth?

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,080
June 30, 1955.

109
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,600
But my mom tells everyone it's May 11.

110
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,680
Elderly people prefer using the lunar calendar.

111
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,940
But her ID shows the solar calendar date.

112
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,200
Xiao Li,

113
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,260
make a copy of this.

114
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,159
Follow this template

115
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
to write a case withdrawal application

116
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,159
and just sign it.

117
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,159
Is the elderly person in poor health?

118
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:47,720
Yes,

119
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,140
Alzheimer's disease.

120
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,170
She's had it for many years,

121
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,520
but it's gotten worse recently.

122
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,400
When the elderly woman came to file a report this morning,

123
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,800
I felt something was off.

124
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,280
She could accurately state her daughter's

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,720
name and ID number,

126
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,280
but couldn't remember her own name and address.

127
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,760
I had to use Zhou Wanrou's household registration information

128
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,490
to identify the elderly woman.

129
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,920
By the time I brought the DNA collection kit,

130
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,120
she had already left.

131
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,640
I could only call Zhou Wanrou's number directly.

132
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,280
I'm really sorry for the trouble.

133
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,520
I've been using that phone number all along.

134
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,400
So when I got the call,

135
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
my wife and I rushed over immediately.

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
Once we're done here,

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,680
I need to hurry with my wife to find the old lady.

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,080
Has the elderly woman returned home yet?

139
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,880
No.

140
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,440
We'll do our best to find her.

141
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,480
If we can't find her,

142
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,360
we'll have to trouble you officers again.

143
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,620
You should hurry then.

144
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,920
Okay.

145
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,120
Go quickly to find her.

146
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,580
Come back if you need help.

147
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Thank you for your help.

148
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,720
Next person.

149
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,000
Right?

150
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,240
I wasn't wrong, was I?

151
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,480
Look at the time again.

152
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,610
Zhou Wanrou is clearly alive and well.

153
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,760
My goodness.

154
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,080
A woman who's been dead for three months

155
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,760
actually appeared in broad daylight

156
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,920
on the police station's security footage.

157
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,450
This is like seeing a ghost.

158
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,080
Where did we make a mistake in our investigation?

159
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,880
We extracted the same DNA from Zhou Wanrou's home.

160
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,480
The deceased is definitely Zhou Wanrou.

161
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
There's no mistake.

162
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,400
I've carefully reviewed Zhou Wanrou's family registration information.

163
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,160
She doesn't have a twin sister either.

164
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,290
According to this registration form,

165
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,480
the reason for withdrawing the missing person case

166
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,240
is because her mother, Zheng Lanshu, has Alzheimer's disease.

167
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,480
Memory might be distorted

168
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,520
or confused.

169
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,440
This means that

170
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Zhou Wanrong was never actually missing.

171
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,640
So where was she for these three months?

172
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,240
Obviously, reality contradicts their story.

173
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,480
Could it be

174
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,460
this Zhou Wanrong is an impostor?

175
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,760
But that can't be right.

176
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,880
Her appearance and body type

177
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
are exactly the same.

178
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,890
And she has her ID card with her.

179
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,840
Could Lao Ning have made a mistake with the autopsy?

180
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,120
Go verify it again

181
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,440
and the others.

182
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,300
Stop guessing,

183
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,240
Curly.

184
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,960
Take the video back as evidence.

185
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,490
Once we find this Pei Xinlu,

186
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,250
the truth will be revealed.

187
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,280
Lu.

188
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,080
I'm

189
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,880
Sandangzi.

190
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,920
What is it?

191
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,000
It's actually nothing important.

192
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,930
It's just that these past few days,

193
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,020
I haven't been sleeping well.

194
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,960
Whenever I think about your son,

195
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,440
I feel terrible inside.

196
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,080
Poor Xixi,

197
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,420
he didn't even have a proper funeral.

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,860
What does this have to do with you?

199
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,040
How can it not?

200
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,660
We've been neighbors,

201
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,840
living across from each other for all these years.

202
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,240
That night when I was coming back from Mr. Wang's

203
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,040
I ran into you.

204
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
I saw everything

205
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,200
that happened.

206
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,159
They say even tigers don't eat their cubs,

207
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,840
but you're truly ruthless.

208
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,900
You're more poisonous than arsenic.

209
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,880
Let me tell you,

210
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,440
stop spreading these damn lies.

211
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,280
Brother.

212
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,460
I've been eyeing an apartment downtown.

213
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,210
Let's go check it out sometime.

214
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,880
Where's my purse?

215
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,320
Didn't you just buy one last week?

216
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,560
I want another one.

217
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,120
I'll buy it for you.

218
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,080
Come here,

219
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,880
give me a kiss.

220
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,720
Who's there?

221
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,600
Mr. Pei.

222
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,440
It's Mr. Pei.

223
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,300
What's he doing here on a weekend?

224
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,800
You go ahead.

225
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
I'll check it out.

226
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Mr. Pei.

227
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,050
You startled me.

228
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Why come to the office on a Saturday?

229
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm here to work overtime.

230
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,840
What are you-

231
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,600
Okay, okay.

232
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,080
It's fine, you should go home now.

233
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,880
Mr. Pei.

234
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,240
Here,

235
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,520
officers,

236
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,780
have some water first.

237
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,680
This Xinrou Company

238
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,920
was founded by Mr. Pei and his wife as partners.

239
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,240
But Mr. Pei rarely comes to the office.

240
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,760
He's always out seeking business.

241
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,920
I haven't seen him for 2 weeks.

242
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,600
You haven't seen him for 2 weeks

243
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,930
and you didn't think something was wrong?

244
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,680
Officer,

245
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm just an employee.

246
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,440
I just go where I'm needed.

247
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,760
If the boss doesn't respond to messages,

248
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
am I supposed to go to his house and demand

249
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,890
why he's not coming to work?

250
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,040
Where does Pei Xinlu usually go?

251
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,520
He told me

252
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,200
he sometimes goes back to his hometown.

253
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,720
He also mentioned that the signal there isn't good.

254
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,580
Maybe you could ask around there.

255
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,440
Alright,

256
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,600
that's all for today.

257
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,040
Okay.

258
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Let's go now.

259
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,000
Who is she?

260
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,480
Ji Shiqing.

261
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,040
What's her position?

262
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,440
Just a regular employee.

263
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,600
Why?

264
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,000
Nothing.

265
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,570
She's quite pretty.

266
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,400
Captain Luo

267
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,120
Chi Xia

268
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,880
Don't you think there's something off about Ji Shiqing?

269
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,200
What issues do you see?

270
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,280
I think

271
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,480
Let me explain.

272
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,080
Well...

273
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,280
I used that method you taught me before.

274
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,000
When I was at the police station,

275
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,040
I carefully studied

276
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,800
the fake Zhou Wanrou's walking posture.

277
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,930
She walks like this,

278
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,570
and Ji Shiqing walks exactly the same way.

279
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,440
So what do you think,

280
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,000
could it be that

281
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,920
Ji Shiqing was impersonating Zhou Wanrou?

282
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,960
Your effort is commendable,

283
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,160
but I can't agree with your conclusion.

284
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
Do you think they look alike?

285
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,040
Do they?

286
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,080
Not really.

287
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,920
So I was at least half right,

288
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,640
wasn't I?

289
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,240
Good effort,

290
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,280
but enough joking around.

291
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,360
Officer Cao Bin sent me a message.

292
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,000
He said they went to find Pei Xi's

293
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,400
extracurricular teacher

294
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,000
and her attending physician.

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,040
Their conclusions were consistent:

296
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,480
she hasn't been seen for three months.

297
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,200
Here's what I'm thinking.

298
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,840
Qu Bai.

299
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,040
You know him?

300
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,120
Thanks for your help with this matter.

301
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,360
That case with Sun Xiangbo's company,

302
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,880
he assisted with the investigation.

303
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,240
The person talking with Qu Bai

304
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,720
is a businessman with prior economic crimes.

305
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,840
We helped arrest him.

306
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,880
He's currently on probation.

307
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,280
I'll head over first.

308
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,810
Goodbye.

309
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,050
Mr. Qu, you seem quite busy with business.

310
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,680
Just making a living.

311
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,880
To make money,

312
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,160
you deal with all kinds of people,

313
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,800
right?

314
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,640
Making money isn't easy.

315
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,000
Sometimes we have no choice.

316
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,120
In this way, we're similar to you police officers.

317
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,880
However,

318
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,840
I do it for business,

319
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,120
while you do it to solve cases.

320
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,240
We both have to deal with all sorts of people.

321
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,040
In that case,

322
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,360
Mr. Qu, perhaps you should try to avoid dealing with police.

323
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,240
That's not necessary.

324
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,080
The police serve the people.

325
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,060
We should maintain regular contact.

326
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,680
Well, officers,

327
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,440
I apologize,

328
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,600
I have a client meeting soon,

329
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,520
so I must go now.

330
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,000
If you need anything in the future,

331
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,930
just let me know.

332
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,640
As a concerned citizen,

333
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,770
it's my duty to help.

334
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,440
Quite busy.

335
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,040
Luo.

336
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,760
Captain Luo.

337
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,240
What about Zhang Chao and Ji Shiqing?

338
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,100
Are we still investigating them?

339
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
Follow up on your own leads.

340
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,940
Come with me to Pei Xinlu's house.

341
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,520
What for?

342
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,080
I haven't eaten yet.

343
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,040
How many times do I have to tell you?

344
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,900
Keep a low profile at the company.

345
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,680
We don't even know what's going on with Pei Xinlu yet.

346
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,080
Now the police are here.

347
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,200
If our little operation

348
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,480
gets discovered,

349
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,560
I don't need to spell out the consequences.

350
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,440
I know.

351
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,800
I'm not a child.

352
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,770
From the looks of it,

353
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,720
two weeks ago,

354
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,080
he was planning to flee.

355
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,800
That's nothing.

356
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,640
I noticed three months ago

357
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,500
that something was off about him.

358
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,800
But whatever happened to him,

359
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,360
I just think the police are too slow.

360
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,360
I hope they find him today.

361
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,490
What do you mean?

362
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,640
What else do you know?

363
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,120
Mom.

364
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,800
Remember.

365
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,360
I

366
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,480
will catch the killer.

367
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,580
What are you doing?

368
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm

369
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,080
driving.

370
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,480
Was I talking in my sleep?

371
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,040
Yes.

372
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,320
You said you must catch Pei Xinlu.

373
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,740
Make a big achievement

374
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,050
so Chief Chang can personally pin a red flower on you.

375
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,520
Is that really a thing?

376
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,240
When I successfully caught Zhou Yanchen before,

377
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,400
why didn't I get one?

378
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,400
This is an annual project,

379
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,100
a special year-end bonus.

380
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,800
Do you think

381
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,280
in this case,

382
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,050
the killer will leave special numbers again?

383
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,600
12 and 25.

384
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,640
I've been watching for them since the case began,

385
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,370
but they haven't appeared yet.

386
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,800
However, if they do appear,

387
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,930
it definitely won't be a coincidence.

388
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,240
[Dong E-80090]

389
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,100
[Dong E-80090]

390
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,640
Hello, ma'am.

391
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,000
Hello.

392
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,680
We're from Dongzhou Police Department.

393
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
We'd like to ask you some questions.

394
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,000
Honey!

395
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,720
Stop eating.

396
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,520
Come out here.

397
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,880
Who is it?

398
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,360
Is it Xinlu coming home?

399
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,240
Hello, sir and ma'am.

400
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,000
We're from Dongzhou Police Department.

401
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,880
We'd like to talk to you

402
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,640
about Pei Xinlu.

403
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,800
Oh, you're from the police?

404
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,600
You...

405
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,640
Is there something wrong with Xinlu?

406
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,560
He's not in any trouble.

407
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,600
It's mainly about some business matters.

408
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,000
Do you know where he is?

409
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,280
Isn't he always at his company?

410
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,800
My son is very busy.

411
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,600
He's only been home once in the past couple months.

412
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,440
Sorry to bother you then.

413
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,240
Take care.

414
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,460
You think the elderly couple is fine?

415
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,960
I don't think there's any issue for now.

416
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,760
Their front door was left wide open without any precaution.

417
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,520
When I was checking the laundry,

418
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,780
I didn't see any young person's clothes.

419
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,480
When his mother heard we were police,

420
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,320
she wasn't panicked,

421
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,280
just confused.

422
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,600
His father's reaction was quite natural too.

423
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,480
It means Pei Xinlu really isn't here.

424
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,740
And the elderly couple

425
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,170
probably know nothing about all this.

426
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,600
We're approaching our stop.

427
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,330
The intelligence point at the village entrance.

428
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,000
It's been a while since I've seen

429
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,200
that Pei boy.

430
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,500
Young comrade.

431
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,560
Did he get into debt?

432
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,880
I could tell he was shady from the start.

433
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,120
How else could he make so much money?

434
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,160
That's true.

435
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,280
People who make big money in business

436
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,360
have dark hearts.

437
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,800
Didn't Sandangzi mention the other day?

438
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,680
Pei Xinlu was cruel even

439
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,120
to his own son.

440
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,120
Yes.

441
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,960
You believe Sandangzi?

442
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,320
He's just a con man selling health products.

443
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,520
Sir.

444
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,880
Where does Sandangzi live?

445
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,080
In that old house behind the Pei family's place.

446
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,520
Right.

447
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,880
Who's there?

448
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,900
You're Sandangzi, right?

449
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,040
I'm from Dongzhou Police Department.

450
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,770
Need to ask you some questions.

451
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,800
Police.

452
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
You seem familiar with the process.

453
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:13,920
No,

454
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,640
officer,

455
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,119
I didn't do anything.

456
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,520
Then why are you running?

457
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,680
Not talking, huh?

458
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,640
I just sold health supplements to old men in the village.

459
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,520
Although they're not really effective.

460
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,200
But...

461
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,440
But I have certification.

462
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,960
It's a legitimate business.

463
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,800
You're not finished.

464
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,280
I'll pay compensation.

465
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,960
See if there's anything valuable at home.

466
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,840
Can you just confiscate that instead?

467
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,080
I heard from the villagers

468
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,320
that you saw Pei Xinlu kill his own son.

469
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,120
Tell me in detail.

470
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,000
What happened?

471
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,640
About that...

472
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,280
Officer,

473
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,760
I apologize.

474
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,520
I was just

475
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
drunk and talking nonsense.

476
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,720
That's not illegal, right?

477
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,920
Tell me the truth.

478
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,440
Actually, Pei Xi

479
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,420
fell to his death by accident.

480
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,290
How could Pei Xinlu possibly kill his own son?

481
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,800
It was Pei Xinlu who pushed Xixi down from upstairs.

482
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,840
Then Pei Xi fell right onto that rebar frame.

483
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,780
He was impaled instantly.

484
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,800
Are you sure that woman is Zhou Wanrou?

485
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,480
What's wrong?

486
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,240
What's the issue?

487
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,600
He couldn't even make eye contact with the police.

488
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,800
He seemed a bit nervous.

489
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,560
Anxious.

490
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,360
Doesn't look at all like

491
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,560
a housewife who takes care of children.
