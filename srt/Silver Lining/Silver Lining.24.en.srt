1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya.

2
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,320
It's okay.

3
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,200
Don't stress.

4
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,319
Anyway,

5
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,690
if their purpose for doing this

6
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,640
is to trigger your memory recovery,

7
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,170
they must have other plans.

8
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,000
No matter what happens in the future,

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,520
no matter what the truth is,

10
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,320
don't worry,

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,410
I'm here for you.

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,240
And all the guys in our team

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,080
will bear this together.

14
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,600
Thank you,

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,360
Captain Luo.

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,479
Captain Luo,

17
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,210
Officer Chi.

18
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,009
Officer Chi.

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,240
Are you both

20
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,039
all right?

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,440
I couldn't reach you by phone.

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,120
I came here

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,360
and just found out you're in the hospital too.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,720
Why aren't you chasing after Tu Guolin?

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,960
What are you doing at the hospital?

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Something happened.

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,680
Tu Guolin was poisoned in an assassination attempt.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,960
Fortunately, we got there in time.

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,560
He's now

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,759
being treated in the operating room.

31
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,600
Who did it?

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,720
Did you catch them?

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,759
No idea at all.

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,380
Tu Guolin was hiding in a residential house.

35
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,760
The guy who brought him food

36
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,200
He was most likely being used.

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,960
He didn't even know

38
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,680
how they switched his food.

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,039
Stop investigating.

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,759
You won't find anything.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,800
When you found Tu Guolin,

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,080
did you make any other discoveries?

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,240
Everything he brought

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,280
was just ordinary daily necessities.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,410
If I had to point out anything unusual,

46
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,680
we found

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,400
a partially carved

48
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,200
wooden cat in his briefcase.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,460
There was also a small carving knife inside.

50
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,650
A carving knife?

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,160
What kind of carving knife?

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,560
Yes.

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
The evidence is here.

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,600
Take a look.

55
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,890
It's a U-shaped carving knife.

56
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,400
Fortunately, he was brought in on time.

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,200
The patient is out of danger now.

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,640
However, the toxins in his blood

59
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,960
will take some time to be completely eliminated.

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,720
He'll probably remain unconscious for quite a while.

61
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,320
Did you hear me?

62
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,960
Chi Xia,

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,690
even if you go now, you won't be able to wake him up.

64
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,480
That's right.

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
Only these calluses and scars

66
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,090
come from holding a carving knife for a long time.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
How does this relate

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,329
to what happened to him?

69
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,600
Captain Luo,

70
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,640
I strongly suspect

71
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,920
he's the real murderer who killed my parents.

72
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay.

73
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,200
I'll go back and pack right away.

74
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,360
I'll make some calls.

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,160
We'll transfer Tu Guolin tonight

76
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,890
to Dongzhou Central Hospital.

77
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,780
What are you doing?

78
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,520
You're awake.

79
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,560
Why didn't you wake me up?

80
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,760
You were sleeping so soundly.

81
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,640
And I didn't know if you'd be grumpy when woken up.

82
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,440
If I woke you up

83
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,500
and made you angry,

84
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,560
what if you complained to Director Chang that I was bullying team members?

85
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,320
Well, I'm awake now anyway.

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Then I apologize.

87
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,970
How will you make it up to me?

88
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,850
When I was passing by here earlier,

89
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,680
I saw those seagulls.

90
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,500
My mind suddenly went blank for a moment.

91
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,340
I remembered the times

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,560
when I went to my countryside home.

93
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,720
My sister and I would feed pigeons in the evening.

94
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,680
Not seagulls.

95
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
Back then,

96
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,860
the flock of pigeons would circle in the sky.

97
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
When the sunset glow shined on them.

98
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
It was beautiful.

99
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,570
Too bad I'll never see it again.

100
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,850
You're thinking about your sister again.

101
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,440
Luo Xun

102
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,370
Why are you here?

103
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,480
Master.

104
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,240
I've seen the autopsy report.

105
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,320
The way my sister died

106
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,640
matches the previous serial killings

107
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,360
exactly how those victims died.

108
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,890
And the timing lines up too.

109
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,920
I think we should investigate them together.

110
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,120
Why are you closing the case now?

111
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,320
Come, let me tell you.

112
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,520
Listen to me.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,130
The puncture wounds on Xiaofei's body

114
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,520
compared to the other victims

115
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,760
have many inconsistencies.

116
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,240
It looks more like

117
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,400
a copycat crime.

118
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,140
I understand how you feel,

119
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,960
but don't be too anxious.

120
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,760
Master,

121
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,240
are you just trying to avoid suspicion?

122
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,770
All the victims are young, attractive women.

123
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,360
The distribution of puncture wounds

124
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,040
also has distinctive patterns.

125
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,680
Especially in areas with sexual connotations,

126
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,810
the punctures are more concentrated.

127
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,480
But none of these victims

128
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,120
were sexually assaulted.

129
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,360
Can I reasonably suspect that

130
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
the killer is someone with

131
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,800
sexual dysfunction and a puncture fetish?

132
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Even if it's a copycat crime,

133
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,080
as long as the criminal characteristics are similar,

134
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,120
he must be the one.

135
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,520
Why can't we intensify the investigation?

136
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,240
Enough.

137
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,360
Am I in charge of this case or are you?

138
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,960
Do I need you to remind me?

139
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,080
The case I assigned you,

140
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,340
have you solved it yet?

141
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,920
Just focus on your own work

142
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,980
and that's enough.

143
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
No.

144
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
You've been acting strange lately.

145
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,050
Your emotions have never been this unstable before.

146
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,320
Master.

147
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,880
She also calls you Master.

148
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,920
Precisely because she calls me Master,

149
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,000
don't you think

150
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,020
I feel heartbroken about what she went through?

151
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,450
I was thinking at that time.

152
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,880
No matter what,

153
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,850
I had to investigate it myself.

154
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,560
That night,

155
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,000
If it wasn't because of me

156
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,200
leaving her alone in the office,

157
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,160
she wouldn't have gone out

158
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,340
to investigate a lead by herself.

159
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,120
In the end,

160
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,720
I just can't get over this guilt.

161
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,340
But you still figured it out, didn't you?

162
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,760
Yes.

163
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
I did.

164
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,760
I never really understood it.

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,930
I couldn't let it go for a long time.

166
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,840
I couldn't forgive him either.

167
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,680
But recently,

168
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,900
I've started to accept it gradually.

169
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,680
The bond between father and son is deep.

170
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,409
My mentor felt that way about his son Zheng Yanbo.

171
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,080
I feel the same about my sister Luo Lingfei.

172
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,280
Even you,

173
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,400
Chi Xia,

174
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,680
You're so determined about your adoptive parents' case.

175
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,720
Isn't it because

176
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,890
family bonds can't be severed?

177
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,800
We're all the same.

178
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,960
My mentor,

179
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,370
He was wrong, plain and simple.

180
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,520
For this,

181
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,530
the law will punish him.

182
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,690
Morality will condemn him.

183
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,080
As someone

184
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,620
who was a police officer with high moral standards,

185
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,440
the moment he chose to cover up a crime,

186
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,659
I don't believe he wasn't tormented inside.

187
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,570
I won't forgive him.

188
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
But I won't hate him anymore either.

189
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,640
Captain Luo.

190
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,850
Don't force yourself to face the past.

191
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,440
Even when a wound heals,

192
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,610
the scar still needs time to fade, doesn't it?

193
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,300
Since it's not the right time,

194
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,680
just wait until

195
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
the day you can talk about it calmly.

196
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,500
Whenever you want to talk,

197
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,500
I'll be here to listen.

198
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,610
You've forgiven yourself.

199
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,360
That's good.

200
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,320
Alright.

201
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,920
Let's move on.

202
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,560
Yu Ji's case.

203
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,480
You two really had me worried.

204
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,000
What did you promise me on the phone?

205
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,200
Chief Chang.

206
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,640
Didn't I bring this person back safely?

207
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,480
Yes.

208
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,200
Chief Chang,

209
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,640
we had a close call this time,

210
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,480
but next time when we're better prepared,

211
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,360
we'll definitely succeed.

212
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,160
Next time?

213
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
If there's a next time,

214
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,080
I'll transfer both of you to the PR department.

215
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,960
Alright.

216
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,290
Let's get down to business.

217
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,480
What's the latest

218
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,200
on Yu Ji's case?

219
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,560
Everything that needs to be transferred

220
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,680
to the prosecutor's office

221
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,140
is proceeding as planned.

222
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,880
The local suspects involved in the fighting

223
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
and assaulting officers are being arrested.

224
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,400
The explosion analysis at Bailong Resort

225
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,560
has been completed.

226
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,240
There are no leads to follow.

227
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,200
However,

228
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,000
fortunately it happened in an abandoned building

229
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,400
deep in the mountains.

230
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,920
No civilians were injured.

231
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,320
So the negative impact

232
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,280
hasn't spread.

233
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,480
But Chief Chang,

234
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,360
I think these people

235
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,840
still need to be investigated.

236
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,800
If next time they set something off in a crowded area,

237
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,060
I won't even make it to the PR department.

238
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,000
The Fox has gone into hiding again.

239
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,360
Taking all her people with her

240
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,920
as if they've vanished into thin air.

241
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,120
But that's okay.

242
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,960
As long as she appears,

243
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,200
she'll leave traces.

244
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,240
Sooner or later,

245
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,480
we'll catch her.

246
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,120
Comrades,

247
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,360
I won't give you that motivational speech

248
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,720
about staying extra vigilant.

249
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,120
I know

250
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,480
you're all working very hard.

251
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,280
But

252
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,280
you can't let your guard down,

253
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,080
nor can you relax your vigilance.

254
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,160
Is that clear?

255
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,520
Absolutely clear.

256
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,840
Good.

257
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,100
The New Year is coming.

258
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,040
There are no major cases at the moment.

259
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,760
Everyone go home and get some rest

260
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,800
to recharge.

261
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,380
I'm waiting for you all

262
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,400
to bring me good news about winning this tough battle.

263
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,480
Yes.

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,800
Officer Chi.

265
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,520
Officer Chi.

266
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,480
I came specifically to tell you

267
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,120
that our shop

268
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,840
will be open until the 29th of the lunar month

269
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,320
and will reopen on the 7th.

270
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,740
Mr. Qu specifically asked me to give this to you.

271
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,000
Where has Qu Bai been lately?

272
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,040
I can't reach him.

273
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,760
Mr. Qu went to the mountains to research a project.

274
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,490
The signal might be poor there.

275
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,680
Alright.

276
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,760
Thank you.

277
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,560
I'm leaving.

278
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,800
Bye-bye.

279
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,920
Mr. K.

280
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
The clouds are quite thick tonight.

281
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,760
I could see a few stars just now,

282
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,240
but now I can't see any.

283
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,420
Starlight indeed cannot penetrate the clouds,

284
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,700
just like everyone in the company

285
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
must follow your orders.

286
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,640
Are you saying I'm

287
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
all-powerful?

288
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I'm sorry, Mr. K.

289
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
I know I was wrong.

290
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,080
I'll follow all your orders.

291
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,160
Tell me.

292
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,680
Does the law only protect victims?

293
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,880
What do you mean?

294
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,160
Go now.

295
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,420
I won't disappoint you again.

296
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
It doesn't matter if I'm disappointed.

297
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,200
He's the one

298
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,540
who's truly disappointed in you.

299
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,330
K is waiting for you.

300
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,800
Coming.

301
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,730
You're always so reliable.

302
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
All these years,

303
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,650
you've never disappointed me.

304
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,520
You're too kind.

305
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,460
I'm just doing my best.

306
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,360
You asked me to come here.

307
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,420
Is there another assignment?

308
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,330
Don't always talk about assignments.

309
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,080
In your eyes,

310
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,130
am I really that cold-hearted?

311
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,600
Not at all.

312
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,080
I called you back from China this time

313
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,960
because I want you to spend New Year with me.

314
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,200
Those who can chat with me about everyday matters,

315
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,360
besides those two,

316
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,740
there's only you left.

317
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,040
Drink slowly.

318
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,540
I just added hot water.

319
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,400
If you drink tea too hastily,

320
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,540
burning your tongue is a minor issue,

321
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,420
but if you swallow such hot water,

322
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,290
it could damage your internal organs.

323
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,400
Indeed, some things

324
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,700
are better learned

325
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
from others

326
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,610
than through self-discovery.

327
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,200
Do you still remember

328
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,360
everything I taught you?

329
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
I wouldn't dare forget for a moment.

330
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,860
I'm well aware of what Chi Xiao is doing on the mainland.

331
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,370
Whether it succeeds or fails, I'll make my own judgment.

332
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,640
But given your position,

333
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,490
there are some matters you should be involved in,

334
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,600
and others you should stay away from.

335
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,280
This is for the bigger picture.

336
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,540
Water has a boiling point.

337
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,200
People have principles.

338
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,280
Don't cross the line.

339
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,000
I understand.

340
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,440
If you don't drink it soon,

341
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
it will get cold.

342
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,620
Almost.

343
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,890
In the year I turned twelve.

344
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,120
What really happened?

345
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,440
In this world,

346
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,840
it's all about who dares

347
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,480
to go further than others.

348
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,040
But my parents,

349
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,640
they underestimated me.

350
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,320
As long as I can catch the killer with my own hands,

351
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,720
I'm willing to die for it.

352
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,320
Ready?

353
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,360
Let's try.

354
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,080
What happened to your hand?

355
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,520
I've fantasized countless times

356
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,650
about dying together with him.

357
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,700
Trying to save my life now,

358
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,060
isn't it a bit too late?

359
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
The victim's body contains nerve-paralyzing drugs.

360
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,060
If my speculation is correct,

361
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
this should be a premeditated murder.
