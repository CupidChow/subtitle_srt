1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya.

2
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,520
Should I call you Qu Bai now

3
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,240
or what?

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,460
After the Riverbank Case on the 14th,

5
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,660
I finally realized

6
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,960
that you were the boy from her memories.

7
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,560
Captain Luo,

8
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,400
from the first time

9
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,320
we met, I knew

10
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,760
no matter how well I hid,

11
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,560
I would eventually meet you at the end of the road.

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,320
So you're also part of Old K's criminal organization.

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,650
Helping us solve cases,

14
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,520
helping us catch criminals,

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
even saving my life at Yu Ji's place.

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,410
It was all part of your plan, wasn't it?

17
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,539
Right and wrong exist in one's heart.

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,039
I have nothing to explain.

19
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,200
Fine.

20
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,690
Let's put aside what happened before.

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,010
But you and Chi Xia are on different paths now.

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,520
Have you decided what to choose?

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,360
Sometimes choices aren't ours to make.

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,400
But I will keep my distance from Chi Xia.

25
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,300
However, Captain Luo should understand

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,780
that I'm doing this

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,120
not because I fear you.

28
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,480
Qu Bai,

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,360
listen carefully.

30
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,720
What I'm telling you now

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,200
isn't for my sake.

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,079
It's for Chi Xia.

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,000
You're the most important person in her memories.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,079
I don't want your wrong choices

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,880
to cause her such pain

36
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,079
and suffering again.

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,920
Whether you choose right or wrong,

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,050
it's your decision.

39
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,340
Though I don't have evidence now,

40
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,360
but if in the past

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,850
or in the future,

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,180
you commit a crime,

43
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,900
I will catch you with my own hands.

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,840
These are Chixia's favorite

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,320
lychee candy recipe.

46
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,320
Please take good care of her for me.

47
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,520
This is a shared memory between you two.

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
It has nothing to do with me.

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,260
I won't interfere.

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,120
She's my team member now.

51
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,940
I'll naturally take good care of her.

52
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,500
No need for your reminder.

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,420
Stay on the right path.

54
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,480
Here it comes.

55
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,240
Still at the crossroads.

56
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,050
I don't particularly like this scene.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,360
But I do like this scene.

58
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,240
can bring me.

59
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,000
Haven't you always wondered

60
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,810
why I insist on Chixia recovering her memory?

61
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,860
I've been keeping it from you.

62
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,800
But now

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,360
it's time to tell you.

64
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,640
Do you remember Zhou Nan?

65
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,680
That chemistry genius from the base.

66
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,280
I remember.

67
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,840
Seventeen years ago,

68
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,140
to break into the drug market,

69
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,640
I had Zhou Nan develop

70
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,440
a zombie drug with 92% purity.

71
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,920
But it was ruined by that

72
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,580
undercover cop named Fu Gang.

73
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,960
Fu Gang took the formula with him,

74
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,240
along with Zhou Nan and Chi Xia.

75
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,920
As for Zhou Nan,

76
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,720
he was killed by that idiot who worked for us.

77
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,920
You remember, right?

78
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,040
I do.

79
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,370
Before Fu Gang died,

80
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,000
I deduced from what he deliberately avoided saying

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,760
that he put the paper formula in a coded box

82
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,480
and hid it somewhere.

83
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,720
And Chi Xia, who successfully escaped,

84
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,280
became the only person

85
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,300
who might know about the formula.

86
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,760
It took me a full ten years to find her.

87
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,080
But

88
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,160
her adoptive father Lin Yushan, a psychology professor,

89
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,600
had actually sealed

90
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,440
all her memories

91
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,440
through hypnosis.

92
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,640
But where there's a will, there's a way.

93
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,120
I had someone approach Lin Yushan as a student

94
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,890
and discovered that

95
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,180
in Chi Xia's original therapy notebook,

96
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,650
there were some numbers written down.

97
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,380
I remember a sequence of numbers.

98
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,420
It includes but is not limited to these numbers,

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
besides 12,

100
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,840
14, and 25.

101
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,360
There are also 1 and 2.

102
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,960
Are you saying

103
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,170
that the numbers appearing in previous cases

104
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,400
have appeared in your memory before?

105
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,460
Not just appeared,

106
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,960
but left a very deep impression.

107
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,640
This was told to me by Fu Gang,

108
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,560
a police officer who went undercover

109
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,640
at the Lawa Zhai criminal base years ago.

110
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,770
I can't run anymore.

111
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,570
I can't run anymore.

112
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,680
Calm down.

113
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,440
I'm begging you.

114
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,640
If you want to escape,

115
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,880
don't take me with you.

116
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,760
Shut up.

117
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,320
Chi Xia.

118
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,400
Uncle will tell you a series of numbers.

119
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,930
They represent a location.

120
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,600
25.

121
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,880
14.

122
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,159
12.

123
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,159
14.

124
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,880
25.

125
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,920
25.

126
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,400
12.

127
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,159
Remember their order.

128
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Give it to Jinzi.

129
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,380
This series of numbers

130
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,640
[Computer wallpaper 25]

131
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,970
represents a location.

132
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,400
There's a formula for a high-purity drug hidden there,

133
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,760
methcathinone.

134
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,880
Also, Fu Gang has been undercover for years

135
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,480
and has gathered partial evidence of Old K's crimes.

136
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,540
Unfortunately...

137
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,120
Knowing the numbers is useless.

138
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,360
I have no idea how to decode them.

139
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,290
If I can get the complete sequence,

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,880
I can find where Fu Gang hid the formula.

141
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,520
Back then,

142
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,400
the Lin couple wanted to protect Chi Xia,

143
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,220
and refused to awaken her memories at all costs.

144
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,480
So,

145
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
you arranged hitmen

146
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,080
to make it look like an accident

147
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,539
and killed the Lin couple.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,840
Two years ago,

149
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,450
Chi Xia encountered a case of vigilante justice,

150
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,580
which caused her memories

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,260
to start resurfacing.

152
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,600
So you had Chi Xiao manipulate those killers

153
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,300
to take justice into their own hands.

154
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,640
Yes.

155
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,320
It was a heaven-sent opportunity.

156
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,760
The murderer Tu Guo'an

157
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,200
was sent back to Dongzhou under my orders.

158
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
Two years was enough time

159
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,840
for us to orchestrate several vigilante cases.

160
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,200
I guess.

161
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,080
These recent cases

162
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,920
have been constantly triggering my memory recovery

163
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
were actually planned by

164
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,720
Old K to retrieve the formula and criminal evidence

165
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,180
through targeted crimes.

166
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,480
[Methcathinone]

167
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,400
Now that it's banned domestically,

168
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,930
manufacturers will certainly move operations abroad.

169
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,000
For me, this

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,130
is the biggest business opportunity.

171
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,960
We can use this chance

172
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,810
to build a production base.

173
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,680
Our group only appears prosperous

174
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,940
but we're actually losing money.

175
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,180
If this continues,

176
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,040
we'll be at a dead end.

177
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,560
The Kotter Group

178
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,080
is very satisfied with our high-purity samples.

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,800
Last month,

180
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,760
I secured an order with them.

181
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,360
Now we just need the formula.

182
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,840
Once we get the formula,

183
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,040
we can immediately begin

184
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,560
mass production

185
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,290
and complete the delivery.

186
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,600
Is it that multinational Kotter Group?

187
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,520
Why such urgency?

188
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,600
What happens if

189
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
we can't deliver?

190
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,760
The Kotter Group

191
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,640
is not someone we can afford to offend.

192
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,440
But

193
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,210
let's take a gamble.

194
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,810
The delivery date is the 8th of next month.

195
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,680
If we deliver successfully,

196
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,440
our group

197
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,410
will get a new lease on life.

198
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,640
If we fail to deliver,

199
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,040
then I,

200
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,200
you,

201
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,400
all of us

202
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,380
will be completely finished.

203
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,760
Don't worry about the coded box,

204
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,760
but as for the location array...

205
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,320
I know

206
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,400
you and Chi Xia are close,

207
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,160
like siblings, right?

208
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,160
So

209
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,960
you need to pay attention

210
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,160
to what matters.

211
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,920
Don't worry.

212
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,880
Go now.

213
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,680
Give Mo Laoqi a message.

214
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,440
Okay.

215
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,760
Also,

216
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,320
Yang Zhiming's son, who has been my stand-in for all these years,

217
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,360
is coming back to China.

218
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,620
He's devoted so much time to the company.

219
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,740
It's about time

220
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,980
for father and son to reunite.

221
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,320
Well,

222
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,520
Zhiming is a smart man.

223
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
He knows what to do.

224
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,040
All right.

225
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,880
Actually, shortly after the fire incident

226
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,540
Mr. Chang mentioned something to me.

227
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,440
He said there was a foreign criminal organization

228
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,400
that had already infiltrated Dongzhou.

229
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,360
And it has caught the serious attention of the provincial department.

230
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,620
Combined with what you've told me today,

231
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,970
I think the current situation is extremely serious.

232
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,770
I'll relay this to Chang

233
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,170
so he can report it to the provincial department.

234
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,900
After you escaped from Lawazhai,

235
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,620
have you seen any gold?

236
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,040
After returning to the country,

237
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,320
I tried to find him,

238
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,520
but couldn't.

239
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,000
To be honest,

240
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,140
from the moment I escaped from Lawa Village,

241
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,720
I've been constantly on edge.

242
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,560
I was so afraid.

243
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,560
I was afraid they would find me

244
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,820
and take me back there.

245
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,580
Even though my parents adopted me later,

246
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,320
and were so good to me,

247
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I still couldn't fully trust them.

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,040
As time went on,

249
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,650
my mental state collapsed.

250
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,880
My parents felt sorry for me,

251
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,760
seeing that I couldn't even sleep well.

252
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,200
So during one psychological counseling session,

253
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
they used hypnosis

254
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,420
to block all my memories before the age of 12.

255
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,600
Captain Luo,

256
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,920
As a relative,

257
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,160
I'm requesting to recuse myself from my parents' case.

258
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,000
And my connection with the K Group

259
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,860
is complicated and difficult to explain right now.

260
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,520
So I'm earnestly asking you

261
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,690
to make sure the suspects are brought to justice.

262
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,400
Don't worry.

263
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,480
I'll pay close attention to your adoptive parents' case

264
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,340
and submit your recusal request.

265
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,360
However,

266
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,080
I'll also submit a request

267
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,760
to have you involved in the investigation.

268
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,800
Your knowledge about the K Group

269
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,960
would be extremely helpful for solving this case.

270
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,040
But,

271
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,300
I'll submit it,

272
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,760
and it's up to the leadership to decide.

273
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,330
Thank you, Captain Luo.

274
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,960
Do you have

275
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,340
any other impressions

276
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,560
of Comrade Fu Gang?

277
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
My impression of him is very strong.

278
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,680
When I arrived in Lawa Village at eight years old,

279
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,640
I met him.

280
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,920
Back then, I thought

281
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,040
he was no different

282
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,740
from the other criminals.

283
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,240
Thank you, Uncle Fu Gang.

284
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,730
But later I gradually realized

285
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,700
that he wasn't actually a cold-hearted person.

286
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,680
But how could someone from a criminal organization

287
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,240
have any humanity?

288
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,600
He would secretly help me

289
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,720
when I failed to pass the tests.

290
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,840
He privately pleaded with other instructors for me

291
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,640
to spare me from the painful hypnotic punishment.

292
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,890
Then what happened?

293
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,600
Later,

294
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,920
I got my own code name.

295
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,200
Fox.

296
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,360
But I don't know why after I left,

297
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,120
this code name was adopted by Chi Xiao.

298
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,000
Maybe that's why

299
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,120
whenever I hear the word 'Fox'

300
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,400
or see the fox symbol,

301
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,360
it feels so familiar.

302
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,320
You're not Fox.

303
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,560
You never were.

304
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,800
You never belonged with them.

305
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
Forget about their damn code names.

306
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,800
You're not like them.

307
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,880
He told me the same thing.

308
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,760
Maybe I was different from

309
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,640
the other children in the village.

310
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,120
Because I always wanted to escape.

311
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
So he thought there was still hope for me.

312
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,450
He thought I wasn't completely deranged.

313
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,980
That I wasn't fully brainwashed.

314
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,680
So...

315
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,920
When did you first realize

316
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,460
Comrade Fu Gang was a police officer?

317
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,700
Because he was always helping me,

318
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
so I started watching him secretly.

319
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,800
One time,

320
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,400
he went to steal documents from the chemistry lab.

321
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,840
I happened to be there too,

322
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,640
but he didn't notice me.

323
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,740
From that moment, I started thinking

324
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,810
that he might not be from Lawazhai,

325
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,360
that he might not be a bad person.

326
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,970
He had such a profound impact on me.

327
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,839
Actually, everyone in the group

328
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,140
had quite a complicated background.

329
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,819
But he treated everyone equally.

330
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,680
If we were on a mission together,

331
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,000
in life-or-death situations,

332
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,359
he would step forward

333
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,160
and risk his life to save others.

334
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,920
I once asked him why.

335
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,680
Why do you save them?

336
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,520
What?

337
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,960
Aren't you a police officer?

338
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,080
Those people all have blood on their hands.

339
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Isn't it said that killers should pay with their lives?

340
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,440
Why do you save them?

341
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,560
Why don't you just

342
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,840
kill them directly?

343
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,250
Police officers

344
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,240
are defenders of the law,

345
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,200
not executioners of vigilante justice.

346
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,560
Before they are legally convicted,

347
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,420
they are all living human beings.

348
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,920
Disregarding life

349
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,640
is not what Chinese police

350
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,880
should stand for.

351
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,410
Perhaps it was words like these

352
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,900
and this kind of character

353
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,240
that gradually influenced my entire life.

354
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,760
Even though I lost my memory,

355
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,120
something subconsciously guided me to apply for police academy

356
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,380
and become an excellent police officer.

357
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,840
In such extreme circumstances,

358
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Comrade Fu Gang

359
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,570
could still demonstrate firm beliefs

360
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,200
and excellent character to inspire the next generation.

361
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Truly admirable.

362
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,960
What he left you

363
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,900
is a series of numbers.

364
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,200
This array contains information about a location.

365
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,760
I guess

366
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,160
there must be a master key

367
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,330
that can decode these numbers.

368
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,040
But this master key

369
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,620
isn't a standard decryption method.

370
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,720
Just guessing won't help us.

371
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,960
I'll request

372
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,560
Old Chang to help us look into

373
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,320
Comrade Fu Gang's specific information before he went undercover.

374
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,520
Let's see if we can crack the master key.

375
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,400
Or perhaps

376
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,040
find Jin Zi.

377
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,320
This way,

378
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,320
we can locate that place.

379
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,000
Good.

380
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,680
Alright.

381
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,480
I understand.

382
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,600
Let's go.

383
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,260
Tu Guolin is awake.

384
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,360
What happened to your foster parents

385
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,620
was done by my brother.

386
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,440
The meaning of accident

387
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,240
is accidental death.

388
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,000
You know which side you're on now.

389
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,200
So someone has to take

390
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,580
the blame for this.

391
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,240
You're a police officer.

392
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,500
You can't kill people.

393
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,360
Then thank you for paving the way

394
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,560
for my first-class merit.
