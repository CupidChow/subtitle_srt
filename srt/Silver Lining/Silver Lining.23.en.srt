1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunyue.

2
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,800
I checked it.

3
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,200
This 'Old Liu' mentioned by Wang Sheng

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,600
is probably a fake identity.

5
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,720
The phone wasn't registered

6
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,280
and the SIM card was likely discarded long ago.

7
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,080
It seems now

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,120
that the Fox's plan in Yuji

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,560
was to kill two birds with one stone.

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,220
Tu Guolin was also her target.

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,720
The criminal organization behind Chi Xiao

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,920
must be quite substantial.

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,120
The good news is

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,650
their first attack failed.

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,560
This indicates someone is working against them behind the scenes.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,400
I feel this criminal organization

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,200
might be connected to those people in my memories.

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,080
Let's not overthink this now.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,880
Let's meet with Tu Guolin first.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,400
The only briefcase he brought is missing.

21
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,160
The room key is here.

22
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,920
The door wasn't locked.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
The instant noodles weren't eaten.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,250
He left in quite a hurry.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,520
Alright.

26
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,240
Wei,

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,640
let's split up to search.

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,440
Chi Xia,

29
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,800
go find Qu Bai again

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,280
and see if you can get any information.

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,920
Besides that Tu Guolin,

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,080
ask him to find out

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,880
who this Liu guy is that's working with Wang Sheng.

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,000
I got it.

35
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,400
Both of you be careful.

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
The signal in Yuji is unstable.

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,920
Contact me as soon as possible if anything happens.

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,720
You too.

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,479
Goodbye.

40
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,840
Officer Chi,

41
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,300
are you looking for Mr. Qu?

42
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,840
Do you know where he is?

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,280
He has official business this afternoon.

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,320
He took a car to the mountains in the south.

45
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
There's no signal there.

46
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,640
He asked me to tell you

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,960
if you need to see him,

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,090
please wait a while.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,360
I understand.

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,930
You're welcome.

52
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,880
The investigation by Dongzhou police

53
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,280
has concluded.

54
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,450
They've determined

55
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,000
it wasn't arson.

56
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,440
Sir.

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,680
If someone killed my parents.

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Then the murderer

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,960
must have planned it carefully.

60
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,960
They must have strong counter-detection skills

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,560
and someone might be helping cover up the truth.

62
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,720
What you've said

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,000
has no evidence so far.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,720
Hello.

65
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,320
I'm a police officer.

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,040
Hello.

67
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,720
We need to use your vehicle right now.

68
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,320
Please cooperate with us.

69
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,800
Is that okay?

70
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,440
Okay.

71
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,529
Here's your helmet.

72
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,130
Captain Luo.

73
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,080
No need.

74
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,320
The repair shop has been completely trashed.

75
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,360
Everyone's gone.

76
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,360
I strongly suspect

77
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,320
that Tu Guolin has already left Yuji.

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Didn't Wei order a thorough search?

79
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,400
If we can catch just one mechanic,

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,480
we can definitely follow the trail

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,610
and find some leads.

82
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,000
What's wrong, Captain Luo?

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,880
Someone lured Chi Xia to Bailong Resort

84
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,440
claiming they have something important to her.

85
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,159
She insisted on going.

86
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,680
Asked us to provide backup once we see her.

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,880
What about Tu Guolin?

88
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,880
Have your men look for Tu Guolin.

89
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,560
If there's any news,

90
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
notify the police immediately.

91
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,560
I'll go to the resort with Xiao Wei.

92
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,360
Understood.

93
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,560
Why aren't you here yet?

94
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Are you trying to starve me to death?

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,080
Mr. Tu,

96
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
please calm down.

97
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,680
It's so dark out here,

98
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,080
and we can't turn on any lights.

99
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,480
The place was hard to find.

100
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,400
Please wait a moment,

101
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,080
I'm almost there.

102
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,760
Hurry up.

103
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,560
Okay.

104
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,159
Mr. Tu.

105
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,280
Were you followed?

106
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,000
No.

107
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,320
Be quicker next time.

108
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,880
Yes, of course.

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,520
Give me the food.

110
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,159
Here.

111
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,920
Now get out of here.

112
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,720
Right away.

113
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,880
Mr. Qu.

114
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,200
Ms. Chi Xia came looking for you this afternoon.

115
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,600
She seemed quite urgent.

116
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,840
Phone.

117
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:14,960
Thanks.

118
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,890
You're welcome.

119
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,680
Let's go.

120
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,240
Captain Luo.

121
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,840
Slow down.

122
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,480
Watch out for the hole ahead.

123
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,240
We've got a flat tire.

124
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,170
What's going on?

125
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,000
They're using the tactic of ambushing reinforcements.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,060
These bastards are playing military strategy with us.

127
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,200
Wei.

128
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,460
Grab your weapons.

129
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,600
Let me remind you all.

130
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,620
You're surrounding police officers right now.

131
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,780
Do you know the consequences of assaulting an officer?

132
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,840
Young Master.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,920
We have news.

134
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,800
Chi Xia was deliberately lured back to Bailong Resort.

135
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
Who?

136
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,160
We don't have exact details.

137
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,240
But our men reported.

138
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,880
They saw Mo Laoqi going to Bailong Resort this afternoon.

139
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,810
Apparently he installed homemade bombs in the room.

140
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,040
Captain Luo.

141
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,480
Wei.

142
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,380
The bomb has two minutes left.

143
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,300
Defuse it quickly!

144
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,840
Let me do it.

145
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
Is it this wire?

146
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,640
No.

147
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,800
This one?

148
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,260
This is the ignition wire.

149
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,930
Fall back! Quickly!

150
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,160
A-De, get them to the hospital.

151
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,640
Now!

152
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,400
Chi Xia,

153
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,240
wake up!

154
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,960
Chi Xia,

155
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,640
wake up!

156
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,840
Chi Xia!

157
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,040
Chi Xia!

158
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,560
She's still breathing.

159
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Get help quickly!

160
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,080
Young Master.

161
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,640
Fortunately, Chi Xia is only temporarily unconscious.

162
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
She should wake up

163
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,840
after a night's rest.

164
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Is your hand

165
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,520
all right?

166
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,920
Chi Xia.

167
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,760
After experiencing such trauma,

168
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,960
she might recover some of her memories.

169
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,680
Oh.

170
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,840
By the way, Young Master,

171
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,240
there's something else.

172
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,200
When we were at Bailong Resort,

173
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,840
Chi Xiao found Tu Guolin

174
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,000
and poisoned him.

175
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,160
But the police arrived in time.

176
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,800
Tu Guolin is now in the hospital,

177
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,360
and he might survive.

178
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,160
You're awake.

179
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,460
Does your hand still hurt?

180
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,090
You're injured.

181
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,160
I'm fine.

182
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,360
Just a minor scratch.

183
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,420
Let me tell you.

184
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,320
Well.

185
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,440
Those people who lured you there

186
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,050
must have planned this.

187
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,280
Xiao Wei took a hit for me.

188
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
Mild concussion.

189
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,040
Xiao Wei got hurt too?

190
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
But he'll be fine.

191
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,130
A few days' rest will do.

192
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,500
Please don't feel guilty.

193
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,610
I'm the one who should feel guilty.

194
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,920
Mr. Luo.

195
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,340
I apologize to you.

196
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,040
I shouldn't have

197
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,960
acted without understanding the situation

198
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,220
and rushed in blindly.

199
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,360
It's all in the past now.

200
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,620
Don't blame yourself.

201
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,280
Thankfully,

202
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,360
Qu Bai

203
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,920
arrived just in time.

204
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,680
But anyway,

205
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,200
why did you insist on going back to that resort?

206
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,240
Because in that abandoned house

207
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,240
there were photos showing

208
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,040
Zhou's whereabouts before my parents' accident.

209
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm increasingly convinced

210
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,460
that my parents' death

211
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,170
was carefully planned by someone.

212
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,880
And that explosive device

213
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
was deliberately designed

214
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
to jump directly

215
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,680
to 14 seconds once triggered.

216
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,839
Why not 15 seconds, you think?

217
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,319
Why not 10?

218
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,839
Why specifically 14?

219
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,520
She used to stay in Room 6.

220
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,680
Ever since her daughter Zhou Wanrou stopped visiting,

221
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,720
she insisted on moving to Room 14.

222
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,319
Zheng Lanshu's Room 14.

223
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,720
Not just that.

224
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,119
The 2 PM class bell.

225
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,720
And also,

226
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,080
the invitation for October 14.

227
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,920
These all appear repeatedly,

228
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,450
but we've overlooked them.

229
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,400
And also 12.

230
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,080
The number twelve is also significant.

231
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
The village chief said

232
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,560
that inside this abandoned house...

233
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,440
I think there were only ten statues before.

234
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,240
Don't know why it became twelve.

235
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,360
In the Bailong Resort,

236
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,020
there were twelve statues forcibly assembled.

237
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,720
I understand now.

238
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,720
The number twelve in the Hundred Bones case...

239
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,960
Someone deliberately erased it

240
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,690
and intentionally left twelve graffiti pieces.

241
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,000
So

242
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,560
14

243
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,600
12 and 25

244
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,810
were deliberately embedded in the murder cases.

245
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,280
I'm afraid so.

246
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,500
Did you remember something else?

247
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,320
It's very vague.

248
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,160
But what I can confirm is

249
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,920
during a

250
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,240
survival test,

251
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,360
my two friends and I

252
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,460
worked together to disarm an explosive device.

253
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,440
One of them was a girl.

254
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,340
But we had a falling out later.

255
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,240
My intuition tells me

256
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,320
she is the Fox.

257
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,720
Who was the other person?

258
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,440
Do you remember him?

259
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,920
Are you okay?

260
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,920
I'm not sure.

261
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,000
We found

262
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,920
an unfinished wooden carving of a cat

263
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,840
in his briefcase.

264
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,080
There was also a small carving knife inside.

265
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,800
It was a U-shaped carving knife.

266
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,360
He is the real murderer who killed my parents.

267
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,540
Water has a boiling point.

268
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,200
People have principles.

269
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,280
Don't cross the line.

270
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,980
Are you coming?

271
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,360
Let's find out.
