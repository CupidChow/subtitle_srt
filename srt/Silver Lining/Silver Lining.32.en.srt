1
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya

2
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,520
Director Meng

3
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,600
Luo Xun

4
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,680
is dead.

5
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,000
By the time I arrived with my team,

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,460
there were no vital signs.

7
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,160
We're certain Chi Xia did it.

8
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:09,840
Absolutely.

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,280
The security cameras caught her.

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,680
She pushed Chi Xiao down.

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,610
Where is Chi Xia?

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,940
We can't reach her.

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,080
Luo Xun.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,680
Remove all surveillance cameras

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,039
in the area that can capture this place.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,200
Understood?

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,320
Yes.

18
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,039
I know about Chi Xiao now.

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,400
Where are you?

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,160
Can we meet?

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,480
Why so gloomy?

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,260
Business is business.

23
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,200
No one is above the law.

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
Curly.

25
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,100
Issue a wanted notice.

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,170
Put out an APB on Chi Xia.

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Wait.

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
On the notice,

29
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,010
don't mention her occupation.

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,860
Let her keep some dignity.

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,520
Okay.

32
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,400
The rest of you shouldn't be idle either.

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,360
Yang Zhiming is right there.

34
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
We have to arrest him.

35
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,600
Now we have the evidence.

36
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,560
First, send someone to protect Lu Ningzhi.

37
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,890
It's time to bring in this Yang Zhiming

38
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,810
to cooperate with our investigation.

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,440
Hello.

40
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,800
We're from Dongzhou City Police Department.

41
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,920
Routine inspection.

42
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,720
Okay.

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,200
This way.

44
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,000
Mr. Yang.

45
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,560
Yang Zhiming, right?

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,520
I'm Luo Xun, captain of the Municipal Police Major Crimes Unit.

47
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,480
Please come with us

48
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,410
to assist with our investigation.

49
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,640
Let's go.

50
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,680
Are you okay?

51
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,320
Still alive.

52
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,280
Do you know

53
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
they've already started

54
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,440
posting wanted notices for you online?

55
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,240
So what?

56
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,640
Are you a messenger of justice?

57
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,000
Are you here to arrest me for the police?

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,800
You know that's not what I meant.

59
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,000
Why did you kill her?

60
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
What do you think?

61
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,880
Chi Xia

62
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,280
Do you know how helpless your parents were

63
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,560
when they died?

64
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,960
The fire slowly peeled away their skin,

65
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,960
and no matter how loudly they screamed, it was useless.

66
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
And you were far away in Qin City,

67
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
just a fresh graduate from the police academy,

68
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,240
unable to do anything.

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,520
How disappointed your parents must have been

70
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,159
in their only daughter.

71
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,450
Because what she said was true.

72
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,440
Because she hit my weak spot.

73
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
It's been five years.

74
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,240
My parents' death

75
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,170
has always been a thorn in my heart.

76
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,980
I've always hated myself.

77
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,980
Hated myself for not being in Dongzhou then.

78
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,840
Hated that I knew something was wrong

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,720
but couldn't figure it out.

80
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,120
Hated that even though I became a police officer,

81
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,920
I still couldn't avenge them or clear their names.

82
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,200
That

83
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,320
fire.

84
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,420
How desperate my parents must have felt.

85
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,080
When the fire was burning their skin,

86
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,680
how much pain they must have been in.

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,880
Before they died,

88
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,080
did they call out my name?

89
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,200
Did they

90
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,640
regret adopting me?

91
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,760
Because of all this,

92
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,800
I wanted her dead.

93
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,460
Is that so hard to understand?

94
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,840
But it wasn't your fault.

95
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,540
Even if you had been in Dongzhou then,

96
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,140
you couldn't have changed anything.

97
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,840
When Chi Xiao was carrying out the order

98
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,900
to kill my parents,

99
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,570
did you know about it or not?

100
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,920
I didn't know.

101
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,440
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,320
But I don't regret it.

103
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,090
I've only let down you and Uncle Fu Gang

104
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,320
who risked your lives to help me escape from Lawa Village.

105
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,960
If I had known it would be like this,

106
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,820
I might as well have stayed there.

107
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,970
To avoid suffering like I am today.

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,800
On one side,

109
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,680
professional ethics.

110
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,480
Moral condemnation.

111
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,240
On the other side,

112
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,720
the pull of hatred.

113
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,360
The satisfaction of revenge.

114
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,280
I have nowhere to go now,

115
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,520
like a rat everyone wants to kill.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Qu Bai.

117
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,160
You should go.

118
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,890
Don't get dragged down with me.

119
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,740
Those days in the past,

120
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,200
I can't go back.

121
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,400
Yes, you can.

122
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,960
Come in.

123
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,480
Reporting.

124
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,679
Director Chang.

125
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,400
Ah, Luo Xun.

126
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,320
Look.

127
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Yang Zhiming has confessed everything clearly.

128
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,880
All suspects have been arrested.

129
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,720
The evidence is extremely solid.

130
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,520
To be honest,

131
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,640
since I joined the Major Crimes Unit,

132
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,700
I've never handled such an easy case.

133
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,360
Good.

134
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,120
Well done.

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,640
By the way,

136
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,400
I need to tell you two things.

137
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,720
With the help of Interpol,

138
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,200
we've been able to investigate

139
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,360
and identify Old K's real identity.

140
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,520
His real name is Huang Weisheng.

141
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,440
He's Chinese.

142
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,840
His parents divorced when he was young,

143
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,440
and he lived with his mother.

144
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,320
In 1984,

145
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,280
his mother was murdered.

146
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,360
Although they caught the killer,

147
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,080
due to insufficient evidence,

148
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,040
no conviction was made.

149
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,320
Later he left the country

150
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,780
and went to Mengkun State,

151
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,560
where he's been involved in illegal business ever since.

152
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,400
Until today.

153
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,810
There's one more thing.

154
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,560
Fu Gang's

155
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,770
identity has also been confirmed.

156
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,200
These are the files from the provincial department.

157
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,960
His real name is Liu Gang,

158
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,880
but he doesn't have any family left.

159
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,120
However, he has a handler

160
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,080
named Zhang Jinguo.

161
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,780
Multiple serious illegal activities, some cases are connected to a recent one.

162
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,040
What's wrong, Qu Bai?

163
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,760
Chi Xia.

164
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,220
An old friend wants to talk to you.

165
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,040
Long time no see,

166
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,880
little fox.

167
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,120
I really don't know if Qu Bai is helping me

168
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,640
or hurting me.

169
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,760
I think

170
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,520
we can talk.

171
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,280
I have nothing to say to the mastermind

172
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,410
who ordered the killing of my parents.

173
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,800
I only hate myself

174
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,640
for not having the chance to kill you with my own hands.

175
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,480
It's my fault for not finding you sooner,

176
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,240
leaving you

177
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,500
in this difficult situation now.

178
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,880
Qu Bai says

179
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,800
revenge makes you feel happy.

180
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,400
That's a happiness you couldn't feel

181
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,960
when you were a police officer

182
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,680
catching criminals, right?

183
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,440
Before,

184
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,160
I misjudged.

185
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,680
I only focused on making you all ruthless,

186
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,380
making you heartless.

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,120
I forgot that virtue and evil

188
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,880
can coexist.

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,800
Chi Xia,

190
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,400
don't hide your desires.

191
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,600
Deep down,

192
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,920
you crave crime.

193
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,480
We are the same kind.

194
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,360
You didn't make this call

195
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,320
just to lecture me, did you?

196
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,240
Of course not.

197
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,920
I just want to make a small deal with you.

198
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,240
You're so smart,

199
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,240
you must be able to guess.

200
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,400
Since it's a deal,

201
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,480
what can you offer me?

202
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,960
Freedom,

203
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,240
money.

204
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,340
If you're willing,

205
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,080
you can come back to my side.

206
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,040
Whatever I have,

207
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,360
you will have too.

208
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,000
And I

209
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,800
only want one array.

210
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,960
Impossible.

211
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,680
What if you go back on your word after getting the array?

212
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,880
Isn't this kind of betrayal

213
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,680
something people like you do all the time?

214
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,040
What do you want then?

215
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,170
Resource exchange.

216
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,490
I want the master password key.

217
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,040
Little fox,

218
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,560
I'm afraid

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,530
you're not in a position to negotiate with me.

220
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,420
Then there's nothing to discuss.

221
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,210
What if I told you

222
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,890
I have something

223
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,040
that will force you to cooperate with me?

224
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,700
Do you still remember him?

225
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,440
Your dear uncle.

226
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,760
This is Mr. Zhang's study.

227
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Do you mind if I...

228
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,900
Since Mr. Zhang passed away early last year,

229
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,820
nothing has been touched.

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,440
I just come by occasionally

231
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,640
to dust the place.

232
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,210
Before Comrade Zhang Jinguo passed away,

233
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,720
did he leave any message?

234
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,120
His death was sudden.

235
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,660
He didn't leave anything.

236
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,580
He did have a habit of keeping a diary though.

237
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,480
Here.

238
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,140
Nothing much has changed, right?

239
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,600
Yes.

240
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,540
It's been 15 years.

241
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,520
I'm back again.

242
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,240
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,220
I didn't know Fu Gang was still alive.

244
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Even if you knew,

245
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,200
what could you have changed?

246
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,080
You are Chi Xia.

247
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,890
Please hand over all electronic devices.

248
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,440
Welcome home,

249
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,320
little fox.

250
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,160
This place is still the same as before,

251
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,120
lifeless.

252
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,730
When you ran away back then,

253
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
did you ever think

254
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,200
that one day you would come back?

255
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,960
Actually,

256
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,240
I've always had a feeling

257
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,600
that

258
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,760
we would meet again.

259
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,200
I've heard foxes

260
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,160
like to make their dens in graves.

261
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,920
So,

262
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,760
isn't the lifeless Lawa Village

263
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,800
perfect for you,

264
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,600
little fox?

265
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,080
I'm not your little fox.

266
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,640
Chi Xiao was,

267
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,970
even though she's dead now.

268
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,800
I killed her.

269
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,570
Still that stubborn attitude.

270
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,360
Chi Xiao,

271
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,920
she was proud

272
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,640
and not steady enough.

273
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,760
Compared to her,

274
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,370
I actually admire you more.

275
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,360
Don't say these useless things.

276
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,010
Since I'm willing to come back,

277
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,480
I'm naturally willing to join you

278
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,810
in your dirty business.

279
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,920
But what I want,

280
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,180
you know very well.

281
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,040
Where is he?

282
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,480
You've tortured him like this.

283
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,839
Uncle.

284
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,480
Uncle.

285
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,760
Uncle.

286
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,080
Uncle, I'm Xiaxia.

287
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,080
I'm Xiaxia.

288
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,960
Chi Xia.

289
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,280
Chi Xia.

290
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,600
What happened to you?

291
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,920
I never gave up on him.

292
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,720
I've been trying to cure him.

293
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,120
You want to cure him,

294
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,680
just to get the array from him.

295
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,620
That's not fair to say.

296
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,500
After all these years,

297
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,770
without any backup,

298
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,160
I've done pretty well for myself.

299
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
I could have easily killed him,

300
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,560
couldn't I?

301
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,720
Don't be so tense.

302
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,480
Since I've brought him to you,

303
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,370
I won't do anything more to him.

304
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,380
Actually, I quite admire him.

305
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,210
His faith is strong,

306
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,980
his position unwavering.

307
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,680
No matter how I tortured him,

308
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,560
I couldn't make him talk.

309
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,620
You've met the person.

310
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,080
What about the array?

311
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,480
Can you tell me now?

312
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,400
No.

313
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,440
Fu Gang must return to China.

314
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,930
I need you to guarantee his safety.

315
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,810
Take him to Dongzhou City Police Station.

316
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,930
Then I'll tell you about the array.

317
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,800
Otherwise,

318
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,360
no deal.

319
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,480
To prevent you from taking him somewhere

320
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,080
and quietly disposing of him.

321
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,320
I want a video call.

322
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,560
I need to see him return to the country with my own eyes.

323
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,960
Standing safely at the entrance of Dongzhou Police Station.

324
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,130
What I promised you,

325
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
I've done it all.

326
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,120
So where's my array?

327
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,220
Listen carefully.

328
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,060
The sequence is...

329
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,280
You suspect there's something fishy about Chi Xia being wanted by the police?

330
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,400
Even if this falls into the hands of the police,

331
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,600
what good would it do?

332
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,720
The password

333
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,800
only I have it.
