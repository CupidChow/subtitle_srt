1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya

2
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,080
How long has she been sleeping?

3
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,810
Captain Luo,

4
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,360
just for a little while.

5
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
What did the doctor say?

6
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,080
Nothing serious,

7
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,610
just needs time to recover.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,640
Officer,

9
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,760
his hand is swollen.

10
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,560
Can I use the other hand instead?

11
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,640
Zhu Chongliang.

12
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,280
Stay back!

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Come any closer and I'll kill her!

14
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,120
Zhu Chongliang.

15
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,720
Calm down.

16
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,920
We know you didn't kill anyone,

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,039
and we're not here to arrest you.

18
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:45,920
You're lying!

19
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,330
I've killed people.

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
I killed everyone who hurt Lu Ningzhi.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,320
Are you going to hurt her too?

22
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,759
The person you're holding hostage

23
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,120
never hurt Lu Ningzhi.

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,210
Take me instead.

25
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,759
I'll be your hostage.

26
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,039
Come on.

27
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,560
Stay back!

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,920
I said stay back!

29
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,170
Zhu Chongliang,

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,200
did Tao Han use a syringe

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,160
to stab people that night too?

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,720
Come here

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
Behave yourself.

34
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,400
Think carefully.

35
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,440
That night, how did Tao Han

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,720
get into room 601?

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,490
Did he knock or enter the passcode?

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,280
Also,

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,200
when did Dong Chengbin allegedly harass

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,000
Lu Ningzhi, as you claimed?

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Was it right then?

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,520
Bite me.

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,280
You dare bite me?

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,800
Help!

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,080
Help me!

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,760
Help! Is anyone there?

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,840
Run!

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,120
Run!

49
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,600
Get away!

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,560
Where are you running to?

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,120
Come here.

52
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
Help! Is anybody there?

53
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,360
Run!

54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,440
Let me go!

55
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,000
Run!

56
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Help me!

57
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,520
Help! Is anyone there?

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,980
I'll show you for running.

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,120
Run now!

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,520
You... help me!

61
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,480
Please save me!

62
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,400
I...

63
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,880
Run!

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,560
Answer me.

65
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,800
What did you see?

66
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,200
I... I saw...

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,400
She was bullied.

68
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,240
The man she liked

69
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
and who liked her back.

70
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,760
He avenged her.

71
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,519
It's all because I was too cowardly.

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,399
That person,

73
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,560
he truly was braver than me.

74
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,360
Sir.

75
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,560
Why is this camera pointing at the wall?

76
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,880
It can't record anything like this.

77
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,520
Exactly.

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,980
It used to face the window.

79
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
When was it moved?

80
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,000
Sir.

81
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,140
Please have a seat.

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,960
Could you help me check something?

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,720
This one here.

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,200
The footage from this camera.

85
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,800
Could you pull it up?

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Let's take a look together.

87
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,260
Starting from yesterday.

88
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,920
Isn't this from three days ago?

89
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,680
Three days ago in the morning.

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,760
This camera was facing the side window on the first floor.

91
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,690
So it must have been moved that day.

92
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,480
Sir.

93
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
Sorry to trouble you again.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,080
Could you pull up

95
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,080
the duty roster from three days ago?

96
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,480
Thank you for your help.

97
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,810
The duty roster, right?

98
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,080
Wait a moment.

99
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,360
25.

100
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,560
Is it 25?

101
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,080
Let me check.

102
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,800
Sir.

103
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,440
Sir.

104
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,900
Please continue looking.

105
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,490
The duty roster.

106
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,360
Found it.

107
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,760
This is the duty roster from three days ago.

108
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,400
Pan Haili was on duty.

109
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,680
Pan Haili.

110
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,520
Pan Haili again.

111
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,680
Alright.

112
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,760
I understand the situation with the case now.

113
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,720
Let's find out where Pan Haili is.

114
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,200
I need to confirm

115
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,280
if Chi Xiao is going

116
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,800
to continue using fire

117
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,500
to stimulate Chi Xia's memory recovery.

118
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,400
No one.

119
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,360
Nobody.

120
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,400
What about the numbers?

121
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:46,840
25

122
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,970
and 12 are both here.

123
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,960
What about 14?

124
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,560
The book titled '12' that Pan Haili left behind

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,080
is actually about decoding.

126
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,360
But what does this fox want us to decode?

127
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,160
Heizi.

128
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,010
Go to Dongzhou and find someone for me.

129
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,240
Pan Haili.

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,960
It's raining today.

131
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,520
I didn't drive.

132
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,850
Can I get a ride with you?

133
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,120
What's wrong?

134
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,920
You seem off.

135
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,080
It's that feeling again when the suspect is right in front of me,

136
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,680
but I can't get the evidence.

137
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,920
This is

138
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,760
the phone my sister used to send me messages

139
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
when she was on that mission.

140
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,560
Luo Xun

141
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,640
About that stabbing serial killer case,

142
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,800
I might have a lead.

143
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,600
But I need to confirm something.

144
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,720
Contact me when you see this message.

145
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,520
I need you.

146
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,500
Actually that day,

147
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,970
I went to the mountains.

148
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,840
Later,

149
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,730
I asked the carrier,

150
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,360
they told me there was simply no signal.

151
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,160
So I didn't receive the message,

152
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,520
and couldn't save my sister.

153
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,560
As her family,

154
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,770
they returned this phone to me afterward.

155
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
I've kept it with me all these years.

156
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,280
I keep thinking,

157
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,180
she trusted me so much,

158
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,760
but I let her down.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,930
She needed me so desperately then,

160
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,960
but I only realized it after she died.

161
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,690
It's not your fault.

162
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
The person who hurt my sister

163
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,400
is named Zheng Yanbo.

164
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,520
He is my mentor's

165
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,480
son, isn't he?

166
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,940
Luo Xun!

167
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,000
Luo Xun, what are you doing?

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,930
Get out of my way!

169
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,280
You've been hiding evidence

170
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
and stalling for so long

171
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,440
just to protect him.

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,800
Answer me!

173
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,120
You're a police officer.

174
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
You're breaking the law knowingly.

175
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,120
If I hadn't figured it out,

176
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,460
were you planning to let this case go cold

177
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,770
and hide it forever?

178
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,690
Yanbo, he...

179
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,600
He was just being used by others.

180
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
He fell in with the wrong crowd.

181
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
That's bullshit!

182
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,040
Loyalty to the Party,

183
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,360
fairness in law enforcement -

184
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,820
that's what you taught me.

185
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,560
Do you know what Zheng Yanbo told me?

186
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,000
He said he couldn't stand seeing those girls in nice clothes.

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,460
He wanted to destroy them.

188
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,800
This is what

189
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,160
a police officer's well-raised son turned out to be.

190
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,640
Luo Xun!

191
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,540
What are you doing?

192
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,600
You're a police officer!

193
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,370
But actually, he wasn't wrong.

194
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,960
Zheng Yanbo later told me

195
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,060
He was provoked by someone

196
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,440
which triggered the evil side of his human nature.

197
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,480
He grew up with my sister.

198
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,840
I think my sister must have noticed something unusual

199
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,100
and wanted to warn him.

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,800
But then...

201
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,620
Always having that thread of worry for family members.

202
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,080
That constant tension, always on edge.

203
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,680
I understand it all too well.

204
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,680
But we're not just Luo Xun and Chi Xia.

205
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,360
Behind us

206
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,420
are thousands of Dongzhou citizens.

207
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,020
They need our protection.

208
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,730
This is our responsibility

209
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,000
and our mission.

210
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
I believe

211
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,800
you understand this without me having to explain.

212
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,480
So stop blaming yourself.

213
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,480
Your sister wouldn't blame you.

214
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,290
And don't have regrets.

215
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,480
Because regret

216
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,920
is the most useless thing in this world.

217
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,880
You're the captain.

218
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,920
I'm the captain.

219
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,900
Why do you sound so much like the chief today?

220
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,820
I'm learning from you.

221
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,440
But you're right.

222
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,000
I really can't

223
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,920
let personal feelings cloud my judgment anymore.

224
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,980
Dongzhou has thousands of citizens,

225
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,460
and they all have their own families.

226
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,760
These incitement to murder cases keep happening one after another,

227
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,560
and people are living in fear.

228
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,880
We need to catch them.

229
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,600
So

230
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
our top priority

231
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,640
is to catch the big fish behind all this.

232
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,720
We need to be fully prepared.

233
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,400
- Good.

234
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,760
- Let's go.

235
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,360
Let's go catch the fish tonight.

236
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,440
Not tonight.

237
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,840
We'll do it tomorrow.

238
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,300
Let me take you home first.

239
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,320
Let's go.

240
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,450
Captain Luo.

241
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,120
Curly.

242
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,280
Pass out the materials first.

243
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,840
Okay.

244
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,370
Captain Luo.

245
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,280
Jue.

246
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,000
Go ahead.

247
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,280
I've retrieved the traffic accident case file.

248
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,560
Everyone, please take a look.

249
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,840
The deceased is Xu Changting.

250
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,960
He was 52 years old

251
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,760
and died instantly after being hit.

252
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,020
The driver responsible was Tao Cong'an,

253
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,410
who is Tao Han's father.

254
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,650
Tao Han was also in the car at that time.

255
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,080
According to the autopsy report and records,

256
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,960
the victim had been drinking that night.

257
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,400
He was walking on the reservoir bridge.

258
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,240
When Tao Cong'an was driving,

259
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,080
he was distracted

260
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,040
and didn't notice the pedestrian in the middle of the road,

261
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,500
which led to the accident.

262
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,040
At that time, the bridge

263
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,600
had no surveillance cameras installed.

264
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,400
However,

265
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,680
the victim's family member,

266
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,960
namely Lu Ningzhi,

267
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,480
was also at the scene

268
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,680
and witnessed the entire incident.

269
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,920
She had no objection to the driver's statement,

270
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,560
so the case was quickly settled.

271
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,360
I've also looked into

272
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,080
the verdict of this accident

273
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,360
and its aftermath.

274
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,200
The Tao family paid 650,000 yuan in compensation to the Lu family.

275
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,720
After that,

276
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,200
Tao Han's father, Tao Cong'an,

277
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,720
was sentenced to one and a half years in prison

278
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,480
for the crime of causing a traffic accident.

279
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,360
And Tao Han, who was in college at that time,

280
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,760
was also affected by this incident,

281
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,640
so he

282
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,120
dropped out of school.

283
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,240
Then he paid his own way

284
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,170
to study abroad.

285
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,600
He just returned to the country half a month ago.

286
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,280
What I currently know is...

287
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,080
Wait a moment.

288
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,540
There's something suspicious here.

289
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,650
Look at this.

290
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,900
This accident scene investigation report.

291
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,600
According to the brake mark analysis,

292
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
at the time of the incident,

293
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,440
the speed of the car was between

294
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,080
70 and 80 miles per hour.

295
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,720
And there was emergency braking.

296
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,650
Now look at this.

297
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,360
This is Tao Han's father,

298
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,720
Tao Cong'an's prison physical examination report.

299
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,920
Height: 1.72 meters.

300
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,560
Weight: nearly 200 jin.

301
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,210
This is clearly an obese body type.

302
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,900
It doesn't make sense.

303
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,200
What doesn't make sense?

304
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Taohan's father claims

305
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,000
that he was

306
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,080
driving

307
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,360
with his seatbelt fastened.

308
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,480
But with his extremely obese body,

309
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,080
during such a rapid emergency brake,

310
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,480
his abdomen...

311
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,920
But there are no marks

312
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,450
of soft tissue contusions from the seatbelt.

313
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
Is that possible?

314
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,680
You mean

315
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,880
the killer is Tao Han,

316
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,160
not his father?

317
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,040
Yes.

318
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,560
Curly.

319
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,760
Check if there are any medical records

320
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,920
for Tao Han on the night of the incident

321
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,840
and the following days.

322
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,720
Sure.

323
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,680
Hello, comrade.

324
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,940
I'm here for the night shift medication.

325
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,760
I'm sorry.

326
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,210
It's time for Tu Guolin's medication.

327
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,840
Stop!

328
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,760
Don't run!

329
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,040
Catch him!

330
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:09,880
Don't move!

331
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,410
Let me go!

332
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,560
Let me go!

333
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,280
They're Chi Xiao's people.

334
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Our people pretended to be Good Samaritans

335
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,540
and gave a little help.

336
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,200
That fake fox

337
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,400
won't last much longer.

338
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,839
Police.

339
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,720
Come with us.

340
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,130
I don't like surprises.

341
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,000
I'd rather Officer Chi bring me

342
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,800
fairness and justice.

343
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,849
I wanted to kill him myself.

344
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,640
Nobody made me do it.

345
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,450
Do you like psychology?

346
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,180
Manipulating people's minds

347
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,460
can be quite interesting sometimes.
