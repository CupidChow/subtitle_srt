1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya.

2
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,050
Do we really have to do this?

3
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,240
What if Old K finds out?

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,660
We can't worry about that now.

5
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,760
Actually,

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,620
let's give her a little surprise.

7
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,080
Hey,

8
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,810
you're here.

9
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,640
I came to buy some green beans.

10
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,240
Sure.

11
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
These green beans look really good.

12
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,840
Good.

13
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,720
Chi Xia and I

14
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,759
interviewed the school teachers

15
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,039
and neighbors in the area.

16
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,000
We can now basically confirm

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,120
that Feng Yuqin

18
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,320
is a hardworking woman

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,200
with limited education.

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,360
I believe

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,920
even if she wanted to avenge Zhao Shengqian,

22
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,960
she wouldn't have

23
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,200
the skills to commit such an elaborate locked-room murder.

24
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,840
We originally suspected she might be manipulated by the Fox.

25
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
But now it seems

26
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,080
she's carrying the entire family burden alone,

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,740
a woman with too many worries,

28
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,680
making it unlikely she'd risk committing a crime.

29
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Wei,

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,000
did you get the information

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,640
about the other rescuers

32
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,400
that I asked for the other day?

33
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,000
It's ready,

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,520
with Officer Xia.

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,079
Do you want it?

36
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:24,880
Just a moment.

37
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,680
Wang,

38
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,010
Officer Wei is here.

39
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,320
That woman who often comes with her child,

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,880
you know her, right?

41
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,760
Yes, I do.

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Take this,

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,280
here.

44
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
When she comes again,

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
take good care of her.

46
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
Pick the freshest vegetables for her.

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
If there's not enough, take it from this money.

48
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,720
Alright,

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,579
I'll definitely take care of her.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,000
At that time, the rescue team

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,960
had seven people

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,240
besides Zhao Shengqian.

53
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,520
After that blind girl Qu Feiyu

54
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,040
left because of her blindness,

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
the rescue team disbanded shortly after.

56
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,080
Two of them joined

57
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
a new rescue team.

58
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
The remaining four people

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,320
also shifted their focus to new

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,680
careers and families.

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,000
However, these people

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,640
still maintain contact with Feng Yuqin,

63
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,880
often visit her,

64
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,240
and help her out when needed.

65
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,920
If we're excluding Qu Feiyu,

66
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
that's not right.

67
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,240
We can't rule her out now.

68
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Look,

69
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,810
after Zhao Shengqian died,

70
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,680
Qu Feiyu's financial support

71
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
to Feng Yuqin

72
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,240
was actually much more frequent than others.

73
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,120
But unlike the other six people,

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,120
she was both a witness

75
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,200
and a victim.

76
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,920
This indicates that for the past five years,

77
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,120
she's been dwelling on

78
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,450
that rescue operation.

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,930
It's too early to rule her out as a suspect.

80
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
Check it thoroughly.

81
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
What do you think?

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,730
Chief Chang.

83
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,140
I request to assist with the investigation.

84
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
I need information about someone named Qu Feiyu,

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
her entry records in other countries,

86
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,890
to confirm her detailed whereabouts.

87
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,480
Okay.

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,720
I'll send you her identity information now.

89
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,680
Take this.

90
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,480
Alright.

91
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,050
All these years,

92
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,279
this small association of mine

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,079
has relied on Mr. Qu's support.

94
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,200
I never expected that a businessman like you

95
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,280
would have such a strong sense of social responsibility.

96
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,880
I truly admire you.

97
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,770
Let me toast you with tea

98
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,330
instead of wine.

99
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,880
About what I mentioned earlier,

100
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,610
I wonder if President Sun has made a decision yet?

101
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,920
Well...

102
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,440
This murder case at Bailong Resort

103
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,240
has caused quite a stir.

104
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,960
Everyone in Yuji Town

105
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,480
has heard about it to some extent.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,920
And it also involves

107
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,640
the former rescue team captain Zhao Shengqian.

108
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,520
If our association were to

109
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,520
stick our nose

110
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,720
into this matter now,

111
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,600
I'm afraid

112
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,440
it would damage our reputation.

113
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,380
I'll give you two options.

114
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,440
Either

115
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,520
you do as I say,

116
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,360
and I'll increase my sponsorship to your association.

117
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,160
Or

118
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,400
I'll withdraw my previous sponsorship

119
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,920
and cut off your funding.

120
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,240
No,

121
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,080
Mr. Qu,

122
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,610
we can't lose that funding,

123
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,080
we really can't.

124
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,000
I...

125
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,440
I was just

126
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,480
trying to discuss this with you.

127
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,159
Come,

128
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,320
Mr. Qu,

129
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,200
everything is negotiable.

130
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,330
We can work this out.

131
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,760
Luo,

132
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
come look at this.

133
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,240
January 16.

134
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,970
That's tomorrow, isn't it?

135
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,720
At this moment,

136
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,080
this association suddenly changed its tune.

137
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,880
What are they up to?

138
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,680
What are they planning?

139
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,160
We'll find out tomorrow.

140
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,960
Mr. Zhao Shengqian.

141
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,000
He has always been recognized by our Civil Search and Rescue Association

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,460
as the most outstanding rescue team leader.

143
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,080
Due to some oversight in previous work,

144
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,480
Captain Zhao has been stigmatized for a long time.

145
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,440
So today,

146
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,620
the Association is willing to bravely step forward

147
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,080
and admit our mistakes.

148
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,280
To Captain Zhao's family,

149
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,720
we express our most sincere apologies.

150
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,400
Today we are here

151
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,159
not only to restore Captain Zhao's reputation,

152
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,200
but also

153
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,640
to make amends.

154
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,120
We will pay all the overdue compensation

155
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,320
and living allowances for these years

156
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,840
to Captain Zhao's wife,

157
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,640
Mrs. Feng.

158
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,520
Please welcome Mrs. Feng and her child to the stage.

159
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,560
I never thought

160
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,170
he would have a chance to restore his reputation.

161
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,880
Although it's a bit late,

162
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
I still

163
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,880
thank you all.

164
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,120
Speaking of gratitude,

165
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,280
we would like to thank Mr. Qu for being here today.

166
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,100
This award ceremony today

167
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,050
wouldn't be possible without Mr. Qu's sponsorship.

168
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,680
In the future, our rescue team's equipment

169
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,360
will become more professional.

170
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,240
The safety of our rescue personnel

171
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,760
and their quality of life

172
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,080
will also be well guaranteed.

173
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,040
I believe

174
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,800
our Civil Rescue Association

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,880
will certainly live up to its mission.

176
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,480
We will make greater contributions

177
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,140
to the development of Yuji's tourism industry.

178
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,760
Yuji Rescue Team

179
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,960
I didn't expect you all to be here too.

180
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,160
How else would we know you helped us so much?

181
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,000
It's nothing.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,560
Alright.

183
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,840
Stop pretending.

184
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Going for that 'do good deeds anonymously' routine, huh?

185
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,600
Yes.

186
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,120
I was hard on you before,

187
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,880
but I think you did a really good job with this.

188
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,840
When the case is over,

189
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,970
I'll buy you a drink.

190
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,320
Me?

191
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,320
I'm just doing my civic duty.

192
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,799
Using the appropriate sense of social responsibility

193
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,720
to improve my personal and company image.

194
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,960
Thanking me so much

195
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,480
is a bit over the top, isn't it?

196
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,240
Not at all.

197
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,410
Should I give you a banner of honor too?

198
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,360
Okay,

199
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,240
no more joking.

200
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,960
I have some executives waiting for me over there.

201
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,720
I need to go.

202
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,650
You all carry on.

203
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,440
Sure.

204
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,560
Bye.

205
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,920
Chief Chang

206
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,360
Luo Xun, listen to me.

207
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,720
That information you asked me to check

208
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,080
about Qu Feiyu's immigration records

209
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,120
I found it.

210
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,000
She hasn't left the country in three months.

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
There's absolutely no record

212
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,600
of her entering any foreign country.

213
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,760
No immigration records?

214
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,520
Right.

215
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,320
How are things going for you guys in Yuji?

216
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,840
Luo Xun?

217
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,320
Oh.

218
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,960
It's going okay.

219
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Chief Chang, I'll talk to you later.

220
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Based on Fox's usual methods,

221
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,680
if she could manipulate an elderly person like Zheng Lanshu,

222
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,800
helping a blind person

223
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,330
commit murder for revenge isn't impossible.

224
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,700
But how did she manage to do it?

225
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,800
Luo.

226
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Come look at this.

227
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,520
Is that a wire?

228
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,200
Be careful.

229
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,240
It's fine.

230
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,890
Did you find something?

231
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,400
It's new.

232
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Must have been installed recently.

233
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,560
I suspect

234
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,380
this Buddha head was once suspended.

235
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,900
The Mountain God statue has protected Yuji Town residents for generations.

236
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,880
Without the Yuji Town residents,

237
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,480
outsiders can never leave Dead Man's Mountain.

238
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,000
Why?

239
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,360
We could have all left together.

240
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,520
Why did you do this?

241
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,960
Why?

242
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,160
Luo Xun.

243
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,840
If you had experienced what I have,

244
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,480
what form of redemption would you choose?

245
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Captain Luo.

246
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,800
Usually when people are in an enclosed space,

247
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,760
in darkness,

248
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,000
and panicking,

249
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,280
where do they hide?

250
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,850
They look for cover.

251
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,400
Victims instinctively flee from

252
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,520
the source of their fear.

253
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,920
Like a tape recorder making strange noises,

254
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
a fallen Buddha statue,

255
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,320
or Xiong Jing's body hidden in the wall.

256
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,680
To feel safe,

257
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,940
they could only go to that relatively enclosed small room.

258
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,480
All the evidence now proves

259
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,580
that this locked-room murder

260
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,760
is closely related to Zhao Shengqian's

261
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,560
mountaineering team from back then.

262
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,320
But with so many people involved,

263
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,520
which one could it be?

264
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,520
I saw a post on a forum earlier.

265
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,980
The title was exactly about this.

266
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,680
But according to the poster,

267
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,200
the only person connected to the mountaineering case

268
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,160
is Qu Feiyu.

269
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,560
Qu Feiyu?

270
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
A blind person.

271
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,160
To execute such a complex murder,

272
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,720
she couldn't have done it alone.

273
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,920
Who could it be?

274
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,660
Look at these Buddha statues.

275
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,280
Twelve of them.

276
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,760
Such a familiar number.

277
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,090
Who else could it be?

278
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,020
The Fox, of course.

279
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,080
Chi Xia.

280
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,400
Didn't you ask me to monitor

281
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,000
Xiong Jing's social media?

282
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,200
On victim Xiong Jing's social media account,

283
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,480
a video from 5 years ago was suddenly posted.

284
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,000
It shows footage she recorded of Shi Guangxuan,

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,720
Yao Lixing,

286
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,160
leading the group stealing food from Zhao Shengqian and

287
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,480
Qu Feiyu.

288
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,080
Look at the public opinion.

289
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
It's completely out of control now.

290
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,240
Move aside.

291
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,720
Mr. De.

292
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,360
We're just following orders.

293
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
Please don't make this difficult.

294
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,120
If we break the rules,

295
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,650
it won't be good for anyone.

296
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,720
If we don't complete this,

297
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,200
we won't dare go back.

298
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,440
Come.

299
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,400
Come.

300
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,960
Who made these rules you're talking about?

301
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,660
What's wrong? Don't move.

302
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,450
- Smoke.
- Smoke.

303
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,890
- Smoke.
- Smoke.

304
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,320
Give your boss a message.

305
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,680
One of these days,

306
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,520
I'll pay him a visit personally.

307
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,080
I've smoked the cigarette.

308
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,800
Is that good enough?

309
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,760
Get lost.

310
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,760
The forensic results are out.

311
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,160
The video was scheduled to be sent.

312
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,240
The video's backend shows

313
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,760
that its operation time

314
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,840
matches Xiong Jing's time of death.

315
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,000
We can basically confirm

316
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,400
it was done by the killer.

317
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,080
The video was sent

318
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,520
at 18:25.

319
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,600
Usually, scheduled times

320
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,800
are set either at half past

321
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,080
or on the hour.

322
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,720
Setting it at 25 minutes

323
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,920
is quite unusual.

324
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,040
Plus, this number 25

325
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,280
has appeared for the fourth time now, right?

326
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,800
At first, internet users were completely confused.

327
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,160
But some comments were too leading.

328
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,840
Now people have dug up

329
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,040
the whole story behind the rescue team.

330
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,340
I guess this was the killer's intention.

331
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,160
To clear Zhao Shengqian's name.

332
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,280
What's wrong?

333
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,280
There's been an incident at the guesthouse.

334
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,520
A group of people just tried to sneak into the hostel.

335
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,780
But strangely enough,

336
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
they were stopped by another group.

337
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,850
The target is Tu Guolin.

338
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,760
It must be him.

339
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,680
Captain Luo.

340
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,360
Should we check the nearby surveillance cameras?

341
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,800
No need.

342
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,320
It's dark,

343
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,120
they're wearing masks.

344
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,880
I've asked Heizi to keep watching.

345
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,680
I just talked with Jue,

346
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,010
we think that video was sent by the killer.

347
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,240
And the time it was posted

348
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,560
was 18:25.

349
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,080
25 has appeared again.

350
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,840
Indeed it has.

351
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,480
With all this commotion now,

352
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,040
Qu Feiyu definitely won't dare to go

353
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,440
to Zhao Shengqian's home for the memorial service again.

354
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,120
Look,

355
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,520
these are all the hotels,

356
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,320
inns,

357
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,960
and guesthouses in Yuji with their exact locations.

358
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,040
I've had Xiao Wei mark them all.

359
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,760
She's been deliberately concealing her itinerary before,

360
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,040
she won't leave any accommodation information.

361
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,800
That's why

362
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,520
we're choosing to act at night.

363
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,320
I've asked Xiao Wei

364
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,000
to gather all the police officers.

365
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,200
We'll split up

366
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,020
and check each room one by one.

367
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,000
This area,

368
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,260
you take care of it.

369
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,120
This area,

370
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,640
I'll handle it.

371
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,240
Alright,

372
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,460
you're so experienced, Captain Luo.

373
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,370
As long as Qu Feiyu is still in Yuji,

374
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,170
don't expect to get a good night's sleep tonight.

375
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,520
Comrade.

376
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,400
When you're delivering packages,

377
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,130
have you ever seen this person?

378
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,480
This person?

379
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,839
I think I've delivered packages to her before.

380
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,839
Is she blind?

381
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,240
Yes.

382
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,000
Where is she?

383
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,079
I think her home is in...

384
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,200
Is it reliable?

385
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,920
Wei.

386
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,240
Absolutely reliable.

387
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
This is an illegal hostel.

388
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
They only find customers online.

389
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,000
That's why last night,

390
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,240
we missed it during our search.

391
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,800
I've already had people secure both the front and back doors.

392
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,240
How did you find it?

393
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,120
I thought since Qu Feiyu is blind,

394
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,520
and Yuji is a small town,

395
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,640
if she went out,

396
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
she would definitely attract attention.

397
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,080
So I specifically looked for people

398
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,200
who move around the streets and asked them.

399
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,000
Surprisingly, I actually got information.

400
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,120
Well done.

401
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,080
But we've been watching for a while now,

402
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,800
and haven't seen any signs of her going out,

403
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,840
nor have we spotted any suspicious individuals.

404
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,100
So we don't know exactly what's going on.

405
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,200
Blind people are generally more sensitive to sounds.

406
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,000
You were right not to alert them.

407
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,400
But we still can't rule out

408
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,120
the possibility that the hostel owner

409
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,640
is harboring Qu Feiyu.

410
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,680
So before we find her exact location,

411
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,210
it's better to be cautious.

412
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,570
We're almost there.

413
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,060
Don't talk.

414
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,250
So this is your illegal business, huh?

415
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:17,920
Listen,

416
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,800
we'll deal with your situation later.

417
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,480
Right now,

418
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,440
cooperate with our investigation.

419
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,500
We ask, you answer.

420
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,800
This person,

421
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
have you seen her?

422
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,800
Is she staying here?

423
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,680
Yes,

424
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,600
she's blind, right?

425
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,080
Yes.

426
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,640
Where is she?

427
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,440
Which room?

428
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,080
Second floor.

429
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,240
Where on the second floor?

430
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,040
The balcony on the second floor.

431
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,010
You're Qu Feiyu, right?

432
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,250
We're police officers.

433
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,120
There's a case

434
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,980
we'd like you to cooperate with our investigation.

435
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,080
You've finally come.

436
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,760
Without the help of us Yuji Town residents,

437
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,890
none of you will make it out of this Death Mountain alive.

438
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,600
We are guilty.

439
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,320
You deliberately carved this on the victims, didn't you?

440
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,200
They are unforgivable.

441
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,720
Kill me.

442
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,400
You fake fox,

443
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,520
you'll never become real.
