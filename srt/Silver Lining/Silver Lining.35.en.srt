1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya.

2
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,800
Everyone,

3
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
get ready for the arrest operation.

4
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,640
Support Team Luo!

5
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,440
Move it!

6
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,360
Qu Bai,

7
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
take your men

8
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,960
and make sure to capture Chi Xia.

9
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
We'll meet at the evacuation point.

10
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:32,900
The rest of you,

11
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,520
hold back the approaching police.

12
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,400
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,080
Mountain road interception team

14
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,920
move out now.

15
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,280
Forest team

16
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,289
tighten the perimeter.

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,920
Senior,

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,720
take over for me

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,360
as temporary commander.

20
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,700
Not a single one

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,330
None of them can escape.

22
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,900
Take cover!

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,240
Move in!

24
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,300
Covering fire!

25
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,520
It's already dark now.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Old K has hidden in the dense forest.

27
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,520
His men will cover for him.

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,079
It's very difficult to capture him in the forest.

29
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,200
If something goes wrong,

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,600
and he goes into hiding,

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,980
or if he comes up with another plan...

32
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,840
Every time you make that face,

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,240
it means you have an idea.

34
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,720
Let's hear it.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,480
Right now, I'm the only one

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,740
who knows the formula.

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,400
So Old K won't rest

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
until he captures me.

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,200
And before I reveal the formula,

40
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,440
he won't dare kill me.

41
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,730
That being the case,

42
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,140
I might as well be the bait.

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,720
[POL Curly Cao Bin]

44
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,480
You two get out of there now.

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,040
Hurry up!

46
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,880
Go to the forest to support Chi Xia immediately.

47
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,520
Be careful.

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,240
Roger that.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Cover me!

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,400
I would never risk your life,

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,400
but I need your cooperation.

52
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,520
When we meet Old K,

53
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,320
I need you to pretend to stop me,

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,440
then secretly let me go.

55
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,560
I'll lead Old K into our trap.

56
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,720
Huang Rui.

57
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,800
It seems

58
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,130
you haven't let me down.

59
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,880
Qu Bai.

60
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,520
Well done.

61
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,090
You've certainly left yourself plenty of backup plans.

62
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,920
Chi Xia,

63
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,160
when it comes to turning people,

64
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,060
you're not clever enough.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,360
Go!

66
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,000
Hurry!

67
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,360
Move!

68
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Police! Freeze!

69
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,660
Drop your weapons!

70
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,060
Don't move!

71
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,250
Put the gun down!

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,160
Drop it!

73
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,160
Hands up!

74
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,810
Get down!

75
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,360
Team Four,

76
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,960
follow me.

77
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,920
Yes, sir.

78
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,220
Don't move!

79
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,280
Stay down!

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,800
Your so-called perfect trap

81
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,920
is nothing but

82
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,600
full of holes.

83
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,040
Let's go.

84
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,960
Back to Lawa Village,

85
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,480
I have ten thousand ways

86
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
to make you talk.

87
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,690
Nobody move!

88
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,980
Drop your weapons!

89
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,320
Everyone freeze!

90
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,040
Get down! Police!

91
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,840
Drop the gun!

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,360
Drop your weapons!

93
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,440
Hands up!

94
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,240
Put it down!

95
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,360
Drop it!

96
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,800
Get down!

97
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,600
The gun might go off.

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,260
No one will collect your body.

99
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,000
Brother Jue.

100
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
It seems

101
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,560
I truly underestimated you.

102
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,200
The show is finally over.

103
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,520
No one is interested in playing along anymore.

104
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,409
It's time to wrap things up.

105
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,120
Take him away.

106
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,159
Take him away.

107
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,960
Go.

108
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,500
Captain Luo, give me a chance.

109
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,040
You'll spend the rest of your life with regret,

110
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,840
doubt,

111
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,560
and remorse.

112
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,640
Step by step, you'll walk toward your own execution ground.

113
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,240
Those who died because of you

114
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,440
will haunt you day and night,

115
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,680
whispering in your ear over and over,

116
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,640
asking why you did it.

117
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
Young Master!

118
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,400
Hang in there!

119
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,280
Qubai,

120
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,970
don't speak.

121
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,409
Save your strength.

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,400
Don't worry.

123
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,640
I promise I'll take good care of Chi Xia.

124
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,480
Young Master!

125
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,820
Doctor!

126
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,809
Please, I beg you, save him!

127
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,240
Doctor!

128
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,840
Young Master!

129
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,120
Young Master!

130
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,760
Young Master!

131
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Move forward.

132
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,760
Don't look back.

133
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,080
Little fox.

134
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,880
You must survive.

135
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,600
I have a sister.

136
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,040
Whenever she won a fight,

137
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,360
she'd get some persimmons.

138
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,690
But she never ate them herself.

139
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,840
She always saved them for me.

140
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,570
What a coincidence.

141
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,250
I used to get into fights when I was little.

142
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,810
Whenever I got hurt,

143
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,760
my brother would give me a lychee candy.

144
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
He told me

145
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,050
to eat some candy

146
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,540
and the wound wouldn't hurt anymore.

147
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,800
Please save

148
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,520
my brother.

149
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,360
You're awake.

150
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Is everyone okay?

151
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Everyone's fine.

152
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,880
Take it easy.

153
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,400
How's your wound?

154
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,760
I'm fine.

155
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,280
How is Qubai?

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,320
No.

157
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,450
I'll go check on him.

158
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,720
Chi Xia.

159
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,280
The doctor said

160
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,650
you need to rest.

161
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,960
I just want to see him.

162
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,680
Which room is he in?

163
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,480
Listen to me.

164
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,080
Chi Xia.

165
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,880
What?

166
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,160
Chi Xia.

167
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,840
Listen to me.

168
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,760
Chi Xia.

169
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,120
Let me go!

170
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,840
Calm down.

171
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,200
Please calm down.

172
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,480
Let me go, Luo Xun.

173
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,800
I just want to see him.

174
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,400
Calm down.

175
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,160
I just need to see him once.

176
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Please calm down.

177
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,320
Luo Xun, I'm begging you.

178
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,720
Let me see him just once.

179
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,840
He's my only family left in this world.

180
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,600
Let me see him.

181
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,120
Listen to me.

182
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,680
Just one look.

183
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,200
Listen.

184
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,840
Qu Bai.

185
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,520
You...

186
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,720
Qu Bai.

187
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,600
Qu Bai is dead.

188
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,920
Chi Xia.

189
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,840
Chi Xia.

190
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,840
Chi Xia.

191
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,160
Are you okay?

192
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,920
From now on,

193
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,960
I'm all alone.

194
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,040
Chi Xia.

195
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,920
Chi Xia!

196
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,520
Chi Xia!

197
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,760
Doctor!

198
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,680
Someone help!

199
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,440
Chi Xia!

200
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,880
Help! Quickly!

201
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,080
Doctor!

202
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,000
Chi Xia

203
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,320
Chi Xia

204
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,400
Why did you name me Chi Xia that year?

205
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,600
Because

206
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,040
summer came particularly late that year.

207
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,000
Chi Xia.

208
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,080
I like this name.

209
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,400
Summer has come just as late this year.

210
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,280
I wish you were still here.

211
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,700
I've always been here.

212
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,980
There are countless paths in this world,

213
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,140
but I've always wanted to take the one leading home.

214
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,200
Little fox.

215
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,320
I hope on this thorny path,

216
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,320
you can cut through the brambles

217
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,920
and clear a way for all those who have no choice.

218
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,760
Including yourself.

219
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,840
Jinzi.

220
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,840
I've come to see you.

221
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,580
It's my fault I couldn't find him sooner.

222
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,690
It's not your fault.

223
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,200
Don't cry.

224
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,040
Salute.

225
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,640
Recently,

226
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,320
our city police have cracked a major case

227
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,960
involving the Lawazhai overseas criminal organization led by Huang Weisheng.

228
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,080
They are charged with human trafficking,

229
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,120
running illegal gambling operations,

230
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,280
solicitation of murder,

231
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,040
smuggling,

232
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,520
illegal possession of drugs and other crimes.

233
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,450
Now let's see the detailed report.

234
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,120
Do you think they'll film us?

235
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,250
They probably will.

236
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,280
Chief Chang.

237
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Solving this case

238
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,240
wouldn't have been possible without everyone's hard work.

239
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,770
You've all done a great job.

240
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,960
Chief Chang,

241
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,680
no need to be so formal right now,

242
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,360
right?

243
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,160
You're right.

244
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Let's do something tangible.

245
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,800
Not just verbal praise.

246
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,200
Something more substantial.

247
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,760
Well,

248
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,120
dinner's on me tonight.

249
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,840
What would you like to eat?

250
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,800
Order whatever you want.

251
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,280
Great!

252
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,960
Where are Luo Xun and Chi Xia?

253
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,480
They said they're going to some secret place,

254
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,200
I think.

255
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,480
Lin Wenjue,

256
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
I've noticed that after hanging out with them for so long,

257
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,300
you're starting to become less serious too.

258
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,960
Alright,

259
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,600
after work,

260
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,440
see you at the restaurant.

261
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:36,920
Sure thing!

262
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,200
Take care, Chief Chang.

263
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,930
Chief Chang!

264
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,120
Spicy hot pot, okay?

265
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,040
Got it.

266
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,360
Come on, let's continue.

267
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,800
Last time I came here with you

268
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,200
it felt quite magical.

269
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
This place makes one feel peaceful.

270
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,480
Look at this lake.

271
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,840
It's just like our lives.

272
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,840
Sometimes calm.

273
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,040
Sometimes turbulent.

274
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,820
But no matter what difficulties we face,

275
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,240
we always find

276
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,780
the strength to move forward.

277
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,960
Yes.

278
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,680
I once felt lost

279
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,640
because of my lost memories.

280
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,240
You all gave me a second life,

281
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,920
gave me a family again,

282
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,920
and helped me understand

283
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,380
what true teamwork means.

284
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,800
Officer Chi,

285
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,610
we're family, let's be straightforward.

286
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,000
Here's to our

287
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,440
revolutionary friendship,

288
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,060
may it be unbreakable.

289
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,280
Unbreakable.

290
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,090
To a pleasant cooperation.

291

Let's keep up the good work.

292

through scorching sun and bitter cold,

294
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
