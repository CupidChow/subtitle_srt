1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya.

2
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,850
You got what you wanted.

3
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,360
Now you

4
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,240
can finally relax completely.

5
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,080
Look at your mother.

6
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,840
Do you miss her?

7
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,320
Her death anniversary is coming soon.

8
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,320
Take that step.

9
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,680
Just like your mother did.

10
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,880
Just one step.

11
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,640
You'll see her soon.

12
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,280
I knew about my dad's illegal card room.

13
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,440
And that my mom was paying off his debts.

14
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,800
I also knew

15
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,520
my father's public humiliation

16
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
was the last straw for my mother.

17
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,610
Otherwise, how do you think

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,900
Xu Xiaodao was caught so quickly?

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,520
If Liang Ruqing hadn't used tutoring as an excuse

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,050
to interfere in our family,

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,740
my mother, even if living miserably,

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,500
wouldn't have chosen to jump.

23
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,920
My mother and I wouldn't be separated by death.

24
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,180
So she deserves to die.

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,660
But you don't know that

26
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,520
the last text your mother sent before she died

27
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,880
was to Teacher Liang.

28
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,200
Thanking her.

29
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,640
This

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,060
is what we found in Liang Ruqing's phone.

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,980
Your mother had attempted

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
suicide multiple times before.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,880
It was always Liang Ruqing who talked her out of it.

34
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,010
Your tutoring fees -

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
Liang Ruqing never took a penny.

36
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,000
Even some of the gambling debts your mother paid for your father

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,240
came from Liang Ruqing's financial support.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Do you think such a person

39
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,970
would encourage your mother to jump to her death?

40
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
Just now on the rooftop,

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,220
I think you've already realized.

42
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,200
Actually, you and Liang Ruqing are the same -

43
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,640
both implanted with the psychological anchor to commit suicide afterward.

44
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,440
Xu Yang.

45
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,740
You're a smart person.

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,560
The person who manipulated you will never let you go.

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,000
So there's only one path ahead of you now.

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,160
Tell the police the truth.

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,060
Help catch the person who dragged you into this.

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,920
This way you can also atone for wrongfully killing Liang Ruqing.

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,920
And I believe

52
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,920
your mother

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,760
would certainly want to see you do this.

54
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,760
After my mother passed away,

55
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,280
I felt like I lost my soul.

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,600
I couldn't get out of my grief at all.

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,440
My classmates saw my social media posts

58
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,240
and all urged me to get psychological counseling.

59
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,720
You should really see a therapist.

60
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,240
I hate the way they talk.

61
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,200
They've never lost a mother.

62
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,680
They can't possibly understand how I feel.

63
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,160
Xu Yang.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,860
I don't have a mental illness.

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720
I just can't accept

66
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,880
the reality that my mother passed away.

67
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,570
A few months ago.

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
I met this female doctor named Hu Li.

69
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,040
What else do you know

70
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,720
about this female doctor?

71
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,040
She always wore a mask

72
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,720
or large sunglasses.

73
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,880
Even during hypnosis,

74
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,840
when she took off her mask,

75
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,700
I couldn't make out her true face.

76
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,290
But she was sincere,

77
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,850
understood me well,

78
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,170
and could always read my thoughts.

79
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,960
She said she's a psychiatrist

80
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,080
and asked me to help her with a therapy project.

81
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:57,960
Hu Li.

82
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,040
She's the only attending physician in the psychiatric department.

83
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,920
Go on.

84
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,560
The important thing is

85
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,400
she doesn't lecture me like everyone else

86
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,920
telling me to move on with my life.

87
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,380
Do you remember what your mother looks like?

88
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,920
Now close your eyes.

89
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,720
I'll take you to find her.

90
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,600
She misses you very much.

91
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,800
She helps me see the memories

92
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,400
of daily life with my mother.

93
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,060
That's why I trust her.

94
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,530
And I'm grateful to her.

95
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,840
Your mother was manipulated into committing suicide.

96
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,440
Don't you want to avenge her?

97
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,159
The learning atmosphere at the technical school is unstable.

98
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,880
Dr. Hu told me to pretend to be studious

99
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,530
to attract Liang Ruqing's attention.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,930
Thank you, Miss.

101
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,640
Xu Yang.

102
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,560
I've been wanting to talk to you,

103
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,620
but I was afraid it would make you sad.

104
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,520
I'm glad to see you're moving on.

105
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,640
It makes me happy.

106
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,080
Miss,

107
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,520
I'm actually fine.

108
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,020
But your dark circles are getting worse lately.

109
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,400
Are you not sleeping well?

110
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,200
It's nothing.

111
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,200
I've been having insomnia for quite some time now.

112
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,040
You should go back now

113
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,080
and get some rest.

114
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,960
After my mother passed away,

115
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,360
I often had insomnia too.

116
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,320
Oh, Miss,

117
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,280
this doctor is really good.

118
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,500
You might want to give it a try.

119
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,560
Okay.

120
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,600
Thank you.

121
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,340
Goodbye, teacher.

122
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,400
So,

123
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
the doctor you recommended to Liang Ruqing

124
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,780
is this female doctor?

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,200
How many times did she go?

126
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
I don't know.

127
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,520
Did you go with her?

128
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
I went with her the first few times,

129
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,140
but later she went by herself.

130
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,240
What was the specific treatment process?

131
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,280
Hu Li didn't allow outsiders to be present.

132
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,680
There were two occasions

133
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,700
when Liang Ruqing's condition actually improved.

134
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,720
I asked her

135
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,920
about the revenge we planned,

136
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,650
why things turned out this way.

137
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,960
But she said everything was going according to plan.

138
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,760
You claim you didn't know anything,

139
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,720
so why did you give Liang Ruqing a pen?

140
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,380
Hu Li asked me to give it to him.

141
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,600
She didn't tell me why.

142
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,840
She just told me to wait patiently.

143
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,740
But two days later,

144
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,360
Liang Ruqing harmed himself and jumped off a building right in front of me.

145
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
I don't know how she managed to do it.

146
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,260
Let's talk about this jersey.

147
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,680
This is Bulls player Korr's jersey.

148
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,840
I did some research.

149
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Compared to other popular players,

150
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,340
he has almost no fans in this country.

151
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,000
And your classmate mentioned

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,040
that you used to wear

153
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,480
Kobe's number 24 jersey.

154
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,420
So why did you change numbers?

155
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,280
Hu Li told me to change it.

156
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,040
She didn't tell me why.

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,120
I'm curious too.

158
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,080
What does this have to do with hypnosis?

159
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,880
Xu Yang.

160
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
You're too clever for your own good.

161
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,530
At the moment Liang Ruqing was killed,

162
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,000
you had already figured out

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
how to clear yourself of suspicion.

164
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,160
Did you think

165
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,360
pretending to know about hypnotic murder would help you?

166
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,640
Then you can shift all the blame

167
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,760
onto a fictional person.

168
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,800
I'm telling the truth.

169
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
If what you're saying is true,

170
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,159
your behavior

171
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,400
was the most crucial part in plotting against Liang Ruqing.

172
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,640
How could that female doctor

173
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,440
possibly hide the most critical step from you,

174
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,700
the hypnosis process?

175
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,559
What if something went wrong

176
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
and the plan failed?

177
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
She said the less I knew, the better.

178
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,440
Even if the police caught me,

179
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,660
they couldn't convict me.

180
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,680
Just like my mother

181
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,410
who was killed by Liang Ruqing.

182
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,440
If the law can't find evidence to punish the perpetrators,

183
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,770
then we'll find our own way to punish them.

184
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,120
Officer Chi.

185
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,170
If your beloved family member died

186
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,360
and the law couldn't punish the killer,

187
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,760
I think

188
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,050
you would seek revenge by other means too.

189
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,490
Director Chang.

190
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,080
Come in.

191
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,880
Have a seat.

192
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,920
Brother Jue.

193
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,650
Let's begin.

194
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,090
Director Chang.

195
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,080
We've checked all surveillance footage

196
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,480
and found that this female doctor named Hu Li

197
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
has extremely strong counter-surveillance awareness.

198
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,560
During her interactions with Xu Yang,

199
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,090
she didn't leave any clues.

200
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,240
Although none of us have been idle lately,

201
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,640
we still

202
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
don't know what she looks like.

203
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,370
Director Chang,

204
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,120
there's also this number, 25.

205
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,040
Zhou Yanzhen murdered

206
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
three girls who were all 25 years old,

207
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,400
and Xu Yang wore the number 25 jersey.

208
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,730
It's all quite strange.

209
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,600
Obviously, there's a bigger conspiracy behind this Hu Li.

210
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
I find it strange too.

211
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,000
But based on what we know so far,

212
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,640
we can't rule out coincidence,

213
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,880
or the possibility that someone's being deliberately mysterious.

214
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,040
So apart from the number 25,

215
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,800
are there

216
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,840
any other suspicious

217
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,240
or related numbers?

218
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,100
Yes, there are.

219
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,240
12.

220
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,800
Zhou Yanchen, the drowning victim, had a total of 12 paintings.

221
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,640
And Liang Ruqing stabbed herself 12 times.

222
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,920
But I think this number 12,

223
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,640
compared to 25,

224
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,370
seems more like a coincidence.

225
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,480
Twelve.

226
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,440
Twenty-five.

227
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,920
Interesting.

228
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,640
It's fine.

229
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,200
Well,

230
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,980
during an investigation,

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,120
having different perspectives

232
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
is better than being thick-headed.

233
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,400
Besides,

234
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,600
no general wins every battle.

235
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,800
Hasn't Xu Yang, the mastermind, already confessed?

236
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,600
This shows we haven't suffered a complete defeat.

237
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,400
From now on,

238
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,520
it's not something we need to worry about.

239
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,240
By the way,

240
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,000
let's follow procedure and

241
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,740
transfer this case to the prosecutor's office.

242
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,840
Xu Yang's mother has passed away,

243
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,560
and his father is suspected of a crime.

244
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,640
I've already spoken with the

245
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,080
juvenile prosecution department.

246
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,120
They'll communicate with the school

247
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,600
to find a temporary guardian as soon as possible

248
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,000
to handle the paperwork.

249
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,440
Good.

250
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,360
Chief Chang,

251
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,970
I have a suggestion.

252
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,960
Cases like Xu Yang's,

253
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,320
juvenile crimes aren't isolated incidents.

254
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,560
Many children's minds

255
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
aren't fully developed.

256
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,120
Their emotions

257
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,280
and ideas can easily be misguided.

258
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,610
Do you think we could

259
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,160
contact the education department

260
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,480
to conduct some

261
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,340
mental health awareness activities for children?

262
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
That's an excellent suggestion,

263
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,840
and this case

264
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,200
provides the perfect opportunity.

265
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,930
I'll report it to my superiors.

266
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,240
Also,

267
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,040
everyone,

268
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
catching foxes

269
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,420
is a long-term battle.

270
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,320
So,

271
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,440
we need to stay confident.

272
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,760
Everyone's been working too hard lately.

273
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,160
Go home and get some rest,

274
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,280
recharge your batteries,

275
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,880
we have bigger battles ahead.

276
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,000
Alright.

277
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,240
That concludes today's meeting.

278
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,280
Everyone go rest.

279
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,200
Cheer up.

280
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:06,880
Alright.

281
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,810
Director Chang.

282
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,480
Cheer up.

283
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,000
Luo Xun.

284
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,680
You must stay focused.

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,330
You're the team leader,

286
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,660
set an example.

287
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,400
Ms. Liang,

288
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,450
this is your last therapy session.

289
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,840
Now.

290
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,360
Let's take a deep breath

291
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,560
and relax.

292
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,960
Imagine

293
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,000
you are completely relaxed now.

294
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,000
As you relax, you'll realize

295
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,920
you deserve this finest pen before you.

296
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,560
You're the best teacher for first and second graders.

297
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,000
The knowledge from books

298
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,440
has long been etched into your mind

299
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
and into your very bones.

300
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,560
Now we bow our heads

301
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,940
and peel back your flesh and bone.

302
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,920
Look at it.

303
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,480
Can you hear it?

304
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,680
This is the most beautiful melody in your heart.

305
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,360
It carries your pride.

306
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,680
You're about to step onto

307
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,940
the stage that symbolizes the highest honor for teachers.

308
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,120
Now we slowly

309
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,840
walk toward it.

310
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,120
Step onto that platform.

311
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,880
Take that step.

312
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,760
Your soul is about to transcend.

313
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,040
Don't kill me.

314
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,720
Please.

315
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,760
Don't kill me.

316
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,040
Don't kill me.

317
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,840
I beg you.

318
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,720
Spare me.

319
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,560
People like us

320
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,000
are born with sin.

321
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,080
Come on,

322
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,720
tell me

323
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,520
what's wrong.

324
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,080
You were sweating profusely earlier.

325
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,480
I noticed something was off during the meeting.

326
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,280
Are you okay?

327
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,320
Luo,

328
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,960
Do you think in my subconscious

329
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,200
I'm someone who desires to commit crimes?

330
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,060
What nonsense?

331
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,480
Do you think I'm like Zhou Yanchen

332
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,680
or someone like Hu Li,

333
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,080
someone who pursues evil?

334
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,560
Are you sick with a fever

335
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,720
and talking crazy?

336
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Why are you talking nonsense again?

337
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,720
To be honest,

338
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,660
when you first joined the major crimes unit,

339
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,880
you always liked to think

340
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,200
from the suspects' perspective.

341
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,800
You analyzed cases thoroughly and logically.

342
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,010
And you spoke in such a cold manner.

343
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,380
Most importantly,

344
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,080
you would stand in the criminals'

345
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,760
shoes and empathize with them.

346
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,000
That kind of state,

347
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,200
it was quite chilling.

348
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,200
But

349
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,099
after spending time with you,

350
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,359
anyone could see

351
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,880
you were just analyzing the cases objectively.

352
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,680
What's wrong?

353
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,000
Have you spent too much time

354
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,440
in a criminal's mindset and started doubting yourself?

355
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,300
Let me tell you,

356
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,960
you're just under too much pressure lately

357
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
and not getting enough rest.

358
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,400
It's nothing to worry about.

359
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,050
Maybe you're right.

360
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,440
Officer Chi

361
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,650
If your beloved family member died

362
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,840
and the law couldn't punish the killer.

363
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,000
I think

364
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,250
you would seek revenge by other means too.

365
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,500
It must have been painful.

366
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,680
This victim

367
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,160
must have had many stories in their life.

368
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,480
Take me to see Xiaorou.

369
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,000
I'll kill you! Give me back my Xiaorou!

370
00:18:59,440 --> 00:18:59,970
Starring

371
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,400
