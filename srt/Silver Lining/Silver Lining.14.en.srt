1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya

2
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,160
Xixi

3
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,240
Grandma's good grandson

4
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,519
Poor child

5
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,480
Mrs. Zheng

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,039
I asked around.

7
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,700
Someone in the village saw

8
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,080
Pei Xinlu pushed Xixi from upstairs

9
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,640
and secretly buried the body.

10
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,080
Pei Xinlu

11
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,620
The police say it was an accident.

12
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,000
They won't do anything about it.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,120
We can't let that beast get away with it.

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,920
Make Pei Xinlu pay with his life.

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,640
Don't worry, Mrs. Zheng.

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,810
I'll take you to find him tomorrow.

17
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,400
Let's get some sleep now.

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,120
Okay?

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,360
Pei Xinlu

20
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,100
Make him pay with his life.

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,039
Pei Xinlu

22
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,920
Pay with his life.

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,560
Pei Xinlu.

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,480
Just three months ago.

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,240
I was coming back after drinking outside,

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,840
when I heard a loud noise.

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,600
Pei Xinlu.

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,730
I looked over there.

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,000
This is what you and Zhou Wanrou owe me.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,280
This is the retribution you deserve.

31
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,840
No, please.

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,640
Don't kill me.

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:29,970
Xixi.

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,760
Don't kill me.

35
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Don't move. Stay still.

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,880
Don't kill me.

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,480
Xixi.

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,440
Old Pei's house was under renovation at that time.

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,160
There was a stone sculpture at the entrance.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,240
With a half-finished rebar frame on top of it.

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,960
Pei Xi fell right onto that rebar frame.

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,420
He was impaled instantly.

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,210
Was that woman Zhou Wanrou?

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,400
Officer,

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,930
my foot's gone numb.

46
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,840
Thank you.

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,840
Yes.

48
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,760
One night last month,

49
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,080
I saw her coming back with Pei Xinlu.

50
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,840
But she seemed to leave very early the next morning.

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,960
How did Zhou Wanrou react

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,200
when she saw her own son die in front of her?

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,440
She had no reaction at all.

54
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
I was puzzled at the time.

55
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,920
As a mother,

56
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,360
her son was gone,

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,960
yet she acted like nothing happened.

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,360
I guess she'd had enough.

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,320
A sick child is hard to raise.

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,720
So then you spread rumors

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,600
that Pei Xinlu killed Pei Xi,

62
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,280
didn't you?

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,600
Let me tell you,

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,680
you better tell me the truth.

65
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,880
Don't make me find out myself.

66
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,079
I'll talk, I'll talk.

67
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,800
I was really drunk that day.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,600
I...

69
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,079
I was terrified when I saw what happened.

70
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,880
I don't even remember how I got home and went to bed.

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,200
Then I thought,

72
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,610
early the next morning,

73
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,120
I should go check on his house.

74
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,780
But his house looked like nothing had happened.

75
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,079
Then I thought,

76
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,000
I should call Pei Xinlu,

77
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,280
but he ignored me.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,440
Then that night I went to Old Wang's place and had some drinks.

79
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,160
I got drunk again

80
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,000
and started bragging about what I knew.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,160
You weren't trying to blackmail Pei Xinlu,

82
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,400
but he had nothing to hide,

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,640
so you spread rumors out of revenge?

84
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,800
No,

85
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,560
officer,

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,120
that's not fair.

87
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,760
No blackmail.

88
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,330
Back to Zhou Wanrou.

89
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,760
You said about a month ago

90
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,890
you saw her coming back with Pei Xinlu.

91
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,530
Were you drinking then?

92
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,399
Not at that time.

93
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,600
You were definitely sober?

94
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,660
Absolutely sober.

95
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,519
Are you sure that woman was Zhou Wanrou?

96
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,360
I'm certain.

97
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,680
Jue

98
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,000
Cao Bin

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,720
come here.

100
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
Any findings?

101
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,520
I checked the recent surveillance footage.

102
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,560
This looks like Pei Xinlu's car.

103
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,240
Look.

104
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,520
It's still not clear.

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,659
Can you enhance it?

106
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,560
Let me try.

107
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,000
Dong E·B8069

108
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,600
It is Pei Xinlu's car.

109
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,680
This is heading toward the suburbs.

110
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,340
Let's see where this guy is going.

111
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,760
This is the place.

112
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,320
The car went in

113
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
but the person never came out again.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Let's go.

115
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll kill you!

116
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,600
You killed Xixi!

117
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,680
Cao Wenwu!

118
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,560
It's up to you now.

119
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,159
Don't worry.

120
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,200
I know what I'm doing.

121
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,320
He won't get away.

122
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,940
You'll pay with your life!

123
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,850
Give me back my Xixi!

124
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,000
Cao Bin!

125
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,820
The deceased should be Pei Xinlu.

126
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,370
The line between the falling point and landing point

127
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,650
The angle from the vertical

128
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,080
is about 15 degrees.

129
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,260
It's too small.

130
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,120
With Pei Xi's weight

131
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,600
and a slight external force,

132
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,930
the resulting parabola

133
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,680
would push him to a farther position.

134
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,120
Your phone.

135
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,920
You take it.

136
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,760
Captain Luo.

137
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,320
This is Chi Xia.

138
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,920
We're together.

139
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,680
Go ahead.

140
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,039
We just found

141
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,480
a body in the abandoned building that might be Pei Xinlu.

142
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,840
The face is severely decomposed.

143
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,520
Before death,

144
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,400
he was tortured.

145
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,880
The crime scene was cleaned thoroughly.

146
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,679
Also,

147
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,960
we found a letter

148
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,640
where Pei Xinlu confesses to killing his wife

149
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,880
and son.

150
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,960
He also specified

151
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,920
that all his assets

152
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,760
and company

153
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,560
were transferred to Ji Shiqing.

154
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,970
I just analyzed the situation.

155
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,520
When Pei Xi fell,

156
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,160
with just a slight push,

157
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,440
he would have landed on the flat ground in front of him.

158
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,920
He could only have landed on that rebar

159
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,720
if he fell straight down.

160
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,890
So I think San Dangzi saw it correctly.

161
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,320
Pei Xi's death was probably an accident.

162
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,080
Wait.

163
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,880
There's something wrong with Pei Xinlu's confession letter.

164
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,680
Cao Bin.

165
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,960
Bring in Ji Shiqing.

166
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,160
I'll interrogate her when I get back.

167
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,680
Okay.

168
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,360
Got it.

169
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,480
I don't know.

170
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,680
I really don't know.

171
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,760
This Ji Shiqing

172
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,280
not only has a suspicious relationship with Zhang Chao behind the scenes,

173
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,200
From what we know now,

174
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,360
she also has deep connections with Pei Xinlu.

175
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,320
But after several rounds of interrogation,

176
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,680
she claims to know nothing

177
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,140
and refuses to talk at all.

178
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,610
What's your relationship with Pei Xinlu?

179
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,920
We're just superior and subordinate.

180
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,050
I didn't force him to transfer assets.

181
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,520
It was all voluntary.

182
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,160
As for anything else,

183
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
I know nothing.

184
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,680
Brother Jue.

185
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,040
Tell her.

186
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,160
If she wants to inherit Pei Xinlu's company,

187
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,000
she'll have to inherit their company's debts too.

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,240
Use this to scare her.

189
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,730
We've already verified

190
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,210
the financial details of Xinrou Foreign Trade Company.

191
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,840
You probably don't know yet

192
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,300
that this company is over 20 million in debt.

193
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,210
If you still refuse to confess,

194
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,420
when you inherit the company,

195
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,680
you'll be stuck paying off those debts.

196
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,000
Listen,

197
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
I need to tell you.

198
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
I installed a tracker

199
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,040
in Pei Xinlu's car.

200
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,120
That day,

201
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,080
I saw his car

202
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,480
parked at an abandoned building

203
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,540
and it hadn't moved for several days.

204
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
I was curious,

205
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,960
so I followed the signal.

206
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,620
At that moment,

207
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,760
I was terrified.

208
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,040
Then I found Pei Xinlu's body.

209
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,440
I also found a suicide note.

210
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,080
I don't know what came over me,

211
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,160
but I suddenly got greedy

212
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,280
and altered the suicide note.

213
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,240
I was just blinded by greed for a moment.

214
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,720
I never thought it would turn out like this.

215
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,080
Why did you put a tracker in his car?

216
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,160
Because I like him.

217
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,440
Being with Zhang Chao

218
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,560
was just for fun.

219
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,680
I've always liked Pei Xinlu.

220
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,520
I don't want to be just

221
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,050
a small employee under him.

222
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,160
I'm really tired of living in poverty.

223
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,360
I believe I definitely have a chance

224
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,220
to make him fall for me gradually.

225
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,960
As long as he divorces for me,

226
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,960
my life in the future

227
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,000
will slowly get better.

228
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,520
He's already cheating with other women.

229
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,920
So I have a chance too.

230
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,640
What do I lack?

231
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,680
I'm still so young.

232
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,080
The other woman.

233
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
That woman.

234
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,090
I've only seen her once.

235
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,100
She looks very much like Zhou Wanrou.

236
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,810
Extremely similar.

237
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,080
Stop.

238
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,080
Right here.

239
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,800
Zoom in.

240
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,600
What's wrong?

241
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,360
What's the issue?

242
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
This Zhou Wanrou.

243
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,890
Has such long fingernails.

244
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,240
She doesn't look at all like

245
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,440
a housewife who takes care of children.

246
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,600
And her interactions with Pei Xinlu

247
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,560
seem very strange.

248
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
Especially Pei Xinlu.

249
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,920
He can't even make eye contact with the police.

250
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,120
He looks nervous.

251
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,880
Anxious.

252
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,360
Yes.

253
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,360
Well.

254
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
The demon's 72 transformations.

255
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,730
Couldn't escape our Chi Dasheng's fiery eyes after all.

256
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,680
Captain Luo,

257
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,320
Chi Xia,

258
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Dr. Ning wants you both to come over.

259
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,240
Mr. Ning,

260
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,040
what's wrong?

261
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,600
Here.

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,800
This

263
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,720
is Pei Xinlu's autopsy report.

264
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Take another close look at his body.

265
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,900
See if anything comes to mind.

266
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,320
These wounds

267
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,040
are highly similar to Zhou Wanrou's injuries when she died.

268
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,840
That's right.

269
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,720
So his actual cause of death

270
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,160
wasn't from the fall,

271
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,640
but from being impaled by a sharp object.

272
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,540
Initial assessment suggests it was a steel rod.

273
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,570
Pei Xi and Zhou Wanrou died one after another.

274
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,640
Pei Xilu's body has

275
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,440
injuries highly similar to Zhou Wanrou's.

276
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,570
This manner of death

277
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,770
is also highly similar to Pei Xi's.

278
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,130
It's a revenge killing.

279
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,440
The motive for revenge is

280
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,300
Pei Xi and Zhou Wanrou's murders.

281
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,600
I checked the surveillance footage.

282
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,200
Ji Shiqing did visit the abandoned building.

283
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,060
What she said should be the truth.

284
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,420
We can temporarily rule out Ji Shiqing as a suspect.

285
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,400
But what's troubling is

286
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,760
she still can't provide any information

287
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,220
about that woman who resembles Zhou Wanrou.

288
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,000
Do you think

289
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,840
that woman Ji Shiqing mentioned

290
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,600
who had an affair with Pei Xinlu

291
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,960
and the woman that Sandangzi mistook for

292
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,280
Zhou Wanrou

293
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,680
Could they possibly be the same person?

294
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,280
The key question is

295
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,980
who exactly is this woman?

296
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,780
This Pei Xinlu is quite interesting.

297
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,520
His taste is quite consistent.

298
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,200
When he cheats,

299
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,760
he always chooses women who look similar to Zhou Wanrou.

300
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,200
Someone who doesn't know better

301
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,600
would definitely mistake these two women as the same person.

302
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,080
Investigate.

303
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,000
What are you thinking about?

304
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,880
You scared me.

305
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,480
Why aren't you going home after work?

306
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,240
Let's go.

307
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,300
I'll take you home.

308
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,080
It's fine.

309
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,820
I'll walk by myself later.

310
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,920
I didn't mean to.

311
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,440
Your phone was just sitting there.

312
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,770
It was hard not to see it.

313
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,320
She's gone.

314
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,360
Sir,

315
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,880
we just received instructions from above.

316
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,610
You need to temporarily hand over the Jack Drive.

317
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,040
The Jack Drive contains

318
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,970
confidential personnel files of the organization.

319
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,140
It's crucial for controlling all underground forces.

320
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,100
If it falls into her hands,

321
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,960
chaos will inevitably follow.

322
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,240
Should we

323
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,080
continue to intervene?

324
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,720
Keep a close eye on her first.

325
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,000
If there's any suspicious movement,

326
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,460
take action immediately.

327
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,320
Don't worry.

328
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,970
Let's get ready to move.

329
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,160
This Yu Jia

330
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,400
is an important suspect

331
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,660
and could also be the next victim.

332
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,560
This fake Pan Haili used a false identity

333
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,320
but what was her purpose in instigating murder?

334
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,240
This symbol

335
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,480
is a fox.
