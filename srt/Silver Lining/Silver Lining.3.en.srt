1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya

2
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,760
Five years ago in Dongzhou,

3
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,200
346 Pingjiang Road,

4
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,920
the Zhou family massacre.

5
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,840
You claimed that while repairing an air conditioner, you got into an argument

6
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,100
and then killed all five family members.

7
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,420
Is that really what happened?

8
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,280
The youngest victim at the scene

9
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,740
had a wooden carving of a cat in their pocket.

10
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,039
Later, the police found

11
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,440
many similar wooden carvings at your home.

12
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,080
Cats.

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,840
Do they have

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
some special meaning to you?

15
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,720
The girl brought a cat home that day.

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,000
Her family was allergic to cat hair,

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,259
so cats were never allowed in their home.

18
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,160
So they killed the cat.

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,020
You witnessed everything

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,840
and on behalf of that cat,

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,160
you judged them.

22
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,720
One cat,

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,600
five human lives.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,360
Quite a bargain.

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,800
Bullshit!

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,530
How the hell would I kill people over a cat?

27
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,000
Three days after the Zhou family massacre,

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,930
there was a fire across the street.

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,880
In the home of the deceased Lin couple,

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,009
similar cat carvings were also found.

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,400
Strangely enough,

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,560
their cat wasn't found dead at the fire scene,

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,760
but disappeared.

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,400
You love cats so much.

35
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Where do you think

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,320
the cat went?

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,400
Officer,

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
I don't feel well.

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,160
I want to end this interview.

40
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,360
I'm not feeling well.

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,600
Officer.

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,240
We're actually the same kind of people.

43
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,040
Tu Guo'an yesterday

44
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,360
suddenly felt unwell.

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
When the doctor came in for diagnosis,

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,880
he grabbed medical scissors.

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,140
He cut his major artery

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,020
and almost couldn't be saved.

49
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,000
As the last person who saw him,

50
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,100
shouldn't you tell us something?

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,000
Tu Guo'an's death sentence was upheld in the second trial

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,920
and has been sent to the Supreme Procuratorate for review.

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,579
It could be issued at any time.

54
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,960
Why would he choose to commit suicide now?

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Good question.

56
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,690
That's what we want to know too.

57
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
Before Tu Guo'an's suicide attempt,

58
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,280
did he reveal anything

59
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,940
about the details of the Lin couple's fire case?

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
Did he mention the cat woodcarving

61
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,780
and its connection to the Lin couple?

62
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,140
Are you suggesting

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,480
that Tu Guo'an

64
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,600
is involved in other unsolved cases?

65
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,240
Who are you?

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,600
Why are you following me?

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,330
Cut the crap.

68
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,800
Hand over your money.

69
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,040
See what this is?

70
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,080
If this knife goes into your artery,

71
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,520
even God couldn't save you.

72
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,450
I suggest you hand over your money.

73
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,560
Let go!

74
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,079
Let go or I'll kill you!

75
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,360
Call everyone you know.

76
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,019
Let them all come at me.

77
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,520
You're just a junkie.

78
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,740
Who would help you?

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
As for me,

80
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,000
I've never been one to follow the rules.

81
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm in a bad mood today.

82
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,250
You're unlucky to have run into me.

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,600
But I'm just like you.

84
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,170
I also enjoy hearing a knife

85
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,360
pierce through an artery.

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,060
Why don't you try it for me?

87
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,440
Don't try to scare me.

88
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,340
This is a society ruled by law.

89
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,520
If you've got the guts, just kill me.

90
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,760
Rule of law?

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,560
There are no surveillance cameras around this alley.

92
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,080
The police won't go to great lengths for someone

93
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,240
who's already dying from addiction.

94
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,120
Your death

95
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,120
doesn't fall within the scope of the rule of law.

96
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,240
Bullshit!

97
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,740
How could I possibly kill someone over a cat?

98
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,720
You've got nerve.

99
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,400
Want a quick death, is that it?

100
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,800
You carry such deep sins

101
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
and you dare hope for an easy way out?

102
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,680
People like you deserve to be flayed alive.

103
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,170
To taste what it's like when you can't live

104
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,840
and can't die either.

105
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,880
Officer Chi,

106
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,680
what difficult case are you working on?

107
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,920
Need any help?

108
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,490
What a coincidence.

109
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,760
Yeah, right.

110
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,060
Hands on your head and squat down.

111
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,120
You don't seem right.

112
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,220
I'll take care of this person.

113
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,159
Go home first.

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Hey.

115
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,330
Are you in Dongzhou?

116
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,460
Can you help me investigate someone?

117
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,260
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

118
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,920
Thank you.

119
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,620
I wasn't in a good mood last night,

120
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,650
so I might have caused you trouble.

121
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,520
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,120
It's fine.

123
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,360
By the way,

124
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Xu mentioned that

125
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,300
death row inmate who attempted suicide.

126
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,170
What's your connection to him?

127
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,930
There's no connection.

128
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,890
Is there some misunderstanding here?

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,580
Let me help you sort it out.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,920
Also,

131
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
how did they interrogate you yesterday?

132
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,730
How much stress did they put you under?

133
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,220
There's no misunderstanding, Captain Luo.

134
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,840
It's okay. There's no misunderstanding.

135
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,800
The prosecutor's office shouldn't have approached you.

136
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,160
When has our Major Crimes Unit ever suffered such humiliation?

137
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,080
I'll speak to their supervisor right now.

138
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,840
Captain Luo.

139
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,120
He's just a sample for my criminal psychology

140
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,850
research project, that's all.

141
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,340
No need to make a big deal out of it.

142
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,159
Let's go

143
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,200
to Zhou Yanzhen's parents' house.

144
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,659
They've returned from their business trip.

145
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
This Zhou family is quite interesting.

146
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,240
Zhou Yanzhen's grandfather is called Zhou Sanping,

147
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,500
a businessman with substantial wealth.

148
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,120
His father is Zhou Zhengguo,

149
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,800
who took a different path and studied medicine.

150
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,860
Now he's a renowned ophthalmologist in Dongzhou City.

151
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,290
Ophthalmology.

152
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,200
Eye doctor.

153
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,360
His mother is Liang Jing,

154
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,080
who grew up pampered

155
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,280
as a wealthy heiress.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,600
Now she's become a housewife

157
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,760
who occasionally accompanies Zhou Zhengguo on business trips.

158
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,200
Three generations of the Zhou family

159
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,060
in three different professions.

160
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,500
Each generation chose not to follow the path laid by the previous one.

161
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,330
That's quite interesting.

162
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,200
You've never cared about Xiao Chen.

163
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,320
You're always harsh on him

164
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,520
and that's why his personality became so extreme.

165
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,000
He just likes art.

166
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,000
What right do you have to disapprove?

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,920
Enough.

168
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,240
Was I wrong to be strict with him?

169
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,080
How dare you say that!

170
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,919
If you weren't spoiling him all day,

171
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,480
would he disobey me?

172
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
I spoil him?

173
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Let me tell you.

174
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,880
If Xiaochen really killed someone,

175
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,240
you, as his father, are the one to blame.

176
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,600
If you put half the effort you spend on your students

177
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,760
on your own son,

178
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,570
he wouldn't be like this today.

179
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
How can he compare to Zi'ang?

180
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,240
If he were half as obedient as Zi'ang,

181
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,970
I'd be thanking my lucky stars.

182
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,640
Is he really your biological son?

183
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,200
Let go of me!

184
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,040
Alright, alright. Stop arguing, both of you.

185
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,840
Sit down.

186
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,240
Let's talk this through.

187
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,240
We police are here to gather information.

188
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,920
Why are you parents already

189
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,120
making final decisions about the case?

190
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,130
Is this some kind of indirect confession?

191
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,040
Officer.

192
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,240
I know my son.

193
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,360
He can be stubborn sometimes.

194
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,480
But he couldn't possibly kill someone.

195
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,800
He doesn't have the guts.

196
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,640
Right. All he thinks about is art.

197
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,840
He wouldn't kill anyone.

198
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,880
Think carefully about

199
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,680
how long it's been since you've seen Zhou Yanchen.

200
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Is he really as simple as you think?

201
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,090
Now let's talk about Zhang Zi'ang.

202
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,200
This Zhang Zi'ang

203
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,460
is Zhou Zhengguo's most prized student.

204
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,320
In the early days, Zhou Zhengguo

205
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,880
would take him along

206
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,440
when researching major projects.

207
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,840
Other classmates have reported that

208
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,200
their relationship is like father and son.

209
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,000
Zhang Zi'ang should be studying abroad right now.

210
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,170
Does anyone have any thoughts?

211
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,720
Based on the available information,

212
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,800
from a criminal psychology perspective,

213
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,000
Zhou Yanchen likely

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,680
resented Zhou Zhengguo's favoritism toward Zhang Zi'ang.

215
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Over time, he developed hatred toward Zhou Zhengguo.

216
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,000
And because of Liang Jing's compliance and overindulgence,

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,040
his temperament became unrestrained.

218
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,600
This family dysfunction

219
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,560
would place Zhou Yanchen

220
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,220
under intense emotional stress for a long time.

221
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,320
On one hand, he craves Zhou Zhengguo's attention,

222
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,650
on the other hand, he wants to vent his anger through murder.

223
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,920
I know what you're going to say.

224
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,520
I'll say it again. No.

225
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,640
Binzi, you speak.

226
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,370
Captain Luo.

227
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,760
Zhou Yanchen

228
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,480
has been going out frequently lately.

229
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,040
These past few days,

230
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,480
he's met with some art investors

231
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,440
and painters.

232
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,960
But yesterday was unusual.

233
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
It was almost dark

234
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,040
when he left the exhibition hall.

235
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,920
Also, he went home

236
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,180
and saw Zhou Zhengguo.

237
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,490
When he came out, he looked very upset.

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,200
What's today's date?

239
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,440
The 20th. Why?

240
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,520
The time between each crime has been decreasing exponentially.

241
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,600
He knows if the police investigate him,

242
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
he'll definitely accelerate his crimes

243
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,160
to complete his provocation.

244
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,320
Today is the fifth day since the third case.

245
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,880
He went home

246
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,840
and must have faced criticism

247
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,400
or even physical abuse from Zhou Zhengguo.

248
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,000
He urgently needs to vent these emotions.

249
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,040
He will definitely choose to kill someone else immediately.

250
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,840
Cao Bin, stay on him.

251
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,180
Roger that.

252
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,360
Map.

253
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,970
Give it to me.

254
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,200
According to Bin's recent reports,

255
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,600
Zhou Yanchen frequently appears here,

256
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,840
in Jingxin District,

257
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Youjia Building.

258
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Time is running out.

259
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,520
Two directions:

260
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,200
continue reviewing surveillance footage

261
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,760
and try to locate the first crime scene.

262
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,440
Got it.

263
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,040
Check the exhibition attendees

264
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,900
and identify potential victims.

265
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,800
In half an hour,

266
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,530
we'll summarize our findings.

267
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,360
Although the footage is blurry

268
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
and we can't see faces clearly,

269
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,080
we can still track the gait.

270
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,600
When he walks,

271
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,240
his feet are parallel to the ground,

272
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,080
the inner side of his heel touches the ground first,

273
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,410
then his foot pushes forward internally,

274
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,920
people like this usually have knock knees,

275
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,820
and their legs are more separated when walking.

276
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,360
Look.

277
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,820
There's significant swaying when walking.

278
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
But Lin Wei is different.

279
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,920
She lifts her feet quickly,

280
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,200
which makes her walk at a faster pace.

281
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,760
Her steps are higher.

282
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,320
See?

283
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,240
That's very informative.

284
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,400
Alright, I'll continue the investigation.

285
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,120
I don't believe we can't find the problem.

286
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,780
Keep going.

287
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,920
How's it going?

288
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,400
In the guest list for the Drowning Exhibition,

289
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,040
there are 25 women in total.

290
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,880
Actually, we just need to focus on these three.

291
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,520
Li Xiaoyu once anonymously shared on the forum

292
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,240
about being psychologically manipulated by her ex-boyfriend,

293
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,120
suffering from depression,

294
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,580
and her recovery process.

295
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,560
This journey gained a lot of support from fans.

296
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,360
And then there's Qi Meng.

297
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,400
On social media,

298
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,160
she posts about her mood every day.

299
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,960
Actively fighting depression.

300
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,240
As for Xie Yao,

301
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,400
she posted on social media

302
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,000
about breaking up with her boyfriend.

303
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,400
She's emotionally unstable

304
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,440
and lives alone.

305
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
She did make some suicidal comments.

306
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,640
But most importantly, all three of them

307
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,880
are 25 years old.

308
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,440
Jue.

309
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,320
Send me the locations

310
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,120
of the three potential victims.

311
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,240
Xie Yao

312
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,080
34 Qianshui Road, Jingxin District.

313
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,160
Li Xiaoyu lives in Jiahua Neighborhood,

314
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,800
Building 6, Room 1104.

315
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,560
Qi Meng

316
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,240
Fuhui Garden, Jingxin District,

317
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
Building 3, Room 502.

318
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,760
Fuhui Garden.

319
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,800
Zhou Yanchen seems to be going out frequently these days,

320
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,000
but he's actually scouting locations.

321
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,560
Hello,

322
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,290
Captain Luo.

323
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,600
We lost him.

324
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,400
Come to Fuhui Garden quickly.

325
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,000
Copy that.

326
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,600
Don't move.

327
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,760
What's your name?

328
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,040
My name is Qi Meng.

329
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,090
I made a mistake in my judgment.

330
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,210
Captain Luo.

331
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,800
Lin Wei and Zhang Wen both visited Huixin Shopping Center.

332
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,960
But from the surveillance footage,

333
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,560
I discovered a major problem.

334
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,800
They both entered the mall that day and came out.

335
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,960
But judging from their walking patterns,

336
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,760
the people who came out weren't them.

337
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,840
I suspect the primary crime scene is in Huixin Shopping Center.

338
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,440
So you're saying

339
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,640
Lin Wei and Zhang Wen

340
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,200
were already replaced with doubles

341
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
while they were at Huixin Shopping Center?

342
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
It's possible.

343
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,560
Huixin Shopping Center is in a busy area,

344
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,320
surrounded by glass curtain walls.

345
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,080
From the first floor to the top,

346
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,840
there are no absolute blind spots.

347
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,560
This place is crowded with many witnesses,

348
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,040
and Curly has already

349
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,359
thoroughly checked all surveillance footage.

350
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,599
To control someone under these conditions

351
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,440
and kill two living people,

352
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,000
there's only one possibility:

353
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,800
the basement.

354
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,760
Let's go.

355
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,040
I'll turn over every stone

356
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,800
to find that bastard's

357
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,960
criminal evidence.

358
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,080
Let's provoke Zhou Yanchen to commit a crime.

359
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,740
How do you want to provoke him?

360
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,600
Hello.

361
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,240
Guess where I am.

362
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,280
