1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya.

2
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,520
Either cut open the pig's carcass,

3
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,490
I'll give you something to eat,

4
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,520
and you'll survive.

5
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,520
Or else,

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,120
you'll starve to death.

7
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,570
Stop being so dramatic,

8
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,360
Zhou Yanchen.

9
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,280
I'm a police officer.

10
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,360
Even if I die here today,

11
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,000
it would be a line of duty death.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,400
I would have a memorial service

13
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,720
and compensation for my family.

14
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,240
Everyone would think it's a tragedy

15
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,400
and miss me.

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,080
But you?

17
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,600
Whether you survive miserably

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,680
or face justice,

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,800
people will only despise you.

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,290
Your father would be the first.

21
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,440
Aren't you going to explain yourself to me?

22
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,500
You called me here,

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
not just to be your audience, right?

24
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,360
And your father...

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,400
Imagine if he saw you using his surgical knife

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,960
to gouge out Qin Mei's eyes.

27
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,400
That scene

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,040
would be quite something, wouldn't it?

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
Xiaochen.

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,160
Xiaochen.

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,520
I've worked hard all these years

32
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,520
hoping you could have an easier path

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,600
and do better

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,880
with less struggle.

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,320
The path your grandfather paved for you,

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,520
why won't you take it?

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,560
The things you can't do well,

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,760
why force me to do them?

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,760
Do you remember her?

40
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,920
This was your masterpiece.

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,560
I'm going to dig out her eyes

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,000
right in front of you.

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,920
Let you experience what shattered hope feels like.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,000
Xiaochen.

45
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
I was wrong.

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,440
I won't force you anymore.

47
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,120
Xiaochen.

48
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,640
Don't you love painting?

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,440
I'll send you abroad.

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,480
We'll find the best school for your studies.

51
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,940
I'll hire the best professors for you, okay?

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,200
Oh right.

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,240
Director Zhou.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,120
If you hadn't mentioned it,

55
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,560
I would have almost forgotten.

56
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,800
Do you remember your favorite student,

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,079
Zhang Zi'ang, right?

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,360
Let me tell you,

59
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,600
he's already dead.

60
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,680
Killed by my own hands.

61
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,160
I used

62
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,920
this very surgical knife.

63
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,400
Don't keep making the same mistakes.

64
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,840
They are all innocent.

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,000
You can't go on like this.

66
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,920
What are you doing?

67
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,880
Where is your high and mighty attitude?

68
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,810
Where is your arrogant authority?

69
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,240
Why are you kneeling before me like a dog?

70
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,880
I hate you for bringing me into this world.

71
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,079
I hate what I've become.

72
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,600
I hate that I can't go in there and cut you into pieces.

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,480
So I will torture you ten times,

74
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,720
a hundred times,

75
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,560
a thousand times,

76
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,440
ten thousand times more.

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,040
Torture you until you die.

78
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,720
Officer Chi.

79
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,120
So tears are sweet after all.

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,960
Do you even know how to kill?

81
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,960
Take your scalpel,

82
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,800
find her main artery,

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
and stab it hard.

84
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,210
Blood will splatter

85
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,200
and mix with your paint.

86
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,960
That's real art.

87
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,560
Don't you understand?

88
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,680
Shut up!

89
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,520
Move again

90
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,560
and I'll kill him.

91
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,760
Jue.

92
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,160
I've checked the terrain.

93
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,720
Go get a spotlight from the car.

94
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,040
Shine it on him when the time is right.

95
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,520
Cao Bin,

96
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,720
we'll take him down together.

97
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,640
We can't wait for Curly anymore.

98
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,500
Let's move now.

99
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,440
Wait for my signal.

100
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:32,920
Okay,

101
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,400
go.

102
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,250
You took your father's life-saving knife

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,440
and stained it with innocent blood.

104
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,440
You've finally shattered the patriarchy

105
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,640
that oppressed you for so many years.

106
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,200
You must be feeling quite proud of yourself now.

107
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
I know why you killed those girls.

108
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,480
Because you're jealous.

109
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,970
You're jealous of them.

110
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,240
Everyone came from the same darkness,

111
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,120
but someone always pulled them into the sunlight.

112
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,540
No one cared about you.

113
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,560
Yes.

114
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,040
They may be dead,

115
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,050
but someone will always love them.

116
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,020
What about you?

117
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,000
Does anyone?

118
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,640
All you want is that sick attention.

119
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,640
What will people call you?

120
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,680
A great artist?

121
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,120
No.

122
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,880
They'll only say you're a psychopath,

123
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,280
a twisted murderer.

124
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,520
Trying to provoke me?

125
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,280
It won't work.

126
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,560
I don't fall for that.

127
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,720
Do you remember what I told you?

128
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,840
When you see this cage,

129
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,040
does it remind you of anything?

130
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,640
This is your secret.

131
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,080
I won't tell you.

132
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,720
I'll let you live with this regret

133
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,560
as I torture you slowly.

134
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,680
I'll torture you until you die.

135
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,260
Let me tell you something.

136
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,280
Secrets?

137
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,400
I'll find out myself.

138
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,880
Kill me?

139
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,980
You're not worthy.

140
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,880
Is that so?

141
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,560
Try it then.

142
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,200
Zhou Yanchen.

143
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,700
Don't move!

144
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,540
Don't move!

145
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,260
Don't move!

146
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,320
Zhou Yanchen,

147
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,960
you're under arrest.

148
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,130
Give me an explanation.

149
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,460
What explanation do you want?

150
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,940
Why didn't you wait for us?

151
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,000
I was in a hurry to save someone.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,080
Didn't I send you a message?

153
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,160
You only sent the message after you arrived here.

154
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,040
Fortunately, today was just a close call.

155
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,300
Stop playing the lone hero in the future.

156
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,120
Wait.

157
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
How old is Qin Mei?

158
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,760
As you suspected,

159
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,890
twenty-five years old.

160
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,280
Why only kill 25-year-old girls?

161
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,440
Not just girls.

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,360
Zhang Zi'ang was also 25.

163
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,360
Why only kill people who are 25?

164
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,400
You'll find out the answer.

165
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,840
Bin.

166
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,820
Actually, we're the same kind of people.

167
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,290
Your skewers are ready.

168
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,320
Thank you.

169
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,290
You're welcome.

170
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
Officer Luo.

171
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,120
I rarely get to come to Dongzhou on business trips.

172
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,080
And I'm lucky enough to have you treat me to a meal.

173
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,960
Just tell me.

174
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,290
What do you want to know?

175
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,840
Chi Xia.

176
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,440
Do you know her well?

177
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,280
This person.

178
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,920
She's my junior from school.

179
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,000
I have to say.

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,560
She's extremely talented.

181
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,280
Five years ago.

182
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,240
She provided assistance to the provincial department.

183
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,120
In criminal psychology.

184
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
And helped solve a major case.

185
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,200
The school even commended her at that time.

186
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,880
And now.

187
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,810
She's still working in this field.

188
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,360
Yes.

189
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,920
Thanks for your help, Dao.

190
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,640
No, no.

191
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,700
Don't call me that.

192
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,600
I'm kidding.

193
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,640
About what I asked you to look into.

194
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,900
Did you find anything?

195
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,040
I did.

196
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,880
Luo Lingfei.

197
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,640
She was also a member of your Major Crimes Unit at that time.

198
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,400
Once when she was out investigating a case.

199
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,660
She encountered a psychopathic killer.

200
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,640
Let me tell you.

201
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,570
The way she died.

202
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,760
Was horrific.

203
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,960
This case.

204
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,280
Was handled by Luo Xun's mentor, Zheng Jinghuai.

205
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,360
It was his last case.

206
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,960
For some unknown reason at that time.

207
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,680
The case took a long time to solve.

208
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,240
All we know is that the killer.

209
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,600
Was a psychopath who committed serial murders.

210
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
We couldn't find any information about him.

211
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,760
And later.

212
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,960
Zheng Jinghuai was imprisoned.

213
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,820
For allegedly falsifying evidence.

214
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,160
You're not suited for the Major Crimes Unit.

215
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
I'll go talk to Chief Chang right now

216
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,780
to get you transferred to another position.

217
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,240
Our Major Crimes Unit

218
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,050
has a heavy workload

219
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,680
and frequent overtime.

220
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
Where do you live?

221
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,320
Is it nearby?

222
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,000
If it's too far away,

223
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,080
it could negatively affect your work.

224
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,880
Let me know if you need anything.

225
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,040
Sis.

226
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,680
What are you thinking about?

227
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,400
Nothing.

228
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,080
I only know his sister died in the line of duty 4 years ago.

229
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,140
I didn't know that.

230
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,860
Let me tell you something.

231
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,400
Before she joined the criminal investigation team,

232
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,800
she visited a death row inmate.

233
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,080
Prosecutor Xu told me

234
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,560
this inmate was sentenced to immediate execution.

235
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,960
A man who was about to die

236
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,760
after meeting with her

237
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,840
suddenly demanded to commit suicide.

238
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,500
He didn't succeed, of course.

239
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,320
But don't you think that's suspicious?

240
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,920
Why do you think this person's suicide attempt

241
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,640
has anything to do with Chi Xia?

242
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,570
Maybe he was just one of Chi Xia's research subjects.

243
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,760
Listen to me.

244
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,800
For people who study psychology like her,

245
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,160
requesting to meet a death row inmate

246
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,400
for research purposes

247
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,240
is completely normal.

248
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,960
I have work to do at the bureau.

249
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,920
I need to go now.

250
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,080
Take your time with your meal.

251
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,760
You haven't eaten anything.

252
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,440
Oh right,

253
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,370
keep investigating Luo Xun for me.

254
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,720
Chi Xia.

255
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,040
I only lost to you in computer skills back then,

256
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,640
I didn't sell myself to you.

257
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,330
It can't be done.

258
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
That scar above your eyebrow

259
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,920
has healed pretty well, hasn't it,

260
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,680
Shi Tianyi?

261
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,240
I'll figure something out.

262
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,840
What's wrong with you today?

263
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,170
You're acting strange.

264
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,160
No.

265
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,960
It's about Chi Xia, isn't it?

266
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,840
It's a shame.

267
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,370
That case with your sister.

268
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,000
It was also a sick pervert who targeted women.

269
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,640
Why is your master so...

270
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,500
That's enough.

271
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,050
It's all in the past.

272
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,880
Let's not talk about it anymore.

273
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,980
My fault, my fault.

274
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
I ruined the mood.

275
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,240
We're actually the same kind of people.

276
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,680
We're actually the same kind of people.

277
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,000
When you come back after graduation,

278
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,130
Mom has something to discuss with you.

279
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,210
Prepare yourself mentally first.

280
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,000
We'll talk when you return.

281
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,960
Mom,

282
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,400
Mom,

283
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,520
what exactly do you want to tell me?

284
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,360
Let me out.

285
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,400
Lift it up.

286
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,800
Raise it.

287
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,560
Higher.

288
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,640
Defend.

289
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,720
Move along.

290
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,640
Good.

291
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,240
Hello.

292
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,760
Miss.

293
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,120
Hey there.

294
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,080
That's not how you throw that punch.

295
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,940
This punching bag is quite heavy.

296
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,920
If you hit too hard,

297
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
your form will suffer.

298
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,160
And it's hard to control.

299
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,220
We usually use it for combo training.

300
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,480
Miss,

301
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,640
I'm talking to you.

302
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,360
Hello?

303
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,960
Don't worry about damaging the bag.

304
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,000
Just don't hurt yourself.

305
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,860
I'd have to pay you compensation.

306
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,080
Young lady,

307
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,810
why aren't you listening to me?

308
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,560
What's wrong?

309
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,280
Let's try.

310
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,400
Get in the ring.

311
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,800
I'll spar with you.

312
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,400
Stop!

313
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,640
Boss.

314
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,840
Coach Ding.

315
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,370
Apologize to our customer.

316
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,120
I'm sorry, miss.

317
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,960
My attitude was inappropriate.

318
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,880
It's fine.

319
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,570
Go back to your work.

320
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,040
Sorry if that scared you.

321
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,840
My apologies.

322
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,280
My name is Qu Bai.

323
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,080
I'm in charge of this boxing gym.

324
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,080
I think he's the one who got scared.

325
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,880
Manager Qu.

326
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,760
I hope you can better implement

327
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,760
the saying 'the customer is always right' in your gym.

328
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
You look pale.

329
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,410
Must be low blood sugar.

330
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,810
Have a lychee candy.

331
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,320
I specially asked someone to make these with real lychee juice.

332
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,520
They're different from those made with artificial flavors.

333
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,320
Try it.

334
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,080
I wasn't lying.

335
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,410
It's special, isn't it?

336
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,400
Delicious.

337
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,160
Ade.

338
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,160
Grab some lychee candies

339
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,280
for this customer.

340
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,640
No need.

341
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,100
Please don't be so polite.

342
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,930
Consider it my apology for our earlier conflict.

343
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,000
That's a rather cheap apology.

344
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,980
Welcome to visit us often.

345
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,320
The more you come,

346
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,440
the better the gifts will be.

347
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,220
I won't stand on ceremony.

348
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,820
Let me make up for that handshake.

349
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,599
Young Master.

350
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,040
De.

351
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,050
Do you remember her?

352
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,280
I do.

353
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,920
Hard to talk to yet easy to please.

354
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,839
Her personality hasn't changed.

355
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,640
Indeed.

356
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,760
Long time no see.

357
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,040
Little Fox.

358
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,400
Hello, sir.

359
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,560
I believe Liang Ruqing's death

360
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,000
was a carefully planned hypnotic murder.

361
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,200
Liang Ruqing stabbed himself multiple times.

362
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,080
Twelve stabs.

363
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,690
