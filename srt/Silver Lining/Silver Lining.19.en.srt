1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya.

2
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,280
Take her away.

3
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,640
Yes.

4
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,800
Her time of death

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,320
is slightly earlier than

6
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,200
those three male victims

7
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
found yesterday.

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,000
I believe

9
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,680
her body was already there

10
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,080
when the police discovered

11
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,140
those three male victims yesterday.

12
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,979
What's your evidence?

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,800
Well.

14
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,920
Those three male victims

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,240
all showed symptoms of hypothermia.

16
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,080
But one of them, named Guo Yiliang,

17
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,240
compared to the other two victims,

18
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,640
had an additional symptom.

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,200
Pathologically, it presents as

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,000
extensive necrosis of the subendocardial contraction bands in the left ventricular free wall,

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,660
resulting in non-obstructive coronary myocardial infarction.

22
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,680
Don't look so confused.

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,280
In simple terms,

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,140
he was literally scared to death.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,440
I've been puzzled about something

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,800
that I couldn't figure out.

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,280
These sculptures in the abandoned houses,

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,840
they do look quite strange in appearance.

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,400
Someone unfamiliar with them might

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,160
get the creeps at first glance.

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,480
But regardless,

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,840
they shouldn't be enough

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,840
to literally frighten a healthy young man to death.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,800
But now I believe

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,200
we've found the answer.

36
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,880
I had previously speculated

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,560
whether the deaths of these three men

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,160
could have been caused by accidental factors.

39
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,079
Hypothermia,

40
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,600
oxygen deprivation, and shock.

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,680
These could be non-human factors.

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,280
But now with

43
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,480
the appearance of this female victim's body,

44
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,200
I believe the possibility of accidental death

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,730
can basically be ruled out.

46
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,880
But now a new question arises.

47
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,640
If it was deliberate,

48
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,280
then how was this environment of hypothermia

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,600
and oxygen deprivation created?

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,680
In a locked-room murder,

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,160
the most important thing is to ensure airtightness.

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,280
Wei told me before

53
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,160
they took measures to seal doors and windows

54
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,020
to prevent insects from damaging

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,360
these wooden sculptures.

56
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,560
That's not enough.

57
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,160
It also needs to be airtight.

58
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,600
They would need to use external materials

59
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,720
to transform this room

60
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,840
into a completely sealed space.

61
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,400
Then use some special methods

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,400
to turn this sealed space into a low-temperature,

63
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,440
oxygen-deprived environment.

64
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,920
Your analysis makes a lot of sense,

65
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,760
but what kind of special methods

66
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,680
are you referring to?

67
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,800
What could they be?

68
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,040
Look at this.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,079
This vine's

70
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
upper part has withered,

71
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,200
but the roots are growing normally

72
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,260
and remain intact.

73
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,320
I believe it's liquid nitrogen.

74
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,120
If the liquid nitrogen

75
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,680
entered this room,

76
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,440
the temperature would drop.

77
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,920
The vines near the window

78
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,800
would deteriorate faster

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
due to the temperature drop.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,920
But the roots

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
continued to grow

82
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,200
because their temperature remained stable.

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,330
But how did the liquid nitrogen get in?

84
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,940
This is the answer.

85
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,519
Liquid nitrogen is similar to dry ice.

86
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,959
It creates a white misty fog.

87
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,680
The colder the room gets,

88
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
the more scared they become.

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,240
And the more scared they are,

90
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,760
the less likely they can escape from the storage room.

91
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,090
Everything matches up.

92
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,880
I'll arrange for someone to collect samples

93
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,610
and take them back for testing.

94
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,400
Chi Xia.

95
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
What do you think?

96
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,920
I don't have much experience with crime scene investigation.

97
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,680
We can't find any more clues,

98
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,040
but from a criminal psychology perspective,

99
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,680
there are several questions I can't figure out.

100
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,080
Why would the killer give the four victims

101
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,680
different methods of death?

102
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,440
Complicated death methods

103
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,560
would multiply the risk of committing the crime.

104
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,200
In such a remote mountain environment,

105
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,680
spending enormous effort

106
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,440
to create a cold,

107
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,080
frightening,

108
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,880
oxygen-deprived environment.

109
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
It's like they're

110
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,400
performing some kind of ritual.

111
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,080
The second question is:

112
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,610
how many killers are there?

113
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,320
Placing a female victim

114
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,960
in a predetermined location

115
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,680
and killing three adult males

116
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,280
doesn't seem like a task one person could accomplish.

117
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,570
The third question:

118
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
the connection between the three adult males is

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,000
they all belonged to the same outdoor club.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,760
Now there's a fourth victim

121
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,980
who is also female.

122
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,960
Does this connection still exist?

123
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,040
Leave this to me.

124
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
I'll look into it.

125
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,600
We are guilty.

126
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,120
I found it.

127
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,180
Five years ago,

128
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
there was a rescue accident in Yuji.

129
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,520
A group of hikers went up the mountain

130
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,640
without filing a report.

131
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,720
As a result, because they were unfamiliar with the terrain,

132
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,200
they got stranded on the mountain.

133
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,320
At that time, there was a villager

134
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,400
who organized a volunteer rescue team.

135
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,730
It was this rescue team.

136
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,760
Did someone die in that rescue operation?

137
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,560
Yes.

138
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
The rescue team leader was named Zhao Shengqian,

139
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,760
and he was the only one who died.

140
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,520
Everyone else was rescued.

141
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
This incident caused quite a stir online at the time.

142
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:00,960
Wei,

143
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,560
don't rush.

144
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,520
Tell us more details.

145
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,850
Thank you, Captain Luo.

146
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,000
Five years ago,

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,160
Yuji became a popular adventure destination in the area.

148
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,720
Many adventure enthusiasts came because of its reputation.

149
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,320
However,

150
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
not all mountains in the area were open to the public.

151
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,600
Including the one

152
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,200
where we found the body, Death Mountain.

153
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,240
Sir, may I ask you

154
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,160
how to get to Death Mountain?

155
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,000
Why are you asking about that place?

156
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,840
We're from out of town.

157
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,680
We heard it's interesting,

158
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,560
and we want to check it out.

159
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,360
Interesting?

160
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,840
Just listen to the name of the mountain.

161
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,080
Does that sound like a fun place?

162
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,010
What do you mean?

163
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,880
There was a brave contractor before

164
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,760
who built a resort on the mountain.

165
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,920
But accidents kept happening on the mountain.

166
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,000
Eventually,

167
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,640
no one dared to go there anymore.

168
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,920
His business became worse and worse,

169
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,280
and later the resort was abandoned.

170
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,800
Such a creepy mountain

171
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,080
plus dozens of old, dilapidated houses.

172
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,920
Aren't you afraid of attracting something unwanted?

173
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,480
What do you want?

174
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,409
Grab it quickly.

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,040
Come on, take it.

176
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,560
Coming.

177
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,920
Actually,

178
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,120
we're not going up the mountain.

179
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,480
Just walking around at the foot of it.

180
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Taking some photos

181
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,520
to show off later.

182
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,800
How much?

183
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,320
In total,

184
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,040
46.

185
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,520
Here's 50.

186
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,450
Keep the change.

187
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,640
Thank you.

188
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,700
How do we get there?

189
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,760
Just keep walking this way

190
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,960
until you see a small stream.

191
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,160
But,

192
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,840
just stay at the foot of the mountain.

193
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,000
Don't go up there under any circumstances.

194
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,400
It's dangerous up there.

195
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,320
Thanks, boss.

196
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,440
Thanks, boss.

197
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,720
- Take care.
- Take care.

198
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
What would you like?

199
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,880
There were actually quite a few groups of people that day.

200
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,960
After they entered Death Mountain,

201
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,620
the stall owner kept an eye out

202
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,920
and waited nearby.

203
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,200
Sure enough, there was a group of people

204
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,400
who never came back down.

205
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,240
The owner got worried

206
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,000
and called the police.

207
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,200
But you know,

208
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,640
people in their twenties or thirties

209
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,840
could be wandering anywhere.

210
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,400
Everyone searched the entire village first

211
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
but couldn't find them.

212
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,680
Only then did they go up the mountain for rescue.

213
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,440
How many people were in the rescue team?

214
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,240
Eight people.

215
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,360
They weren't professional rescuers,

216
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,760
just kids who grew up in the village,

217
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,680
who ran barefoot on the mountain since childhood.

218
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,240
The leader of the rescue team

219
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,480
was Zhao Shengqian.

220
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,160
He was only 26 years old at the time.

221
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,960
In the end,

222
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,640
he not only lost his life

223
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,040
but also his reputation.

224
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,200
Why?

225
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,120
Saving people is a good deed.

226
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,360
Exactly.

227
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,280
The trapped people were rescued,

228
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,200
the rescuers sacrificed themselves.

229
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,960
They should have been honored,

230
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,280
so why did his reputation suffer?

231
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,160
That's why people say his death was unjust.

232
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,720
Actually, many people went up Death Mountain that day.

233
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,520
Most people were found early on,

234
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,680
but there were still a few left,

235
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,560
and the rescue was extremely difficult.

236
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,960
Some people suggested

237
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,000
that rescue wasn't necessary,

238
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,130
but Zhao Shengqian refused to give up.

239
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,400
Take it slow.

240
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,809
Let the others catch up.

241
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,640
You take these people back to the village first.

242
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,299
I'll go back and search again.

243
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,080
Captain,

244
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,880
are you crazy?

245
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,760
It's getting dark soon.

246
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,919
This is Death Mountain,

247
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,380
no one returns from there.

248
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,200
Yes, Captain.

249
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,160
That's right.

250
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,570
Don't worry, everyone.

251
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,880
I've been to Death Mountain

252
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,600
more times than all of you combined.

253
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
It's fine.

254
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,240
Captain.

255
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Let me go with you.

256
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,880
No need.

257
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,960
Your leg is in bad shape.

258
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,040
You need to make sure

259
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,200
these people get down safely.

260
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,640
I have to go back and search again.

261
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,880
If I don't find anyone, I'll leave.

262
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,680
Before dark,

263
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,120
I'll definitely be back.

264
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,240
Captain,

265
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
let me go with you.

266
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,680
I've studied wilderness survival

267
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,080
and know basic emergency medical care.

268
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,640
Captain.

269
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,840
Take Feiyu with you.

270
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,040
It's really not safe for you to go alone.

271
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,760
Let's go.

272
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,600
Watch your step.

273
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,330
Keep moving.

274
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,240
Then Zhao Shengqian and Qu Feiyu had an accident.

275
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,920
Yes.

276
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,360
The other rescue team members

277
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,760
escorted the people they had found down the mountain first.

278
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,000
Zhao Shengqian and Qu Feiyu took food and water

279
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,920
and continued searching for survivors.

280
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,520
After that,

281
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,850
three more days passed.

282
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,040
The rest of the people gradually came down from the mountain.

283
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,440
But Zhao Shengqian and Qu Feiyu

284
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,720
never came down.

285
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,640
So the villagers

286
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,160
organized another search party to go up the mountain.

287
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,360
They finally found Zhao Shengqian dead

288
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,820
and Qu Feiyu unconscious.

289
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,160
What about Zhao Shengqian?

290
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,240
What was his cause of death?

291
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,080
Did you investigate?

292
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,800
Yes, we did.

293
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,800
Zhao Shengqian suffered from hunger,

294
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,360
dehydration,

295
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
and hypothermia.

296
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,080
It led to exhaustion,

297
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,840
causing him to fall down a cliff,

298
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,200
dying from severe head trauma.

299
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,330
What about Qu Feiyu?

300
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,040
Qu Feiyu was in a coma for three whole months.

301
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,440
She escaped death,

302
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,720
but not without consequences.

303
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,840
Since she woke up,

304
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
she's been blind.

305
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
Um...

306
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,920
What about the ruined reputation?

307
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,280
What happened?

308
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
After Zhao Shengqian's body was found,

309
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,480
reporters

310
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,640
interviewed Shi Guangxuan who was still

311
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,600
under observation in the hospital.

312
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,330
As a result, this Shi Guangxuan

313
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,040
accused Zhao Shengqian of lacking professional skills,

314
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,600
claiming that during the rescue,

315
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,800
he put others at risk.

316
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,280
Zhao Shengqian was dead.

317
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,720
Qu Feiyu was in a coma.

318
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,360
Of course people believed

319
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,020
whatever the survivors said.

320
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
They weren't a professional rescue team to begin with.

321
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,240
Many people online latched onto this point and started criticizing them.

322
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,040
How did this matter end?

323
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,920
As time passed,

324
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,880
people forgot about it.

325
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,410
The rescue team disbanded.

326
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,480
Qu Feiyu wasn't a local,

327
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,210
so she left Yuji shortly after.

328
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,480
The living continued with their lives.

329
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,160
It's just that

330
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,560
Zhao Shengqian and his family were quite pitiful.

331
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,360
Xiao Wei.

332
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,880
Could I trouble you to make another trip?

333
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,360
Please go ahead.

334
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,720
Find out about

335
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,680
Zhao Shengqian's family's current information

336
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,640
and let me know.

337
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,960
Also about those rescue team members from back then.

338
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,760
Okay.

339
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,660
Does it feel familiar?

340
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,680
What?

341
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,240
The 12 sculptures.

342
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,000
The words 'We are guilty.'

343
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,500
And revenge again.

344
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,800
Doesn't it seem like Fox's work?

345
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,200
Indeed.

346
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
But we have limited clues right now.

347
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,920
We don't know who Fox's

348
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,200
next target will be.

349
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,960
If it's really her,

350
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,640
where would the 25 be?

351
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,280
Okay.

352
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,280
I got it.

353
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,900
I just had Curly check something.

354
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,400
This Qu Feiyu left the country three months ago

355
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,160
with no record of returning.

356
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,240
Makes sense when you think about it.

357
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,120
A completely blind person

358
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,960
may have a motive

359
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,000
but hardly has the ability to commit these crimes.

360
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,300
She's probably not Fox's target.

361
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,840
Captain Luo.

362
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,370
Miss Xia.

363
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,560
Wei.

364
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,600
Could you tell me about

365
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,680
Zhao Shengqian's wife in detail?

366
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,720
Sure.

367
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,040
Zhao Shengqian's wife

368
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,960
is named Feng Yuqin.

369
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,600
Since Zhao Shengqian died,

370
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,920
Feng Yuqin's personality has become very strange.

371
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,320
She often gets into huge arguments

372
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,240
She often gets into huge arguments

373
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,760
with neighbors over trivial matters.

374
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,440
Our station has mediated many times.

375
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,560
She now survives on odd jobs

376
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,000
while taking care of Zhao's mother

377
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,480
and a 7-year-old child.

378
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,880
Because of her personality, she's offended many people,

379
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,800
so her social circle is quite limited.

380
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,600
In short,

381
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,600
she's difficult to get along with.

382
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,640
Resentful,

383
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,520
quiet,

384
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,850
and socially isolated.

385
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,360
Such people are easily manipulated by Fox.

386
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,930
This is the restaurant.

387
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,860
This is Feng Yuqin.

388
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,880
Here's your vegetable platter.

389
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,920
Wei.

390
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,560
Go ask Feng Yuqin to come out.

391
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,000
We need to get some information from her.

392
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,640
Okay.

393
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,090
For table three.

394
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,160
Feng Yuqin.

395
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,920
Two officials from the city are here.

396
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,920
They want to know about Zhao Shengqian's rescue mission five years ago.

397
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,760
Please cooperate with them.

398
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,560
What?

399
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,720
Wasn't everything made clear enough back then?

400
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
Since I've found you,

401
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,520
it means there are more details to add.

402
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,440
Put down what you're doing first.

403
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,920
Please cooperate.

404
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,600
I can't.

405
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,720
Can't you see I'm busy?

406
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,520
Rice noodles.

407
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,530
Didn't I order noodles?

408
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,720
Then where are my rice noodles?

409
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,400
Not cooperating.

410
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Always like this.

411
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,520
How long have I been waiting?

412
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,600
Here.

413
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,880
Didn't I tell you to serve table 3?

414
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,940
Take it over there.

415
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,120
Who are you slamming things at?

416
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,880
I wasn't even angry yet.

417
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,440
What are you throwing things for?

418
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,640
Don't make trouble.

419
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,400
Didn't I just bring it to you?

420
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,960
What's with your attitude?

421
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,840
Looking for trouble, huh?

422
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,440
Eat it if you want.

423
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,320
If not, leave.

424
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,120
No, you...

425
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,200
Brother.

426
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,240
Calm down.

427
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,970
Take it easy.

428
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,760
Boss.

429
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,780
Make a new bowl for my friend here.

430
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,800
It's on me.

431
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,280
Alright.

432
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,760
Serve him first.

433
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,560
I'm not in a hurry.

434
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,280
Also,

435
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,560
your employee Feng Yuqin.

436
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,480
I need to borrow some of her time.

437
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,280
I've already told you many times.

438
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,800
What else is there to say now?

439
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,540
That rescue team back then

440
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,600
was trapped on the mountain for many days.

441
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
Captain Zhao was experienced

442
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,640
and successfully rescued all of them in the end.

443
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,440
But he

444
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,980
not only lost his life,

445
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,680
but was also slandered

446
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,720
and his reputation was ruined.

447
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,360
That's why you've been living

448
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,760
under everyone's gossip.

449
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,120
Have you ever thought about

450
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,580
changing this situation?

451
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,200
Nothing changed five years ago.

452
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,490
What's the point of thinking about it now?

453
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,960
When Zhao Shengqian was around,

454
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,680
your quality of life must have been pretty good.

455
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,520
Now you can only work as a helper in this restaurant.

456
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,320
Such a big difference.

457
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,040
After all this time,

458
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,520
do you feel any resentment?

459
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,250
Resentment?

460
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,650
Can resentment feed me?

461
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,920
What's past is past.

462
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,200
If I dwell on it too much,

463
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,800
how can I go on with my life?

464
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,960
Listen, officer,

465
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
are you here today

466
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,480
to learn about the old case

467
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,960
or just to laugh at me?

468
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,080
Feng Yuqin,

469
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,730
what's with your attitude?

470
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,080
Did I just help you for nothing?

471
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
Don't be so ungrateful.

472
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,960
Let me tell you something.

473
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,080
We have reasonable suspicion

474
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,200
that you harbor resentment toward the hikers who were rescued 5 years ago,

475
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,320
and might be seeking revenge on behalf of Zhao Shengqian

476
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,920
and possibly murdered them.

477
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,400
If you feel you're being wrongly accused,

478
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,320
please cooperate seriously with our investigation.

479
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,120
Revenge.

480
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,520
I only blame Zhao Shengqian for being too helpful back then,

481
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,320
bringing trouble upon himself.

482
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,920
I have no desire to avenge him

483
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
and get myself into trouble.

484
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,520
I just want to take care of

485
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,480
the elderly and children in my family.

486
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,640
If you insist on making things difficult for me...

487
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,760
Just arrest me

488
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,600
and let the elderly and children

489
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,240
starve to death at home.

490
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,200
No,

491
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,880
we don't mean to give you a hard time.

492
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,640
We just want to understand your thoughts better

493
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,040
so we can help you.

494
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,200
My thoughts?

495
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,090
Do my thoughts even matter?

496
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
It's been 5 years.

497
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,920
The civilian search and rescue association insists

498
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,720
there were problems with Zhao Shengqian's rescue operation.

499
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,120
Now the compensation can't even be issued.

500
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,520
You police officers,

501
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,160
can't you do something about it?

502
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
You don't deal with people like this,

503
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,240
but instead you give me,

504
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
the victim's family member,

505
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,300
a hard time, right?

506
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,520
What's wrong with you today?

507
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,040
I...

508
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,640
Why are you so hot-tempered?

509
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,760
Feng Yuqin is just a suspect.

510
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,520
Why are you jumping to conclusions

511
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,380
and treating her like a criminal?

512
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,480
I think having enthusiasm

513
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,010
for the case is a good thing.

514
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,880
But let me give you some advice.

515
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,200
In the future, focus on the case itself

516
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,130
rather than on solving it quickly.

517
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,920
Being impatient won't close the case.

518
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,960
Only when you have evidence

519
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,620
can the case be closed, right?

520
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,170
Don't let your emotions

521
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,620
affect your behavior.

522
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,360
I'm sorry about today.

523
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,160
I admit I was too impulsive today.

524
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,000
But I promise

525
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
from now on,

526
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,400
I'll definitely follow orders.

527
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,600
I won't act rashly anymore.

528
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,660
Alright, let's go.

529
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,400
Keep looking for other clues.

530
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,320
But we need to

531
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,600
keep someone watching Feng Yuqin.

532
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,200
Got it.

533
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,180
Based on Fox's usual style of operation,

534
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,560
she can even manipulate an elderly person like Zheng Lanshu.

535
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,220
But how did she manage to do it?

536
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,079
I suspect

537
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,079
this Buddha head was once suspended.

538
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,760
Why?

539
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,599
Usually when people are in an enclosed space,

540
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,920
where would they hide?

541
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,170
