1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya.

2
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,250
Mr. Liang is coming. Sit properly.

3
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,400
Hello, teacher.

4
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,840
Mr. Liang.

5
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,600
Mr. Liang.

6
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,640
Mr. Liang.

7
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,720
Mr. Liang.

8
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,440
Mr. Liang.

9
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,120
Hurry.

10
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,610
Students, don't push forward.

11
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,360
Step back. Step back.

12
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,210
Stop gathering around.

13
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,240
Move back. Stop looking.

14
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
I don't know either.

15
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Everyone step back.

16
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,680
Move back.

17
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,850
What are you looking at?

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,920
This amount of blood.

19
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,440
Before she fell from the building,

20
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,700
her self-harm was already quite severe.

21
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,020
My senior just examined the body.

22
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,460
She landed head first,

23
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,320
specifically on her forehead.

24
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,490
Captain Luo.

25
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,000
The surveillance footage is ready.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,760
How is it?

27
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,820
It's a bit strange.

28
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
You say this video is strange.

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
What's strange about it?

30
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,490
Her demeanor is off.

31
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,000
When we were in school,

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,520
we were also intimidated by our homeroom teacher's powerful presence.

33
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,360
Normally,

34
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,720
when a teacher stands at the podium,

35
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,079
Either staring at students

36
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,400
or looking at textbooks.

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,260
But look at her.

38
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,520
Her chin slightly raised

39
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,250
as she stares into empty space.

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,520
Her eyes vacant and hollow

41
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,960
for more than ten seconds.

42
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,680
Even when she took the knife from the textbook,

43
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,940
she never looked down.

44
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,680
Her gaze maintained that unfocused stare the entire time.

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,800
Her movements are too stiff,

46
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
like a machine.

47
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,880
Also,

48
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,100
from the moment she put down the knife and walked to the window,

49
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,520
she seemed like she was following programmed instructions.

50
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,520
Have you noticed

51
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,200
she stabbed herself so many times

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,460
yet there's not a hint of pain on her face?

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,120
Chi Xia.

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,200
What's wrong?

55
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,000
Chi Xia.

56
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,400
Nothing.

57
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,640
I just zoned out for a moment.

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,760
Where were we?

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,399
Jue was just saying Liang Ruqing stabbed herself multiple times.

60
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,279
12 stabs.

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,320
You counted?

62
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,720
Do you remember

63
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,920
when we were at the separate exhibitions,

64
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,640
how many paintings Zhou Yanchen had of those people asking for help?

65
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,720
This series of paintings has

66
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,100
12 pieces in total.

67
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,000
Is there any special meaning behind them?

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,060
It's not clear yet.

69
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,890
It could just be a coincidence.

70
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,820
I think Liang Ruqing was hypnotized.

71
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,159
Why is this getting more and more mysterious?

72
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,120
Hypnotized?

73
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,130
Hypnosis isn't mysterious at all.

74
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,720
It's a practice based on deep understanding

75
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,560
that uses conversation, guidance, and suggestion

76
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,760
to deliberately intervene in one's psychological state.

77
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,920
It has substantial scientific evidence.

78
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,400
It can weaken or eliminate a person's

79
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,159
independent judgment

80
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,120
and free will.

81
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,200
Things like loss of physical control

82
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,320
and numbness to pain

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,600
are two typical effects of hypnosis.

84
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,050
We still need evidence to prove hypnosis.

85
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,360
Whatever the cause of Liang Ruqing's death,

86
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,040
we need to find evidence.

87
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,720
Curly, Cao Bin.

88
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,520
You go interview some school teachers.

89
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,720
Senior.

90
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,340
Chi Xia.

91
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,900
Let's go meet the students in this class.

92
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,040
Everyone,

93
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,100
quiet down please.

94
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,320
Time is short and we have a lot to do.

95
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,720
I'll get straight to the point.

96
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,160
We're from the Criminal Investigation Division

97
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,159
of the Major Crimes Unit,

98
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,760
investigating your teacher's fall.

99
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,920
You're all witnesses.

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,320
Who wants to speak first?

101
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
You there.

102
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
And you, student.

103
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,320
I've checked the security footage.

104
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
You were all in the front row,

105
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,880
so you must have seen better than others.

106
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,720
Tell me.

107
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,600
Officer,

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
I'm their homeroom teacher, Xu Lan.

109
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,320
The children just experienced a trauma.

110
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,400
Could you question them later?

111
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
That's fine, Ms. Xu.

112
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,320
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,360
Captain Luo,

114
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
why don't you and Jue go help Juanmao and Cao Bin?

115
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,000
They have a lot of work.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,040
I can handle this.

117
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,360
It's yours.

118
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,000
All yours.

119
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,520
Ms. Xu,

120
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,800
could you please take us over there?

121
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,280
Sure.

122
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,080
Thank you.

123
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,520
Turn left at the door.

124
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,880
Thank you for your help.

125
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
I'm sorry, Ms. Xu.

126
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,480
Have something sweet first.

127
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,440
It helps relieve anxiety.

128
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,920
I didn't bring much with me this time,

129
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,120
so boys, please let the girls have some.

130
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,920
We don't need to recall the details of the incident.

131
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,600
Let's just talk about what kind of person Teacher Liang was.

132
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,200
I watched the security footage.

133
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,600
When she entered the classroom,

134
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,800
you all immediately went quiet.

135
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,060
Were you afraid of her?

136
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,200
Teacher Liang was indeed quite strict,

137
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,400
and often scolded us.

138
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,290
Several girls in our class have been scolded to tears by her.

139
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,120
All the students were quite afraid of her.

140
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,280
Well, I think

141
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,800
your feelings toward Teacher Liang weren't just fear.

142
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,920
Because when she walked to the window,

143
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,180
there was a boy who tried to pull her back.

144
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,560
Who was that?

145
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,250
It's not your fault that you couldn't save Ms. Liang.

146
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,840
Ms. Liang actually

147
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,160
wasn't as difficult to get along with as they said.

148
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,720
My family is very poor,

149
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,880
I almost had to drop out this year.

150
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,800
Ms. Liang came to my home

151
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,880
and convinced my parents thoroughly.

152
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,010
That's why I could come back to school.

153
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,780
She really cared about me.

154
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,720
You were the only one who rushed to save her.

155
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,360
You were already very brave.

156
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,920
We heard from other teachers

157
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,600
that you didn't get along with Ms. Liang.

158
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,860
What exactly happened? Tell us about it.

159
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,360
About Ms. Liang,

160
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,280
her teaching skills were truly exceptional.

161
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,920
But her temper...

162
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,280
Officers, you can ask around.

163
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,159
In our school,

164
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:57,320
which young teacher hasn't been scolded by her?

165
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,720
She was always flaunting her seniority and giving attitude.

166
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,810
Captain Luo.

167
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,880
Not much useful information.

168
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,010
We haven't made much progress either.

169
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,320
This Liang Ruqing...

170
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,250
Had conflicts with many teachers,

171
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,050
but they all reconciled later.

172
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,880
Not enough motive.

173
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,560
We haven't finished our interviews yet.

174
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,160
Do you want to meet up with us?

175
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,490
I want to check out Liang Ruqing's office.

176
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,400
This is Mr. Liang's desk.

177
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,600
Has this photo always been on her desk?

178
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
It should be newly changed this semester.

179
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,280
I remember

180
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,880
it used to be a family photo of the three of them.

181
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,960
Ruqing.

182
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,040
Sir.

183
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,720
Ruqing,

184
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,320
calm down.

185
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,920
Ruqing!

186
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,290
Don't be impulsive.

187
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
What's your relationship to the deceased?

188
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,360
Ruqing, Ruqing!

189
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,320
What's wrong with you?

190
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,200
Ruqing, you were fine when you left this morning.

191
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,920
It's okay.

192
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,020
That's enough.

193
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,520
Ruqing.

194
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,920
My condolences.

195
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,320
Ruqing.

196
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,580
My name is Sun Xiangbo.

197
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm Liang Ruqing's partner.

198
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,320
Ruqing...

199
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,160
She was fine when she left this morning.

200
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,120
How could she suddenly jump off a building?

201
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,420
How did you determine it was suicide?

202
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,080
I've seen the security footage.

203
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,000
Ruqing jumped by herself.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,800
If it's not suicide, then what is it?

205
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,000
Did someone say something to upset her?

206
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,160
Or was she bullied at school?

207
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,320
The school must be held responsible.

208
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,720
The school must take full responsibility.

209
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,250
Alright, please calm down.

210
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,850
We need to verify your identity first.

211
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,440
Has the body been identified?

212
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
I didn't allow it.

213
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,100
He was too emotional earlier.

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,800
Mr. Sun.

215
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,220
It's like this.

216
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,800
Regarding Liang Ruqing's falling case,

217
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,640
we haven't reached a conclusion yet.

218
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,360
But the police will further verify the facts.

219
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,560
If there are any detailed findings,

220
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,080
we'll definitely let you know.

221
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,880
But now,

222
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,660
please come with us to identify the body.

223
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:37,850
Okay.

224
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,370
This is his basic information.

225
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,560
Jue.

226
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,420
Let's go through this.

227
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,980
Let me speak first.

228
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,120
I believe the cause of Liang Ruqing's death

229
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,560
was a carefully planned hypnotic murder.

230
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,480
Why?

231
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,400
Everyone has seen the surveillance footage.

232
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,960
I think everyone can see

233
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,880
her behavior in the footage was very abnormal.

234
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,820
According to our autopsy report,

235
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,160
Liang Ruqing died from severe head trauma.

236
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,520
But her limbs had no fractures,

237
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,120
which is inconsistent with typical falling deaths.

238
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,400
Because whether suicide or homicide,

239
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,520
as long as the person is conscious,

240
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,400
at the moment they hit the ground,

241
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,720
they would instinctively use their limbs to brace against impact,

242
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,120
resulting in fractures.

243
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,760
Liang Ruqing didn't have any.

244
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,000
What does this indicate?

245
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,320
It shows Liang Ruqing was unconscious when she fell.

246
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,160
Additionally, hypnosis

247
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,720
requires a hypnotist.

248
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,800
Hypnosis requires long-term contact between the hypnotist and subject.

249
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,920
Close contact.

250
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,760
But our investigation revealed

251
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,960
Liang Ruqing's relationships with students

252
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,600
and colleagues were all quite ordinary,

253
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,200
and she had no close friends.

254
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,760
So who could have had close, prolonged contact with her?

255
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,490
Only her husband, Sun Xiangbo.

256
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,800
According to feedback from some teachers at the school,

257
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,080
their marriage

258
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,440
did have some issues.

259
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,600
They argued frequently,

260
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,160
but everyone thought highly of Sun Xiangbo.

261
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,360
Looking at all this information,

262
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,640
it's possible that Liang Ruqing

263
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,560
was the one with bigger issues in the marriage.

264
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,480
A model husband in public,

265
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,720
yet with widely known marital problems.

266
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,610
Quite the devoted husband.

267
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
Today he made sure everyone saw his

268
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,800
overwhelming grief.

269
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,300
Don't you think he's overacting?

270
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,120
This guy is highly suspicious right now.

271
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,080
Alright.

272
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,840
Everyone go home and get some rest.

273
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,640
Do more research.

274
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,800
Don't just sit around.

275
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,200
Tomorrow we'll visit Sun Xiangbo's place.

276
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,120
Chi Xia.

277
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,560
Are you feeling unwell?

278
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,820
Should I take you home?

279
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,720
No.

280
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,920
Don't worry, Captain Luo.

281
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,720
I won't delay our work progress.

282
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,250
You need to take a break.

283
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,000
You're not in good shape.

284
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Although it feels good,

285
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,370
getting injured would not be worth it.

286
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,720
In my opinion,

287
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,090
physical pain is ten thousand times better than mental suffering.

288
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,600
But in my view,

289
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,600
physical pain

290
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,730
doesn't eliminate mental suffering.

291
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,880
You might end up suffering twice as much instead.

292
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,720
Ade.

293
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,620
How about this.

294
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,560
Don't just take it out on the punching bag alone.

295
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm free today, I can train with you.

296
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,560
This will also reduce your chance of getting hurt.

297
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
The gym owner himself is stepping in.

298
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,560
You treat your members quite well.

299
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,420
Alright, no need to be polite.

300
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,040
Give me a moment.

301
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,720
Okay.

302
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,320
You win.

303
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,520
Let's call it a day.

304
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,640
How are you feeling? Any better?

305
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,320
Much better.

306
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
If you need this kind of thing again,

307
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,000
just call me anytime.

308
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,530
I'll treat you to dinner sometime.

309
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,880
I've received another complaint letter.

310
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,760
The student witness

311
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,200
didn't cooperate promptly with police to reconstruct the scene.

312
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,600
It's because they said

313
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,600
some officers don't look like police

314
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,520
but like thugs.

315
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,720
They were scared,

316
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,780
do you understand?

317
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,040
How many times have I told you?

318
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,440
Look at that messy hair of yours.

319
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,360
I've told you to pay attention to your appearance

320
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,400
and your image.

321
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,560
Do you know how

322
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,720
terrible this influence is?

323
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
My hairstyle has nothing to do with solving cases.

324
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,250
You've got a hundred comebacks for everything I say, don't you?

325
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,860
Do you want to keep fighting with yourself forever?

326
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,080
This is way too short.

327
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,690
Listen to me. Short hair looks energetic.

328
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,440
You're a police officer now.

329
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,920
You need to present a good image to the public.

330
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
It's all because of this injury.

331
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,810
I missed your induction ceremony.

332
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,640
Let's make up for it at home.

333
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,200
Come on.

334
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,840
Sis.

335
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,400
Is your hand really okay for this?

336
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,860
Maybe we should forget it.

337
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
Don't make a fuss about this little injury.

338
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,930
Stand straight.

339
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,040
Is this okay?

340
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,900
Yes, it's fine.

341
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,250
You look very handsome.

342
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,000
When I'm on the front lines in our unit,

343
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,930
let me handle it.

344
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,180
I won't let you get hurt again.

345
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,800
Would a delicate flower choose to join the major crimes unit?

346
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,359
If you actually encounter a case,

347
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,000
your duty is to protect the safety of the people.

348
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,240
Don't always worry about your big sister.

349
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,760
That's Officer Luo for you.

350
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,320
Your sense of duty is deeper than mine.

351
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,560
I need to learn from you.

352
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,320
At ease.

353
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,800
Attention!

354
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,120
Sis.

355
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,940
I'll listen to you.

356
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,240
Young Master.

357
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,900
It's not easy to fight when you're deliberately holding back.

358
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,400
Her fighting skills are much sharper than before.

359
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,660
She must join the game.

360
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
She has no choice.

361
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,200
His place is too clean.

362
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,960
It's so clean as if he knew we were coming

363
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,360
and tidied up specially.

364
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,240
In the relationship between Liang Ruqing and Sun Xiangbo,

365
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,760
there's a third person involved.

366
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,080
Damn it. He just can't stand seeing me do well.

367
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,160
She deserves to die.
