1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya.

2
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,080
Is Mo Laoqi in Dongzhou?

3
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,160
Officer Chi.

4
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
Last night,

5
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,840
someone broke into Tu Guolin's hospital room,

6
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,720
switched his medication,

7
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,850
almost killing him.

8
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,120
Fortunately, the police on duty caught the person.

9
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,250
Okay, I understand.

10
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,640
What's wrong?

11
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,200
Last night someone switched medications

12
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,640
to attempt to assassinate Tu Guolin.

13
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,570
But the person disguised as a doctor has been caught.

14
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,200
Good that he's safe.

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,479
Let's focus on the current case first.

16
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,880
We'll interrogate them thoroughly later.

17
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,160
This

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,880
is Tao Han's medical record from that time.

19
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,600
This

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,960
is from after the treatment was completed.

21
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,280
The payment receipt signed by Tao Han

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,680
The time was right after the accident.

23
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,400
And the location was

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,600
the Second People's Hospital nearest to the accident site.

25
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,400
Good.

26
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
This is solid evidence.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,640
The strangulation marks were indeed on Tao Han.

28
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,600
So his father must have

29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,280
arrived at the scene afterward.

30
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,480
Lu Ningzhi couldn't have been unaware.

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,720
But she tacitly accepted

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,720
her father's killer going unpunished.

33
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,320
There must be something fishy going on.

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,400
Just as I thought.

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,340
But none of them will get away.

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,160
Notify everyone.

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,240
We're arresting Tao Han.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,900
Notify and summon Lu Ningzhi.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,480
Before Lu Ningzhi left,

40
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,010
did she say anything to you?

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,440
She didn't say anything.

42
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,840
When I woke up in the middle of the night,

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,320
she was already gone.

44
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,620
How's it going?

45
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,960
Have you found Lu Ningzhi?

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
I checked the neighborhood surveillance footage.

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,440
Lu Ningzhi did

48
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,400
leave alone at 3 AM this morning.

49
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,480
Her phone is turned off

50
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,280
and we can't reach her.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,960
I see.

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,680
I just got news from Forensics.

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,480
Tao Han's phone signal was detected

54
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,360
five minutes ago

55
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,160
near the yoga studio owned by Lu Ningzhi.

56
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,120
I think these two are likely together.

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,800
Here's the plan.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,160
My senior and I will head there now.

59
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,960
You all come too,

60
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,680
okay?

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,480
Okay.

62
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,040
Let's go.

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,120
Who is it?

64
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,000
Property management.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,280
Open the door, Pan.

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,240
I'm busy trying to catch Tao Han.

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,440
Don't bother me unless it's urgent.

68
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:08,920
Wait, wait.

69
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,120
I have great news for you.

70
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,480
We've caught Pan Haili.

71
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,320
The fake Pan Haili.

72
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,120
That was fast.

73
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,440
How did you catch her?

74
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,160
Heizi.

75
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
He located her position first.

76
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,960
Then we found someone.

77
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,480
Someone the fake Pan Haili trusted to help us.

78
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,480
The whole operation went smoothly.

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Who is it?

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,600
Property management.

81
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,320
Open the door.

82
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,000
Pan.

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,880
Pan.

84
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,330
What do you want?

85
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,200
Police!

86
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,240
Don't run!

87
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,960
Police!

88
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,080
Well done!

89
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,400
Take them to the station.

90
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,280
We've arrived at Lu Ningzhi's yoga studio.

91
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,010
We'll round them all up at once.

92
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,080
Well, you're quite impressive, kid.

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,480
We've been after them for so long without success,

94
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,810
how did you locate them?

95
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,970
All thanks to Captain Luo's leads.

96
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,440
The property management company responsible for that area

97
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,480
is all connected.

98
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,200
Captain Luo asked me to communicate with them.

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,060
Eventually, I followed the trail

100
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,680
and found the person who brought the fake Pan Haili

101
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,160
to work at the property management company.

102
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,720
With that person's cooperation,

103
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,160
we were able to figure out

104
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,820
the fake Pan Haili's address.

105
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,840
That wasn't easy.

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,720
Right.

107
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,920
We can't let all this effort go to waste,

108
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,920
right, Bin?

109
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,960
Let's interrogate them thoroughly later.

110
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,880
You and me, Bin.

111
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,600
You got it.

112
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,290
Captain Luo is back.

113
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,880
Captain Luo,

114
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,840
what happened?

115
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,980
Two suspects got away.

116
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,560
What a shame.

117
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,159
The surveillance setup wasn't complete.

118
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,220
We couldn't track them immediately.

119
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,600
At least we caught the fake Pan Haili.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Take it slow.

121
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,250
Captain Luo.

122
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,250
You're just in time.

123
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,840
Cao Bin and I will handle the interrogation.

124
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,960
The rest of you go find Tao Han and Lu Ningzhi.

125
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,360
No.

126
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,960
No need to look for them.

127
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,120
That's what I came to tell you.

128
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,920
They just turned themselves in.

129
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,360
Who?

130
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,000
Tao Han and Lu Ningzhi.

131
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,200
They came together?

132
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes.

133
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,080
Tao Han confessed to hit-and-run,

134
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,480
arson and murder.

135
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,460
Lu Ningzhi just accompanied him.

136
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,360
Interesting.

137
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,480
Let's interrogate them together.

138
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,740
See what they're up to.

139
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,000
Prepare the files.

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,800
Got it.

141
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,760
Thanks.

142
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,840
We meet again.

143
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,520
Officer Chi,

144
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
feel free to ask whatever you want.

145
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,600
I actually quite like you.

146
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,160
I quite like you too.

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,840
I like

148
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,770
the surprises you bring me.

149
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,490
But I don't really like surprises.

150
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,120
What I hope Officer Chi can bring me

151
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,920
is fairness and justice.

152
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,200
My duty is to handle cases according to law.

153
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,800
As for the final outcome,

154
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,730
whether it matches your idea of fairness and justice

155
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,159
depends on what the truth really is.

156
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,040
Of course.

157
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll do my best to cooperate with you, Officer Chi.

158
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,120
That's great.

159
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,700
Let's start by discussing

160
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,960
why you accompanied Tao Han to turn himself in.

161
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,560
That day,

162
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,320
I was overseeing the renovation at the yoga studio until dawn.

163
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,380
Tao Han suddenly came looking for me.

164
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,000
What are you doing?

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,360
Tao Han.

166
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,890
Ning Zhi.

167
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
It's all my fault.

168
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,560
I just couldn't stand by

169
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,800
watching Fang Xiaofeng and Dong Chengbin

170
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,130
bullying you like that.

171
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,280
What did you do?

172
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,000
They deserve it.

173
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,440
Why are you so foolish?

174
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,240
Ningzhi.

175
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,840
All these years, I've been filled with regret.

176
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,920
If I hadn't been

177
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,930
so impulsive back then,

178
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
causing a deep

179
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,600
blood feud between us,

180
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
how could we

181
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,160
possibly not be together?

182
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,680
I know.

183
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,440
I know all these years

184
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,160
you've been protecting me.

185
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,360
Every time I feel

186
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,120
you near me,

187
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,320
my heart aches.

188
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,640
I really...

189
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,880
I...

190
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,760
I never asked you to save me.

191
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,560
You really don't have to do this.

192
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,880
But Ningzhi,

193
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,320
when I dealt with everyone

194
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,600
who ever hurt you,

195
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,720
I felt that was my purpose for living.

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,400
I know.

197
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,400
I've caused you trouble this time.

198
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,600
But my life belongs to you.

199
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,280
If you want to punish me,

200
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,800
you can take it right now.

201
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,960
I have no right to punish you.

202
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
Only the law does.

203
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,600
Don't worry.

204
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,900
I'll give you an explanation.

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,040
Do you know that Tao Han is

206
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,570
the real killer who ran over your stepfather?

207
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,080
After all, it was

208
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,920
a horrific scene.

209
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,880
Back then, Ningzhi

210
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,530
couldn't handle such a situation.

211
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,080
She was shocked

212
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
and grief-stricken,

213
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,000
so she fainted.

214
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,200
She didn't notice that I was the one who hit him.

215
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,730
According to what you said,

216
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,760
you acted on impulse.

217
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,340
Lu Ningzhi didn't see you hit the person,

218
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,240
and then your father took the blame for you.

219
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,280
After that, when Lu Ningzhi asked about it,

220
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
how did you explain it to her?

221
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,000
At first,

222
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,170
I didn't dare to see her.

223
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,050
I only told her the truth recently.

224
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,360
After

225
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,960
killing Fang Xiaofeng

226
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,240
and Dong Chengbin,

227
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,320
Tell me the details of how you committed the crime.

228
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,360
I snuck in through

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,330
a blind spot in the surveillance cameras.

230
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,400
I had seen

231
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,970
Lu Ningzhi enter the door code before,

232
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,040
so I knew their password.

233
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,400
After I got inside.

234
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,960
Who are you?

235
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,920
I rushed at him first

236
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,180
and injected the intoxicated Fang Xiaofeng with the drug.

237
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,760
Then I stabbed him.

238
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,840
Then I used his phone

239
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,930
to send blackmail messages to Dong Chengbin.

240
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,440
To lure him over.

241
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,080
I was hiding

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,120
behind the door, waiting.

243
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,600
As soon as Dong Chengbin entered,

244
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,400
I took him down

245
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
using the same method.

246
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,720
Then,

247
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,760
I set a fire.

248
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,560
I escaped

249
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,880
the same way I came in.

250
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,040
Why did you kill them?

251
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,480
Is someone behind this?

252
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,360
I wanted to kill them myself.

253
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,080
Nobody told me to do it.

254
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,600
Then how did you know

255
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,000
about the blind spots in the surveillance?

256
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,360
Pan Haili from property management told me.

257
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,600
I don't know why she wanted to help me.

258
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,360
Maybe

259
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,340
she noticed I was always following Ningzhi.

260
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,080
One day she suddenly

261
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,640
came to me.

262
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
She said she could

263
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,000
help me

264
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,100
avoid the cameras.

265
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,280
You trusted her that easily?

266
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,200
Besides that,

267
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,680
did she tell you anything else?

268
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,810
Elementary school.

269
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,420
Chi Xiao gave me very detailed information.

270
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,880
About the history between Tao Han

271
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,280
and Lu Ningzhi.

272
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,640
I know everything.

273
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,760
So persuading and guiding Tao Han

274
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,160
was an easy task.

275
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Who is Chi Xiao?

276
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,160
I don't know if Chi Xiao

277
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,720
is her real name.

278
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,580
But that's what the executives call her.

279
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
The subordinates

280
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
usually call her Fox.

281
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,760
The group?

282
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,560
What group?

283
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,450
I don't know the full name of the group.

284
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,760
I only know

285
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,400
the top decision-maker is called Old K.

286
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,320
So you're saying that the person who instructed you

287
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,200
to pose as a caregiver at the nursing home

288
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,880
and to work at the property management office this time

289
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
was Chi Xiao?

290
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,080
Yes.

291
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,800
Then what about the numbers?

292
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,440
The 25-second video,

293
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,920
the wallpaper with '25' in English,

294
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,160
the 12 graffiti pieces,

295
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,360
the book titled '12,'

296
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,400
and the room that Zheng Lanshu insisted on moving into -

297
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,040
Room 14.

298
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,840
What's going on with all of this?

299
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,240
I don't know.

300
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,410
I just followed Chi Xiao's instructions.

301
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,000
She wouldn't let me ask too many questions.

302
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,700
What about 14 then?

303
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,810
Why didn't 14 appear this time?

304
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,040
Or did you hide it somewhere?

305
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,440
There's no 14

306
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,400
because Chi Xiao didn't tell me

307
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,930
that we needed 14 this time.

308
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,720
Now tell me clearly

309
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,080
how you and Lu Ningzhi planned this.

310
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,160
Pan Haili?

311
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
Who's Pan Haili?

312
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,220
I don't know her

313
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,660
and have never met her.

314
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,040
Officer Chi,

315
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,840
I've said many times,

316
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,400
I really just want to live

317
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,800
a quiet life of my own.

318
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,160
When Fang Xiaofeng was abusing you,

319
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,220
did you just want to live a quiet life?

320
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,120
Yes.

321
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,040
When Zhu Chongliang was stalking you,

322
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
did you just want to live a quiet life?

323
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,400
Yes.

324
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,600
When Dong Chengbin assaulted you,

325
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,560
did you also just want to live a quiet life?

326
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,360
No.

327
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,240
I wanted to kill him,

328
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,200
grind his bones to dust,

329
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,840
cut him into pieces.

330
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,440
I...

331
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,650
Do you like psychology?

332
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,080
Studying the human mind,

333
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,480
manipulating people's hearts,

334
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,320
sometimes it's quite interesting,

335
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,120
isn't it?

336
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,040
You don't necessarily need to be interested to learn something.

337
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,500
Everyone has their flaws.

338
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,380
Everyone has weaknesses.

339
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,800
As long as you identify those weaknesses,

340
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,860
you can use anyone to your advantage.

341
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Just like Tao Han.

342
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,320
Please confirm this.

343
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,000
Sign here.

344
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,920
Why did you buy so many things?

345
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,720
Is it heavy?

346
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,560
It's fine.

347
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,200
You should have asked me.

348
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,480
Officer Chi.

349
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,560
If you don't have any other questions,

350
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,720
I need to leave now.

351
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,120
There's still a lot to do at the yoga studio.

352
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,440
Of course.

353
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,260
You can leave anytime.

354
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,890
The law says I can't keep you here too long.

355
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,600
But Fang Xiaofeng,

356
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,640
Tao Han,

357
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,680
Dong Chengbin,

358
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,170
Zhu Chongliang,

359
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,610
What about them?

360
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,080
Whether they were good people

361
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
or bad people,

362
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,160
whether they deserved it

363
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,440
or were misunderstood,

364
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,570
they can never walk out of there again.

365
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,660
Are you at peace with that?

366
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,640
Everyone has to pay

367
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,000
for their immature emotions.

368
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,640
I'm no exception.

369
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,440
Am I?

370
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,890
As for whether I'm at peace,

371
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,460
it doesn't matter.

372
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,120
If someone is evil,

373
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
evil deeds will be repaid with evil.

374
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,800
Ms. Lu.

375
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,800
Have you never thought about killing them?

376
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,800
Watching them helpless before you,

377
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,200
engulfed in flames,

378
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,600
unable to move.

379
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,360
And you,

380
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,160
being the god who watches them with indifference.

381
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,840
Have you really never thought about it?

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,120
Of course I have.

383
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,160
But I'm just a person,

384
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,520
not a god.

385
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,480
Officer Chi,

386
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,560
goodbye.

387
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,480
Someone who incites others to kill

388
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,000
and escapes legal punishment.

389
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,320
I kill whenever I want.

390
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,720
He typically holds a knife with his right hand,

391
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,920
but you use your left.

392
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,360
Without his orders,

393
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,930
you wouldn't dare kill.

394
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,200
I was your target from the beginning, wasn't I?

395
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Don't look back.

396
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,240
Keep walking.

397
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,880
Little Fox,

398
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,120
you must survive.
