1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya

2
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,440
Mrs. Zheng

3
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,880
Mrs. Zheng

4
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,840
It's windy here.

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,099
Let's go back and rest.

6
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,720
Don't interrupt me talking to my daughter.

7
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,600
Mrs. Zheng

8
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,200
I know you miss your daughter,

9
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,000
but it's windy here,

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,200
and you might catch cold.

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,680
How about this,

12
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,560
let's go back first,

13
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,620
and Ms. Zhou will be here in a few days.

14
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,520
Don't interrupt me talking to my daughter.

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,039
Mrs. Zheng

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,560
Xiarou

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,640
Xiaorou

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,880
Dr. Xie

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,440
Mrs. Zheng's condition has worsened again.

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,800
Xiaorou

21
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,000
Thank you all for your hard work.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,039
After working all night,

23
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,400
we finally have some progress.

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,039
Curly

25
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,759
go ahead.

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,800
First, we found a phone number

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,800
that Pei Xinlu contacted multiple times on his phone.

28
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,200
But our investigation revealed

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,920
this phone number wasn't registered under anyone's name.

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,759
The forensics department also indicated

31
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,240
that this phone number

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,800
stopped being used after Pei Xinlu went missing.

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,920
We couldn't accurately track the IP address.

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,760
So Cao Bin and I

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,160
made another visit to Pei Xinlu's company.

36
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,410
Get to the point.

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,760
Here's the key information.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,800
According to an employee at Xinrou Trading Company,

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,480
about half a month ago,

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,120
she saw Pei Xinlu at Mingzun Entertainment Club.

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,920
This place.

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,400
She saw Pei Xinlu with a woman

43
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,060
who looked very similar to Zhou Wanrou on a date.

44
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,440
So Cao Bin and I went to the club

45
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,800
and checked the surveillance footage and registration records.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,440
Yes.

47
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,850
And here's this,

48
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,760
take a look.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,560
They really do look alike.

50
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Rather than saying Pei Xinlu was cheating,

51
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,890
it seems that this Yu Jia

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,840
was Pei Xinlu's former lover.

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,520
The two of them

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,600
dated for three years.

55
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,920
They broke up ten years ago,

56
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,640
and Yu Jia went abroad after that.

57
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,720
But what's strange is

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,360
after Pei Xinlu broke up with Yu Jia,

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,920
he immediately got together with Zhou Wanrou

60
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,650
and married her shortly after.

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,680
Also,

62
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,880
Pei Xinlu's company faced

63
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,480
a major financial crisis about six months ago.

64
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,400
Right at that time,

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
Yu Jia returned to China.

66
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,120
And soon after,

67
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,400
she rekindled her relationship with Pei Xinlu.

68
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,360
This Yu Jia

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,600
is a key suspect.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
She could also be the next victim.

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,440
Let's go

72
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,200
to her place.

73
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,040
Captain Luo.

74
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
No one's home.

75
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,730
Let's withdraw.

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,090
Yes, sir.

77
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,360
Wait.

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,600
That's

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,220
Pei Xinlu's house.

80
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,320
Mrs. Zheng.

81
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,649
Let's go over there.

82
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,450
Where are you taking me?

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,520
Mrs. Zheng,

84
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,040
be good.

85
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,600
I don't want to go.

86
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,440
I'm taking you to see Xiaorou.

87
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,320
I don't want to see her.

88
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,980
Don't you want to see Xiaorou?

89
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,440
Xiaorou is waiting for you.

90
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
Your Xiaorou

91
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,700
is waiting for you.

92
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,720
Xiaorou?

93
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,280
Yes.

94
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,680
See Xiaorou.

95
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
See Xiaorou.

96
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,040
See Xiaorou.

97
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,840
Xiaorou,

98
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,280
see Xiaorou.

99
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,040
Yes.

100
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
See Xiaorou.

101
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,600
Master.

102
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,400
Why does everyone like to come here?

103
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,480
Mrs. Zheng too.

104
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,200
She used to come

105
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,460
and sit here every day.

106
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,320
Every day?

107
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,600
Since she changed rooms,

108
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
she comes here daily.

109
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,010
Wasn't she in this ward before?

110
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,680
She was in Room 6 before.

111
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,720
After her daughter Zhou Wanrou stopped visiting,

112
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,680
she insisted on moving to Room 14.

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,240
Do you know why

114
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,600
she insisted on Room 14?

115
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,680
She said

116
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,360
Room 14

117
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,820
is close to this place.

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,040
Mrs. Zheng must have gone out for some fresh air.

119
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,159
Her caregiver, Pan,

120
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,440
usually takes her out

121
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
around this time,

122
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,880
for about 2 hours each time.

123
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,480
I see.

124
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,720
They should be back soon.

125
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,520
Often?

126
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,640
With a caregiver accompanying her.

127
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,960
It's convenient for the elderly to go out.

128
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,320
We allow it here too.

129
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
About this caregiver Pan,

130
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,500
how much do you know about her?

131
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,080
Her name is Pan Haili.

132
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,400
She came to the nursing home about 3 months ago

133
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
and has been Mrs. Zheng's caregiver ever since.

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,360
Although she hasn't been here long,

135
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,560
in the entire nursing home,

136
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,640
she's the person Mrs. Zheng trusts the most.

137
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,920
She's particularly dependent on her.

138
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,780
Except for her,

139
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
the old lady doesn't listen

140
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,360
to anyone else.

141
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,000
Alright.

142
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,240
Take us to Pan Haili's staff quarters.

143
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,720
Sure.

144
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,380
Please follow me, both of you.

145
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,720
It's too clean.

146
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,159
Unnaturally clean.

147
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,200
Look.

148
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,920
Found it.

149
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,680
This is the employee register.

150
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,010
It has Pan Haili's personal information.

151
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,120
Take a look at this.

152
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,640
It moved.

153
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,560
Yu Jia withdrew money

154
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,640
from the ATM at Longyun Resort

155
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,080
just 2 hours ago.

156
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,800
She's probably hiding here at Longyun Resort.

157
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,640
Curly.

158
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Call Captain Luo.

159
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,200
Let's go.

160
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,840
Curly.

161
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Longyun Villa.

162
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,800
Ms. Yu.

163
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,280
The wooden cabin at the southernmost point of that hilltop.

164
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,880
Over there, right?

165
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,480
Yes.

166
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,000
Everyone,

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
head to the southernmost cabin.

168
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,760
Give me back Xiaorou!

169
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
Return Xiaorou to me!

170
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,200
Stop!

171
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,240
Stop it!

172
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,040
I'll kill you!

173
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,320
Give Xiaorou back!

174
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
Calm down!

175
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,100
I'll beat you to death!

176
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
Return my Xiaorou!

177
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,120
I really am.

178
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,680
How's it going?

179
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,080
He's the chief examiner.

180
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,720
Let me tell you.

181
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
This old lady

182
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
is impossible to communicate with.

183
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
Why don't you try?

184
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,880
Alright.

185
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,040
Is she emotionally stable?

186
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,880
It's just hard to gauge her emotions.

187
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,610
Captain Luo.

188
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,640
I've discovered important information.

189
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,440
Look.

190
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
This Pan Haili

191
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,320
is fake.

192
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,240
The identity she used to register is real.

193
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,570
This person does exist.

194
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,280
But she died

195
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,650
from illness a year ago.

196
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,880
Look at this photo in the employee handbook.

197
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,080
Don't they look alike?

198
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,760
If you don't look carefully,

199
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,960
most people wouldn't notice the difference.

200
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,920
Although she doesn't look

201
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
as similar as Zhou Wanrou and Yu Jia,

202
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
it's more than enough

203
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,880
to pass the nursing home's recruitment process.

204
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,360
Then I immediately asked Cao Bin

205
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,880
to investigate the whereabouts

206
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,120
of this fake Pan Haili.

207
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,920
Unfortunately,

208
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,720
we didn't find any information.

209
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,160
What was this fake Pan Haili's purpose

210
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,760
in using a false identity to instigate murder?

211
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,290
It's not just instigation.

212
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,360
Do you really believe

213
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,840
that with Zheng Lanshu's physical abilities,

214
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,920
she could have, all by herself,

215
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,520
tortured Yu Jia like that?

216
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,580
Severely injured,

217
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,560
she's still in the hospital fighting for her life.

218
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,040
And the injuries on her body

219
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,720
are almost identical to the torture

220
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,640
Zhou Wanrou suffered before her death.

221
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,040
I also don't believe Zheng Lanshu could lure Pei Xinlu

222
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,280
to that abandoned building,

223
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,360
torture him,

224
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,440
and then kill him.

225
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,560
So there must be

226
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,490
the fake Pan Haili's involvement.

227
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,120
Everyone's here.

228
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,600
Captain Luo,

229
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,800
there's a situation.

230
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,520
The videos of Zheng Lanshu assaulting Pei Xinlu

231
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,400
and Yu Jia

232
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,440
have been uploaded online

233
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,370
and already have quite a few views.

234
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,240
What are you standing there for?

235
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,840
Quickly contact cybersecurity to block it.

236
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,680
Got it.

237
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,400
Minimize the social impact.

238
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,680
I understand.

239
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,480
Thanks,

240
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,120
thank you.

241
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,480
Cybersecurity says

242
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,080
the videos have already been blocked.

243
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,280
But they haven't identified who blocked them.

244
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,920
Who was it?

245
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,240
They moved even faster than us.

246
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,040
I don't know.

247
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,100
Let's watch the two videos first.

248
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,170
Give me back Xiarou!

249
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,650
Give me back Xiarou!

250
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,010
Give me back Xiarou!

251
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
I'll kill you!

252
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,130
Give me back Xiarou!

253
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,400
25.

254
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,000
Both videos are 25 seconds long.

255
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,440
This number has appeared again.

256
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,320
It really has.

257
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,040
And have you noticed

258
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,360
that in these two videos

259
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,420
there's no sign of the fake Pan Haili?

260
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,160
This proves

261
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,960
someone is deliberately trying to frame Zheng Lanshu.

262
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,560
Do you think the person who released these videos

263
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,090
could be the fake Pan Haili?

264
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,480
This logo

265
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,160
is a fox,

266
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,720
right?

267
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,480
Fox...

268
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,400
Could the person behind this

269
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,560
be the one Xu Yang mentioned,

270
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,360
Hu Li?

271
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,980
Almost certainly.

272
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,100
But what does this number represent?

273
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,440
Young master.

274
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,900
I'll wait for you outside.

275
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,680
Qu Bai.

276
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,400
Long time no see.

277
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,760
Not bad.

278
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
You've improved.

279
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,260
Let's have a match.

280
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,800
If you win,

281
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,160
I'll give you the Jack disc.

282
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,960
Sounds good.

283
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,120
What mission did K give you

284
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,440
that makes you go to such lengths

285
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,800
and even deliberately provoke the police?

286
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,560
Should I remind you

287
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,420
that this isn't how our organization operates?

288
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,340
You have no right to question my mission.

289
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,000
Let me remind you as well.

290
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,980
We are the same kind of people.

291
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,640
We should be keeping each other warm in the darkness.

292
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,010
You shouldn't empathize with the police.

293
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,840
No matter how much you try to protect Chi Xia,

294
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,640
she's still a police officer.

295
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,080
Do you think when she learns the truth,

296
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
she'll appreciate what you've done?

297
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,360
Don't let momentary luck

298
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,320
cloud your judgment, Qu Bai.

299
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,040
Is that so?

300
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,520
Why do I feel

301
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,620
that you care about her more than I do?

302
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,160
You...

303
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,940
Showing off in front of an expert.

304
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,570
How do you expect to beat me?

305
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,160
Jack Disk

306
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Come and get it yourself if you dare.

307
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,640
Qu Bai

308
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,880
Don't go too far.

309
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,050
With those pathetic skills

310
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,540
you still want to get your hands on the Jack Disk?

311
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,140
You've messed with the wrong person.

312
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,920
Be careful or you'll suffer the consequences.

313
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,640
Qu Bai

314
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,240
Don't act so high and mighty here.

315
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,680
We've both crawled through blood and mud.

316
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,960
Why does she get all the love from her parents?

317
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,880
Why does she have that halo that puts me in her shadow?

318
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,400
I just want to know

319
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,200
what she thinks

320
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,120
about this case.

321
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,050
Doesn't she want to find evidence?

322
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,360
The evidence and the killer are both with me.

323
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,080
Qu Bai

324
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,000
As long as I'm around,

325
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,840
she'll never get what she wants.

326
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,720
Old K really has raised a lunatic.

327
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,760
Do you think your worthless evidence

328
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
will be of any use?

329
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,720
Let me go!

330
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,440
Qu Bai.

331
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,890
But your plan will eventually have flaws.

332
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,520
The hospital just sent news.

333
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,000
Yu Jia is not dead.

334
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,360
She's now under police protection.

335
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,480
Once Yu Jia wakes up,

336
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,240
all your so-called evidence

337
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,480
will become meaningless jokes.

338
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,560
I suggest you think about how to fix this mess.

339
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,880
Stay away from Chi Xia.

340
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,000
Qu Bai.

341
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,320
Qu Bai.

342
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,480
The recent homicide cases caused by Hu Li.

343
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,010
Although the killer was caught by the police,

344
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,400
she wasn't exposed.

345
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,080
And she didn't receive any punishment from Old K.

346
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,320
That's very unusual.

347
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,520
I'm afraid these cases

348
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,410
are related to Chi Xia's memories.

349
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,280
If you hadn't taken advantage of the situation,

350
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,000
I wouldn't have lost my child.

351
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,080
So Pei Xi is here to pay with her life.

352
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,960
You mean

353
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,020
this person is a scapegoat prepared by the Fox long ago?

354
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
You've actually found her already.

355
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,960
Then you'll never find the Fox.

356
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,330
What do you mean?

357
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,410
