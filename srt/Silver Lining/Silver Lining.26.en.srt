1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya.

2
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,120
She's out of danger now.

3
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,000
But as for when she'll regain consciousness,

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,930
it will definitely take some time.

5
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,400
The specific situation

6
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,120
depends on her will to live

7
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,520
and physical condition.

8
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,840
Thank you.

9
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,480
If anything happens,

10
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,000
please contact the police immediately.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,800
Okay.

12
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,880
No signs of forced entry.

13
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,840
No evidence of external damage either.

14
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,180
This indicates

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,660
the killer definitely entered using the passcode.

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
I've already reviewed

17
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,320
the fire department's footage.

18
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,680
Fang Xiaofeng died right here.

19
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,570
Dong Chengbin died at the doorway.

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,840
This means

21
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,039
the killer was in the middle of the crime

22
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,880
when they happened to run into Dong Chengbin,

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,240
so they silenced him.

24
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,600
This makes logical sense.

25
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,400
Zhu Chongliang must have witnessed everything.

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,200
Yes.

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,960
But the surveillance footage shows

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,160
no suspicious individuals

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,560
ever entered Building 8.

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,600
That's strange.

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,280
Tomorrow when the property management is working,

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,280
I'll have Curly come check the surveillance footage.

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,440
Why did you buy so many things?

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,300
Are they heavy?

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,120
It's fine.

36
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,400
You should have asked me first.

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
My fridge can't fit all this.

38
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,680
I bought what seemed useful.

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,320
How can we eat all of this?

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,120
These items have a long shelf life.

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,480
Let's eat the fruit first.

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,280
Okay.

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,680
These are

44
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,740
all Xiao Fang's favorite dishes.

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,520
He was so young.

46
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,520
Such a pity.

47
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,930
Eat something, Mom.

48
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,960
I don't understand

49
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,090
how you can act like nothing happened.

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,860
He was your husband after all.

51
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,040
How could you?

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,840
Mom.

53
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,240
Since when did you

54
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,960
start caring about our relationship?

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
I had no idea.

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,020
It was an accident, wasn't it?

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,810
I'm just worried about you.

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,560
How will you

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,760
manage on your own?

60
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,560
I'll live just like

61
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
you've been living all these years.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,460
Long-term surveillance.

63
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,120
Captain Luo.

64
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,279
The diary

65
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,540
is written like a mundane log.

66
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,720
See this?

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,130
This guy's crush is Lu Ningzhi.

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,880
That bastard from 602

69
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,620
actually bullied her.

70
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,970
I really hate myself

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,020
for not being able to help her.

72
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,040
I'm useless.

73
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,600
So useless.

74
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,050
That guy named Fang.

75
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,680
You're in cahoots with that bastard from 602,

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,280
Fang Xiaofeng,

77
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,409
you'll pay for this!

78
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,400
If I see you hit her again,

79
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,240
I'll kill you myself!

80
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,400
It seems the scenes Zhu Chongliang described

81
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,760
actually happened.

82
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,360
But in his mind,

83
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,280
the timeline got scrambled.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,920
That's why

85
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,500
he can only remember the things he hates.

86
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,480
This Zhu Chongliang,

87
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,250
since he had been stalking for a long time,

88
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,440
it's not surprising

89
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,700
that he became a witness to this case.

90
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,240
I think

91
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,000
after manipulating the unpredictable Zheng Lanshu once,

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,640
the Fox wouldn't choose someone like Zhu Chongliang

93
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,920
as a scapegoat again.

94
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,040
Maybe Zhu Chongliang

95
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,440
was just traumatized after witnessing it,

96
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,480
mistakenly believing he killed someone,

97
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,340
which is why he turned himself in.

98
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,400
It seems we need to

99
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,530
have another meeting with Lu Ningzhi.

100
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,280
Sir,

101
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,200
what's the situation?

102
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,880
Sir,

103
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,940
I think there's something suspicious about this fire.

104
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,570
I'm asking about Chi Xia's condition.

105
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,080
Chi Xia is safe for now

106
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,840
with no unusual circumstances.

107
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,880
Don't leave yet.

108
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,080
Wait until they've gone before you leave,

109
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,140
in case someone tries to harm Chi Xia.

110
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,080
Understood.

111
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,680
Zhu Chongliang's examination results are in.

112
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,080
He does have mental abnormalities

113
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,600
and below-average intelligence.

114
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,480
He's awake now,

115
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,000
but his emotions are still unstable.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,200
I've arranged for someone to watch him.

117
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,080
At this point,

118
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,640
there's not much value in questioning Zhu Chongliang again.

119
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,320
We need to find a new lead.

120
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,300
What's the situation with Chen Lingxin?

121
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,640
Chen Lingxin has a new boyfriend now

122
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,600
named Tao Han.

123
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,640
What do you mean?

124
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,360
Well,

125
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,159
Tao Han's father

126
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,680
caused a traffic accident five years ago

127
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,810
that killed Lu Ningzhi's stepfather.

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,130
What a coincidence.

129
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,840
Quite the coincidence indeed.

130
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,760
Currently, Jue and I suspect

131
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,600
that Chen Lingxin,

132
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,760
unable to bear Fang Xiaofeng's deception,

133
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,160
threatened to burn Fang Xiaofeng to death,

134
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,520
then used Tao Han, who has a grudge against Lu Ningzhi's family,

135
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,920
to take revenge on Fang Xiaofeng's family.

136
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,210
Do you know this person?

137
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,160
Yes, I do.

138
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,480
Just acquaintances.

139
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,000
Or like Dong Chengbin?

140
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,640
Just nodding acquaintances.

141
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,840
Just acquaintances,

142
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,680
neighbors several doors apart.

143
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,200
He lives in 606.

144
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,040
You seem to know quite a bit about him.

145
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,500
I'm not interested in him,

146
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,900
he's interested in me.

147
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,600
I know he used to peep

148
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,159
and stalk me.

149
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,159
I see.

150
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,760
Thank you.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,280
In his statement,

152
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,760
we found some information.

153
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,120
It says you and

154
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,050
Dong Chengbin had some issues.

155
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,680
About that,

156
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't want to talk about it.

157
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Dong Chengbin assaulted me before.

158
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,040
He saw it.

159
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,680
Does Fang Xiaofeng know?

160
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,640
He knows.

161
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,919
He has more than once

162
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,100
used this incident

163
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,200
to blackmail Dong Chengbin.

164
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,440
I really

165
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,120
just want to live

166
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,600
a peaceful life.

167
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,040
But for some reason,

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,530
things never go as planned.

169
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,280
Why didn't you

170
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,000
tell us about this last time?

171
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,610
I didn't want to mention it.

172
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,820
It's not something to be proud of.

173
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,650
Who wants to reopen old wounds?

174
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,600
Why don't you divorce him?

175
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,970
You could live peacefully on your own.

176
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,480
I told you last time,

177
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,520
I can't leave him.

178
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,660
What exactly can't you leave behind?

179
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,840
When I married him,

180
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,690
my mother strongly opposed it.

181
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,520
I once used the most vicious words

182
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,380
to mock her two failed marriages.

183
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,880
If I get divorced,

184
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,680
I'll become just like my mother.

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,040
I would lose.

186
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,080
I don't want to lose.

187
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,280
How much do you know about Fang Xiaofeng's affair?

188
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,680
Nothing.

189
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,650
Not interested.

190
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,640
Do you remember

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,800
the traffic accident that killed your stepfather

192
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,000
five years ago?

193
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,160
Yes.

194
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,880
The driver's son

195
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,620
was my high school classmate,

196
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,720
Tao Han.

197
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,660
Have you kept in touch since then?

198
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,880
Back then,

199
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,080
his father was charged with a traffic offense.

200
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Before the trial,

201
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,000
Tao Han knelt down and begged me to forgive his father

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,460
and not send him to prison.

203
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,080
But the law is the law.

204
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,680
There was nothing I could do.

205
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,840
Tao Han seemed

206
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,500
resentful about the verdict.

207
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,240
Later I heard

208
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,440
he went abroad.

209
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,810
What do you think about what Lu Ningzhi just said?

210
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,730
I don't think she's making up her experience.

211
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,080
It's just that she gives me a feeling...

212
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,100
How should I put it?

213
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm the one asking questions,

214
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,490
but she's the one controlling the situation.

215
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,120
I found it.

216
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,920
This Tao Han returned to China

217
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,200
half a month ago, just days before the New Year,

218
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,280
already.

219
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,660
Here's his itinerary.

220
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,730
So from what we know now,

221
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,280
there's a possibility that Tao Han

222
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,520
is seeking revenge against Lu Ningzhi's family.

223
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,920
Was Dong Chengbin really killed

224
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,200
because he witnessed Tao Han committing murder

225
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
and had to be silenced?

226
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,080
Then what about Zhu Chongliang?

227
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,560
How did he manage to witness everything

228
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,090
and still remain unharmed?

229
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,660
Are you suggesting

230
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,040
that Dong Chengbin's death

231
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,520
wasn't because he witnessed Fang Xiaofeng's murder?

232
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,400
Hard to say.

233
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,400
Regarding Chen Lingxin's suspicion,

234
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,000
I now have a different perspective.

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,800
Just tell me.

236
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,480
This girl Chen Lingxin,

237
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,640
despite her young age,

238
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,840
has quite an extensive dating history.

239
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,280
In just the past three years,

240
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,360
we've verified that

241
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,560
she's had double-digit official relationships.

242
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,320
Half a month ago,

243
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,920
she just broke up with Fang Xiaofeng.

244
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,680
Three days later,

245
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,880
she got together with her current boyfriend,

246
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,240
who is Tao Han.

247
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,720
According to people close to Chen Lingxin,

248
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,600
this girl

249
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,840
comes from a wealthy family

250
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,520
and her personality is

251
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,850
outgoing and cheerful.

252
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,520
She just has this habit of

253
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,960
threatening her ex-boyfriends when they break up.

254
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,400
It's only to embarrass them.

255
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,160
She has never actually

256
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
followed through with her threats.

257
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,000
And soon after,

258
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,440
she would start a new relationship.

259
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,900
I think a girl like this...

260
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,720
She wouldn't go to extremes

261
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,960
over an ex-boyfriend.

262
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,240
And this doesn't really match the Fox's

263
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,940
criteria for selecting criminal accomplices.

264
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,560
Now Tao Han is the only suspect left.

265
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,160
I think he's a valid suspect.

266
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,000
Being dissatisfied with his father's verdict

267
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
is a motive for the crime.

268
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,160
Getting close to Chen Lingxin

269
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,360
was to learn about Lu Ningzhi's family.

270
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
If the Fox is involved in this case,

271
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,720
he also fits the Fox's criteria

272
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,780
for choosing someone to manipulate.

273
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,720
That's all for today.

274
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,850
Thank you everyone.

275
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,400
Thank you for your hard work, teacher.

276
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,920
It's no trouble at all.

277
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,160
You all did great.

278
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,600
Why are you here?

279
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,640
I came to congratulate Coach Lu

280
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,600
on completing your first personal training session.

281
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,730
How did you know I had a personal training session today?

282
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,200
You referred the client.

283
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,480
Why did you do this?

284
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,320
I want to witness and be part of

285
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,650
every step in your life.

286
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,820
Whether it's the past,

287
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,960
the present,

288
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,440
or the future.

289
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,560
Tao Han.

290
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,600
Thank you,

291
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,760
but it's no use.

292
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,960
I don't believe that.

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,520
You know about my family situation.

294
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,240
I don't care.

295
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,040
My stepfather...

296
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,160
I'm not him.

297
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,120
Don't you understand?

298
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,720
Between us,

299
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,520
it's my issue,

300
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
not yours.

301
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,890
My mother remarried when I was very young.

302
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,400
I grew up with my stepfather's

303
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,160
alcoholism and domestic violence.

304
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,960
Towards men,

305
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,880
I only feel hatred and disgust.

306
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,240
In my memory,

307
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
men have only brought me pain.

308
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,320
I can't bring myself

309
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,880
to trust or rely on any man.

310
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,140
Don't you understand?

311
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,480
Ningzhi.

312
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,080
Ningzhi.

313
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,720
Not all men are like your stepfather.

314
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,880
I want to be someone you can trust,

315
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,340
someone who protects you.

316
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,640
Today's private lesson was just a small thing,

317
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,200
but it represents that I can

318
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,320
stand up for you when you need me.

319
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,480
I can do anything

320
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,200
you need me to do for you.

321
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,880
If you don't bring me the money tomorrow,

322
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,140
I'll beat you to death.

323
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,920
Always crying.

324
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,520
I'll beat you to death!

325
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,240
Get out!

326
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,400
Let me go!

327
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,200
I'll kill you!

328
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,560
Still trying to run?

329
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,960
I'll show you what happens when you run.

330
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,040
Marrying your mother

331
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,000
was the worst mistake of my life.

332
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,730
I'll beat you

333
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
for running away.

334
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,980
Running again?

335
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,880
I'll kill you!

336
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,940
I'll beat you to death!

337
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
I'll destroy you!

338
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
I'm in trouble.

339
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,420
Binjiang Road Reservoir Bridge.

340
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,400
Come quickly.

341
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,040
Dad.

342
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,200
Are you okay?

343
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,440
I'm here.

344
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,960
I'm here.

345
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,970
I'm with you.

346
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,440
I'm with you.

347
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,840
I'm here.

348
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,560
Ningzhi.

349
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,400
Ningzhi.

350
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,080
Ningzhi.

351
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,360
I just wanted to

352
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,339
teach him a lesson for you.

353
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,000
I

354
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,579
didn't expect this to happen.

355
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,079
How dare you?

356
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,800
He's my father.

357
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,119
When I was pouring the wine,

358
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,359
I accidentally knocked the bottle.

359
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,400
Did I scare you?

360
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,770
Mom, what are you doing with that wine?

361
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,290
Since you rarely come back,

362
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,800
let's make an offering to him.

363
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,130
It's been so many years.

364
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,420
Let's not hold grudges against the dead.

365
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,120
He drank so much when he was alive

366
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
and still wasn't satisfied.

367
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,570
Now you want him to keep drinking after death?

368
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,720
What did you see?

369
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,120
I... I saw

370
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,520
she was bullied.

371
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,200
Is Chi Xiao going

372
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,860
to use fire again for his plan?

373
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,680
25

374
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,360
25

375
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,480
What about 14?

376
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,680
Luo Xun, Wang Guangyuan

377
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,320
Special Appearance
