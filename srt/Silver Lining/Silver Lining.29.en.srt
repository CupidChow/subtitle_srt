1
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya

2
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,760
Based on our separate interrogations,

3
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
Tao Han and Lu Ningzhi's testimonies

4
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,200
were most likely coordinated beforehand.

5
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,519
This guy

6
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,290
is taking all the blame.

7
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,360
If he doesn't admit

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,420
that he was instigated by Lu Ningzhi,

9
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
it will be

10
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,560
difficult for us to find evidence

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
to convict Lu Ningzhi.

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,960
Also,

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,360
Lu Ningzhi wasn't

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,560
physically present at the crime scene.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,760
And Zhu Chongliang

16
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,600
can't provide any testimony that would implicate Lu Ningzhi

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,560
as the mastermind behind this.

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,250
The summons period is almost over.

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,480
We have to let her go.

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,800
Lu Ningzhi probably knew five years ago

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,280
how to distance herself

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,840
and escape legal responsibility.

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,120
That's why Chi Xiao,

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
or the Fox, chose her.

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,120
With the Fox's help

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,759
and Tao Han and Zhu Chongliang

27
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,620
willingly becoming her weapons,

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,000
she could perfectly avoid responsibility again.

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,960
Has the Fox's identity

30
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,880
been verified?

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,200
There are many people named Chi Xiao in the system.

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
We need more specific filtering criteria.

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,440
This Fox, just like Old K,

34
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,080
might just be a code name.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,020
Although we don't know

36
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,200
why these people orchestrated

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,600
so many vigilante cases,

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm certain that

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,440
these five cases

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,250
all have specific targets.

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,440
12,

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,160
14,

43
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,960
25.

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,960
These three numbers

45
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,520
appear in all five cases.

46
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,740
But we can't find any pattern yet.

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,600
I can't tell if they're

48
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,560
deliberately provoking us

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,520
or trying to hint at something.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,160
Where's the number 14 this time?

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,160
Indeed.

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,079
We really need to figure out

53
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,000
what these numbers actually represent.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,880
We can't let up.

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,520
Otherwise when similar cases appear in the future,

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,920
we'll be clueless again.

57
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,200
We can't allow Dongzhou

58
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,060
to remain in such a state of panic.

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
That's right.

60
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,440
So,

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,820
wherever the evidence leads,

62
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,360
that's where we stop.

63
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,200
We need to maintain this spirit of thorough investigation,

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,040
but

65
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,040
we shouldn't get stuck in a dead end.

66
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
We need to investigate the numbers,

67
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,840
but we must also follow proper procedures.

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
Let's transfer the case to the prosecutor's office as soon as possible.

69
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Okay.

70
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,520
Yes, yes.

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,280
Who are you?

72
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,450
What do you want?

73
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,720
Inciting murder.

74
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,080
You don't really think

75
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,010
you can live out the rest of your life in peace, do you?

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
You're Fox's person.

77
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,160
This isn't what we agreed on.

78
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,200
Let me go now.

79
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,480
Fox.

80
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,130
She's not worthy of commanding me.

81
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160
Besides,

82
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,159
she can barely save herself now.

83
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,920
Whatever she promised you

84
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
simply can't be fulfilled anymore.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,400
Who really sent you here?

86
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,120
I'll give you money.

87
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,159
Just let me go.

88
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
Help!

89
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,920
Help! Is anyone there?

90
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,080
Don't scream.

91
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
Lu Ningzhi manipulates people

92
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,850
and treats lives as worthless.

93
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,160
She has repeatedly escaped legal punishment.

94
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,400
You police can't punish her,

95
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,200
the law can't punish her.

96
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,520
So I'll deliver justice myself.

97
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,520
I'm at Factory 14,

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,840
waiting for you all to witness.

99
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,920
Fourteen.

100
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
It's buried here.

101
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,500
Sure enough, all three appeared.

102
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,960
Is this person a relative of those victims?

103
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,170
Definitely not.

104
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,600
There's no anger in his emotions.

105
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
He's clearly targeting the police.

106
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,920
No matter what,

107
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,000
safety is our top priority.

108
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,680
If they dare to challenge the police so blatantly,

109
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,120
they must be well-prepared.

110
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,000
Stay alert,

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,860
ensure safety,

112
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,120
select the team and move out.

113
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,760
Got it.

114
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:53,920
What's happening?

115
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,760
The group's people

116
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
have taken Lu Ningzhi to Factory 14,

117
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,360
and the Major Crimes Unit is heading there now.

118
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,600
Sir,

119
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,240
the source of this information is unclear.

120
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,840
Going there rashly

121
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,880
could be dangerous.

122
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,560
I don't know why Old K

123
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,440
is so determined

124
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,920
to restore Chi Xia's memory.

125
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,480
He might want to get something from her.

126
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,520
But for Chi Xia,

127
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,680
this is definitely trouble.

128
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,810
Since it's trouble,

129
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,600
I won't shield her from it.

130
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,060
Who will protect her then?

131
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,080
Don't move!

132
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,880
Police!

133
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,200
Put the knife down.

134
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Drop your weapon.

135
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,320
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,280
My goal is to kill her.

137
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
You won't do that.

138
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,240
From the video you sent

139
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,400
to the police, it's clear

140
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,000
that you understand the law.

141
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,680
Kidnapping

142
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,640
or murder,

143
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,240
you know the difference very well.

144
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,840
You won't make a choice that works against you.

145
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,159
Step back!

146
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,400
You can try.

147
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,840
Put down the gun.

148
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,200
Put down the gun.

149
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,680
Now we're even.

150
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:31,960
We can talk now.

151
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,320
Be careful. We can talk now.

152
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,180
We can talk now.

153
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,730
But you're not the person in the video.

154
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,760
He usually holds the knife with his right hand.

155
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,800
But you use your left hand.

156
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,000
Without his orders,

157
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,680
you wouldn't dare to kill.

158
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,480
Tell me.

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,930
What do you want?

160
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,240
Someone who incites others to kill

161
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,840
and escapes legal punishment.

162
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,240
I kill whenever I want to.

163
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,800
I don't need anyone's orders.

164
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,760
This is called carrying out justice.

165
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,490
If you're really so righteous.

166
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,410
Let that female officer Chi Xia come instead.

167
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,680
Would she be willing?

168
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,680
I am willing.

169
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,960
Chi Xia!

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,040
Save the hostages first.

171
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,170
We'll play it by ear.

172
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,020
One for one, right?

173
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,160
I go over there.

174
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,140
She comes here.

175
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,080
Agreed.

176
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,080
Don't move!

177
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,039
Put the knife down.

178
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,679
Freeze!

179
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,400
Step back.

180
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,130
I've been your target from the beginning, haven't I?

181
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
As expected from you,

182
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,160
Officer Chi.

183
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,660
What's the purpose of doing this?

184
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,880
Light it up.

185
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,840
Save me.

186
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,720
Help me.

187
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,080
Little fox.

188
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,800
You must survive.

189
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,040
Over here.

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,930
Keep searching.

191
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,920
Chi Xia.

192
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,540
Let me tell you something.

193
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,660
I'm afraid I can't get out of here.

194
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,850
I'll draw them away.

195
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,680
Run down this path.

196
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,560
Don't look back.

197
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,680
Search carefully.

198
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,040
I'm over here.

199
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,340
Go. Over there.

200
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Don't look back.

201
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,600
Keep going.

202
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,200
Chi Xia

203
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,080
Chi Xia

204
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,720
I'll go help Qu Bai.

205
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,400
Stay here.

206
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,120
Don't move.

207
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,290
Keep yourself safe.

208
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,800
Don't look back.

209
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,920
Keep moving forward.

210
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,480
Hurry up.

211
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,820
This way. This way.

212
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,480
Hurry up.

213
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,400
Keep going down this path

214
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,620
and you'll be safe.

215
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,160
Go now.

216
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,240
It'll be too late if you don't leave now.

217
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
What about uncle?

218
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,000
Only if you survive

219
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,320
will you have a chance to save him.

220
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,180
I can only accompany you this far.

221
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,240
Go!

222
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,720
Keep walking forward.

223
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,650
Don't look back.

224
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,840
Little fox,

225
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,640
you must survive.

226
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,680
You're awake.

227
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,410
How are you feeling?

228
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,440
Let me tell you,

229
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,280
your arm

230
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,480
was just reset after dislocation.

231
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,400
Move it around

232
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,480
and see if anything feels uncomfortable.

233
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,280
I'm fine.

234
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,610
What about the kidnappers?

235
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,240
They said

236
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,730
they were just hired to do a job.

237
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
I'm pretty sure

238
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,800
it's related to that fox.

239
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,960
Qu Bai,

240
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,280
is he okay?

241
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,800
He's fine. His injuries aren't serious.

242
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,930
Just took a few hits.

243
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,480
Qu Bai.

244
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,760
How did he know about our operation?

245
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,640
Long time no see.

246
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,090
Long time no see.

247
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,600
I mean...

248
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,080
It's been a really long time.

249
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,680
It's been a really long time.

250
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,610
Why do you like persimmons and pomegranates?

251
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
I have a sister.

252
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,280
Whenever she won a fight,

253
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,410
she would get some persimmons.

254
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,210
But she never ate them herself.

255
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,240
She always saved them for me.

256
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,360
She didn't know

257
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,580
those were the most delicious things I've ever tasted.

258
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,890
What a coincidence.

259
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,730
I used to get into fights when I was little.

260
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,330
Whenever I got hurt,

261
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,280
my brother would give me a lychee candy.

262
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,440
He told me,

263
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,240
'Have some candy,

264
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,530
and the wound won't hurt anymore.'

265
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,450
Are you feeling better?

266
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,580
Just a scratch.

267
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,120
I'm used to it.

268
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,490
This is the highest mountain in Dongzhou.

269
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,880
I still remember

270
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,680
how you used to take me to the highest mountain over there.

271
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,680
Looking down at all of Lawa Village.

272
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,240
We had so little free time.

273
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,160
That's why those moments were especially precious.

274
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,720
But I hated that place.

275
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,200
That's why I had to leave.

276
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,609
You have the right to choose your freedom.

277
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,599
I left.

278
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,119
You helped me.

279
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,000
Lawa Village isn't big,

280
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,240
but it always gives people

281
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
a feeling that you can never escape.

282
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,080
I must help you.

283
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,570
The law casts a wide net.

284
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,720
Do you think Old K can escape?

285
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,360
Qubai.

286
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,440
Walk toward the light.

287
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,020
Don't put me in a difficult position.

288
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,520
That light

289
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,360
has already shone into my heart.

290
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,960
It hasn't faded all these years.

291
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,100
No matter the past,

292
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,520
present,

293
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,400
or future.

294
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,210
Before Fu Gang died,

295
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,440
he put the paper formula in a coded box

296
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,160
and hid it somewhere.

297
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
I remembered a sequence of numbers,

298
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,520
including but not limited to these digits.

299
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,640
I'm guessing

300
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,040
there must be a master key

301
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,880
that can decode this sequence.
