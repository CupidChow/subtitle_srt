1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya.

2
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,520
You should eat less candy. It's bad for your teeth.

3
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,120
Officer Chi.

4
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,440
Sorry to bother you so late.

5
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,000
Am I interrupting your overtime work?

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,560
I'm not working overtime today.

7
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,880
But I might as well be.

8
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,039
Until I solve this case,

9
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,500
my mind is a complete mess even when I'm home.

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,759
I'm just fulfilling my duty as a good citizen.

11
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,800
Don't tell me

12
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,880
the Sun Xiangbo case is still troubling you, Officer Chi?

13
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,280
I haven't had the chance to thank you yet.

14
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,880
Although the case was a bit complicated,

15
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,000
you've been a great help to us.

16
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,360
If you really want to thank me,

17
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,200
come practice boxing more often.

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,280
It's rare to find someone with such compatible energy.

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,320
Just chatting casually

20
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,449
makes me feel happy.

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,840
That sounds great.

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,680
I was going to prepare a medal for you,

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,120
but now the department can save some money.

24
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,760
Get some rest.

25
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,240
See you another day.

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,640
Okay.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,840
Goodbye.

28
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,920
Goodbye.

29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,840
After all these years,

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,240
you haven't changed a bit,

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,360
still so adorable.

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,000
Liang Ruqing is pitiful.

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,040
But after all these years together,

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,920
we only have resentment and disgust left between us.

35
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,240
Linlin is a girl.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She'll get married sooner or later.

37
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,040
Sweetheart,

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,760
today is your birthday.

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,120
Daddy bought you

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,360
a nice present.

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,600
A teddy bear.

42
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,880
Put on the birthday hat.

43
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,540
Thank you, Mom.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,520
Mom?

45
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,280
I have a question for you.

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,490
I'm not your biological child.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,960
Aren't you afraid I might suddenly leave you someday?

48
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,079
Silly child.

49
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,320
Why are you saying these things?

50
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,880
We're a family together.

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,120
Aren't we happy?

52
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,240
Even if in the future,

53
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,079
for whatever reason,

54
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,360
we get separated,

55
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,320
the part of you that we've loved

56
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,800
will take our place

57
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,720
and stay with you always.

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,400
That's right.

59
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,079
Today is your birthday.

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,560
We should be happy.

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,490
Dad will light the candles for you.

62
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,280
And you,

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,800
make a nice wish.

64
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,920
Okay,

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,360
let's make a wish.

66
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,320
Sis!

67
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,600
Sis!

68
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,159
Luo Xun,

69
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,240
let me go!

70
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:49,920
Luo Xun!

71
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,920
Who?

72
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,560
Who did this?

73
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,040
Calm down.

74
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,240
Tell me who did this.

75
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,970
Take it easy.

76
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,610
Your sister, she...

77
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,800
This is her phone.

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,290
My condolences.

79
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,440
Sis!

80
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,200
Would a delicate flower choose to join the major crimes unit?

81
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,760
What if you actually face a case?

82
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,400
Your duty is to protect the safety of the people.

83
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,460
Stop worrying about your big sister.

84
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,440
Curly hair.

85
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,040
Let's work out

86
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,840
and lose some weight.

87
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,960
Stop exercising.

88
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,440
We need to work.

89
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,160
Not bad.

90
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,159
Already in work mode so early.

91
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,400
Looks like yesterday's gloom has completely disappeared.

92
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,200
Good.

93
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,560
Captain Luo.

94
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,850
Help me think about something.

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,840
Besides people close to Liang Ruqing and Sun Xiangbo,

96
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,440
who else has a motive?

97
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,680
Hypnotic murder.

98
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,960
Who could Liang Ruqing trust so much?

99
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,960
What is the anchor?

100
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,610
Jing Hao, right.

101
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,720
I almost forgot.

102
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,440
I need to deliver documents to Director Chang.

103
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,840
Good thing I set an alarm.

104
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,600
Alarm...

105
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,880
What time are classes at Feiyang Technical School in the afternoon?

106
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,640
Let me see.

107
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,680
2 p.m.

108
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,820
The anchor is the school bell.

109
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,480
What?

110
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,080
Psychological suggestion

111
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,640
is like when Curly hears the alarm

112
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,800
and knows it's time to deliver documents to Director Chang.

113
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,240
It's the same with Liang Ruqing.

114
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,720
When he heard the class bell, he jumped from the building.

115
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,780
The class bell was his mental anchor.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,520
Teacher Liang usually

117
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,600
arrives at the classroom early.

118
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
This time

119
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,480
doesn't seem any different.

120
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,860
What about other aspects?

121
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,680
Xu Yang.

122
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,600
Think carefully.

123
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,290
We suspect that Teacher Liang's death

124
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,160
is related to hypnosis.

125
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,330
Your seat is closest to the podium.

126
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,780
Did you notice anything unusual?

127
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,960
Hypnosis?

128
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes,

129
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,880
hypnosis.

130
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,140
Think carefully about

131
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,560
your teacher's condition at that time.

132
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,210
Before she entered the classroom,

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,640
did you see her?

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,320
The last time I saw her

135
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,460
was the day before she jumped.

136
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,850
She seemed completely normal.

137
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,330
She even reminded me

138
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
not to forget my makeup assignment.

139
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,040
Who knew that...

140
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,159
Teacher Liang rarely smiled,

141
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,520
but these past few days I keep dreaming of her smiling face

142
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,159
and her yellow hair tie stained with blood.

143
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,000
I wanted to save her,

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
but I couldn't...

145
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,920
You're just a child.

146
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,220
Don't blame yourself.

147
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,040
Keep calm.

148
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,640
Everything will be alright.

149
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,400
This child is still in a vulnerable period.

150
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,800
I'll contact the school later

151
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,560
and ask the counselor to pay more attention to her.

152
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,360
We don't have many leads for now.

153
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,880
I want to

154
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,840
start with the ringtone.

155
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,360
I'll undergo a targeted hypnosis session.

156
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,560
To see if there are

157
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,440
any other useful clues in my mind.

158
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,160
Okay.

159
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
Relax.

160
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,520
Stay calm.

161
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,160
Only this way,

162
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,320
your consciousness can fully immerse

163
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,160
into the space constructed by your brain's memories.

164
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,040
Focus your attention

165
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,880
completely on this voice.

166
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,520
Good.

167
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,360
Maintain this state.

168
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,280
When I say,

169
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,080
the sun has risen,

170
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,080
you will wake up.

171
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,560
Hello, sir.

172
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,760
Sir.

173
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,040
Sir.

174
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,880
Mr. Liang.

175
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,680
Mr. Liang.

176
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,680
Mr. Liang.

177
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,680
Mr. Liang.

178
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,980
Come down quickly!

179
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,720
Mr. Liang.

180
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,920
Mr. Liang.

181
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,120
Hello, sir.

182
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,240
Mr. Liang.

183
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,040
The sun has risen.

184
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,120
Let me out.

185
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,400
Accept your inner self.

186
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,120
You're a born criminal.

187
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,000
Go.

188
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,320
Fulfill your mission.

189
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,840
I'm not.

190
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,160
I'm not.

191
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,480
Chi Xia.

192
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,720
I'm not.

193
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,200
I'm not.

194
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,760
Chi Xia.

195
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,880
I'm not.

196
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,170
What happened to me?

197
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,720
You fell into a deep coma

198
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,380
during the hypnosis session.

199
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,560
We tried calling you

200
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,960
but you wouldn't wake up.

201
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,280
Fortunately you're awake now.

202
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
It's not serious.

203
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,960
I'm sorry

204
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,520
for making you worry.

205
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,880
I'm glad you're okay.

206
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,960
So...

207
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,600
Did you figure anything out?

208
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,520
So many things.

209
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,760
I can barely remember it all.

210
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,120
The bell.

211
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Hello, teacher.

212
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,560
The timing

213
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,410
must all be guided by Liang Ruqing's mental anchors.

214
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,860
But before that, there should be another one

215
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,640
that

216
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,640
is the real trigger that caused Liang Ruqing to stab himself.

217
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,900
But I couldn't find it.

218
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,680
It's okay.

219
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,480
You've already found many clues.

220
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,220
How about this?

221
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,940
Let's go back to the crime scene again

222
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,880
and see if there are any

223
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,840
clues we've missed.

224
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,170
We need to keep looking.

225
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
That's not right.

226
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,040
What detail am I still missing?

227
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,560
Did you remember something?

228
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,840
I remember now.

229
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,480
What is it?

230
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,800
Complicated family of origin,

231
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,880
tense marriage,

232
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,120
poor relationships with colleagues.

233
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,200
Students disliked her,

234
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,720
and no close friends.

235
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,530
Who would give her such an expensive gift?

236
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,160
'Admiring the virtue of a teacher's path,

237
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,360
grateful for kind words during hardship.'

238
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,760
'After much reflection,

239
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,160
I regret my past actions.

240
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,640
This humble gift expresses my gratitude,

241
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,180
wishing you well on your journey ahead.'

242
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,720
This handwriting.

243
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,440
Oh my!

244
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,320
That's a foul!

245
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,800
Wait,

246
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,160
Xu Yang never played like this before.

247
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,680
Exactly.

248
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,540
When did he become so aggressive?

249
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,680
Ever since he got that new jersey,

250
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,840
he's like a completely different person.

251
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,560
Yeah.

252
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,410
Captain Luo.

253
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,520
Your analysis is correct.

254
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,080
That pen is authentic.

255
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,280
It's a commemorative edition,

256
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,040
limited release,

257
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,359
and quite expensive.

258
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,920
Small stationery stores

259
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,050
don't even stock it.

260
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,359
I just checked with

261
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,200
the brand supplier of this pen.

262
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,560
According to them,

263
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,520
in the entire Dongzhou City,

264
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,280
only the stationery store

265
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,839
at Dongzhou Garden Plaza sells it.

266
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,640
Wait.

267
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,680
What's wrong?

268
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,810
Is something wrong?

269
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
I'm thinking about something else.

270
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,160
What is it?

271
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,440
Given Xu Yang's financial situation,

272
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,400
such an expensive pen

273
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,120
is not something he could afford.

274
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,040
So behind this,

275
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,440
there must be clues we haven't discovered yet.

276
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,360
Let's not overthink it.

277
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,020
Let's follow this lead first.

278
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,720
Okay.

279
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,000
Xu Xiaodao can't escape the charges of running an illegal gambling den.

280
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,600
Nobody move!

281
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,130
Get down!

282
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,240
Stay where you are!

283
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,960
She always wears a mask in public.

284
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,840
Almost no one has seen her face.
