1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya.

2
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,560
I'll burn these for you.

3
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,640
All of it for you.

4
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,620
Don't blame me.

5
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,560
Ghost!

6
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,400
Ruqing, don't come after me.

7
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,480
Ruqing, stay away from me.

8
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,340
Leave me alone.

9
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,800
So at the scene,

10
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,660
did you notice anything unusual?

11
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,520
Look at this.

12
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,180
Is this the Captain Luo I know?

13
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,880
It's just like being back in school.

14
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,480
Alright, stop joking around.

15
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm not used to it myself.

16
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,730
It feels a bit cold when the wind blows.

17
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,840
Looking good?

18
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,240
Quite youthful.

19
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,840
Energetic and very handsome.

20
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,400
Right?

21
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,120
Chi Xia.

22
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,400
Enough with the flattery.

23
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,079
Here's the plan.

24
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,600
We'll split into two teams today.

25
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,240
Jue.

26
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,440
Take Cao Bin and Curly with you.

27
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,760
Go to Sun Xiangbo's company.

28
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,560
See if he's been in contact with anyone suspicious lately.

29
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,240
Chi Xia.

30
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,480
You'll come with me to Liang Ruqing's place.

31
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,280
Let's go.

32
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,960
Okay.

33
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,320
Everyone's here.

34
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Take a look.

35
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,560
How was Liang Ruqing's physical condition usually?

36
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,520
Did she ever mention to you

37
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,050
any psychological issues?

38
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,780
Ruqing was under too much mental stress.

39
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,760
She was afraid of dragging me down.

40
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,220
She even wanted a divorce.

41
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,840
But I never agreed to it.

42
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,040
Divorce?

43
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,680
That shows there were real problems in your relationship.

44
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,600
Of course not.

45
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,200
Our relationship has always been stable.

46
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,960
Please don't listen to those baseless rumors out there.

47
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,520
Ruqing wanting a divorce

48
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,010
is entirely because of her family.

49
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,600
Ruqing has a brother

50
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,040
who's always asking her for money.

51
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,560
If she doesn't give him any,

52
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,240
he comes over and makes trouble.

53
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,400
Ruqing feels inferior

54
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,320
because she doesn't earn as much as I do.

55
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,160
She doesn't want to use money from my company

56
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,020
to support her parasitic family.

57
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,250
I've always told her

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,600
that no matter what happens,

59
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,960
whatever difficulties we face,

60
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,320
I will always be by her side

61
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,720
and never give up on her.

62
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,080
But she...

63
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,360
Why would she be so desperate

64
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,250
that she'd try to kill herself?

65
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,680
Sun Xiangbo plays this tragic role quite well.

66
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
But the problem is

67
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,000
his house is too clean.

68
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,760
It's so clean as if he knew

69
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,960
we were coming and tidied up specially.

70
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,400
This packaging was just opened,

71
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,400
it's not expired,

72
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,330
yet thrown away.

73
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
This box of melatonin capsules too.

74
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,640
These should all be Liang Ruqing's things.

75
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,000
Look at this travel plan

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,400
and taking supplements.

77
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,440
Living with such a positive attitude,

78
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,770
doesn't seem like someone who would commit suicide, right?

79
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
Nice shot!

80
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,880
Xu Yang.

81
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,680
Wait for me!

82
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,130
Let's continue.

83
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,320
Ms. Liang was indeed tutoring me before.

84
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,080
At first, we had lessons at her home.

85
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,520
Later, because her husband kept arguing with her,

86
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,240
she was afraid it would affect my tutoring,

87
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,440
so we moved to my home.

88
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Do you remember

89
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,760
why she argued with her husband?

90
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,400
Ms. Liang is a strong-willed person,

91
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,840
and she cares a lot about her reputation.

92
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,360
Whenever they had an argument,

93
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,960
she would send me away first.

94
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,360
In your impression,

95
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
what kind of person was her husband?

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,260
I don't remember much.

97
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,660
Xu Yang!

98
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,920
Time for basketball.

99
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,600
They're calling me to play basketball.

100
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,400
I've got to go.

101
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,600
Number 13,

102
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,360
Wang Yu.

103
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,120
Come on, how's it going?

104
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,370
Everything's fine.

105
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,640
Number 14, Nie Qianyu.

106
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,000
Here.

107
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,000
Xu Yang.

108
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,520
Just say whatever comes to mind.

109
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,720
Don't you want us to solve this case quickly

110
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,600
and get justice for your teacher Liang?

111
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,760
I really don't know

112
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,300
what happened.

113
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,440
Come here.

114
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
I know you're concerned about your teacher's reputation.

115
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,360
But if we don't uncover the truth,

116
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,680
more and more people will misunderstand her.

117
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,000
Only by catching the killer quickly

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,640
can we stop the rumors from slandering her.

119
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,700
Do you understand?

120
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,200
Last time I went to Mrs. Liang's house for tutoring.

121
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,260
I happened to see her husband storming out of the house.

122
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,400
Mrs. Liang shouted from inside.

123
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,360
Get as far away as possible!

124
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,760
I hope you and that homewrecker rot in hell!

125
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,400
Curly.

126
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,440
In Liang Ruqing and Sun Xiangbo's relationship,

127
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,280
there's a third person involved.

128
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,640
Find out who this person is quickly.

129
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,600
Sun Xiangbo is highly suspicious right now.

130
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,360
What a coincidence, Captain Luo,

131
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,890
I just found something too.

132
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,600
Sun Xiangbo's affair partner is named Nie Qianyu.

133
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,640
She's currently living in a villa purchased by Sun Xiangbo,

134
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,800
Building B of Lijiang Garden.

135
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,440
Good.

136
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,960
Keep your voice down.

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,760
This is a school.

138
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,290
Why are you shouting about affairs so loudly?

139
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,640
Didn't you say it would be soon?

140
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,040
Didn't you say nothing would go wrong?

141
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,370
What's really going on?

142
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,160
It is coming soon.

143
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,240
I didn't lie to you.

144
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,040
The problem is everything happened too suddenly.

145
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,280
I don't know either.

146
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,400
She got upset at this critical moment.

147
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,320
So is she

148
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,240
alright?

149
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,520
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,770
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

151
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,440
What exactly does she know?

152
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,540
It doesn't matter what she knows.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,920
What matters is

154
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,160
if the police find out.

155
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm finished.

156
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,200
Who is it?

157
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,360
Police.

158
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,280
Is this Nie Qianyu's residence?

159
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,480
Coming!

160
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,600
Please, make yourselves comfortable.

161
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,100
You know Liang Ruqing, right?

162
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,880
Yes, I do.

163
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,050
Did you know she jumped off a building?

164
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,480
I do know about Liang Ruqing's suicide.

165
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,780
But I also find it horrifying.

166
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,800
I have nothing to do with it.

167
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,500
What's your relationship with Sun Xiangbo?

168
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
I admit it.

169
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,810
Xiangbo and I are together.

170
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,760
But Liang Ruqing wasn't just domineering.

171
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,600
Her entire family was greedy.

172
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,920
She failed at work.

173
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,200
And failed even more at family life.

174
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,330
She brought everything upon herself.

175
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
We didn't force her to do anything.

176
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,360
How can you blame us for this?

177
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,240
Don't get upset.

178
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,440
It's bad for the baby.

179
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,930
Have you and Sun Xiangbo ever tried psychological counseling?

180
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,720
Psychological counseling?

181
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,920
What do you mean?

182
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,720
Hypnosis.

183
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,340
Sleep therapy.

184
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,530
Or psychological suggestion, things like that.

185
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,840
Have you ever experienced any of these?

186
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,640
Xiangbo often accompanies me to the OB-GYN.

187
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,610
But psychiatry?

188
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,000
Who would see a psychiatrist for no reason?

189
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,600
Captain Luo.

190
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,080
Sun Lin is at the station.

191
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,320
She seems quite agitated.

192
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,580
Come back for a moment.

193
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,120
Um.

194
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,480
Thank you for your cooperation.

195
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,720
If we need anything else,

196
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
we'll contact you again.

197
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,680
Let me see you out.

198
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,440
No need.

199
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Please stay here.

200
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,200
Every question you just answered

201
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,400
was with hesitation.

202
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,520
No wonder the police are suspicious of me now.

203
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,120
What's this about psychological counseling?

204
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,580
Why would the police ask about these things?

205
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
That therapist you told me to see last time,

206
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,960
is it related to this too?

207
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,920
Say something!

208
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,080
What's going on?

209
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,440
Whatever is going on!

210
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,960
Damn it! They just can't stand seeing me happy.

211
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,010
She deserved to die.

212
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,120
Stop crying.

213
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,580
Drink some warm water.

214
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,520
Why do you believe

215
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,760
that your father definitely killed your mother?

216
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,320
Because my mom always knew

217
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,180
my dad wouldn't agree to divorce.

218
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,040
It was all to secretly transfer assets.

219
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,200
So she had been

220
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,420
collecting evidence of my father's money laundering.

221
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,240
My father

222
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,250
was afraid of being ruined.

223
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,240
He tried to destroy the evidence

224
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,970
and that's why he killed my mom.

225
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,540
But he doesn't know

226
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,080
that all the evidence

227
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,000
is in my hands.

228
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,280
Sun Xiangbo owns three companies in total.

229
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,400
A year ago,

230
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,440
Sun Xiangbo transferred

231
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,000
Hongtai Biological Company, which he often used for bridge financing,

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,320
to Nie Qianyu.

233
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,800
This proves

234
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,100
what Sun Lin said about

235
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,040
Sun Xiangbo -

236
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,900
that he was transferring assets.

237
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,520
However,

238
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,520
the evidence Sun Lin provided

239
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,720
isn't enough to prove

240
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,120
Sun Xiangbo's money laundering activities.

241
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,920
So we

242
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,610
need to further investigate his money trail.

243
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,840
This Sun Xiangbo

244
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
is far from being a perfect husband.

245
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,920
But Liang Ruqing

246
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,760
has been holding in all her grievances

247
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
without defending herself.

248
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,700
She's the one who deserves our sympathy.

249
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,120
When we were at Nie Qianyu's place

250
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,800
and mentioned hypnosis,

251
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,970
her expression showed obvious panic.

252
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,660
Additionally,

253
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,040
Liang Ruqing had been

254
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,720
collecting evidence of Sun Xiangbo's crimes for a long time.

255
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,320
Now we have reason to suspect

256
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,800
that Sun Xiangbo, in order to destroy evidence,

257
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,120
subjected Liang Ruqing to long-term hypnosis

258
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,720
to guide her toward suicide.

259
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,200
Alright.

260
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,320
Tomorrow experts from the provincial department will come to assist our investigation.

261
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,760
Let's all go get some rest.

262
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,520
Tomorrow,

263
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,560
we'll take a two-pronged approach.

264
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,360
On one hand,

265
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,200
we'll investigate Sun Xiangbo's financial issues.

266
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
On the other hand,

267
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,600
we'll start with the hypnosis angle.

268
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,400
Let's go.

269
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,040
Okay.

270
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,220
Goodbye, Captain Luo.

271
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,280
Goodbye, Captain.

272
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,800
See you, Captain Luo.

273
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,520
Chi Xia,

274
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,610
bye-bye.

275
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,960
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

276
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,440
Do you want me to take you home?

277
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
No need, Captain.

278
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,120
Sun Xiangbo transferred Hongtai Biotech to Nie Qianyu,

279
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,000
although it happened a year ago.

280
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,960
But since Sun Lin's evidence is insufficient,

281
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,360
I want to check earlier transaction records.

282
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,680
Everyone will investigate together tomorrow.

283
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,640
There's no rush.

284
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,720
You need to hang in there.

285
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,640
I'm not going to try to stop you,

286
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,900
but get some rest soon.

291

292

Miss Chi is here.

293
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,280
Wait for me in the lounge.

294
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,720
Okay.

295
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,780
Coming right away.

296
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,360
You're so good at fighting.

297
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,160
You were going easy on me before.

298
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,560
I just knew

299
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,000
that day was about you letting off steam.

300
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,960
Go ahead.

301
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,610
What do you need from me?

302
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,970
Do you know Sun Xiangbo?

303
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,320
Sun Xiangbo...

304
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,050
Doesn't ring a bell.

305
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
Let me introduce myself properly.

306
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,440
I'm Chi Xia from the Major Crimes Unit of Dongzhou City Police Department.

307
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
I'm here today

308
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,800
to ask for your help as a friend, not officially.

309
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,010
Our friendship was forged in the boxing ring.

310
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
Since you consider me a friend,

311
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,520
I won't treat you like a stranger either.

312
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,320
Tell me,

313
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,120
how can I help?

314
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,080
I'll do my best.

315
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,960
Sun Xiangbo's company, Boxin Technology,

316
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,320
in their financial records,

317
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,600
I saw your name.

318
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,320
So I wanted to ask about the details of your transactions

319
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,040
and

320
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
other things.

321
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,800
Sun Xiangbo,

322
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,640
I remember now.

323
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
A few years ago,

324
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,480
he asked through a friend

325
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,640
to borrow 500,000 from my lending company,

326
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,119
and then borrowed several more times after that.

327
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,920
What's wrong?

328
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,359
Did you run into some issues with your investigation?

329
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,119
Some issues,

330
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,040
but due to confidentiality,

331
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,640
I can't discuss the details.

332
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,880
When I was running my lending company,

333
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,010
I examined many companies' finances.

334
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,700
Not just ordinary people,

335
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,080
even the police

336
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,200
would find it difficult to spot issues.

337
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,800
If you trust me,

338
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,320
you could use numbers

339
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,200
to replace the counterparty information in the financial records,

340
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,400
and let me take a look.

341
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
If we're under hypnosis,

342
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,800
is it possible to find some clues?

343
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
You're saying Chi Xia's case is related to hypnosis?

344
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,840
