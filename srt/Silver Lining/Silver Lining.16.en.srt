1
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya

2
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,480
Zheng Lanshu is under house arrest now

3
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,810
and her condition seems to have worsened.

4
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,440
She doesn't remember anything now.

5
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,400
I doubt we can get a confession.

6
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,000
Let me try.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,800
Mrs. Zheng.

8
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,640
Mom.

9
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,320
Young officer,

10
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,760
did I kill someone?

11
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,160
You...

12
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Remember now?

13
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,160
I'm getting old

14
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,740
and have no strength left.

15
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,360
I wanted to avenge my daughter

16
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,920
so I needed someone to help.

17
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,680
Come.

18
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,050
Let's sit here and talk.

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,960
What do you

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,800
remember?

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,880
I remember things

22
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,040
occasionally.

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,280
I can only remember a few hours.

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,009
When I woke up this morning,

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,680
I saw someone watching over me.

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,930
Then I understood everything.

27
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,880
Pan told me.

28
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,680
Xixi was murdered by Pei Xinlu.

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,600
Xiaorou was also killed by her lover.

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,920
Xixi was stabbed to death with a steel rod.

31
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,760
Xiaorou was beaten to death.

32
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,720
Those animals!

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,360
I don't know why Pan wanted to help me.

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,440
But I'm grateful to her.

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,720
Without her,

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,280
I would have no way

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,520
to get justice for my children.

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Her father

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,640
died of illness before she was born.

40
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,200
I carried her for ten months

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,360
and raised her all by myself. She was my precious baby.

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,560
How dare Pei Xinlu!

43
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,640
How dare he!

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,360
I killed Pei Xinlu.

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,680
I killed Yu Jia too.

46
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,160
I avenged Xixi and Xiaorou.

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,320
Child.

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,560
You must have a mother.

49
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,600
You must understand

50
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,079
why I did this.

51
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,400
Why are you crying?

52
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,079
Let mommy wipe your tears.

53
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,020
I'm talking to you.

54
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,560
Cute little fox.

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,800
Little fox.

56
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
Have you ever thought about leaving this place?

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Leave?

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,360
Yes.

59
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,160
Go to a place where sunlight can reach.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Ade.

61
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,720
Give Chi Xiao a message.

62
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,920
Tell her

63
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
I won't interfere with her mission.

64
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,120
But I absolutely will not allow

65
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,720
her to do anything that harms Chi Xia.

66
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,000
Understood.

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,160
Hello.

68
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,220
Package delivery.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,640
Hello.

70
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,770
Package for Luo Xun.

71
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,320
Thank you.

72
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,250
You're welcome.

73
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,160
Occupation:

74
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,960
Tu Guo'an.

75
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,560
Save me.

76
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,840
Save me.

77
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,320
Little fox.

78
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,040
You must survive.

79
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,920
Hurry up.

80
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,600
Chi Xia.

81
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
Wake up.

82
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,200
Chi Xia.

83
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,810
You had a nightmare.

84
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,640
Get up now.

85
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,600
Yu Jia is awake.

86
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,560
I'll wait for you downstairs.

87
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,690
Get yourself ready.

88
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,890
Are you still not feeling well?

89
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,120
Do you want to sleep a bit more?

90
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,840
No.

91
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,880
How did you know my front door password?

92
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,320
Last time I

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,240
accidentally saw your

94
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,680
phone unlock password.

95
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,820
I called you this morning but you didn't answer,

96
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,799
so I came to your place to find you.

97
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,760
I nearly broke your door knocking,

98
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,020
but you didn't open it.

99
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,240
Then I thought,

100
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,480
what if you used the same password?

101
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
So I tried it.

102
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,159
And it worked.

103
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,240
You're so clever.

104
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,800
What are you thinking about?

105
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,120
Are you worried that Yu Jia won't confess?

106
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,400
Right now we can only connect

107
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,080
the known clues together.

108
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,770
We can't yet confirm that Yu Jia is the killer.

109
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,040
But we can't let her know

110
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,000
that we don't know.

111
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,660
Otherwise she'll definitely deny everything.

112
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,160
Why don't you just say it directly?

113
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,620
Isn't this direct enough?

114
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,520
It means she's a patient now.

115
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,000
She's experienced tension,

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,680
fear, and physical suffering.

117
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,800
If we put some

118
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,960
psychological pressure on her...

119
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,940
Chi Xia, I've noticed you're becoming more and more...

120
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,040
Officer,

121
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
please help me.

122
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,560
Now that you're awake, please tell us

123
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,220
how you murdered Zhou Wanrou.

124
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,880
My head hurts so much right now.

125
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Stop pretending.

126
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,560
All your vital signs are normal now.

127
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,280
They gave up on you.

128
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,800
But the doctors didn't.

129
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,040
So I suggest you think carefully.

130
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
If you continue to deny everything,

131
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,840
in the end, the only one facing legal punishment

132
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,920
will be you alone.

133
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,880
I don't understand what you're talking about.

134
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,130
I don't understand.

135
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,290
Let me break it down for you.

136
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,520
Ten years ago,

137
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,450
you broke up with Pei Xinlu.

138
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,340
Then he immediately got married,

139
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,240
had a perfect family,

140
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,640
and a successful career.

141
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,040
So you were jealous.

142
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,940
You've hated him for 10 years.

143
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,760
You got angrier and angrier,

144
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,480
so you returned to Dongzhou.

145
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,040
You were determined to destroy their marriage.

146
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,280
You couldn't stand that they had a child together.

147
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,400
So you took advantage of Pei Xi

148
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,720
having autism.

149
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,780
You manipulated Pei Xinlu into killing his own son.

150
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,720
You even fantasized about rekindling your relationship with him.

151
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Then giving him a healthy child,

152
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,720
isn't that right?

153
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,560
No.

154
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,760
He doesn't deserve it.

155
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,240
Pei Xi died in an accident.

156
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,640
You think it's heaven's justice,

157
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,040
giving you what you wanted.

158
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,840
But you're still not satisfied.

159
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,040
You believe the root of your tragic life

160
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,160
is Zhou Wanrou.

161
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,360
Am I right?

162
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,640
I told you I don't understand.

163
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
If it weren't for her,

164
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,800
you could have stayed with Pei Xinlu,

165
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,560
and avoided these ten painful years.

166
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
So you interfered in someone else's marriage.

167
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,760
I didn't interfere.

168
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,240
Zhou Wanrou was the mistress.

169
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,160
So you killed her.

170
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,280
I didn't mean to kill her.

171
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,680
I only hurt her.

172
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,480
Back then, Pei Xinlu

173
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,010
wanted to expand the company's new business.

174
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,280
Behind your back,

175
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,610
he got together with Manager Zhou Wanrou.

176
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,120
You couldn't bear the betrayal.

177
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,560
That's why you hated her so much

178
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,480
that you wanted to get revenge on Zhou Wanrou.

179
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,520
That's not all.

180
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,760
Ten years ago.

181
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,280
He and Zhou Wanrou killed my child.

182
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,400
I can never be a mother again.

183
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,560
What else?

184
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,810
Just say it here.

185
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,050
When did you get together with her?

186
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,320
Say something.

187
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,970
Did you break up with me because of her?

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
Can she give you resources?

189
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,960
Things I couldn't give you.

190
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,920
Calm down.

191
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,040
Haven't I given you enough?

192
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,880
Just calm down.

193
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,560
Let me tell you.

194
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,800
She's gentler than you.

195
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,600
More sensible than you.

196
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,360
She's better than you in every way.

197
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,800
I can be gentle too.

198
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,200
I don't need that.

199
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,160
I can change.

200
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,200
I don't want you to change.

201
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,600
You irritate me now.

202
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,440
Please disappear from my sight.

203
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,160
Will you?

204
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,680
We're completely over.

205
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,160
I don't want to break up.

206
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,120
I won't break up.

207
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,040
Let go of me.

208
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,200
Let go.

209
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,240
Let me go.

210
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,480
I won't let go.

211
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,400
Let go!

212
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,880
What are you looking at?

213
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,810
Get back to work.

214
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,120
Show some self-respect.

215
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,600
Stop bothering me.

216
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,380
What you didn't expect was

217
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,420
they eventually got married.

218
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,600
And then

219
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,520
Peixi was born.

220
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,560
So you manipulated Pei Xinlu into killing Peixi.

221
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,640
You wanted to take revenge on Zhou Wanrou,

222
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,120
to make her feel the pain of losing a child.

223
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,360
I'm right, aren't I?

224
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,640
That's right.

225
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,480
I witnessed Pei Xi's accidental fall.

226
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,280
Don't kill me.

227
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,520
Dad.

228
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,320
Xixi.

229
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,280
But I still told Zhou Wanrou

230
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,280
that I ordered Pei Xinlu to push her son down.

231
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,960
Because only this way,

232
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,560
could she truly understand

233
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,240
the pain of losing a child.

234
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Only then could she feel what I felt.

235
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,260
Not enough, right?

236
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,610
Just Pei Xi alone isn't enough.

237
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,240
The person you truly resent is Zhou Wanrou.

238
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,440
If you don't kill her,

239
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,850
you definitely won't stop.

240
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Killing Pei Xi

241
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,960
has made you addicted to murder, hasn't it?

242
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,560
Then you quickly killed Zhou Wanrou.

243
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,600
She came looking for me herself.

244
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,000
What do you mean by that text message you sent me?

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,530
What do you mean Pei Xi was killed by Pei Xinlu?

246
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,280
What?

247
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,520
You don't believe me?

248
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,680
Then let me tell you something else.

249
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,920
I told Pei Xinlu to push Pei Xi down.

250
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,360
I saw him push Pei Xi with my own eyes.

251
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,760
I watched your son get impaled by steel bars.

252
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,560
Impossible.

253
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,920
Pei Xi was Pei Xinlu's biological son.

254
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,680
How could he possibly kill his own son?

255
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,360
He always listens to me.

256
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,620
The way he betrayed me to please you back then

257
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,800
is exactly how he's come back to me now.

258
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,680
If you hadn't taken advantage of the situation,

259
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,400
I wouldn't have lost my child.

260
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,640
So Pei Xi is here to pay with his life.

261
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,040
That's nonsense.

262
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,960
When I got together with Pei Xinlu,

263
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,360
I had no idea you two were already together.

264
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,850
What did Pei Xi do wrong?

265
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,680
He was such an innocent, pure child.

266
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,120
I wished I could

267
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,160
stay by his side 24 hours a day.

268
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,200
I was just hoping he would gradually recover

269
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,730
to be like normal children.

270
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,660
I was careless just that one time,

271
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,440
just once,

272
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,240
and you got him killed.

273
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
So you're free now.

274
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,600
You should be thanking me.

275
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,600
That stupid son of yours,

276
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,640
what's the point of keeping him anyway?

277
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,680
Shut up!

278
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,530
I want you to pay with your life.

279
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,620
Zhou Wanrou was very emotional at that time.

280
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,680
I was afraid she would lose control and hurt me.

281
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,560
I was filled with hatred at that moment,

282
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,000
so I beat her up.

283
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,280
But I panicked afterwards,

284
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,120
so I called Fox.

285
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,600
Her subordinate killed the person.

286
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,200
Not me.

287
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,880
Fox?

288
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,480
Which fox?

289
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,920
The codename is Fox,

290
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,240
the animal fox.

291
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,860
Finally getting to the point.

292
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,520
Tell me about it.

293
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,600
How did you meet?

294
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
A year ago.

295
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,560
I met Fox on a forum

296
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,640
where people share emotional experiences.

297
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,240
We talked a lot.

298
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,160
She made me feel

299
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,880
a strong sense of trust.

300
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,000
So I told her

301
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,120
my story in detail.

302
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,020
She said she could help me.

303
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,080
She could make Pei Xinlu

304
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,000
willingly kill Pei Xi.

305
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,680
She also said

306
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,940
she could help me get revenge on Zhou Wanrou.

307
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,000
The condition is

308
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,130
to hand over Zhou Wanrou and Pei Xi to her after it's done.

309
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,700
As for what she plans to do,

310
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,060
she didn't say,

311
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,410
and I didn't ask.

312
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,200
You're willing to trust that fox,

313
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,120
who supposedly has the ability to make Pei Xinlu

314
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,920
willingly help you get revenge.

315
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,480
It's not just because of his guilt

316
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,940
for abandoning and betraying you back then.

317
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,200
Six months ago,

318
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,040
his company faced a financial crisis.

319
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,400
You happened to return to the country

320
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,760
and helped him resolve those financial difficulties.

321
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,920
So naturally,

322
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,520
you came back into his sight.

323
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,560
Because he needed your help.

324
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,280
So you shamelessly took control over him.

325
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,240
If I'm not mistaken,

326
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,780
Pei Xinlu's company's financial crisis

327
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,200
was also orchestrated by this fox you mentioned, right?

328
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,079
No matter how capable she is,

329
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,119
she'll still treat you as a disposable pawn.

330
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,050
Even when you ran to Longyun Manor,

331
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,810
she still didn't let you go.

332
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,839
Tell me,

333
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,740
how did she find you there?

334
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,680
A week ago.

335
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,620
Pei Xinlu suddenly disappeared.

336
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,800
I was afraid he was taken away for questioning

337
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,680
because of Zhou Wanrou's death case.

338
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,280
So I changed my phone number.

339
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,000
But I was still worried.

340
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,120
Longyun Villa

341
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
doesn't require real-name registration.

342
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,520
So I hid there.

343
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,410
I hesitated for a whole day.

344
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,530
I just sent the location to Fox.

345
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,810
Who knew I'd almost get myself killed.

346
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,540
Where is Zheng Lanshu?

347
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,120
Who took her there?

348
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Is it this person?

349
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,520
It's her.

350
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,290
She's also the one who killed Zhou Wanrou.

351
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,520
I can't believe you've already found her.

352
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,360
But you'll never find Fox.

353
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,370
What do you mean?

354
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,520
Are you saying

355
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,250
this person is a scapegoat Fox prepared long ago?

356
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,900
I should have realized it sooner.

357
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,280
At first, for some unknown reason,

358
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,000
Fox approached me.

359
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,170
Said she could help me get revenge.

360
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,880
The exchange was that

361
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,640
I had to hand Pei Xi over to her.

362
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,680
But you didn't follow through,

363
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,200
so she abandoned you.

364
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,000
In the end, Zhou Wanrou died.

365
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,000
Zhou Wanrou's death

366
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,880
served the same purpose as Pei Xi would have.

367
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
Eventually she changed partners

368
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,800
to Zheng Lanshu.

369
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,560
She promised to help Zheng Lanshu get revenge

370
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,920
using the same method.

371
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,320
She killed the person responsible for

372
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,200
Pei Xi and Zhou Wanrou's deaths - Pei Xinlu.

373
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,040
And me too.

374
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,840
Finally, she planned to frame me

375
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,300
for Zhou Wanrou's murder.

376
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,780
A perfect crime with no witness left.

377
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,360
The number twenty-five

378
