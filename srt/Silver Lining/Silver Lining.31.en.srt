1
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yunya.

2
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,000
Mr. Tu.

3
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,460
Captain Luo, Officer Chi.

4
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,560
He's willing to talk now.

5
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,040
I'll tell you everything.

6
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,840
Go ahead.

7
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,880
Actually,

8
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,320
I'm not Tu Guolin.

9
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,880
I'm Tu Guo'an.

10
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,960
And then?

11
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,200
Then,

12
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,320
what happened to your foster parents wasn't my doing.

13
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,480
It was my brother.

14
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,280
Back then,

15
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,800
I was down on my luck.

16
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,440
To make a living,

17
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,120
I worked as a thug for Fox.

18
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
But one day she came to me

19
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,320
asking me to kill someone

20
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,160
and make it look like an accident.

21
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,079
I was fine being her muscle,

22
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,760
scaring people a bit.

23
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,890
That was no problem.

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,720
But murder? I wouldn't dare.

25
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,760
So I got scared

26
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,040
and went into hiding.

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,360
You're saying

28
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,380
Tu Guolin killed them instead of you?

29
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,540
A big businessman,

30
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,920
a well-known entrepreneur in Dongzhou,

31
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,240
was willing to kill for you?

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,360
From what I know,

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,440
after your parents divorced,

34
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,970
weren't you two estranged?

35
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,200
Not being close

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,920
doesn't mean no contact at all.

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Just a few days after I went into hiding,

38
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,000
he found me.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,260
He said he killed someone in a fit of rage.

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,040
It was

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,900
that family massacre on Pingjiang Road.

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,680
My brother

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,800
has had violent tendencies since childhood.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,280
After our parents divorced, no one controlled him,

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,600
no one could keep his temper in check.

46
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,520
Later he would beat and verbally abuse his employees.

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,320
And also,

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,040
we both really love cats.

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,440
But his love for cats

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,160
was almost pathological.

51
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,360
That day, he happened to see the Zhou family killing a cat,

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,620
and in a moment of rage,

53
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
he killed the entire family.

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,320
So from that point on, you two switched identities?

55
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,120
Yes.

56
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,400
Then he asked me

57
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,200
to help take care of his wife and child.

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,120
To protect them from being implicated,

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,320
he even got divorced.

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,400
Later, following Fox's instructions,

61
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
he went after your foster parents.

62
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,720
Then he used

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,480
the method of leaving a kettle boiling dry

64
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,079
to cause an accidental fire.

65
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,400
This kind of thing

66
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,800
is untraceable.

67
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,690
That's why the police officers handling the case didn't detect it.

68
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,440
I recorded it at the time.

69
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,460
I have a recording.

70
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,380
Why are you coming so late?

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,840
I have a job for you.

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,400
608 Pingjiang Road.

73
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,120
Find an opportunity to get close to that place.

74
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,250
Should I get some guys to rough them up?

75
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,399
There's a couple living there.

76
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,200
I want you to find a way to create an accident.

77
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,090
You understand what I mean?

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,880
An accident?

79
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,840
You want to get rid of them?

80
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,170
The meaning of accident

81
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,160
is accidental death.

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,400
Alright.

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,600
Wait for my news.

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,360
Okay.

85
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,080
Later, I became suspicious.

86
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,600
I had someone

87
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,880
check on that Liu guy who contacted Wang Sheng.

88
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
What did you find?

89
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,800
Found out he's not even surnamed Liu.

90
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
His surname is Mo.

91
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,280
His name is Mo Laoqi.

92
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,760
He seems to be

93
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,560
a senior executive at Shengtian Group.

94
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,960
He has a special relationship with the Fox.

95
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,120
Otherwise,

96
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,780
how could the Fox possibly know my whereabouts?

97
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,100
I even have his photo here.

98
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,640
Hurry up.

99
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,880
Don't worry, can't find it?

100
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,920
It's here.

101
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,340
We've met this person before.

102
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,220
What else do you need to confess to me?

103
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,940
Tu Guolin is awake.

104
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,340
Chi Xia and Luo Xun went to see him.

105
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,360
I don't know if the information revealed

106
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,000
will be disadvantageous to Chi Xiao.

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,460
Do we need to do something?

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,400
Actually, that person is called Tu Guo'an.

109
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,760
Back then,

110
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,220
his brother Tu Guolin was the killer.

111
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,240
He's a witness.

112
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,280
Once they have evidence,

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
will the Fox...

114
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,240
You know which side you're on now.

115
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,320
That's good.

116
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,040
Don't worry.

117
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,840
I can't have a criminal record in this country.

118
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,840
So someone has to

119
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,520
take the blame.

120
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,320
I understand.

121
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,160
According to the evidence provided by Tu Guo'an,

122
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,020
it can be confirmed

123
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,880
that Chi Xiao is the mastermind

124
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
behind the murder of the Lin couple.

125
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,640
Meanwhile,

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,800
she is also connected to several previous murder cases.

127
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,880
Her actions are extremely vicious,

128
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,560
and she must be apprehended as soon as possible.

129
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,920
Yes.

130
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,520
Although currently

131
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
we haven't located Chi Xiao's whereabouts,

132
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
we have found a new lead.

133
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,330
Everyone, look.

134
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,720
According to Tu Guo'an,

135
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,120
it was because of this Mo Laoqi's appearance

136
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,360
that Chi Xiao realized her true identity.

137
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,440
He suspects that Mo Laoqi

138
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,880
has a complicated relationship with Chi Xiao.

139
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,240
We have reasonable suspicion

140
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
that this Mo Laoqi

141
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,440
is very likely a member of the Old K criminal organization.

142
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,170
And judging from his physique,

143
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,280
Mo Laoqi shows signs of middle-age weight gain.

144
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,480
He's probably the one

145
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,560
who kidnapped Lu Ningzhi

146
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,640
and sent threatening videos to the police.

147
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,400
Chief Chang,

148
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,370
I think it's time we bring him in for questioning.

149
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,770
That could work.

150
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
It's a direction.

151
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,560
Excuse me.

152
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Mr. Mo isn't here.

153
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,040
You can't go in.

154
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,040
Everyone,

155
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,840
this is...

156
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,170
You're Mo Laoqi, right?

157
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,360
You're a suspect in a kidnapping case.

158
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,280
Come with us.

159
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,520
Kidnapping?

160
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,280
There must be some mistake.

161
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,680
Factory building No. 14.

162
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,480
You think covering your face

163
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,940
And disguising your voice

164
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,400
Would stop us from catching you?

165
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,280
The problem is your escape technique is terrible,

166
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Full of holes.

167
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Isn't that right?

168
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,760
Liu.

169
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,480
No, no.

170
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,880
This must be a misunderstanding.

171
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,960
You've got the wrong person.

172
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,159
It's a misunderstanding.

173
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,360
We'll talk back at the station.

174
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,220
Take them away.

175
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,620
What are you doing?

176
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,280
No!

177
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,700
What are you doing?

178
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,240
Mr. Yang.

179
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,170
Hello everyone.

180
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,900
I'm Yang Zhiming, Chairman of Shengtian Group.

181
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,440
Your employee is involved in a kidnapping case.

182
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,100
Would you mind coming with me?

183
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
Of course not.

184
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,440
Cooperation between police and citizens is necessary.

185
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,880
The entire Shengtian Group

186
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,540
will cooperate with the police investigation.

187
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,250
You talk, I talk.

188
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,120
Why don't I give you a chance

189
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,520
to confess voluntarily?

190
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,080
Confess what?

191
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
I've already told you

192
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,340
it's a misunderstanding.

193
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,840
Where were you on February 20th?

194
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,360
Probably at the company,

195
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,520
I don't remember.

196
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
That's not right.

197
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,040
We checked the surveillance footage at Shengtian Group.

198
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,570
You weren't there that day.

199
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,080
Then I must have been out for business meetings.

200
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,520
Who would specifically remember that?

201
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,120
You're being stubborn, aren't you?

202
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
Your secretary told us.

203
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
That day you specifically instructed her to stay at the office.

204
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,600
You said you had personal matters.

205
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,120
You told her not to follow you.

206
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
What personal matters did you have?

207
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,440
Let me remind you

208
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,200
about that taunting video you sent to the police.

209
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,930
We've done further technical restoration on it.

210
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,400
My colleague just informed me

211
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,800
that the restoration results are ready.

212
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,440
Should I go get it now

213
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
and play it for you?

214
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,480
Let you hear your own voice?

215
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,040
Or will you confess now?

216
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,480
Do you know Chi Xiao?

217
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,320
Answer me.

218
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,730
I don't know him.

219
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,920
Tu Guolin, as Chi Xiao's pawn,

220
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,680
after losing his usefulness,

221
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,610
was hunted down and nearly killed.

222
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,200
Now that we've caught you,

223
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,080
to your superiors,

224
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,960
you've also lost your value.

225
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,400
From what I know about Mr. K,

226
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,250
do you think his methods

227
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,480
would be more merciful than Chi Xiao's?

228
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,640
And does Mr. K know

229
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,320
about your business dealings with Tu Guolin

230
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,580
using a fake identity?

231
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,320
New debts,

232
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,400
old debts,

233
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,810
how do you think he'll settle with you?

234
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
Yes.

235
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,480
The kidnapping

236
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,960
was my doing.

237
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,960
Here's your chance to redeem yourself.

238
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,120
Where is Chi Xiao?

239
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Can we find her?

240
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,640
I didn't know at first.

241
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,400
But just as you said,

242
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
after she lost her usefulness,

243
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,400
Mr. K abandoned her.

244
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,440
So she wanted to cooperate with me

245
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,120
and asked me to meet at her domestic base.

246
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,040
Of course I didn't agree.

247
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,560
I didn't dare to.

248
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,480
The factory incident

249
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,480
was also ordered by Mr. K.

250
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,720
He's our group's chairman,

251
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,840
Yang Zhiming.

252
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,000
I didn't dare to refuse.

253
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,360
You're saying Yang Zhiming is Mr. K?

254
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,160
That's right.

255
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,840
What evidence do you have

256
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,240
that Mr. K ordered you to do this?

257
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,960
None.

258
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,880
Mr. K is the type of person

259
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,800
who seems to know everything.

260
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,680
I didn't dare keep any evidence.

261
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,080
Chi Xia's previous

262
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,490
recusal request

263
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,380
was rejected by the provincial department.

264
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,700
They really did reject it.

265
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,560
I know you want Chi Xia involved in this case.

266
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,160
The provincial department also stated that

267
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,080
Chi Xia is familiar with Old K's criminal organization

268
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,000
and its internal operations,

269
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
so to solve this case,

270
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
we also need Chi Xia's cooperation.

271
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,920
Look how happy you are.

272
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,720
But there's one condition:

273
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,920
all of Chi Xia's actions

274
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,360
must follow our commands.

275
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,120
Don't worry,

276
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,850
Chief Chang.

277
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,320
Currently, we have

278
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
two tasks ahead of us.

279
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,400
First,

280
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,200
arrest Chi Xiao.

281
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,840
Second,

282
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,240
investigate Shengtian Group.

283
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,040
Cao Bin.

284
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,040
You've encountered Fox before.

285
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,920
Based on the address Mo Laoqi provided,

286
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,680
keep a close eye on her

287
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,040
and make sure to track her location at all times,

288
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,640
so that when we take action,

289
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,320
we don't tip her off and end up empty-handed.

290
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,960
Got it.

291
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,760
Jue.

292
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,120
You and Juanmao go investigate

293
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,200
Shengtian Group's recent business operations.

294
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,000
Tax records

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,720
and recent business partners.

296
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,400
Try to find evidence of criminal activity

297
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,360
to verify what Mo Laoqi said.

298
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,640
Also,

299
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,920
take a close look at

300
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,780
this new fake Old K who's shown up.

301
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,760
I'll ask colleagues from Economic Crime Unit

302
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,840
to assist with your investigation.

303
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,560
Okay.

304
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Captain Luo,

305
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,960
maybe I should go with Jue to investigate Shengtian Group instead.

306
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,280
To avoid any bias,

307
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,040
I won't be at the arrest scene.

308
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,240
Fine, no problem.

309
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,200
Share your impression of Chi Xiao's personality

310
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,080
and behavioral patterns

311
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,280
with everyone

312
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,540
to help them track him.

313
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,440
Bin,

314
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,200
we've been watching for two days now.

315
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,280
Don't even talk about seeing a fox.

316
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,540
I haven't even spotted a single fox hair.

317
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
She can't just not come back, right?

318
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,080
Stop talking nonsense.

319
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,880
Just keep watching as I told you.

320
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,160
Bin.

321
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,440
The fox has shown up.

322
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,880
That's her.

323
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,650
Captain Luo.

324
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,680
She's back.

325
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,440
Good.

326
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,160
No problem.

327
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,800
Let's go.

328
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,080
Cao Bin has confirmed it.

329
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,240
Chi Xiao has been at her hideout recently

330
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,200
We can proceed with the arrest.

331
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,120
Notify all teams

332
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,800
to move in.

333
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,200
Captain Luo.

334
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,880
Chi Xiao must have realized she's being tracked.

335
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,040
She's driving away now.

336
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,100
I'm following her.

337
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,320
The license plate is Dong E C4757,

338
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,180
black vehicle.

339
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,200
We're now on Wuxing Road,

340
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,800
heading toward the suburbs.

341
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,960
Brother.

342
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,120
Go to Chi Xiao's place and intercept her,

343
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,450
so she can't draw us away

344
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,440
and double back after losing us.

345
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,600
Got it.

346
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,880
Dong E·C4757.

347
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,080
Captain Luo.

348
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,140
We lost the target.

349
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,490
You really are like a ghost that won't go away.

350
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,160
Then in your next life, try to be reborn

351
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,640
in a world without me.

352
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,610
And stop being someone else's shadow.

353
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,700
Looks like your memory has returned.

354
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,960
You killed my parents.

355
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,200
That's right.

356
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,370
I just wanted to see you suffer.

357
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,600
Since childhood, you've always been different,

358
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,040
pretending to be so righteous.

359
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,160
Why should someone like you

360
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,040
get special treatment from Qu Bai?

361
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,480
Why has Old K been searching for you for over a decade,

362
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,760
desperately trying to awaken your memories?

363
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,640
I'm clearly better than you.

364
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,040
Why do you get all their

365
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,700
expectations and attention?

366
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,960
You know what?

367
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,360
You look like a clown now.

368
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,800
You still don't understand.

369
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,400
What Old K really wants.

370
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,079
What you care about,

371
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,079
what you envy,

372
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,319
what you desire,

373
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,079
what you resent.

374
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,359
These are all things I don't care about.

375
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,920
Go to hell.

376
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,920
Chi Xia.

377
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,320
Do you know how helpless your parents were

378
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,640
when they died?

379
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,000
The fire slowly peeled away their skin,

380
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,240
no matter how loudly they screamed.

381
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
And you were far away in Qin City,

382
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,920
just a fresh graduate from the police academy,

383
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,320
unable to do anything.

384
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,560
How disappointed your parents must be

385
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,240
in their only daughter.

386
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,520
Chi Xia.

387
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,680
You caused the death of so many people.

388
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,080
Don't you deserve to die?

389
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,000
You still owe me two lives.

390
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,480
You're a police officer.

391
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,440
You can't kill.

392
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,800
Then thank you for paving the way for me.

393
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,060
My first-class merit.

394
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,160
No one is above the law.

395
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,800
Issue a wanted notice

396
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,080
for Chi Xia.

397
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,160
You're a messenger of justice.

398
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,400
You've come to arrest me for the police.

399
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,200
You know that's not what I meant.

400
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,280
I only hate myself

401
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,400
for not having the chance to kill you with my own hands.

402
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,360
Deep down,

403
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,770
you crave to commit crimes.

404
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,040
We are the same kind.
