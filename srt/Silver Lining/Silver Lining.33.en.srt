1
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
Wang Yuya

2
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,280
POLICE

3
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,500
Just go inside.

4
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,160
What's wrong, sir?

5
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,420
Did something happen?

6
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,730
Let me help you up first.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,680
It's okay.

8
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,210
We can talk about it inside.

9
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,050
Let me take you in first.

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
Take it slow, sir.

11
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,980
Let's get you up first.

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,580
We can talk inside.

13
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Let me help you up.

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,360
Come on.

15
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,360
Sir, let's go.

16
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,620
We can talk inside.

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,600
Sir.

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,720
Take it slow.

19
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,800
I've fulfilled

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,570
everything I promised you.

21
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,120
So where's my array?

22
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,460
Listen carefully.

23
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,170
The sequence is:

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,840
25,

25
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,480
14,

26
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,000
12,

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,480
14,

28
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,120
25,

29
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,640
12.

30
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,680
We consulted with several

31
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,880
international cryptography experts to decode it.

32
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,010
We calculated over a dozen solutions.

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,560
At first we thought Chi Xia had deceived us.

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,640
We almost gave up.

35
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,810
But eventually,

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,520
we were able to derive

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,220
these English letters from the numbers.

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,280
We originally had three numbers

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,079
corresponding to three letters in the master key.

40
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,720
Now we have the complete sequence.

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,120
And the order is correct.

42
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,600
We've finally obtained

43
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,360
the corresponding eight-letter combination.

44
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,579
These combinations took considerable effort.

45
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,440
But hard work pays off.

46
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,280
Some parts do match up.

47
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,640
It seems that Chi Xia

48
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,200
wasn't lying.

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,530
This address...

50
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,420
Should we tell Chi Xia?

51
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,770
Of course we should.

52
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,120
The key is how we tell her.

53
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,800
You mean give her a fake address

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,600
to see if she passes the information to the police?

55
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,000
You suspect there's something fishy about her being wanted by police?

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,530
We can't let our guard down.

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,880
Tomorrow,

58
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,760
6 PM,

59
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,680
Lizang Museum.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,920
Your phone.

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,160
You're not going there.

62
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,360
Old K has a job for you.

63
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,519
What job?

64
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,100
It's also tomorrow at 6 PM.

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,440
You'll represent Lawa Village

66
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,960
and go with the Kote Group to Lilong Hotel at the border.

67
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,880
Negotiate with the pharmacist

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,010
and bring them back.

69
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,610
Who is this pharmacist?

70
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,840
Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

71
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,720
If I were you,

72
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,640
I'd make sure tomorrow's mission goes smoothly.

73
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,970
This is the last chance Old K is giving you.

74
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,380
Don't disappoint him.

75
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
If anything goes wrong,

76
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,220
you'll be the first to die.

77
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,680
Old K can't afford to offend the Kert Group.

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,960
Whatever demands they make,

79
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,920
he can't refuse.

80
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
So this is his test for me, right?

81
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,120
He's really got guts.

82
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,730
He signed the contract.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,400
If we can't deliver by the 8th of next month,

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,140
none of us will have peace.

85
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,080
Maybe

86
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,370
he thinks we're already at the end of our rope.

87
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,360
Take care of yourself tomorrow.

88
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,210
Let's go.

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Everything is ready.

90
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,330
Don't worry.

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,120
We've arranged everything.

92
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,580
Come on.

93
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,240
The vehicles and personnel back home are all arranged.

94
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,440
All reliable guys.

95
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,440
Let's go.

96
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,760
We should get going too.

97
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Follow that car.

98
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,880
Aren't we going to the Lizang Museum?

99
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,140
Why are we also going to the Lilong Hotel?

100
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,810
Who said Chi Xia was going to the hotel?

101
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,760
Chief Chang,

102
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,490
Old K's gang has officially entered the country.

103
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,320
Good.

104
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,530
Notify all teams

105
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,900
to proceed as planned.

106
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,100
Roger that.

107
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,360
I see.

108
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,640
These cops

109
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,000
are so naive.

110
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,640
They've surrounded the museum as expected.

111
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,560
Without fail,

112
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,320
we'll be getting a call from Lilong Hotel soon.

113
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
That little fox

114
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,850
still can't be trusted.

115
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,520
Don't worry.

116
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,330
I'm in no hurry to deal with her.

117
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,920
She still has her uses.

118
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,440
Unbelievable, isn't it?

119
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,200
Little fox.

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,330
You're still too green.

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,080
Think about your police partners

122
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,320
finding nothing at the Lizang Museum

123
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,159
and the Lilong Hotel.

124
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,890
Their frustrated expressions

125
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,320
make me laugh.

126
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,760
Have someone secure the perimeter.

127
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,840
Don't be too obvious.

128
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,560
Yes.

129
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,520
You three,

130
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,640
go get the coded box.

131
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,160
Okay.

132
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,320
This one

133
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,159
is found.

134
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Tell me.

135
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,960
Even if this thing falls into the police's hands,

136
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,160
what good would it do?

137
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,880
The password

138
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,140
is only known to me.

139
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,760
What do you want me to say?

140
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,620
Praise you for being so calculating?

141
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,160
It's a game.

142
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,280
There are naturally wins and losses.

143
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,480
Don't be a sore loser.

144
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,960
You've spent so much time

145
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,210
looking for this password box.

146
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,840
Why not

147
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,360
verify it with me?

148
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,200
What a pity.

149
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,400
Just one move away.

150
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,520
Officer Chi.

151
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,960
Are you here to see Mr. Qu?

152
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,920
Yes.

153
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,120
He's not here.

154
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,520
Also,

155
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,840
we're selling this place to someone else.

156
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,680
Why?

157
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,520
We're developing some new business

158
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,580
and don't want to spend time on this boxing gym anymore.

159
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,040
By the way,

160
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,440
you came at the right time.

161
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,320
He said you left some things here

162
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
and he put them in the locker for you.

163
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,600
The password is

164
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,760
Yesterday

165
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,610
someone broke into my home.

166
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,880
The photo on my desk was moved.

167
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,720
Someone went through my diary on the bookshelf.

168
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
The bookmark was in a different place.

169
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,240
Yesterday?

170
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,360
Yes.

171
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,600
I think it happened when we went to see Tu Guo'an.

172
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,800
I suspect they were after the data array.

173
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,520
Also,

174
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,160
Qu Bai is selling his boxing gym.

175
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,360
They say there's new business coming.

176
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,560
This new business,

177
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,120
could it be methcathinone?

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,960
I think so.

179
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,240
They don't even have the formula yet.

180
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,280
They're in such a hurry to start this new business.

181
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,800
Seems like this Old K is pretty confident.

182
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,840
He believes

183
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,920
once he gets the data array,

184
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,120
he can locate the place.

185
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,440
Does that mean

186
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,840
he already has

187
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,010
the cipher key to decode the location?

188
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,080
Chief Chang.

189
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,920
My parents' case

190
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,560
and this criminal organization's case

191
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,600
are both closely connected to me.

192
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,320
So

193
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,000
I should recuse myself.

194
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,960
Wait.

195
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,760
Listen to me.

196
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,040
Following Tu Guo'an's lead,

197
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,520
we've confirmed that Chi Xiao is indeed guilty.

198
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,120
She's the mastermind behind six murder cases,

199
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,400
including Chi Xia's parents' case,

200
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,800
and she was also involved in their execution.

201
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,640
This Old K

202
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,240
went to extreme lengths

203
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,560
to trigger Chi Xia's memory

204
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,280
and obtain the formula.

205
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,160
He repeatedly manipulated

206
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,960
and created the vigilante case.

207
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,000
Chief Chang.

208
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,280
If...

209
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
I mean, what if

210
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,920
Chi Xia had also chosen violence

211
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,930
and killed Chi Xiao?

212
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,560
Go on.

213
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,840
Of course.

214
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,960
We're not actually having Chi Xia kill anyone.

215
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,000
Instead, we're going to stage

216
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,040
a scenario where Chi Xia kills Chi Xiao.

217
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,080
This way,

218
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,280
Chi Xia will be placed in a completely isolated position.

219
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,640
Under these circumstances,

220
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,440
Old K will definitely reach out to Chi Xia,

221
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,280
who has both the array data

222
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,210
and has turned against the police.

223
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,100
Chi Xia can then extract the master password

224
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,840
and figure out the location.

225
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,720
This way,

226
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,720
our people

227
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,380
can set up surveillance at the scene in advance.

228
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,160
Finally,

229
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,380
we've got them like rats in a trap.

230
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,200
All contacts are in place.

231
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
Are all teams ready?

232
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,200
Ready.

233
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,890
Captain Luo,

234
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,000
our man is back.

235
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,560
Good.

236
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,840
Find an opportunity to expose yourself.

237
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,360
Okay,

238
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,080
no problem.

239
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,200
Brother,

240
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,120
put Curly

241
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,360
at the truck parking spot later.

242
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,200
Chi Xia will coordinate with us from the office.

243
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,080
Cao Bin has confirmed

244
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,360
that Chi Xiao is at his hideout.

245
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,560
We can proceed with the arrest.

246
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,440
Notify all teams

247
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,040
to move in.

248
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,560
Got it.

249
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,610
Captain Luo.

250
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,760
Chi Xiao must have noticed she's being followed.

251
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,090
She's driving away now.

252
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,120
I'm tailing her.

253
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,600
Cao Bin.

254
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,680
Keep your car closer to hers.

255
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,600
Let Chi Xiao clearly notice it.

256
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,200
Copy that.

257
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,440
Curly.

258
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,320
Have you reached the designated position?

259
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,000
Almost there.

260
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,080
Almost there, Captain Luo.

261
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,800
Chi Xia.

262
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,600
You can go to the abandoned building now.

263
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,520
I've already set up the surveillance there.

264
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,320
They're all disguised

265
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,240
as civilian cameras for monitoring forest fires.

266
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,520
They'll definitely capture everything.

267
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,320
No problem.

268
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,760
I'll go ahead then.

269
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,520
Be careful.

270
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,560
Let's go.

271
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,000
Curly.

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,040
Are you ready on your end?

273
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,840
All set.

274
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,840
Remove the police light.

275
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,480
Curly.

276
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,200
Get ready.

277
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
Let's go, driver.

278
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,480
Dong E·C4757.

279
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,040
Captain Luo.

280
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,700
The target has taken the bait.

281
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,360
Chi Xia.

282
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,020
It's your turn now.

283
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,760
Captain Luo.

284
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,220
The target has moved past.

285
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,880
Captain Luo.

286
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm following Chi Xiao now.

287
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,690
It's exactly where we planned.

288
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
She took the bait.

289
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,800
Chi Xia,

290
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,640
you coward!

291
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,520
I know about Chi Xiao.

292
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,720
Where are you?

293
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Can we meet?

294
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,859
Chi Xia.

295
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,329
Captain Luo,

296
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,579
they took the bait.

297
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,319
Great!

298
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,720
First, ensure your own safety.

299
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,569
Let me know if there's any problem.

300
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,800
Um...

301
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,319
What?

302
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,680
Worried that I'm using Qu Bai

303
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,079
and feeling bad about it?

304
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,240
Everything is to catch Old K.

305
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,680
I know exactly what I'm doing.

306
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,520
We focus on action.

307
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,720
Don't worry about me.

308
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm relieved you think that way.

309
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,840
I trust you.

310
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,980
Yuan Weimin

311
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,720
According to the news from Chi Xia.

312
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,520
Comrade Fu Gang's current

313
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,600
physical and mental condition is very concerning.

314
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,880
We must act quickly

315
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,920
at all costs

316
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,720
to rescue Comrade Fu Gang.

317
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,960
Luo Xun.

318
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,000
After you go back,

319
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,120
come up with an action plan immediately.

320
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,840
Understood,

321
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,570
Chief Chang.

322
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
I have good news.

323
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,410
The cipher master copy has been found.

324
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,640
You found it?

325
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,060
How did you find it?

326
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,680
Old Zhang loved Chinese opera when he was alive.

327
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,480
He particularly enjoyed 'Sanchaku'.

328
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,280
He said

329
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,600
the characters in opera

330
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,240
all work together as a team

331
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,280
to fight against evil forces.

332
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,520
The core spirit of justice triumphing over evil

333
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,180
aligns perfectly with the police's mission to eliminate criminals.

334
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,800
Old Zhang and his partner

335
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,560
spent their entire lives

336
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,080
upholding

337
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,920
this script.

338
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,940
It was given to him by his partner.

339
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
I heard him say

340
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,920
that each of them had a copy.

341
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,360
When they left,

342
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,640
they kept reminding me

343
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,680
to keep it safe.

344
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,120
This is the master copy of the code.

345
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,880
Yes,

346
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,920
and we've already deciphered

347
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,970
the location information represented by the array.

348
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,840
There aren't many pages here.

349
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,240
We still don't know

350
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,760
the decryption rules.

351
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,890
Can we trust the decoded information?

352
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,970
Director Chang,

353
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,920
actually,

354
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,680
we do have some clues.

355
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,160
Look at these three.

356
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,840
Curly hair.

357
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,620
The item might be hidden in this person's grave,

358
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,560
or even in his urn.

359
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,600
Without the password,

360
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
forcing it open

361
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,080
would destroy all the formulas inside.
