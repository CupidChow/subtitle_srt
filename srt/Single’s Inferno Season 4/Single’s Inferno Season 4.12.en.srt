AN JONG-HOON

15
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:50,925
SINGLE'S INFERNO

16
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,559
Hmm. Who is it?

17
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,519
Who's there first?

18
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,774
What's up?

19
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,568
Hey! I mean…

20
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,570
"What's up?"

21
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,864
"What's up?"

22
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,492
What's up?

23
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,327
Hey! I mean…

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,537
Gosh, you are so funny.

25
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,166
I mean, Jun-seo never comes over here
and just says that.

26
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,126
- Hurry. Let's go.
- What? Where?

27
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,544
Let's go outside.

28
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,879
To go where?

29
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,757
- To a nice spot over there.
- My gosh.

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,675
His knock-knock was hilarious.

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,637
- I guess everyone's putting in an effort.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,478
Ooh, jeez.

33
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,438
So why are you scoffing, huh?

34
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,277
His "What's up" got her heart racing
like, thump, thump again.

35
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,363
The way he said it was a lot less crude.

36
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,449
- Similar when he said, "Hey."
- Did you see her face light up?

37
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,284
- Yeah, I did.
- Yeah, I saw her face.

38
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,161
See? It's 50-50, right?

39
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,413
I still think so.

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,417
Maybe 60-40,
'cause I think he has the upper hand.

41
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,795
Jun-seo's a man of sixes,
like his surname.

42
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,422
Yuk for Yuk, and four for Jeong-su.
Seems right.

43
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,966
"Yuk for Yuk."

44
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,803
I think Jun-seo
is talking to Si-an right now.

45
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,389
Yeah, he seemed to have a lot on his mind.

46
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,432
- What?
- Jun-seo has a lot on his mind.

47
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,476
Gotcha. I can imagine.

48
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,190
But things were probably solidified
yesterday.

49
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,860
- Yesterday?
- Yeah. I bet she's decided.

50
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,529
- Yeah.
- At least to some degree.

51
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,948
He shouldn't get that to his head.

52
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,450
Now is not the time to let his guard down.

53
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,456
- What gives?
- "What gives?"

54
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,041
- What?
- It's not like you.

55
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,586
It's been a while.
It might be my first time coming to you.

56
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,254
I was quite surprised.

57
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,339
- You were?
- Yeah.

58
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,300
I don't wanna have regrets.

59
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,306
What'd you do?

60
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,892
What is it? You're smiling so much today.

61
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,477
- Why you smiling?
- It's been a while.

62
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,062
Oh, okay.

63
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,235
- Yesterday, I…
- So, what is it?

64
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,570
Hey, so…

65
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,531
During yesterday's choosing,
I knew I wouldn't be going.

66
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,659
- I didn't-- I knew you'd choose someone.
- Oh, you knew that?

67
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,952
But then…

68
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,832
When it actually happened,
it really broke my heart.

69
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,962
So, I was surprised
to realize what my actual feelings are

70
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,422
and how they affected me.

71
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,343
I have no regrets
about not getting to go to Paradise

72
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,637
since I've already been there
too many times.

73
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,472
- It wasn't about that.
- Mm.

74
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:47,101
I was thinking about how beautiful
the sky here looked yesterday

75
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,188
and I just wished
I could've enjoyed that view with you.

76
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,274
Jeez.

77
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,276
- What's going on?
- What?

78
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,157
It's done! It's done!

79
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,452
I bet she's thinking,
"Well, this is a nice change."

80
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,663
- I love the look she just gave him.
- I know.

81
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,914
It was so lovely.

82
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,750
Jeez.

83
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,543
What's going on?

84
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,714
Well, anyway.

85
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,219
We didn't really have
any private talks yesterday.

86
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,639
We all just got together
and chatted outside.

87
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,809
We ended up going to bed early,
around 11:00 p.m.

88
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,394
- That's early.
- Yeah.

89
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,480
Going to bed early
is probably why I'm feeling better.

90
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,525
- You feel better? Well, good. I'm glad.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

91
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,070
That's what happened.

92
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:42,282
- We went to Paradise twice, right?
- Yeah.

93
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,411
I've been looking back on how I behaved
during our second date in Paradise.

94
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:51,499
Before I went to bed, I made sure my mind
is made up and all sorted out.

95
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,751
- So yeah.
- All sorted?

96
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,836
It's all sorted.

97
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,047
I told Min-seol that my mind
was made up as well.

98
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,384
- That was my day yesterday.
- Okay, then.

99
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,846
- I did everything I needed to do.
- I guess you did.

100
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,099
I got straight to the point,
and made my feelings clear to her.

101
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,061
So I don't think there's anything else
for me to take care of.

102
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,773
Okay, all you need to do now
is be a little sweeter.

103
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,983
True.

104
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,485
I guess I could give that a shot.

105
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,487
- You just need to be more gentle.
- Yeah.

106
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,407
- Try to be a bit sweeter to me.
- Okay.

107
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,869
- Say, "Si-an."
- What?

108
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,997
Si-an.

109
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,499
Oh, gosh.

110
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,585
Man, I should really practice that.

111
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,628
- Hey, Si-an. Okay.
- Not "hey."

112
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,464
- I'm not a hey. I'm Si-an.
- Right.

113
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,966
Yep, got it.

114
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,928
He's changing.

115
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,765
She found a way to tame the beast.

116
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,231
I can't believe it's our last day already.

117
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,232
I know.

118
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,612
One thing led to another,
we went to Paradise a few times

119
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,489
and spent a lot of time together.

120
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,075
I don't have regrets
that I got to spend time with you.

121
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,118
- Me too.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,286
Yeah.

123
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,372
The emotions I had been feeling
deep down inside…

124
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,168
I was really able to confide in you

125
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,213
and let out a lot
of those pent-up emotions

126
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,632
while talking to you
on our date in Paradise.

127
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,264
In that moment,
I honestly felt like tearing up too.

128
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,310
You kept saying that you felt
like tearing up too.

129
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,149
You just hugged me
and held me really tight.

130
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,362
DAY 6 IN PARADISE

131
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,531
- You okay?
- Yes.

132
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,992
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- No, don't be. It's all right.

133
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,494
Oh, gosh, that hurt.

134
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,833
- I was grateful.
- Yeah.

135
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,837
After crying that day,
it felt like something went swoosh.

136
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,673
- All done.
- Felt like this?

137
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,217
That heavy load on my mind,
I just let it all out.

138
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,100
- I don't know what to say.
- Huh?

139
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,062
You don't have to say anything right now.

140
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,900
- There's nothing back there.
- What?

141
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,778
You have nothing to do back there.
Just stay here.

142
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:35,163
- I never expected to see him like that.
- Jun-seo is trying so hard.

143
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,248
Jun-seo has channeled his sweet side.

144
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,709
- This is huge.
- It must have an impact on her.

145
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,712
Jun-seo's gone up
to that 80-point range now.

146
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,797
With Si-an, well, I don't know.

147
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,759
There's this certain look I only see
on her face when she's around Jun-seo.

148
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,428
You hit the nail on the head.

149
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,514
That bright smile she had
when he came over to her first.

150
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,558
Her facial expressions are more dynamic.

151
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,728
With Jeong-su, it feels like
they've been dating for some time.

152
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,732
But when she's with Jun-seo, she feels
like someone who's freshly in love.

153
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,650
The biggest difference between the two

154
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,320
is that Si-an doesn't want anything
from Jeong-su,

155
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,323
whereas she keeps wanting things
from Jun-seo,

156
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,158
like, she wants him to be sweeter.

157
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,743
She expects a lot more from him,

158
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,953
which tells me
it's something she can't help.

159
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,706
It's showing that Si-an's heart
is with Jun-seo.

160
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,584
If she was sure
about her feelings for Jeong-su,

161
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,544
she wouldn't melt in front of Jun-seo.

162
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,839
Her face wouldn't light up
after hearing what Jun-seo had to say.

163
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,341
Exactly. I told you so.

164
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,469
Jeez, I don't wanna talk anymore.

165
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,012
I'll just watch quietly.

166
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,263
I refuse to speak now.

167
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,557
Reckless assumptions aren't allowed here.

168
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,854
A-rin.

169
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,564
Are you gonna take long?

170
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,900
Give me five minutes. Wait, three minutes.

171
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,069
- Two minutes.
- Two minutes?

172
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,488
What's wrong with him?

173
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,658
"What's wrong with him?"

174
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,284
She's happy though.

175
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,418
Shall we go now?

176
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,587
What do you think?
You like my tropical outfit?

177
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,173
- You look like a beverage.
- A beverage?

178
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,883
Yeah, those fruit-flavored ones.

179
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,221
- Should we sit here?
- Okay.

180
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,688
- I wore glasses today.
- Are they prescription?

181
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,815
They're on the lower end
with a blue light filter.

182
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,610
But there's no blue light to block.
You're just wearing them to look good.

183
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,571
No way, I'm not trying to look good.

184
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,366
- They look good on you.
- What'd you do yesterday?

185
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,325
- Yesterday?
- Yeah.

186
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,162
Well, I talked a big game
about having fun, but I didn't have any.

187
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,623
There wasn't anyone
to chat with one-on-one.

188
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,960
I watched what was happening
between Jun-seo and Min-seol.

189
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,546
You were eager to have fun,
but nothing happened?

190
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,589
Unfortunately.

191
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,925
In Paradise, I was curious
about what others were doing in Inferno

192
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,844
and what pictures they were taking.

193
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,470
Oh, that got you curious?

194
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,307
You must have been
very interested in Inferno.

195
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,434
- Yeah, well, you were here.
- True.

196
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,020
- Yeah, well, you were here.
- True.

197
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,772
Well, you know,
it's good to stay interested.

198
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,945
Did you hear
that yesterday's Paradise was different?

199
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,408
Yeah, I heard it was.
I'm honestly incredibly jealous.

200
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,994
- You shouldn't be.
- I heard you went to an <i>izakaya.</i>

201
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,746
- We did.
- You went bowling.

202
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,164
- That's true.
- Yeah.

203
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,790
That was it.

204
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,959
You didn't do anything fun
when you took me.

205
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,586
Bowling wasn't that much fun.

206
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:33,591
- It might've been fun if you went with me.
- That would've been different, yeah.

207
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,140
How cute.

208
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,893
We went straight to the <i>izakaya</i>,

209
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,936
we had our dinner there,

210
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,855
and we had some tea and fruit.

211
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,940
We chatted a little there over dinner.

212
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,235
Then afterwards,
we washed up and went to bed.

213
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,281
Great.

214
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,034
I see you're explaining your timeline
in detail again.

215
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,703
Well, I mean,
I'm just telling you what I did.

216
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,624
- Nothing happened.
- Okay, then.

217
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,088
- What?
- What?

218
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,590
Wait, why are you laughing?

219
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,884
Gosh, it's so funny.

220
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,850
- Why do you keep laughing?
- Why are you laughing?

221
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,977
Stop laughing. I can't if you don't.

222
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,939
- You laughed first.
- No. You laughed first.

223
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,613
What? Why do you keep laughing?

224
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,952
- Why are they laughing?
- They're happy to be around each other.

225
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,578
- They're solid.
- Yeah.

226
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,542
- You aren't wearing earrings.
- I didn't get a chance to put on jewelry.

227
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,626
You had no time?

228
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,879
You gave me two minutes,
so I came out as soon as you asked.

229
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,298
I'll pick for you.
What options do you have?

230
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,758
- The leaves.
- What?

231
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,760
DAY 1 IN THE EVENING

232
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,055
Now that I'm looking at you from the side,
your earrings are big.

233
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,724
They're actually so loud though.

234
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,061
I glanced over at you
and saw something heavy there.

235
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,939
- They really suit you.
- Thank you.

236
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,732
- The leaves.
- What?

237
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,901
- Don't wear the leaves.
- Don't?

238
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,114
Let me try
picking something out for you.

239
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,285
I didn't bring a lot
of jewelry with me though.

240
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,413
- This is everything.
- Well… Oh, that one goes.

241
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,831
- Better, right?
- Yeah.

242
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,875
Wear that and try this as well.

243
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,586
Let's go with these ones.
No, don't wear those.

244
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:38,215
- These… These ones just scare me a little.
- You really do hate these, don't you?

245
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,178
- They look a bit scary. They freak me out.
- Let me hold them for you.

246
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,013
You might think they look okay.

247
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,598
- Let me see.
- Here.

248
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,224
They're scary. Don't wear them.

249
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,602
They scare me.

250
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,647
- Wear these.
- Whatever. I just wanna wear what I want.

251
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,483
Oh, you do? Then, let's do that.

252
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,027
- Why even bring me here?
- I don't wanna wear this.

253
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,445
It's too bold.

254
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,033
- "Then, let's do that."
- "Why'd you even bring me here?"

255
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,076
- I like this one.
- It looks good on you.

256
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,786
Help me, please.

257
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,290
- Looks tough. I've never done this.
- I have long nails, so it's hard to get.

258
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,959
If you can't,
I can just ask someone outside.

259
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,588
Is that good enough?

260
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,924
- Good? Let's go.
- Yeah.

261
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,301
- Great.
- Why did you even ask?

262
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,969
What?

263
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,890
It's like they're on an actual date
in Inferno.

264
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,603
- These two are a done deal.
- It's obvious with those two.

265
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,563
I can't help but smile watching them.

266
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,025
Knock, knock.

267
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,779
- Hey.
- What?

268
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,906
- Let's hang out.
- Sure.

269
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,285
Should we take
a Polaroid together?

270
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,411
Oh, sure.

271
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:56,669
- It's nice out.
- It's so… nice.

272
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,380
"It's so… nice."

273
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,799
We never got to take any.

274
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,509
Let me take a picture of you.

275
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,388
I'll take a picture of you two.

276
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,975
- Will you? That'd be great.
- Yeah.

277
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,144
All right, one…
Oh, this pose looks better.

278
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,646
Good.

279
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,315
The tour guide.

280
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,902
When did he show up?

281
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,612
Count down for us.

282
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,447
All right. Get ready.

283
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,869
In one, two.

284
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,788
One more.

285
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,292
All right, smile in one, two.

286
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,377
All right, last one.

287
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,879
You're going too fast.

288
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,922
- Let's take a silly one.
- Okay.

289
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,008
What're you gonna do?

290
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,599
They are both so good-looking.

291
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,766
I know.

292
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,102
Let me see.

293
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,230
Well, you might not like it.

294
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,066
Jong-hoon left them
as soon as he was done.

295
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,486
- Is he an actual tour guide or what?
- When did he leave?

296
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,071
I didn't even notice.

297
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,948
Wow!

298
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,825
Let me see.

299
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,119
Well, you might not like it.

300
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,789
You didn't make a silly face, did you?

301
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,375
This was my silly face.

302
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:27,968
Seriously though. I thought I was making
a really ugly face when we took it.

303
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,971
- Are you kidding me?
- I didn't know I had to go that far.

304
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,141
Well, you should've told me
you were going all out.

305
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,143
Are you kidding me? Seriously.

306
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,854
You really took it to the next level.

307
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,068
- I better keep this one for myself.
- No.

308
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,820
They came out nicely.

309
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,905
Mmm…

310
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,408
You look perfect
even while doing a silly pose.

311
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,753
- Whoa, the money shot.
- Hold on.

312
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,715
Perfect.

313
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,098
- Almost ready.
- Here it comes.

314
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,021
Another pretty picture.

315
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,738
Are you a bit tired?
You seem really tired today.

316
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,365
- Do I?
- Yeah.

317
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,409
You're tired?

318
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,623
This mister is tired.

319
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,166
"This mister"?

320
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,876
This old mister is tired.

321
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,716
You love that joke.

322
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,928
That's what you sound like.

323
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,522
It doesn't feel
like the last day.

324
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,024
- Right?
- Yeah.

325
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,905
How peaceful.

326
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,950
It really is.

327
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,454
It feels like a dream.

328
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,913
Like a dream?

329
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,002
It honestly went by so fast.

330
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,718
Whose score do you think is higher now?
What's the score?

331
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:36,096
To me, it seems like Jun-seo
has a higher score out of the two.

332
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,556
I agree. I say it's Yuk.

333
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,726
Si-an seems to be happy
and enjoying his company to some degree

334
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,895
but her mind seems to be elsewhere.

335
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,147
- That's what I'm feeling.
- She's just comfortable.

336
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,026
Why do you keep sighing?

337
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,737
Going through troubles
at home or something?

338
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,991
I guess Da-hee still feels like Si-an
is more drawn to Jeong-su right now.

339
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,242
Why, Da-hee?

340
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,329
Well, honestly, when she's with Jeong-su,

341
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,748
I see her lost in thought
from time to time,

342
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,751
so it does feel like her heart
is with Jun-seo,

343
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,087
but I think she'll choose Jeong-su
in the end.

344
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,005
What? Really?

345
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,967
What a surprise. Wow. I never knew
you were this stubborn. Seriously.

346
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,261
Because you want
to choose him for yourself?

347
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,888
No, that's not it.

348
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,016
I just think she'll choose someone
who makes her feel secure.

349
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,186
But it's Si-an we're talking about,
so I don't know.

350
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,439
So you mean
she may be more drawn to Jun-seo,

351
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,359
but she'll probably choose
the more sustainable option

352
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,570
- that gives her more comfort?
- We don't know where her heart is.

353
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,323
I think Si-an will choose Jun-seo.

354
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,493
- Really? I think-- I do too.
- I think Jeong-su.

355
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,703
- Why?
- You're still clueless, huh?

356
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,957
Why? I wouldn't know
since I'm not roommates with Si-an.

357
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,669
Well, she doesn't say much
in our room either, so I don't know.

358
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,547
It's not sudden.
They went to Paradise.

359
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,257
She got butterflies.

360
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,968
Jeong-su massaged her hand
on the helicopter.

361
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,761
She hasn't been able to forget about that.

362
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,138
Seriously? Still?

363
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,473
She said it gave her butterflies.

364
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,977
That's why she chose him,
to confirm her feelings.

365
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,730
I'm gonna pick Jun-seo.
Does this mean he'll choose me?

366
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:14,736
She only hears things she wants to.
She's interpreting things on her terms.

367
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,739
- Gosh, Min-seol.
- Oh, my goodness.

368
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,284
I'll pick Jun-seo.
Does this mean he'll choose me?

369
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,330
- What?
- Will he choose me? Should I talk to him?

370
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,417
If I were you,
I'd say everything that's on my mind.

371
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,460
I can't say much since I'm an observer,

372
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,005
but things could change
if you spent more time.

373
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,715
What's up?

374
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,217
A-rin, let's go.

375
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:41,221
- Go where? Oh, come on. That's mean.
- No, you can't go. I wanna talk with you.

376
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,848
Count me in too.

377
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,309
I didn't get
to talk much with Dong-ho.

378
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,560
Let's all sit and talk.

379
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,645
- I'll go outside.
- Why are you leaving?

380
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,148
- Hey, can I sit here?
- Yeah, absolutely.

381
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,025
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

382
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,737
- Did you get sleep last night?
- I slept so well. Fell asleep right away.

383
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,655
I was quiet yesterday, wasn't I?

384
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,700
Yeah, you were.
I felt like I was walking on eggshells.

385
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,202
- Really? Sorry.
- Yeah.

386
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,662
When we were doing the dishes,
you looked pissed.

387
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,122
Like I couldn't talk to you.

388
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,749
- I seem pissed?
- Yeah.

389
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,960
You made it obvious
you didn't wanna do the dishes with me.

390
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,255
- Why wouldn't I wanna do dishes with you?
- You seemed to hate it.

391
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,633
- No, I didn't hate it.
- You didn't?

392
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:22,221
It's just that… Honestly, my own emotions
and concerns were all over the place then.

393
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,847
- They're sorted now?
- Yup.

394
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,349
- For sure.
- Good to hear.

395
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,809
I don't care about the results anymore.

396
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,395
I've decided
that I'm just gonna follow my heart.

397
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,982
- Nice, right?
- Me too.

398
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,193
- Same.
- That's the only way.

399
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,986
Mm. Yeah, I agree.

400
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,614
Let's just have a drink tonight.

401
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,368
Jeez, I feel like you're treating me
like a younger sister right now.

402
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,953
I can't believe this. You…

403
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,621
- Hold on. Are you crazy?
- Why?

404
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,291
Fine, let's just drink.

405
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,542
Uh…

406
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,922
- Is this your look today?
- Yeah, pretty girly, huh?

407
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,383
Hold on. Let me see.

408
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,385
I like it.

409
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,387
Do you like it?

410
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,764
- Do you not?
- Why aren't you wearing jewelry?

411
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,267
- It's a bit plain without any.
- Oh, I have some.

412
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,643
Put a necklace on.

413
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,020
"Put a necklace on."

414
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,357
I have some,
but I don't know which one to go with.

415
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,192
You pick.

416
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,320
- Okay. Show me.
- Not this one.

417
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,321
Choose from those.

418
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,532
Or this one.

419
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,287
Well, having your jewelry picked out
by someone who has no feelings for you

420
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,831
- is pointless.
- But she has feelings for him.

421
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,209
Either way, moments like these
should still be enjoyable for her.

422
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,837
- Since she has feelings for him.
- Right.

423
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,674
- There's not much to wear.
- Something like this might be better.

424
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,092
Like this?

425
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,179
- Mm. It's not bad.
- Yeah? Help me.

426
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,390
- Me?
- My nails are too long.

427
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,517
Gosh, you're so high-maintenance.

428
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,895
Can you do it for me? I can't do it
because my nails are too long.

429
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,151
Just don't make it too tight though.

430
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,236
Yeah, I'll leave it loose for you.

431
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,487
Thank you.

432
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,826
I'll check in the mirror.

433
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,996
- It looks like you got pretty tan today.
- I know. It's the sun.

434
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,750
- Oh, whoa!
- Yeah.

435
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,418
- Not bad, right?
- This is it.

436
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:24,760
Jun-seo is 200 percent into Si-an.
But seriously, he's so weird.

437
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,095
He keeps giving me hope
until the very end.

438
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,638
It's driving me nuts.

439
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,392
He keeps flirting with me like
he helped me with my necklace and stuff.

440
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:36,354
He gets flirty with me even when his heart
is already with someone else.

441
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:43,153
He gave her no such thing.

442
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,614
I mean, it was
in the negative percentile range.

443
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,159
- No, this is because…
- I understand why she'd think like that.

444
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,536
Okay, then, was he being flirty with her?

445
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,413
- He was not flirting.
- Not at all.

446
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,665
He's just comfortable being around her.

447
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,169
But Min-seol keeps taking it the wrong way
and reading into things.

448
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,839
It's obvious that Jun-seo simply visited
her room to kill some time.

449
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,049
He was bored.

450
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,260
Also, he picked out a necklace for her
because she asked him to.

451
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,722
And he did make it a point to express
she was being high-maintenance.

452
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,725
- Oh, yeah. You're right.
- I mean, just watch them.

453
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,644
He wasn't flirting with her at all.

454
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,314
I think Min-seol wants to confirm
her own set of speculations.

455
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:22,442
You know, when girls chat,
they ask the same thing repeatedly

456
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,361
until they get the answer they want.

457
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:28,281
People in love tend to hear things the way
they want regardless of what's being said.

458
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,868
True. So she adds meaning
to every little gesture of his.

459
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,205
I didn't know people
thought like that.

460
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,416
- Let's talk in the secret room.
- Okay.

461
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,212
- I'll miss this when it's over.
- Mm.

462
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,505
It's already…

463
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,050
I was skeptical
about how fast this would go.

464
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,719
- Ten days felt so long at first.
- Mm-hmm.

465
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,055
But this whole thing
actually went by so fast.

466
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,807
It probably went by even faster

467
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,434
because we were busy
with our two trips to Paradise.

468
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,397
Do you have any regrets
during your ten days here?

469
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,606
Um…

470
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,443
Losing the first game
and being left behind in Inferno.

471
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,154
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

472
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,780
When I'm out in society,

473
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,825
I always find myself
in positions where I do the winning.

474
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,535
Mm. Sure.

475
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,830
So stomaching my first defeat
during the first game on day one

476
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:20,125
wasn't exactly the easiest thing
to overcome for myself.

477
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,213
What does he mean?

478
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,841
- Business success.
- That's what he means?

479
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,343
He's getting carried away
in his little universe.

480
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,554
- He's too immersed in it.
- Right?

481
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:36,850
I put chocolates in three boxes.
I was only gonna put one in your box.

482
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,059
- Really?
- Yeah.

483
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,187
Well, guess who else I picked.

484
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,189
- No. Don't wanna know.
- Why?

485
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,523
- Really?
- Yeah.

486
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,066
You're not curious at all?

487
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,904
I'm not curious about who you chose
and I'm not curious about who chose me.

488
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,406
I don't usually get curious
about those things.

489
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,324
Really?

490
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,118
You aren't curious?

491
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,913
- No.
- Oh, wow.

492
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,080
I see.

493
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,500
- I just think that it's meaningless.
- How fascinating. Oh.

494
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,005
I always put my emotions and thoughts
before anything else.

495
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,381
That's just what I do.

496
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,008
Mm-hmm.

497
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,928
Interesting.

498
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,014
"Interesting."

499
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,724
- He is interesting.
- Wow.

500
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,852
But women want men
to be curious about such things.

501
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,980
Ji-yeon seems baffled by the fact
that he isn't even curious.

502
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,691
Like, "It's strange.
Isn't it normal to be curious?"

503
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,362
- He's got to be curious.
- She wants him to be curious.

504
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,531
- I think I talked about this.
- About what?

505
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,493
- I didn't think you were that into me.
- You didn't?

506
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,746
I'm just a bit… Well…

507
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,458
I often come off
as indifferent toward other people.

508
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,128
But I think that's how
I actually am deep down.

509
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,215
I'm so sure about myself
I don't care much about anything.

510
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,800
Other things aren't important to you.

511
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,386
I don't put importance
on secondary things.

512
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,891
It can cause misunderstandings like this,
but I can always explain to resolve them.

513
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,976
Yeah.

514
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,355
- I've been a little unsure, to be honest.
- I see where you're coming from.

515
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,693
I hear you and I understand,
but the other girls…

516
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,905
They told me that I'm really lovey-dovey
with how I treat you.

517
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,283
- They did?
- Yeah, just with you.

518
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,245
So I'm just kind of confused
as to why you seem so unsure

519
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,913
about my feelings for you.

520
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,875
Why am I feeling so unsure?
I really don't know.

521
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,836
Maybe it's your personality?

522
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,630
- Maybe I was just being cautious.
- Yeah.

523
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,175
Or maybe it is just my personality.
I don't immediately believe people

524
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,678
when they tell me
they're being genuine with me.

525
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,430
- Mm.
- Yeah.

526
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:44,769
Sometimes, when you say certain things,
I wonder if you mean what you're saying,

527
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,398
or if you're just saying it
to please me, you know? Mm.

528
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,442
Mm-hmm.

529
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,195
Wanna ask me anything else?

530
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,450
I asked all my questions
during our first two days in Paradise.

531
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,828
- I wonder what the others are up to.
- Should we go and check?

532
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,542
Their conversations are so suffocating.

533
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,919
I feel stifled inside
just listening to them.

534
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,589
There's no back-and-forth
in their conversation.

535
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,758
I feel like there's nothing there.

536
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,760
Te-hwan is just a little…

537
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,386
How should I put it?

538
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,972
I feel like he's quite into himself.

539
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,100
- That's what I'm feeling.
- It's like he's drunk on himself.

540
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,310
It shouldn't be a big deal

541
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,605
to accept another person's way of thinking
through conversations,

542
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:32,233
but he's more like, "Well, I am me,
and these are my set ideas.

543
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,943
Whether you accept them or not,

544
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,529
I don't care
because I'll always think like that."

545
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:40,408
"This is how I've been living my life
and this is me. This is me."

546
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,286
It won't be easy for him
to date someone being like that.

547
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,415
He has some of the negative attributes
that people in the arts can have.

548
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,835
Yeah. In short, he's drunk
on his own artistic tendencies.

549
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,839
- For me, and this is how I feel.
- What? Yeah?

550
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,802
So, in my early 20s,
I was obsessed with hip-hop for a while.

551
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:03,765
I had this mindset that I was the best
and everyone else was beneath me.

552
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,682
Sure.

553
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,602
You know, just like those rap lyrics
that rappers write.

554
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,563
I'm being reminded of myself back then.

555
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,982
But, actually,
it's making me feel a little sad.

556
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,567
I have a question for you.

557
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,362
Did you think like that
toward your girlfriend as well?

558
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,656
Those egotistical tendencies?

559
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,450
It came up 'cause I built my life
on that foundation.

560
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,245
Te-hwan currently sees himself
as an ambitious man

561
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,456
who speaks crudely for the sake
of looking indifferent and cool.

562
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,791
All casual.

563
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,461
He cares so deeply about culture
and his ambitious dream

564
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,255
that he's getting carried away.

565
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,924
I'm trying to stay hopeful
he will change like I have.

566
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,926
I just think it would be nice

567
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,388
if he could be a little more considerate
of the other person.

568
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,354
- We get to swim.
- How exciting!

569
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,943
<i>♪ I just do it like that ♪</i>

570
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,987
<i>♪ I just do it like, do it like ♪</i>

571
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,201
<i>♪ Yeah, I do it like that ♪</i>

572
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,371
- Bring it on, girls.
- Bring it on.

573
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,790
Gosh, I love it!

574
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,959
- You're like a seal.
- It's so nice.

575
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,377
It's cold though.

576
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,131
Is that Jun-seo?

577
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,550
He's literally a seal.

578
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,471
- Go in. No, wait, wait, wait!
- What's wrong, Dong-ho?

579
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,322
- Should we get on this?
- I'm not going in!

580
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,032
I'll see you guys in Seoul.

581
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,284
- Bye.
- It's freezing.

582
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,702
It's so cold!

583
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:54,167
Jong-hoon, you're the best.
You're the only one taking care of me.

584
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,885
- Aren't you cold?
I am.

585
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,596
Gosh, what is Jun-seo doing?

586
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,098
What is he, Tarzan?

587
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,394
How did he get up there?

588
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,564
- "Tarzan."
- Oh, my goodness.

589
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,149
Why is he doing that now?

590
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,778
Tarzan!

591
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,822
Tarzan! Tarzan!

592
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,990
Jun-seo! Look at Jun-seo!

593
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,743
- You see what he did? Awesome.
- Only he would do that.

594
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,788
- He did that? He dove.
- He jumped like a diver.

595
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,086
- What on earth is he doing?
No idea.

596
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,297
Give me that.

597
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,008
Just tell me one thing.
Are we a team or not?

598
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,468
Yeah, we're a team.

599
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,554
- You said so.
- No, we aren't.

600
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,848
- Excuse you.
- We're a team.

601
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,724
- What? All of a sudden?
- I'm sorry.

602
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,977
Hey, be careful. Careful.

603
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,311
Seem fine in the water.

604
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,981
- Right, but-- This much is okay.
- Is this okay?

605
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,778
- Si-an, where are you going?
- Goodbye.

606
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,155
Wait, what did you do?

607
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,323
Huh?

608
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,119
How far out is she going?

609
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,289
- She's going too deep.
What? I know, right?

610
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,961


611
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,964
Come back.

612
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,136
Hey, when did you manage
to get out that far?

613
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,140
- He's going in.
They aren't gonna leave together.

614
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,017
Hello!

615
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,103
I'm coming for you.

616
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:40,106
Oh, come on, You-jin. Wow.

617
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,692
- Jeez, You-jin!
You-jin's something.

618
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,986


619
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,156
Hey.
Are you guys drifting off for real?

620
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,829
I'm rescuing her.

621
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:55,872
Hey, you.

622
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,333
Don't snatch her away. She's my princess.

623
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,336
- You're out.
- Hey, go over there.

624
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,130
- No. No!
- Let's all go together.

625
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,467
Okay. Let's go together.

626
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,345
- No!
- Come. Let's go this way, okay?

627
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,765
Are we rescuing Si-an together?

628
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,019
- I'm not feeling good.
- You were drifting off that way.

629
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,563
I can go by myself.

630
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,190
Why are they so far away?

631
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,526
- I think it's time to go. Uh-huh.
- It's time to go now?

632
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,488
- Gosh, it's fun.
- It really is.

633
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,120
We need towels.

634
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,748
Any leftover towels, please?

635
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,129
It's quite cold, huh?

636
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,799
- Yeah.
- It is.

637
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,175
Hey, some towels.

638
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,179
Take this if you're cold.

639
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,264
- Freezing to death.
- I'm cold.

640
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,891
Here's some towels.

641
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,937
- I shouldn't have gone in.
- Why not?

642
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,356
- I'm so cold now.
- Oh, really?

643
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,985
Oh, no. I guess you are feeling
a bit under the weather, aren't you?

644
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,444
Yeah.

645
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,710
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

646
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,712
- Need help?
- I need medicine.

647
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,839
I've got a drink though.

648
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,883
Yeah, if you take medicine,
you can't drink.

649
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,343
Right.

650
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,268
Was there a certain moment
that ruined his mood so suddenly?

651
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,771
Earlier when Si-an was with Jeong-su,
she mentioned Jun-seo again.

652
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,191
She went like, "Where is Jun-seo?"
Maybe that's when he got sulky.

653
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:51,612
- I didn't realize that.
- While with Jeong-su?

654
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,115
- Yeah, while playing.
- Right, they were together.

655
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,159
From that moment on, he was a little…

656
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,661
But Jeong-su is a bit more…

657
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,164
No, both of the guys
are pursuing her actively.

658
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,501
Jeong-su is just a little upset
to see she has also gotten close

659
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,796
- with Jun-seo, not just him.
- He's sulking.

660
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,633
Remember how Jeong-su mentioned
that he was a conservative person?

661
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,678
Jun-seo doesn't get as upset
when he sees him with Si-an,

662
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,848
whereas Jeong-su can't keep a poker face.

663
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,400
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah, me too.

664
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,652
- Whoa, this looks great.
- What?

665
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,738
- It's barbecue.
- Wow.

666
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,324
- Is that meat?
- Awesome.

667
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,785
- Wait. What is this?
- Gosh, no way.

668
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,245
- I'll sit next to A-rin.
- Okay.

669
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,753
- Are you good at grilling?
- Yeah.

670
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,338
Wow.

671
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,382
Nice.

672
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,385
- It's good.
- It's to die for.

673
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,098
- Should we all toast?
- Cheers!

674
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,017
- Do you want a beer first? Want this one?
- Mm.

675
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:10,233
- It's been a great nine days. Cheers.
- Cheers.

676
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,734
Cheers.

677
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,447
Gosh.

678
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,242
I honestly just can't believe it.

679
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,369
- That it's our last night?
- Yeah.

680
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,996
It's the last night.

681
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,249
Well, should we get started now?

682
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,459
- It's getting fun.
- I'm curious.

683
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,920
- I'm curious about Dong-ho.
- Same.

684
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,089
Same.

685
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,758
- You're in for a surprise.
- I can't wait.

686
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,927
Might be younger
than we thought.

687
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,388
I am 30 years old.

688
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,015
- What year were you born?
- '93.

689
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,893
- That's unexpected.
- I'm a public accountant.

690
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,729
A CPA?

691
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,314
Mr. Accountant.

692
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,609
- Whoa.
- An accountant. That's so cool.

693
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,529
It's rare to find an accountant
this handsome.

694
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,115
He has
that white-collar job vibe.

695
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,993
- No way.
- You have a white-collar job too.

696
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,202
Don't assume I'm older.

697
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,954
He was born in '93.

698
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,289
I'm sensitive right now.

699
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,625
They kept using honorifics towards me.

700
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,629
They all kept making it seem
as if I was obviously older than them.

701
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,133
I mean, do I really look
that much older than them?

702
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,468
Earlier you… I almost used honorifics.

703
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,388
Oh, come on. Are you picking
a fight with me or what?

704
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,558
Are the girls starting a war
with each other now?

705
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,143
I mean, come on, guys.

706
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,145
Ms. You-jin… Oops.

707
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,189
I am not older.

708
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,691
She's so comfortable to be around.

709
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:37,612
But I'm worried you're older than me.
Gosh, it's so…

710
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,946
You read older.

711
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,406
So she is older.

712
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,242
Why is everyone poking fun
at her like that?

713
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,662
They are all younger than her though.

714
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,333
- Are you the big sis here?
- Okay, let me ask you all.

715
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,126
How old do I actually look to you?

716
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,421
- Why do you keep… Just say it, Old Sis.
- Just say it.

717
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,007
I am 28.

718
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,305
I am a professional dancer
and part of a dance company.

719
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,725
I dance, choreograph,
so basically everything.

720
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,810
- Suits her, doesn't it?
- Yeah, totally.

721
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,772
I'm a dance teacher and an artist. Yeah.

722
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,274
"An artist."

723
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,692
I never would've imagined.

724
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,445
Really? But whenever I used
hand gestures and stuff,

725
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:23,199
I was worried about making it too obvious
with my delicate movements.

726
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,661
So I sometimes thought like,
"Maybe I gave them a spoiler just now."

727
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,162
That's constantly on my mind.

728
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,165
When your keyword was "bungee jump,"
you did this.

729
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,667
That was a spoiler.

730
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,627
- You did this.
- Really was.

731
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,174
Min-seol.

732
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,178
I was born in 2000, so I'm 23.

733
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,972
Someone born in 2000.

734
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,723
Gosh, this is insane.

735
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,434
I am…

736
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,270
25 years old.

737
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,105
I was born in '99.

738
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,606
You're 25? Wow.

739
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,858
I said she'd be older than me.

740
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,944
- So you two are friends? Right.
- Yeah.

741
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:05,324
- I was born in 2000.
- My gosh, we're the same age!

742
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,994
I'm 25. I was born in '98.

743
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,622
We're the same.
Seriously, I was so nervous.

744
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,291
Darn it.

745
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,167
<i>I am</i> the oldest female contestant!

746
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,381
"I am…"

747
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,718
- She had her hopes up.
- Yeah.

748
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,803
You really are the big sis here.

749
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,389
It was obvious.
You have that vibe.

750
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,977
Well, I was assuming they were
thinking that because I seemed mature.

751
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,521
I figured that my clever
and elegant traits

752
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,316
were what made them think
that I was older.

753
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,986
But now that I know
that I actually am the oldest female here,

754
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,821
well, it's not a good feeling.

755
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,074
Why do people have to age at all?

756
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,455
Oh, gosh.

757
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,499
- She hates it.
- It's not that big of a deal.

758
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,877
Should we start using honorifics?

759
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,921
- What do we do now?
- Big sisters? I guess I was right.

760
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,924
- They are all big sisters.
- I have a question for Hye-jin.

761
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,430
Did your heart ever skipped a beat
during your time here?

762
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,141
I'm not talking about
a simple heart flutter.

763
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,393
Did it go, "Ah", or drop?

764
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,730
When Jong-hoon…

765
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:28,616
When he came back from Paradise this time,
he really reassured me.

766
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,159
My heart skipped a beat then.

767
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,869
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON

768
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,829
I've never been swayed. Not once.

769
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,250
I just wanted to tell you this
and put you at ease,

770
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,252
in case you're feeling anxious at all.

771
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,090
It was touching.

772
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,217
Ooh!

773
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,136
My heart's all warm and fuzzy.

774
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,180
Fuzzy, fuzzy.

775
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,182
All right, Jeong-su,

776
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,185
has your heart ever skipped a beat
during your time here?

777
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,770
Has it at any point?

778
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:58,813
Yeah.

779
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,981
Okay, tell us when.

780
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,442
- Elaborate for us. Yeah.
- How it happened?

781
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,320
- Tell us.
- Hmm…

782
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,035
On the first day when…

783
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,248
- you were all standing.
- What?

784
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,165
What?

785
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,585
Day one, I won the game
and got to choose someone,

786
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,254
and you were standing in a line.

787
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,048
Mm…

788
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,968
On the very first day… Oh, gosh!

789
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,362
Si-an, have you made up your mind yet?

790
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,619
Mm…

791
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,513
Yeah, I think I have.

792
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:26,650
Jun-seo, have you made up your mind about
who to pick for tomorrow's final choosing?

793
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,740
I wonder who.

794
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,783
Gosh, I can't hear this.

795
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,286
Oh, my gosh.

796
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,622
I made up my mind yesterday.

797
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,749
I'm set.

798
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,640
Just do it.

799
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,934
- Jun-seo.
- Go on.

800
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,707
Could I still…

801
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,834
I think I'm tearing up.

802
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,128
- Why are you tearing up?
- I don't know.

803
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,798
- I can't help it.
- Mm!

804
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,383
No, no. Don't console me.

805
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:41,392
You still had fun when you went
to Paradise with me, right?

806
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,935
What's the matter?

807
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,396
- Gosh, I'm embarrassed.
- Of course.

808
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,606
Don't do that. Seriously, don't.

809
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,234
You had fun, right?

810
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,946
Come on, I had so much fun.

811
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,658
Our conversations flowed so well.
We literally never stopped talking.

812
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,873
He kept telling us that.

813
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,834
We seriously talked nonstop.

814
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,421
- Are you okay? No, don't cry.
- Oh, gosh.

815
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,839
It's all right.

816
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,674
- This is bad.
- It's okay.

817
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,023
The message that I wanted to convey
was something like,

818
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,983
"Just please don't forget about me."

819
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,819
I had so much fun.

820
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:43,370
I think I truly had
a once-in-a-lifetime experience here.

821
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,250
I really had fun.

822
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,713
I just… I'd like to tell Jun-seo…

823
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,717
Oh, my goodness, why can't I stop crying?

824
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,095
Thank you.

825
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,854
Mm…

826
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:14,026
Well, I was honestly really skeptical
about the possibility

827
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,195
of falling in love in only ten short days.

828
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,031
But this experience
exceeded my expectations

829
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,450
with everything it put me through.

830
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,160
Mm…

831
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,454
Mm…

832
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,419
Mm. It was really nice.

833
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,424
Well, I don't know how I should say this…

834
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,760
That you liked doing this.

835
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,555
I really liked doing this.
I honestly don't want to go home tomorrow.

836
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,974
I don't wanna go home either.

837
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,815
Since I got discharged from the military,

838
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,776
I have always felt like a stranger
wherever I went.

839
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,239
I found it hard to blend in
with other people,

840
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,699
whether I'm at work or anywhere else.

841
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:07,246
But I truly feel like I made
a new family here, so I'm glad about that.

842
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,792
I'll never forget this.

843
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,757
Well…

844
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,472
During most of this, I was definitely
physically and mentally drained.

845
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:31,895
Still, I believe I won't ever be able
to forget this incredible experience.

846
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,022
Thank you, everyone.

847
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,156
This whole experience
felt like a precious gift to me.

848
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:46,201
I've made great memories here
that I'll cherish for life.

849
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,634
Oh, great.

850
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:39,296
<i>The hottest inferno in the world,</i>
Single's Inferno.

851
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,298
<i>It's the final day.</i>

852
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,675
YUK JUN-SEO

853
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:48,555
<i>Contestants, we will now begin</i>

KIM JEONG-SU

857
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,441


858
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:03,320
<i>The female contestants are</i>
<i>already waiting for the male contestants</i>

859
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,864

<i>Gentlemen,</i>
<i>please head over to the location</i>

866
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,847
<i>where the woman</i>
<i>of your final choosing is waiting.</i>

867
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:39,773
<i>If the man who comes your way</i>
<i>is the man of your final choosing,</i>

868
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,526

<i>If the man who comes your way</i>
<i>is not the man of your final choosing,</i>

870
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:53,161
<i>then he will be left behind in Inferno.</i>

871
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,456
Now, we only have the final choosing left.

872
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,333
Shall we guess who will choose whom?

873
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,334
- Yeah.
- All right.

874
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,253
I'm not sure about You-jin's choice.

875
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,463
It's a mystery.

876
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,174
Theo might stay true to himself
until the very end.

877
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:10,721
Theo, Jun-seo, and Jeong-su
will all choose Si-an, right?

878
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:15,058
The main female contestant
on <i>Single's Inferno Season 4 </i>was Si-An.

879
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,977
We know she won't choose Theo.

880
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,605
I think Si-an will end up
choosing Jeong-su.

881
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,815
Still, Da-hee?

882
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,233
It's her personal wish.

883
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,570
No, that's not it. From my perspective,

884
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,156
Si-an is definitely drawn to Jun-seo,

885
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,658
but I think she will choose Jeong-su
in the end

886
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,244
since he makes her feel safe and at ease.

887
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:38,081
You see, I really do think
her endgame is Jun-seo.

888
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,083
- Yuk?
- Yuk!

889
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,502
I think she'll come full circle
and choose Yuk.

890
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,962
- Whoa, Yuk?
- I say Jun-seo.

891
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,297
What? Really?

892
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,841
I'd really like to take your side.

893
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,719
- No, you don't have to.
- Yeah, I'm not going to.

894
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,679
I'm not taking your side.

895
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,473
My bet's on Yuk Jun-seo as well.

896
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,642
We got everything wrong last season.

897
00:48:56,725 --> 00:49:00,187
Thing is, every season they always
end up choosing the safer option

898
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,314
during the final matching.

899
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:05,317
Si-an has been very true to herself
on this show.

900
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,321
I'm guessing she might end up choosing
someone who provides her stability

901
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:12,949
and who she has a higher chance
of being in a long-term relationship with.

902
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,210
<i>First to choose is Jang Theo.</i>

903
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,629
<i>Make your way over</i>
<i>to the woman of your choice.</i>

904
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,631

Theo was so admirable. The whole time.

909
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,602
He seems rather relaxed, doesn't he?

910
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,775
Go for it.

911
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,904

flashy today, Big Sis.

912
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:52,072

939

00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,008
I'd like to leave Inferno with…

1019
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,729
Gosh, I'm really not sure.

1020
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,190
Somehow, I just feel like
I'll struggle with him

1021
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,359
when we're on the outside if I pick him.

1022
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,777
So I'm not sure.

1023
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:01,347
Did she choose him? Wait.
She's got a sullen look on her face.

1024
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,397
Kim Te-hwan.

1025
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,275
Kim Te-hwan.

1026
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,112
She chose him.

1027
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:23,620
After having many conversations with him,
I didn't think we hit it off in every way.

1028
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,915
I was unsure of certain things,
but I wanted to trust his words.

1029
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,462
Seeing him be so devoted to me
throughout this experience,

1030
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,965
without looking elsewhere,
that was what drew me to him.

1031
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:39,844
You were so…

1032
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,180
Before you said it, you had that look.

1033
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,599
- Your lips were twitching.
- My lips?

1034
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,684
"I'm not satisfied."
That's how your face looked.

1035
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:47,935
"I'm not satisfied"?

1036
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,812
Wow, he nailed it.

1037
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,648
He actually caught that?

1038
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,691
Seriously.

1039
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,027
He's not clueless after all.

1040
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:59,155
Did I look like I was thinking,
"I'll choose you out of pity"?

1041
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:02,450
"Since I can't leave you alone here."
It kind of felt like that.

1042
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,414
Were you expecting me to choose you?

1043
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,749
- No.
- What? Really?

1044
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,293
- No, I expected you would.
- What the…

1045
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,587
How could you be that sure?

1046
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,965
Um, I'm someone
who's always full of certainty.

1047
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,093
Geez, Te-hwan. You're so smug.

1048
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,804
- Am I smug?
- Yeah. I wanna go back and pick again.

1049
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,139
It's too late now.

1050
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:52,834
A-rin, let's meet up on the outside.

1051
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,796
Sure. Let's…

1052
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,007
hang out and have fun together
on the outside.

1053
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,890
I'd like to leave Inferno with…

1054
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,984
Kook Dong-ho.

1055
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,527
Kook Dong-ho.

1056
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,907
- We all knew that.
- Dong-ho was popular,

1057
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,368
but A-rin seized and conquered.

1058
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:31,497
I'm thinking right now,
"This could possibly be fate."

1059
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,375
See you on the outside.

1060
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,836
I'm so happy.

1061
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,840
Right! Isn't she the one
that believes in fate?

1062
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,009
- Yeah, that's right.
- Don't those…

1063
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,261
- They even live close by.
- They live nearby.

1064
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,472
It's convenient for them to go on dates.

1065
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,224
- It'd be cool if they got married.
- Yeah.

1066
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,312
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1067
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,521
They're off.

1068
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,817
- It's hot.
- Yeah.

1069
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,369
Goodbye.

1070
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,039
I'll just stay behind right here.

1071
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,712
From beginning to end,
you were the one for me.

1072
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,506
I caught the "Dong-ho fever."

1073
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,180
Should we let go
since it's getting embarrassing?

1074
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:32,809
- They're glued together.
- Oh, they're glued together?

1075
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,655
We were in Inferno for such a long time.

1076
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,533
Let's leave together.

1077
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,246
Thank you for showing up
in the middle of all this.

1078
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,591
I'd like to leave Inferno with…

1079
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,304
An Jong-hoon.

1080
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,558
An Jong-hoon.

1081
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,354
Let's go.

1082
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,610
- Watch your step.
- Thanks.

1083
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:35,621
Bye, Inferno.

1084
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,863
Si-an.

1085
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:12,450
What I wanted to do
was show you my sincerity,

1086
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:15,328
and I wanted to see
your sincerity in return.

1087
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:18,915
I've checked those two things off my list,
so I have no regrets.

1088
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:19,832
Thank you.

1089
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,668
Every moment I spent with you
was a happy one.

1090
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,670
My voice is gone.

1091
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,796
I wish you happiness.

1092
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,016
Si-an.

1093
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,981
From the very beginning to the very end,

1094
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:47,151
nothing went according
to what my expectations had been

1095
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,986
for this experience.

1096
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:52,031
Through this whole process,
I was able to discover

1097
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,785
new sides to me
and I have you to thank for that.

1098
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:01,624
I'm so happy that I made so many
vulnerable and joyful memories with you.

1099
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,627
I feel bad that this is the end.

1100
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:11,342
I'm grateful that I made
so many memories with you. Thank you.

1101
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,473
Um…

1102
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,309
I've…

1103
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:25,022
Oh, ah… You know that I've liked you
from the very first time

1104
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,649
that you smiled at me.

1105
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:29,235
I still do.

1106
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:35,157
Whatever choice you end up making,

1107
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,411
I hope that it's a good one.

1108
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:46,252
She has an odd look on her face.

1109
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:55,219
Theo…

1110
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:01,183
Um, I smiled the most
whenever I was with you.

1111
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,479
I could sense
your sincere feelings towards me.

1112
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:08,649
Likewise, I hope you know
that I was sincere towards you.

1113
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:10,943
Let's be happy.

1114
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:13,571
I am.

1115
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:25,875
Jun-seo, I've felt all kinds of emotions
when I spent time with you.

1116
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:31,172
Emotions of sadness,
of happiness, and excitement too.

1117
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:44,435
I was so grateful when you took me
to Paradise for the first time.

1118
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:52,026
And I was so happy to have had
my last date in Paradise with you.

1119
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,741
You look good with your hair down.

1120
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:14,340
I'd like to leave Inferno with…

1121
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,240
Yuk Jun-seo.

1122
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,535
Yuk Jun-seo.

1123
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:34,962
- Gosh, it's an electrifying feeling.
- This is how it turned out in the end.

1124
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:37,339
She chose the person
who made her heart race.

1125
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,342
Yuk Jun-seo.

1126
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:52,271
Shall we?

1127
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:53,939
Let's go.

1128
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,774
You went through a lot.

1129
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,320
Thanks.

1130
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:14,585
- Farewell. I'm sure it was hard.
- Farewell.

1131
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:19,298
Look at those two guys left behind.

1132
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:22,343
- Yeah, it's crazy.
- Gosh, and Min-seol.

1133
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:27,431
Jun-seo, aren't you going to celebrate?

1134
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:29,391
- Celebrate? Celebrate?
- Yeah.

1135
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,310
You should run with me on your back.

1136
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,980
- Want me to?
- Of course.

1137
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,107
Hey!

1138
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,151
Ugh, are you insane?

1139
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,615
He's not even carrying her
like a princess.

1140
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,161
Oh…

1141
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,830
Are you crazy?

1142
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,166
Wait, my shoe.

1143
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,459
Where is it?

1144
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:57,044
Gosh…

1145
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:59,546
<i>♪ There is nowhere I would rather be ♪</i>

1146
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,464
Ah!

1147
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:04,009
<i>♪ Than here with all of you ♪</i>

1148
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,763
<i>♪ In our summer dreams ♪</i>

1149
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,434
<i>♪ In our summer… ♪</i>

1150
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:16,272
Okay, she wanted
this kind of romance, huh?

1151
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:20,901
It's over.

1152
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:23,112
This must've gone so fast for you.

1153
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:24,905
- Me?
- Yeah.

1154
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,783
It went by the fastest
when I was with you.

1155
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:30,494
- Really?
- Honestly, we had nothing at first.

1156
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:32,496
- Then in the middle…
- Yeah.

1157
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,999
We suddenly became drawn to each other

1158
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:38,127
while we were busy
getting on helicopters and stuff.

1159
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:44,258
I wonder how this happened.

1160
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:46,760
It's fascinating.

1161
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,680
How did things turn out this way?

1162
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:56,603
Well, if I am being honest with you,
it was a real whirlwind with Jun-seo.

1163
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:02,443
I felt a really wide range of emotions
whenever I was with Jun-seo.

1164
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:08,949
I felt excited, uneasy, awkward, bothered,
happy, and jealous than feeling at ease.

1165
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:13,329
But eventually, those emotions
reassured me that I wanted him.

1166
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:16,582
I'd like to go on a dessert date with…

1167
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,335
Yuk Jun-seo.

1168
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,964
You don't know how to treat a woman.

1169
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,135
Really? Is there a specific way?

1170
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,141
I kept saying I wanted to chat with you.

1171
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:35,642
- Ah, really? Why?
- Seriously.

1172
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,895
I said I wanted to have a chat with Si-an.

1173
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:40,773
My feelings for you have grown,
it's making me confused.

1174
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,233
You're gonna come here with me again.

1175
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:45,444
Because I'm gonna win tomorrow.

1176
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,210
Sleep some more, Jun-seo.

1177
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:04,213
- What time is it?
What?

1178
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:06,965
- I'm sleepy.
Let's sleep some more.

1179
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,259
Gosh, I'm still so tired.

1180
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,975
I need you to know

1181
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:23,565
the last date in Paradise
was just something I needed to do.

1182
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,819
But I'm more romantically drawn to…

1183
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,655
honestly, you, Jun-seo.

1184
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:39,915
I would like to go out with Jun-seo
when we're back in the real world.

1185
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:43,961
Will it happen? Yes.

1186
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:53,887
<i>The final person I chose</i>
<i>was Yuk Jun-seo.</i>

1187
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:58,684
From start to finish,
he made me laugh the most.

1188
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:04,189
And even up until the very end there,
when he was choosing,

1189
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,819
he still managed
to keep me on my toes.

1190
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:16,827
The final person I chose
was Kook Dong-ho.

1191
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:18,954
I'd like to say to him.

1192
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:21,957
"Be honest. You were a bit swayed
by me, right? Admit it."

1193
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,465
<i>I've been over Dong-ho</i>

1194
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:32,134
ever since I didn't get
to go to Paradise with him.

1195
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:36,889
So the person I ended up choosing
in the end was Kim Jeong-su.

1196
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:41,518
I just had the most in-depth conversations
with Jeong-su

1197
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:44,646
when we were in Paradise
on our trip together,

1198
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,983
<i>and we both treated each other</i>
<i>with respect.</i>

1199
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,448
All right.

1200
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,659
Like a midsummer rainstorm,

1201
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:00,370
we shared a whirlwind of emotions
in <i>Single's Inferno.</i>

1202
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:03,207
Four couples were born.
Congratulations to them all.

1203
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:05,083
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

1204
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:09,630
This season's contestants expressed
their emotions on a much deeper level

1205
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:10,964
than any other seasons.

1206
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:13,300
Thanks to them, we were able to be swayed

1207
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:16,094
and empathize with them
on a much deeper level.

1208
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:18,764
Regardless of this being a TV show,

1209
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:22,100
the contestants tried
to be very true to their emotions,

1210
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:26,146
which is why we probably reacted in an
excessive and rather aggressive manner.

1211
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:30,317
But I hope you know that we were
only being true to our emotions as well.

1212
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,153
I think everyone put their whole heart
into this season.

1213
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:36,698
- Even we felt that. Uh-huh.
- Yeah, we hope you could all feel it too.

1214
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:39,910
We are very sorry, everyone.

1215
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:43,622
- We were really being true to this show.
- We really were.
