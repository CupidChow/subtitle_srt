Um…

29
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,123
I've realized it's literally an inferno.

30
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,417
Ji-yeon.

31
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,503
She's alone?

32
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:12,257
Wait. Has anyone ever been left
completely alone there before?

33
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,050
No. This is a first.

34
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,301
She's all alone?

35
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,346
-Jin-young, you wanna go?
-I should head over.

36
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,556
[laughs]

37
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:24,561
Jun-seo stuck to his word and chose
someone with the qualities he wanted.

38
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,897
He chose the person
who seemed the most authentic.

39
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,275
Rather than someone
who's constantly flirting,

40
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,027
he's looking for someone
to have a normal conversation with.

41
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,488
Jeong-su and Hye-jin
probably chose each other

42
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,866
in an opposites attract kind of way?

43
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,243
Jeong-su seemed more at ease.

44
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,536
More than with Si-an?

45
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,291
With Hye-jin, he was more playful,
and it felt like he was taking initiative.

46
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,878
So, I think she could be more his type
than Si-an.

[Min-seol gasps] It's beautiful.

[Jun-seo] The vibe here's really nice.

52
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,728
[Min-seol] Wow.

53
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,440
I feel like I'm in a different world.
Unlike yesterday.

54
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,649
It's very different.

55
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,943
-We're suddenly in a city.
-[Jun-seo] Yeah.

56

It's making the experience
even more exciting.

57

-[Min-seol] True.
-Mm.

58
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,831
[Min-seol] If we hadn't matched,
you'd be sleeping in Inferno.

59
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,666
-That's true.
-Right?

60
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,669
But… I had a feeling I'd pair up
with someone today.

61
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,004
-[Min-seol] Really?
-Yeah.

62
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,380
-You did?
-Just a hunch.

63
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,299
-With me? Why?
-Yep.

64
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,552
-I mean… Oh.
-I thought our conversation flowed best.

65
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,511
I felt the same.

66
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,305
-[Jun-seo] You did?
-Yeah.

67
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,892
What I liked about you…
is that you didn't seem pretentious.

68
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,728
-You weren't putting on appearances…
-Oh, okay.

69
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,063
…just to move forward.

70
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,856
You did say I looked intimidating.

71
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,609
-[Jun-seo] You had your poker face on.
-[both chuckle]

72
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,780
But your personality and the way you spoke
was very down to earth.

73
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,697
I liked that.

74
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,952
Likewise, I felt the most comfortable
talking to you.

75
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:04,911
[Jun-seo] Yeah?

76
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:05,828
So…

77
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,332
I thought this could work,
but I wasn't sure.

78
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,250
[Jun-seo] Right.

79
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,877
-You only had two men to choose from.
-True.

80
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,004
I guess I got lucky then.

81
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,217
Yeah. You've been lucky
for two days in a row.

82
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,970
-You used up all your luck.
-I have? [chuckles]

-Geez, I'm in trouble then.
-[laughs]

84
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,848
You reap what you sow, as they say.

85
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,605
Should we talk now or after dinner?

86
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,731
Let's talk, then eat.

87
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,691
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

88
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,150
-Well…
-How old are you?

-Sure.

-Yeah.

-[gasps] I got it right!
-Yes.

00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,747

-[Min-seol] I did not.

95

You were behind me.

96
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,375
-No, it's just…
-What?

97
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,585
-You have that 28-year-old vibe.
-I do?

98
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,879
-Yeah.
-You don't think I look any younger?

99
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,339
I think 28 is young enough.

100
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,799
-You do?
-[Min-seol] Yeah.

101
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,594
-Is it my turn?
-[Min-seol] Uh-huh. Guess.

102
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,512
Twenty-four?

103
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,098
Hmm…

104
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,017
-Or 23?
-Twenty-three.

105
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,685
My birthday hasn't passed yet.

106
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,520
Jeez, you're so naive then.

107
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,941
-[clears throat]
-[Jun-seo] Gosh, you're so young.

108
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,901
-So?
-You could be the youngest here,

109
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,403
out of all the girls.

110
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,614
-Really?
-[Jun-seo] I think so. [chuckles]

111
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,991
Is that a good thing?

112
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,284
Sure, it's a good thing.

113
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,161
I'll drop the honorifics then.

114
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,078
Same here.

115
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,663
-No, you shouldn't.
-Why?

116
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,457
You can't because I'm older.

117
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,751
-That's absurd!
-It's not absurd.

119
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,129
I'm just messing with you.

120
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,380
Feel free to drop them.

121
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,257
-Let's keep it casual.
-All right.

122
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,719
Compared to yesterday,

123
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,013
Jun-seo's loosened up
and more like himself.

124
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,556
-I agree.
-[Jin-kyung] Yeah.

125
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,184
Oh, I forgot to ask you…

126
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,561
what do you do for work?

127
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,979
-[Min-seol] Right.
-Yeah.

128
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,606
[chuckles] Should I guess?

129
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,608
Maybe, instead say…

130
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,277
what job matches my vibe?

131
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,323
That's gonna be tough.
I have thought about it.

132
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,742
But I haven't been able to decide.

133
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,494
I could tell you were young,

134
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,580
but your voice is livelier
than other younger girls I know.

135
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,999
So I thought maybe you worked in sales.

136
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,836
For a second, yeah.
I thought you could work in sales.

137
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,754
Hmm.

138
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,632
-[Jin-kyung] "Sales."
-In sales?

139
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,175
Ex-soldiers are bad guessers.

141
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,471
Wow.

142
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,680
I'm…

143
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:31,974
a sportscaster.

144
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,810
-[Jun-seo] For real?
-Yeah. [laughs]

145
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,436
-I never would've guessed.
-Why?

146
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,604
-Really?
-No.

147
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,691
[Min-seol] I am a freelance announcer.

148
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,528
These days, I mostly do sportscasts.

149
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,908
Before every game, I research the teams
and their players.

150
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,913
After that, I take time to write a script
that is passionate and energetic,

151
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,874
which sets the tone
when I do my sportscast at the stadium.

152
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,337
They're on a winning streak
with 14 wins and 0 losses.

KIM MIN-SEOL
23 YEARS OLD, SPORTSCASTER

154
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,593
You mean you give live
commentaries on site?

155
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,387
-I do. What about you?
-What?

156
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,097
-What do you do?
-Me?

157
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,849
I draw.

158
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,725
-A cartoonist?
-[Jun-seo] No…

159
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,394
-I mean do you…
-No. I just…

160
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,855
-You're an artist?
-I draw on a canvas.

161
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,440
I draw on different surfaces

162
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,942
and I hold exhibitions
and things like that.

163
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,027
-Did you not expect that?
-I'm surprised.

164
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,487
-[Jun-seo] Really?
-Yeah.

165
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,948
My looks don't scream drawing.

166
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,535
Are you saying an artist placed first
in a physical game yesterday?

167
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,703
Strange, huh?

168
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,955
That makes no sense. Crazy.

169
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,124
-[Jun-seo] Anyway…
-An artist.

170
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,461
…I draw and then I hold exhibitions
every now and then of my work.

171
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,754
Hmm.

172
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,507
We were both pretty blindsided, huh?

173
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,926
-So different than we expected.
-Hmm.

174
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,012
I'm curious about your work.

175
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,221
-You're curious?
-Yeah.

176
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,599
-You should see my exhibition…
-Invite me.

177
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,975
I'm holding one this year.

178
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,602
-Really? When?
-Yeah.

179
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,353
Around December or November?

180
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,354
November?

181
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,440
-I was born in November.
-Yeah, November.

182
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,026
-When's your birthday?
-Why?

183
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,487
Should I expect one of your drawings
as a gift?

184
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,738
I'd have to visit you.

185
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,865
My art's a bit big.

186
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,117
-How big?
-Seven meters.

187
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,244
-[Min-seol] How big is that?
-It would be…

188
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,165
-Around…
-Like this big? As big as this table?

189
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,626
You think seven meters
is as big as this table?

190
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,129
-[laughs]
-What's Min-seol talking about?

191
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,633
-Min-seol?
-[Hanhae] She's not used to it.

192
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,593
-Is that even possible?
-Well, maybe…

193
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,970
-Maybe she misspoke?
-[Jin-kyung] You think?

194
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,681
-Around…
-Like this big? As big as this table?

195
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,226
You think seven meters
is as big as this table?

196
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,228
Is this…

197
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,188
How far did you get in school?

198
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,609
-Just tell me. Stop.
-Are you an elementary school graduate?

199
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,029
-It might be from that end to here.
-Come on. That can't be true.

200
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:50,947
Huh?

201
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,491
How do you draw?
With a ladder or something?

202
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,702
Yeah, I actually bought
a movable ladder just for that.

203
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,539
-Oh, you're serious? [gasps]
-It has a lift and wheels.

204
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,624
-I bought it for drawing.
-Really?

205
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,295
Then, I'll only buy two meters worth
of your seven-meter painting.

206
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,005
[both chuckling]

207
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,510
[laughs]

208
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,762
Jun-seo seems to be more at ease

209
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,098
compared to his date
with You-jin yesterday.

210
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:21,310
Yesterday, we could see heart emojis
in his eyes, today he's different.

211
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,520
[Kyuhyun] Yeah.

212
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:26,023
Come to think of it, he's gotten
more relaxed since his first date.

213
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,568
Back then, he seemed very uncomfortable,

214
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,196
but Min-seol's adorable demeanor
and openness have loosened him up.

215
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,907
Because Min-seol is showing him
her clumsy side.

216
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,160
Min-seol is naturally a talkative
and cheerful person,

217
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,707
that's why the conversation's been flowing
so organically between them.

218
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,042
-A lot of people like her.
-[Jin-kyung] Yeah.

219

PARADISE
KIM HYE-JIN & KIM JEONG-SU

220
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,800
[Jeong-su] How pretty.

221
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,176
[Hye-jin] It really is.

222
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,304
Wow.

223
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,225
-[Jeong-su] Like space.
-[Hye-jin giggles]

224
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,312
I didn't know there was a place like this.

225
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,314
We're speaking casually now.

226
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,899
[laughs] It happened naturally…

227
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,901
-Let's speak casually.
-Great.

228
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,902
Shall we? Okay.

229
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,282
Gosh, I love it here. Such a cool place.

230
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,450
I bet.

231
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,827
Since you were in Inferno yesterday.

232
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,830
Now that I'm here,
I know Paradise really is Paradise.

233
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,335
But you've already been,
so I guess you're not…

234
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,920
-It's my first time here.
-…as impressed as me.

235
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,797
No, that's not true. [chuckles]

236
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,633
You've backed me into a corner.

237
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,844
I like to start petty fights sometimes.

238
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,095
I'm like that too.

239
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,388
-You are?
-Yeah.

240
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,974
We might as well lean into it.

241
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,769
Yeah, otherwise we'll both end up losing.

242
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,978
[Jeong-su laughs]

243
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,229
When I look at you…

244
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:52,652
you seem like you'd be a fun target,
like, it'd be fun to watch you react.

245
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,195
I actually get that a lot.

246
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,780
-[Jeong-su] Do you?
-Yeah.

247
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,490
People say I'm fun to tease.

248
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,367
I don't get it. [giggles]

249
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,286
Maybe it's just your personality…

250
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,705
-Oh.
-…you take jokes well.

251
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,920
[Hye-jin] No way. It looks delicious.

252
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,923
[romantic music playing]

253
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,466
[Jeong-su] It looks so good.

254
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,592
[Hye-jin] Amazing.

255
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,637
[Jeong-su] What do you want first?

256
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,890
I want…

257
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:23,933
this one.

258
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,769
-Okay. This one.
-Yeah.

259
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,229
[both chuckle]

260
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,439
-No, give it.
-Wait, this is edible right?

261
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,983
-[Hye-jin] Either way, I want it.
-Sorry, my bad.

262
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,237
Thank you.

263
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,281
-One mushroom for you.
-Thank you.

264
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,616
-The garnish.
-[snickers]

265
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,911
A pretty woman deserves garnishing.

266
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,247
Oh, I'm… pretty?

267
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,290
[romantic music playing]

268
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,542
-Of course.
-Hmm.

269
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:52,837
Good to know.

270
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,049
But you knew that. You know you're pretty.

271
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,849
[snickering]

272
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,976
I wanna keep poking fun at you.

273
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,103
[both laughing]

274
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,020
Whatever.

275
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,443
Laughing makes my nostrils flair.

276
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,611
-[playful music playing]
-[laughs]

277
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,574
I think this might fit.

278
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,200
-Wanna try?
-They're big enough.

279
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,787
I don't normally give people permission
to do that.

280
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:32,293
You have a great personality.
You play along with any joke.

281
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,130
So…

282
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,257
[Hye-jin] Now then…

283
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,341
What?

284
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,926
It's time to guess.

285
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,556
-What do you think I do?
-I don't know. What do you do?

286
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,808
[both laughing]

287
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,186
Take a guess, go for it.

288
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,439
Hmm… Something like modeling.

289
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,356
Mm.

290
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,150
-Yeah?
-That's right.

291
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,277
[Jeong-su] You're a model.

292
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,572
[Hye-jin] I'm a professional model.

293
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,533
I'm 25 years old.

294
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:09,622
Most recently, I have been the face
of an eyewear brand for two years.

295
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,876
I also frequently shoot ads
for multiple beauty and fashion brands.

00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,928
-Let's try this one.
-Okay.

299
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,014
[Hye-jin] Thank you.

00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,607
[laughs]

303
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,028
Didn't Hye-jin mention
her habit of staring?

304
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:41,987
-Hmm.
-Right.

305
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,532
-She's using that to flirt.
-It was very slight.

306
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,703
The lights reflecting on the window
make it look like it's a starry night.

307
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,746
[Jeong-su] Right?

308
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,499
[Hye-jin] It's quite the vibe. Wow.

309
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,880
I wish we could just call it
happily ever after now,

310
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,091
-but we have to go back.
-[sighs] Right.

311
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,426
-I had forgotten all about that.
-Right?

312
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,803
It slipped our minds.

313
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,014
[Jeong-su] I'm worried about going back.

314
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,516
-Worried?
-[Jeong-su] Yeah.

315
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,103
I'm half excited, half worried,
to be honest.

316
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,604
I get that.

317
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,189
-But don't you worry.
-I'm not.

318
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,857
-Enjoy this moment.
-Yeah.

319
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,109
[Hye-jin giggles]

320
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,117
-Jeong-su surprised me big time.
-For sure.

321
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,828
The fact that a person can give off
different energies

322
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,871
left an impression.

323
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,080
True.

324
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,624
Him talking about "happily ever after"
shocked me.

325
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,835
Yesterday, he wanted to go back, explore,

326
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,921
but today, he's content
with the woman in front of him.

327
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,090
I feel like they were just empty words.

328
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,843
-Pure vibes?
-[Kyuhyun] That could be the case, no?

329
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:49,430
In my opinion,
Jeong-su isn't easily attracted

330
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,349
to someone
who's obviously trying to impress him.

331
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,061
He did call Hye-jin a weirdo earlier,

332
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,064
so I think that means
she at least piqued his curiosity.

333
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,191
But that's just my opinion.

334
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,945
Honestly, I can't get a read on him.
He's hard to figure out.

335
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,032
I just hope he gets wasted
at least one time.

336
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,993
-He might be a light-weight.
-Yes, to see his true colors.

337
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,996
Let's join in, get him wasted,
and then see how he acts.

It's really nice.

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,144
That's the most conservative swimsuit
I've seen.

346
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,604
[laughs]

347
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,981
I've never seen one
with a jacket attached.

348
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,234
[calming music playing]

349
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,152
It's warm.

350
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,782
-I started out in Inferno, you know.
-[Jun-seo] Yeah.

351
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:50,699
So I love this.

352
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,034
-[Jun-seo] You do?
-Yeah.

353
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,285
[chuckles]

354
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,751
I've been meaning to ask what this is.

355
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,710
-This?
-Yeah.

356
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,796
-[Jun-seo] It's just a bracelet.
-Really?

357
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,173
-My wrist was missing something.
-It's pretty.

358
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,842
-So pretty.
-Yeah.

359
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,345
It says Min-seol here.

360
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,430
[playful music playing]

361
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,348
ONE HOUR AGO

362
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,976
Did you have any idea
who I was going to choose?

363
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,395
-Hye-jin.
-Hye-jin?

364
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,479
-Yup.
-Who is that?

365
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,482
-Do you really not know her?
-No, really.

366
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,776
-Or you're playing?
-She's the one with you?

367
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,027
Yeah.

368
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,988
And who was the person next to her?

369
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,531
Ji-yeon.

370
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,283
Ji-yeon?
Geez, these names are all so similar.

371
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,494
That's why you had to write my name here.

372
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,705
Your name's the only one that's different.

373
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,789
Whatever.

374
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,833
Your name's the only one that's unique.

375
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,002
Let me see.

376
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,170
You still need it written on your palm?

377
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,422
-Wipe it off now.
-Gosh.

378
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,298
Hey, what's your surname, anyway?

379
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,427
Guess.

380
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,804
-It's Kim.
-Right.

381
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,472
Don't play with me.

382
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,516
I wrote it down earlier, I remember it.

383
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,767
Seriously.

384
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,103
-I guess you're comfortable with me.
-Why?

385
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,689
-Do you always speak like this?
-Like what?

386
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,443
"Hey, you coming? Or not?"
Do you talk like that to the others?

387
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,361
-Should I fix that?
-Huh? I do that?

388
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,488
Would you speak to a girlfriend that way?

389
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,489
-Yeah.
-You would?

390
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,407
-For real?
-Hmm.

391
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,410
-Should I change that?
-Well…

392
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,203
Wouldn't it be kind of weird?

393
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,414
Say it like… "Have you done it?"

394
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,915
-"Have you?"
-"Have you?"

395
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,042
Don't make that face.

396
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,085
-"Have you?"
-[laughs]

397
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,297
-Forget it.
-I knew it, it's too weird.

398
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,758
-It looks wrong.
-I told you, I know myself.

399
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,134
-Do you?
-Mm.

400
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,345
-If you try to change how you talk…
-Yeah.

401
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,222
-…you might feel awkward.
-Exactly.

402
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,391
And it'll make it harder for you to speak.

403
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,810
That's true.
Did it sound unpleasant to you?

404
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,023
I didn't think it was unpleasant.
At least not for me,

405
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,525
-but the others might be like…
-Hmm.

406
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,778
-"Gosh. What's with this guy?"
-Ah.

407
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,947
-But I'm okay with it.
-[Jun-seo] Good.

408
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,493
When you go out…

409
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,288
I imagine that
you'd be pretty popular, right?

410
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,206
-Why?
-Huh?

411
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,291
-Why? Only you think that.
-Well, your…

412
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,960
-Your presence is very unique.
-[Min-seol] You think?

413
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,129
I've personally never met anyone like you.

414
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,173
-You're joking.
-Good thing you're here.

415
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,050
Should I come to Paradise every day?

416
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,636
-I hope I do.
-Same.

417
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,056
-But everyone else is so charming.
-Hmm.

418
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,058
Maybe only you see me like that.

419
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,184
That could be true.

420
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,564
I guess we should come back together then.

421
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,650
-If it turns out that way…
-[chuckles]

422
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,567
yeah we could.

423
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,277
Admit it, it's nice.

424
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,154
I'm so happy.

425
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,782
[both chuckling]

426
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,701
-I feel the same.
-[Min-seol] Right?

427
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,876
The vibe I'm getting here is,

428
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,546
"Chillin' at the bathhouse
with a close guy friend."

429
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,256
[laughs]

430
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,928
Compared to when Jun-seo was with You-jin,
who happens to be closer to his age,

431
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,641
right now it feels like he's trying to act
more mature with Min-seol.

432
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,309
He's treating her like a sister.

433
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:08,814
What I gather from them is that their
interaction feels like a Gen Z romance.

434
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,067
It may not be lovey-dovey or anything,

435
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,737
but they might just be sharing
all their intimate feelings…

436
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,198
in their own special way.

437
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,493
I do feel that from Min-seol.
She's obviously excited.

438
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,874
Her perception of him being comfortable
around her is a bit off.

439
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,959
Her whole, "Have you done it?" convo…

440
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,170
Do people talk to each other like that?

441
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,006
Personally, if you ask me,
I find it really annoying…

442
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,300
-that bluntness.
-"You eating it?"

443
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,968
[laughs]

444
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,553
Instead of "Are you going to…"

445
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,763
Guys usually talk like that
with other guys.

446
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,848
Something like that.

447
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,933
It probably comes naturally to him.

448
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,311
I can guarantee
that not one woman in Korea

449
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,688
would like a man who speaks like that.

450
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,274
That way of speaking
is definitely a turn-off.

451
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,610
She should be like,
"Have you done so-and-so?

452
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,446
-Have you had a bite to eat?"
-That's how elders speak.

453
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,572
"Have you eaten?"

454
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,158
Speaking like an elder
is better than being blunt.

455
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,869
No amount of cuteness can forgive
something so blunt.

456
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,455
[Jin-kyung]
"Da-hee, my darling, have you eaten?"

457
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,875
MEN'S INFERNO

458
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,169
[You-jin] Oh,
that's where you get the water.

459
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,421
[Dong-ho] It's my first time
going at night.

460
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,131
[You-jin] No way. Look at that!

461
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,427
-[You-jin] Look at the moon, it's so red.
-[Dong-ho] Yeah, it is!

462
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,514
[romantic music playing]

463
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,106
Your eyelashes are really thick and long.

464
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:38,070
Since the lights are right above us,
I can see them more clearly.

465
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,865
-I do get asked if I get my lashes done.
-I get why.

466
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,992
-Totally.
-They're full, like broomsticks.

467
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,788
Are eyelashes like mine something that…

468
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,915
-I'm envious.
-Oh, you're… envious?

469
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:50,832
I envy them.

470
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,750
I see.

471
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,587
[quirky music playing]

472
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,467
This side of your face
feels different from the other.

473
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,386
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

474
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,639
The left side of your face
looks a bit manlier,

475
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,976
but your right side kind of has
a dainty, pretty feel to it.

476
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,894
-Is that so?
-[You-jin] Yeah.

477
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,357
My face is a little asymmetrical,
just like you mentioned.

478
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,609
I'm honestly surprised you noticed it.

479
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,194
-Really?
-[Dong-ho] Yeah.

480
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,531
-The sides don't look asymmetrical though.
-My overall image?

481
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,910
-They just give off different vibes.
-You're very detail-oriented.

482
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,871
-I think so too.
-[Dong-ho] You have a keen eye.

483
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,874
I am very perceptive
when it comes to my senses.

484
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,044
Perhaps you prefer a certain side?

485
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,255
Hmm…

486
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,715
Well, to be clear,

487
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,303
I don't think this has anything to do
with which side is more or less handsome.

488
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,305
All right, I'll help you decide by--

489
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,016
You can show me this side once,
then that side once.

490
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,977
-Turning my face both ways.
-[laughs] Yeah, sure.

491
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,105
Your conversations
make the person you're with

492
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,857
feel comfortable and entertained.

493
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,400
-They do?
-[Dong-ho] Yeah.

494
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,319
Oh?

495
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:05,324
I guess it mistook me for the light
because I sparkle. [laughs]

496
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,992
[snickers]

497
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:13,123
Making remarks like, "Because I sparkle,"
without batting an eye is just so Gen Z.

498
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,959
We Gen X kids got told off
if we acted like that.

499
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,088
I guess it mistook me for the light
because I sparkle.

500
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,214
[laughs]

501
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,551
Hey, you were supposed
to finish my sentence for me!

502
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:28,138
I meant to, but I couldn't come up
with a flattering line to say.

503
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,224
I could tell you were caught off guard.

504
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,435
-I'm usually better with words.
-It's just…

505
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,436
[chuckles]

506
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,521
-[You-jin] The moth.
-But you were quick.

507
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,691
I felt embarrassed so I had to jump in.

508
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,069
I'll call over another moth later.

509
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,487
-Okay.
-We'll try it again.

510
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,657
-[You-jin] Shall we head out?
-[Dong-ho] Sure.

511
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,870
[You-jin] Standing next to you,
you're really tall.

512
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,246
-[Dong-ho] I'm tall?

00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,785
-How have you all been?
-Hello.

685
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,329
-How have you all been?
-Hello.

686
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:31,639
[Jeong-su] When my eyes met with Si-an's,
she had the biggest smile on her face.

687
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,061
I felt somewhat apologetic in a way.

688
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,689
But at the same time,
I was glad to see her.

689
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,442
I definitely felt mixed emotions.

690
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,113
[Jeong-su] I have to admit I was feeling
a bit flustered at first.

691
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,535
[Jun-seo panting]

692
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,122
[thrilling music playing]

693
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,585
Where do we sit?

694
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,211
-Hello.
-Hello.

695
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,631
[Si-an] Wait,
why do they look so good together?

696
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,424
Both with their curly locks.

697
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,801
[laughs]

698
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,014
-Hello.
-[Te-hwan] Hello.

699
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,475
Great to see you all.

700
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,185
Yeah, everyone's here.

701
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,020
Finally, we're all here together.

702
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,196
[You-jin] I have to admit,
seeing him return from Paradise

703
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,989
with another woman by his side…

704
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,283
it soured my mood just a bit.

705
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,576
It really did.

706
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,631
-[sighs] They're all finally in one place.
-[Jin-young] Yeah.

707
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,094
I can tell that Si-an is clearly
more drawn toward Jeong-su than Theo.

708
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,011
[Hanhae] Yeah.

709
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,181
Look at her,
she's straining her neck to face him.

710
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,432
[laughs]

711
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,393
And Si-an was smiling with her eyes.

712
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,772
Her eyes have a sense of longing in them.
And the Infernos have merged.

713
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,148
Some have never met, right?

714
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,526
Te-hwan was kind of sending signals
to Ji-yeon

715
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,528
when they were sitting there talking.

716
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,114
Well, after Te-hwan heard
that Ji-yeon was alone…

717
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,658
But wasn't he kind of hilarious?

718
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,828
He had this nonchalant act going on.

719
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,162
Oh, yeah, he did.

720
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,080
You felt it too?

721
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,000
He tried to sell it, but it was too stiff.

722
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,963
[Jin-kyung] Look at him sitting there.
He looks so pale and emotionless.

723
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,841
I just want to see
his individuality shine through.

724
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,175
[laughs]

725
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,096
-[Min-seol] I have so many questions.
-[Ji-yeon] Me too.

726
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,765
The two of you went to Paradise first,
right?

727
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,309
I'm dying to know
what your experiences were like.

728
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,519
[You-jin] Uh…

729
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,437
[laughs]

730
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:48,151
We… I mean, I got to talk to him a lot
and get to know him during our time there.

731
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:52,030
So it was just a really fun
and pleasant experience.

732
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,074
-It was nice.
-Must've been fun.

733
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,870
They were basically like,

734
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,998
"We talked a lot.
That was all that happened."

735
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,375
I had a feeling
there was nothing more to it.

736
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,255
-[Ji-yeon] I'm curious with yours.
-Me?

737
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,507
-Since we chose the same guy.
-Oh, right.

738
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,094
[Si-an] Hold on,
let's have you two facing each other.

739
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,346
I really didn't know he'd pick me!

740
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,348
[Min-seol] I had no idea.

741
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:25,772
My experience sounds similar,
come to think of it. We talked a lot.

742
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,234
Oh, listening to you both talk
reminded me of something…

743
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,237
My first impression of him here
was different

744
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,781
than he was in Paradise.

745
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,240
-[Min-seol] Jun-seo?
-Yes.

746
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,410
[You-jin] He was a completely
different person.

747
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:45,374
So I warned him that the other girls
might still be a little scared of him.

748
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,501
He still scares me.

749
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,421
When you were carrying your bag together,
I thought he said, "You carry this,"

750
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,131
-and made you do it.
-[girls] Ah!

751
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,716
He looks so intimidating.

752
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,595
About that, he got pretty bad
motion sickness on our way back.

753
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,222
And he was struggling a lot so…

754
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,850
-Slow down, guys!
-Slow down?

755
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,227
Forefront, slow. I, mean…

756
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,813
Guys. He's asking you to slow down,
he's worn out.

757
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,356
[chuckles] "Forefront, slow."

758
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,857
[Hanhae] "Forefront, slow."

759
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,568
-Must be military jargon.
-We used it in the military.

760
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,570
-"Forefront, slow"?
-"Forefront, slow."

761
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,239
Forefront, slow.

762
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,950
Guys, he's asking you to slow down,
he's worn out.

763
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,994
-Guys? He wants you to slow down.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

764
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:22,912
He's tired.

765
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,165
-He asked me to help him.
-[laughing]

766
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,542
Gosh, he's so…

767
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,460
He's different. I told you.

768
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,422
With his muscles and intimidating looks,
I can't imagine him asking for help.

769
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,091
[Min-seol] He was so fun though.

770
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,968
Yeah, exactly. He's so funny.

771
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,553
-Really funny.
-He's hilarious.

772
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,513
-I can't imagine that.
-He really is.

773
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,560
I honestly never really thought of her
as my rival.

774
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,772
It seemed like he had much more fun
with me in Paradise,

775
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,568
so that made me feel
a little better about the situation.

776
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,862
I am a bit annoyed.

777
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,531
Maybe it's because I was with him last.

778
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,199
But she isn't much of a threat.

779
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,786
I'm the last person
he went to Paradise with.

780
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,038
[laughter]

781
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,126
-I'm glad they're both happy.
-[Jin-young] Same.

782
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,587
[laughing]

783
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,008
Oh, I'm curious, Si-an.

784
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,177
I wanna hear your thoughts.

785
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,637
-We went with the same person.
-That's true.

786
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,972
Well…

787
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,851
In the helicopter,
I kept getting motion sickness.

788
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,520
So he kept massaging
this pressure point for me.

789
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,439
-[girls gasp]
-No way!

790
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,610
He kept doing it
until we arrived in Paradise.

791
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,819
[You-jin] Oh, nonstop?

792
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,072
[Si-an] I said I was fine,
but he kept on massaging.

793
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,407
He kept going?

794
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:45,411
I couldn't stop thinking
about the massaging, even today.

795
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,746
Massaging!

796
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,623
It made my heart skip a beat.

797
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,333
Wow!

798
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,835
-It's been heating up from day one!
-They have.

799
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,671
Hmm, I guess they have been, haven't they?

800
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,882
So crazy.

801
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,467
This guy's making moves.

802
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,010
[laughter]

803
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,262
But wait. Don't tell me…

804
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,265
-He's good, I'll give him that.
-[Min-seol] "Good"?

805
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,434
Did he massage you too?

806
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,228
No, he didn't do that,

807
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:14,190
but I definitely had similar experiences
with him while I was there.

808
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,359
He just kept taking care of me, you know?

809
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,569
[Hye-jin] He's got good manners.

810
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:22,531
And we kept teasing each other,
we were constantly joking around.

811
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,450
[You-jin] You were being playful.

812
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,913
When it comes to dating,

813
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,499
I like relationships
that feel like friendships.

814
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,710
And I felt that vibe with Jeong-su,

815
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,296
which made our interaction
feel really natural.

816
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,384
But after having that chat with Si-an,

817
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:46,389
I noticed there were similarities
in the way he behaved towards both of us.

818
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,356
-[Hye-jin] What?
-[Jeong-su] Hey.

819
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,275
Shouldn't we wake up now?

820
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:04,240
[Hye-jin] He seems really caring,
and also very gentle.

821
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,787
[exclaiming]

822
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,999
I felt like I needed
to step back and observe more.

823
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,170
If you were thinking of that interaction
even today,

824
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,465
does that mean you had
less chemistry with the new guy?

825
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,010
[Min-seol] The one next to you earlier?

826
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,011
[Si-an] Yeah, him.

827
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,014
Well, he has an odd personality.

828
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,224
He's charming in his own way.

829
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:35,646
-The massages gave you butterflies?
-He was the one on your mind.

830
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,982
You couldn't help
but think of him even today.

831
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,067
…because he didn't massage your hands.

832
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,365
The massaging wins.

833
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,411
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, my goodness.
-[Min-seol] So it begins.

834
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,958
When I went to Paradise with Theo,

835
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,878
I was actually quite underwhelmed
the whole time…

836
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,715
because he just kept constantly
professing his love and stuff.

837
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:07,803
So honestly, none of what he was saying
seemed particularly sincere to me.

838
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,472
Well…

839
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,808
[Kyuhyun] Ah… I see.

840
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,978
Theo is overly confident right now.

841
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,356
He thinks that she's already
fallen for him.

842
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,983
Just look at his awful
wedding invitation jokes.

843
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,194
I know, but as far as I can tell,

844
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,155
Si-an seems to be
on a completely different page than Theo.

845
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,741
What if he keeps up
with these professions of love?

846
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,785
-[laughs]
-Then there's no hope for him.

847
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,911
It'll look tacky.

848
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,497
-I have a feeling he won't stop.
-Me too.

849
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,041
I wonder what Jeong-su is really like
as a person.

850
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,752
Those gestures could just be
his way of flirting, no?

851

00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,216
I should know. It's PTSD kicking in.

1194
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,175
[Kyuhyun] Oh.

1195
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,052
He probably hates cold water.

1196
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,429
Oh, this is so nerve-wracking.

1197
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,477
[Master] Bae Ji-yeon,
you may start once the signal sounds.

1198
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,146
Whoo!

1199
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,149
Ready…

1200
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:25,650
[whistle blows]

1201
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:28,778
[Ji-yeon] Oh.

1202
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:29,779
[gasps]

1203
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,947
[screams]

1204
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,033
[thrilling music playing]

1205
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,620
[screaming]

1206
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,010
-[hosts exclaiming]
-[Da-hee] For real?

1207
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,344
What's up with him?

1208
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,305
He's used up most of his strength.

1209
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,806
-Jun-seo…
-How could he?

1210
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,725
He was just standing still.

1211
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,769
[screaming]

1212
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,354
[girls laughing]

1213
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,274
The way I see it,
number one is the problem!

1214
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,651
[Master] Bae Ji-yeon, you have failed.

1215
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:10,653
Did you throw her?

1216
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:14,073
-Oh, dammit.
-You guys really fell.

1217
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,993
-[Min-seol] This way. To the left.
-[Ji-yeon] It's nuts.

1218
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,536
[Min-seol] He's unbelievable.

1219
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,662
Oh, no. Are you okay?

1220
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,499
-You all right?
-Yeah, are you okay?

1221
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:26,961
This time, Jun-seo was trying
his best to protect Ji-yeon as they fell.

1222
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,380
-He used his arms…
-[Jin-young] That's true.

1223
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,300
[Ji-yeon] Still, you kept trying
to hold me up. Amazing.

1224
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,970
They fell in together
in a very romantic way.

1225
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,013
[Min-seol] Yeah.

1226
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,433
Someone switch with me.
I'm feeling the pressure here.

1227
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,392
[men laughing]

1228
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,353
-Take it slow.
-[Jun-seo] Okay.

1229
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,104
Man, this is so humiliating.

1230
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,439
[Jeong-su laughs]

1231
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:47,815
Well…

1232
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,609
[Kyuhyun] Jun-seo's losing steam.

1233
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,195
-It's looking bad for him.
-[Da-hee] I know.

1234
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,447
-He's embarrassed himself.
-[Kyuhyun] Yes.

1235
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,366
[indistinct chatter]

1236
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,243
[giggles]

1237
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,203
NUMBER 6, KIM A-RIN

1238
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,081
I'm feeling super nervous
seeing the two before me fall.

1239
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:05,750
[whines]

1240
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,002
Take it slow.

1241
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,588
-It's slippery.
-I'll go slow, I don't wanna fall.

1242
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,757
Man, I'm nervous.

1243
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,175
[Jeong-su] All of a sudden.

1244
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,594
You're soaked anyway. [chuckles]

1245
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,806
-Ambitions aside.
-Take it slow, okay?

1246
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,268
[Master] Kim A-rin, ready…

1247
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,603
Ready…

1248
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,190
[whistle blows]

1249
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,483
Off I go.

1250
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,361
-Pretend I'm not here.
-No, it's comforting.

1251
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:34,862
[laughs]

1252
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,449
[squeals] Hold me.

1253
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,120
[squeals] Hold me.

1254
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,581
[water splashes]

1255
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:45,999
Hold me.

1256
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,046
Oh, no, not again!

1257
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,173
-[Jin-young yells]
-[cracking up]

1258
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,302
-He threw her.
-He tried pushing her back onto the log.

1259
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,596
[laughing]

1260
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,764
This is not good. I feel bad for Jun-seo.

1261
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,141
Who could've imagined?

1262
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,183
[squeals] Hold me.

1263
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,184
[girls scream]

1264
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,645
[Si-an] So you are the problem!

1265
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,230
[laughs]

1266
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,065
[Si-an] So you are the problem!

1267
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,777
[A-rin] Wow, just wow.

1268
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,988
[Master] Kim Arin, you have failed.

1269
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,781
[laughing]

1270
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,117
How on earth did you walk past him?

1271
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,745
-He was the real problem.
-[Min-seol] How did you?

1272
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:26,039
[Master] Kim Arin, you have failed.

1273
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:30,043
-Are you okay?
-I'm going home.

1274
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,003
[laughter]

1275
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,963
[Jun-seo] Man, how refreshing is this?

1276
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,467
-I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.
-It's all right.

1277
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,719
At least he falls in before her.

1278
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:40,845
I fell by myself.

1279
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,598
[Dong-ho] These three failed, huh?

1280
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:48,561
[Master] As for the women's game
for dessert and iced Americanos…

1281
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:54,192
In third place, Kim Hye-jin, with a time
of 1 minute, 7.5 seconds.

1282
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,485
Oh, one minute.

1283
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,405
[Master] Second…

1284
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,992
[upbeat music playing]

1285
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,792
Chung You-jin, with 49.12 seconds.

1286
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,211
-[Min-seol] She's fast.
-[Jeong-su] That's fast.

1287
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,672
What? If she got 49 seconds…

1288
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,841
[Master] And in first place,
Lee Si-an, with 20 seconds.

1289
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,176
Whoa!

1290
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,969
-Just 20?
-[Min-seol] Wow.

1291
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,221
Twenty seconds.

1292
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,806
-[gasps]
-What in the…

1293
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,057
-She crushed it.
-Mm.

1294
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,643
Will it be Theo or Jeong-su?

1295
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,353
I think she'll choose Jeong-su.

1296
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:33,189
[Jin-kyung] Si-an is leaning
towards Jeong-su for sure.

1297
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:38,528
[Master] Lee Si-an,
you may now choose the man

1298
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:40,822
that you would like
to go on the date with.

1299
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,450
I'd like to go on the dessert date with…

1300
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:48,287
[tense music playing]

1301
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,297
Um…

1302
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,346
I was expecting her to choose me.

1303
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:09,016
We connected on an emotional level,
and we clicked in so many ways.

1304
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,978
I believe Si-an will continue to like me.

1305
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,605
Baseless confidence
is what drives me in life.

1306
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,068
I'd like to go on the dessert date with…

1307
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:21,571
Let's see…

1308
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,115
[sighs]

1309
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:27,076
["At Last" by Troy Tang and Jasmine
playing]

1310
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,161
Yuk Jun-seo.

1311
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,371
[Si-an] Yuk Jun-seo.

1312
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,625
[Si-an] Yuk Jun-seo.

1313
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,553
[Master] Lee Si-an has chosen Yuk Jun-seo.
