SINGLE'S INFERNO

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,012
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

17
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:55,680
Lee Si-an.

18
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,065
<i>Lee Si-an.</i>

19
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,610
No way.

20
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,487
- <i>Lee Si-an.</i>
<i>- </i>What?

21
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,613
See! I told you.

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,532
Oh…

23
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,911
- She got excited too soon.
- He's solidifying it.

24
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:21,247
If he was gonna do this,
why'd he ask her in the first place?

25
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,625
He got Min-seol all excited for nothing.

26
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,504
This just means Si-an
is the one who has his heart.

27
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,216
- No way.
- My hands are sweaty.

28
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,551
- Have fun again.
- Seriously.

29
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,262
Whoa, that's crazy.

30
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,264
I've got goosebumps.

31
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,602
Gosh.

32
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,983
Let's go.

33
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,362
- Right away?
- Yeah, right now.

34
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,279
Okay.

35
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,533
All black.

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,582
Wow, Paradise two days in a row.

37
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,751
I wonder what we're doing today.

38
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,920
- Something different.
- You think?

39
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,296
- Yeah.
- I hope so.

40
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,057
You said I'd be the one to go this time!

41
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,143
- I really thought so.
- I know.

42
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,602
I mean, they went yesterday.

43
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,312
I thought it'd be me.

44
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,024
I was sure since they just went,
but I guess was wrong.

45
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,442
What's happening?

46
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,903
I can't wait to see
who Jeong-su will choose.

47
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,072
I know. Since Si-an's already taken.

48
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,495
<i> Next is the second-place winner,</i>
<i>Kim Jeong-su.</i>

49
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,958
<i>Please choose the person</i>
<i>you'd like to go to Paradise with.</i>

50
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,086
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

51
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,923
I wonder what he'll do now.

52
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,259
- He's gone pale.
- Who will he choose?

53
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,223
- I wonder who Jeong-su will choose.
- Hae-lin?

54
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,350
- Hae-lin.
- Hae-lin or Hye-jin.

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,394
It's Hae-lin.

56
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,480
Two guys went with her before,
he didn't get one-on-one time.

57
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,529
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

58
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,575
Chung You-jin.

59
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,244
- <i>Chung You-jin.</i>
- What?

60
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,372
- Huh?
- What?

61
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,582
- What?
- Huh?

62
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,292
You-jin?

63
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,003
<i>Chung You-jin.</i>

64
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,214
<i>Chung You-jin.</i>

65
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,676
Hurry up! Just go on.

66
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,678
You've packed your stuff?

67
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,972
- Good thing you dressed up.
- Go, go, go.

68
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,099
- Have fun there.
- What is this?

69
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,184
Unreal.

70
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,813
Gosh, I guess Jeong-su must've thought
I was a lot of fun yesterday.

71
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,815
Was she that fun?

72
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,110
She must've been super fun
if he picked her this time.

73
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,862
You-jin's cheerful.

74
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,742
Well, if I chose Hae-lin or Hye-jin,

75
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,245
they might sense my uneasiness.

76
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,665
If I had chosen one of them,

77
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,209
I felt like I would've needed
to apologize to them

78
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,336
for being my second choice, in a way.

79
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,049
So I just wanna go with You-jin
'cause she's fun to be with.

80
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,558
- Hi.
- Hi.

81
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,476
Let's go.

82
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,895
Let's go, Donald Duck.

83
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,855
- May I?
- What? It's okay…

84
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,108
- The heavy one.
- It's not that heavy.

85
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,859
- Oh, then…
- Not too heavy, right?

86
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,945
- I'll still carry it for you.
- Thank you.

87
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,782
- This is insane.
- Wow.

88
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,867
You-jin must be shocked.

89
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,036
Like, "Why me?"

90
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,831
Wow, it's getting really fun.

91
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:50,999
I know, right?

92
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,961
<i> Lastly, the third-place winner,</i>
<i>Kim Te-hwan.</i>

93
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,634
I'm wondering
if he'll choose Ji-yeon or not.

94
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,470
And if he doesn't,
then I'll be even more curious.

95
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:13,896
I didn't think I should be the one going
to Paradise with him today.

96
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,691
We just went to Paradise yesterday,

97
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:20,069
so it would be better for us
to confirm our feelings for each other

98
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,448
by taking it easy,
rather than going there twice in a row.

99
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,829
I think Te-hwan will choose Ji-yeon again,
despite all that she's been telling him.

100
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:30,788
- You think?
- Yeah.

101
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,374
To be honest,
he doesn't have any other options.

102
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,292
He doesn't.

103
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,420
No one else
has had even the thing with Te-hwan.

104
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,047
- No one.
- No one.

105
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,465
There's no one!

106
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,677
I'd like to go to Paradise
with Bae Ji-yeon.

107
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,220
- <i>Bae Ji-yeon.</i>
- What?

108
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,517
- I knew it.
- Wow.

109
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,937
Now this should be a good thing
for her, obviously.

110
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,608
- You think she'll be happy?
- Yeah. Right, she should be.

111
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,151
-<i> Bae Ji-yeon.</i>
- What?

112
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,910
I'm not curious about pursuing anyone here
other than Ji-yeon.

113
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,747
I don't think I'd enjoy Paradise
with anyone else.

114
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:20,797
- Hi.
- Hi.

115
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,756
Hi.

116
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,673
Oh…

117
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,591
Oh, thanks.

118
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,680
I gave it a lot of thought,
but it was just…

119
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,598
Go on.

120
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,102
Didn't wanna mess
with your head.

121
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,648
His feelings for her are solid.

122
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,691
This will seal the deal for Ji-yeon.

123
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,611
Choosing her despite suggesting
he choose someone else,

124
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,738
well, that's the cherry on top.

125
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,697
You think so?

126
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,908
Judging by what Ji-yeon said earlier,

127
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,536
I think Te-hwan
might've made the wrong decision.

128
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,995
Really? In what sense?

129
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,624
She needed to take a step back
to see what's she's feeling.

130
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,127
She say what she needed
in a roundabout way

131
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,711
without hurting his feelings.

132
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,340
But now that Te-hwan has chosen her again,

133
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,468
they're going to spend more time together,
which means…

134
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,680
she's not going to get that space
she's been needing.

135
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,808
This could make things
a bit uncomfortable for Ji-yeon?

136
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,895
As far as Ji-yeon's concerned,
I think she would've been fine regardless.

137
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,857
Whether she got chosen or not,
she would've been fine.

138
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,275
Yeah.

139
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,446
Anyhow, Jun-seo is going back to Paradise
with Si-an once again.

140
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,408
I do think today's trip
will solidify things for Si-an as well.

141
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,287
They might end up having
the best chemistry in Paradise today.

142
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,538
Yeah.

143
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,081
I'm concerned for Min-seol.

144
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,417
Imagine how whiny she'll become.

145
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,627
I have a feeling
she'll complain.

146
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,545
True.

147
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,934
I even picked a pretty outfit.

148
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,437
I'm going to lunch in this.
I refuse to change.

149
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,148
It really is pretty,
and it screams Paradise.

150
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,609
Seriously, I thought
I would be going today.

151
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,986
I saved this outfit for Paradise!

152
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,364
- Change already.
- I told you she'd get whiny.

153
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,868
When she speaks,
it's almost like a bird chirping.

154
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,912
- Oh, dear.
- She's adorable.

155
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,415
I saved this outfit for Paradise!

156
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,334
What did I ever do to you?

157
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,252
- I'm just talking to myself.
- Jun-seo!

158
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,130
Goodbye, you jerks.

159
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,011
Look at those
two miserable bags left on the ground.

160
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,389
Man, this is so sad.

161
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,808
- What even is this?
- What happened?

162
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,268
Sit down first.

163
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,437
- I thought he'd choose you.
- I thought so too.

164
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,774
Let me tell you exactly
what we talked about.

165
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,361
I won't embellish on any details
or leave anything out.

166
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,278
Okay.

167
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,198
The first thing he asked me
was how I was doing,

168
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,450
if I was getting the hang of things here.

169
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,368
Uh-huh.

170
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,745
I said I was having fun.

171
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,164
Then, he asked if I had any concerns.

172
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,250
So I said no and we just kept talking.

173
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,336
He then asked,
"Do you wanna go to Paradise?"

174
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,838
- I said, "I want to."
- You made yourself clear.

175
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,007
I said, "Yeah,
I really wanna go."

176
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,801
I asked about his trip with Si-an,

177
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,011
and he said
it was "just dinner and drinks."

178
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,473
He went there just for dinner.
He said, "I just went there to eat."

179
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,724
Wait, he said that?

180
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,562
I was like, "You promised to drink whiskey
with me on our next trip to Paradise.

181
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,939
How dare you drink whiskey without me?"

182
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,858
But he told me,
"I didn't have Johnnie Walker, though."

183
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,486
I read into his words again.

184
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,614
I thought he meant
he wanted to drink it there with me.

185
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,950
You've heard it all. What do you think?

186
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,413
Wait, did I read it wrong?

187
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,502
- Oh, gosh. That poor, sweet girl.
- They can't lie. They just can't.

188
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,006
Like when you have a crush,
you gather a couple of friends,

189
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,134
and you question them
until you get the answers you want.

190
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,386
- And it makes your friends suffer.
- Right.

191
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,805
They do look like they're suffering.

192
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,519
Wasn't that conversation hinting
that we'd go together?

193
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,520
I don't think…

194
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,689
I mean, I really enjoyed talking to him.

195
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,818
Hmm…

196
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,528
Let them do what they want.

197
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,115
I refuse to be played around with.
Sorry, but no.

198
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,702
Why would I do that to myself?

199
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,579
It's like he wants to…

200
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,414
I mean, she's saying all this now,

201
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,791
but if he asks for a chat
when he gets back,

202
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,251
she's going to say yes.

203
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,171
- Like, "Hold on."
- "How annoying." While putting lipstick.

204
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,297
"One second."

205
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,884
It's so cute how she can't play coy.
Seriously, she can't hide it.

206
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,761
- I'm not that obvious.
- You are.

207
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,387
- Am I really?
- Yeah.

208
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,931
As soon as he came,
you started adjusting yourself.

209
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,892
I had to since I was lying like this.

210
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,395
I saw you starting to smile,
and you were like, "Come in."

211
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,397
I really thought I was going though.

212
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,444
Well, in any case,
I can tell she's frustrated.

213
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,405
I bet she'll keep talking about it
with her friends today.

214
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,493
- "Guys, don't you think it's weird?"
- "He likes Johnnie Walker."

215
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,952
They filmed this last year.

216
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,954
Let's go!

217
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,981
- Oh!
- They're sitting next to each other!

218
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,109
- What's this?
- Oh…

219
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,283
What?

220
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,204
- Can you hear me?
Ah!

221
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,998
- Can't you hear me?
Ah!

222
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,750
Are you insane?

223
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,683
Jeong-su looks bothered.

224
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,185
Si-an seems unbothered,
but she actually is.

225
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,395
Yeah, I agree with you.

226
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,689
She can see him
out of the corner of her eye.

227
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,606
Exactly.

228
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,526
Yeah, I still see Jin-kyung like this.

229
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,992
We're here.

230
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:23,993
We're here.

231
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,302
- What?
- Wait, what?

232
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,053
Jun-seo's letting his guard down.

233
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,722
What is happening?

234
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,435
- Huh?
I said, have fun.

235
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,313
Okay, got it.

236
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,569
He's cute.

237
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,030
- He couldn't hear them.
- He heard nothing at all.

238
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,114
PARADISE
KIM JEONG-SU & CHUNG YOU-JIN

239
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,741
- Let's go.
Vroom, vroom.

240
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,452
- Vroom, vroom. Let's go.
- Vroom, vroom.

241
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,746
- Let's do this.
- You opening the door for me?

242
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,248
- Yeah, go on in.
- Thank you.

243
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,710
- But you have to close the door.
- Sure, I'll do it.

244
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,545
- I'm just playing.
- Okay, thank you.

245
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,425
Okay.

246
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:22,843
Off we go.

247
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,179
Let's go pig out!

248
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,847
Nice!

249
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,309
Come on!

250
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,102
"Let's go pig out!"

251
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,271
"Let the food therapy begin!"

252
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,899
Learn from them.
We should be able to do that.

253
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,234
- Come on.
- Gosh.

254
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,568
"Vroom, vroom."

255
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,864
Oh.

256
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,496
Wow, we're finally here.

257
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,207
- Food. I'm so stoked.
- Me too.

258
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,792
Bon appétit.

259
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,629
- Let's just focus on eating.
- Yeah, sure.

260
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,547
I'd love that.

261
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,559
But since you came here because you won,
the food must be like heaven to you.

262
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,728
- Me?
- You conquered this Paradise trip.

263
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,398
I needed to get out of Inferno.

264
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,315
Mm…

265
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,777
Honestly.

266
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,406
- My head was spinning yesterday.
- Hmm.

267
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,994
Having to choose
whether we like someone or not in a day,

268
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,998
that's really not an easy thing to do.

269
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:34,915
I know.

270
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,836
Right now, my number one pick is…

271
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,296
- Who?
- Si-an.

272
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,255
Mm-hmm.

273
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,675
So, if I had placed first today
in the game…

274
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,721
I honestly would've chosen Si-an.

275
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,600
I was hoping
to have a real conversation with her…

276
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,520
since it's hard to find a moment
to chat with her.

277
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,479
Mm-hmm.

278
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,815
Hmm…

279
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,693
But then, somehow…

280
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,405
you were able to help me
clear my head quite a bit.

281
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,743
- Is it the talking that I do?
- I mean it, seriously.

282
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,369
I just thought, like,

283
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,955
"This person's words
are wholesome and sincere."

284
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,498
You mean it?

285
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah, I do.

286
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,877
- Reason I chose you…
- Yeah?

287
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,840
…is because I just wanted to have fun
with someone as sweet as you

288
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,468
and clear my head
on this trip while I can.

289
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,510
Hm.

290
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,514
And I think I did the right thing.
I'm happy that I chose you.

291
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,432
Hm.

292
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,602
It's like…

293
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,190
The closer we get to the end,
the more my head hurts.

294
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,274
It builds…

295
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,028
It's hard, since this is
all about our emotions, you know?

296
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,490
I can put up with the physical exhaustion,

297
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,910
but the mental stuff
is really getting hard to handle.

298
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:56,956
Right.

299
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,625
Mm.

300
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,836
Now that we've gotten
to see him talk about Si-an,

301
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,673
it's pretty obvious
that he only has her in his heart.

302
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,715
Looks like it.

303
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,385
- I don't think there's space for Hae-lin.
- No one.

304
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,762
Feelings grow
the more you talk about someone.

305
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,307
He's opening up to her,
as if he's doing a confessional.

306
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,476
It's making him realize he's on Si-an.

307
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,938
He keeps missing his chances
to be with her because she's so popular,

308
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,483
these situations are making
his feelings for her grow even more.

309
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,278
I have another question.

310
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,781
What do you like about Si-an?

311
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,033
Like, what is it?

312
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,079
Let me be really, really honest with you.

313
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,124
My first Paradise trip…

314
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,711
My very first one was with her.

315
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,796
And we just…

316
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,383
kept having conversations
about love together.

317
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:55,055
And talking about such topics with her
made my heart race, so…

318
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:55,973
Mm.

319
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,517
I used to date pretty casually
and carefree.

320
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,854
I'd say,
"I don't have a romantic bone in me."

321
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,398
"Gosh, I'm just hopeless."

322
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,233
I used to say that.

323
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,946
But then, my heart raced
when I was with her, which surprised me.

324
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,198
I thought, "Wait.

325
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,243
So I still do have a romantic bone in me."

326
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,706
But Si-an does have
a lot of qualities that,

327
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,585
I would say,
most men would find attractive.

328
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,336
- Just like I do.
- Mm-hmm.

329
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,130
Like what?

330
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:35,554
She's got those slightly feline features,
but her smile is totally disarming.

331
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,472
She looks kind.

332
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,892
When she smiles, I mean,
you couldn't look kinder than that.

333
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,769
Yeah, I can see that.

334
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,146
But she's scary
when she makes a straight face.

335
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,316
Looks-wise, a lot of men
find that quality charming.

336
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,817
Mm…

337
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:53,030
When we first talked,
I felt like she really put me at ease.

338
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,114
Mm…

339
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,367
But then again, I sensed
that she could be pretty stubborn too.

340
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,286
Ah, I see.

341
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,163
That's how I feel.

342
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:03,957
So…

343
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:11,256
I wanted to talk with her more,
which unfortunately didn't happen.

344
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,051
But I like it this way.

345
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,720
Because you get time
to organize your thoughts?

346
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,223
No, I'm having so much fun
hanging out with you.

347
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,642
It's so fun.

348
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,728
- You're so harmless.
- Why is that?

349
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,979
Like an Oompa-Loompa.

350
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:30,025
I'd like to make you this small
and carry you on my shoulder like this.

351
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:30,943
This small?

352
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,197
- Then you'd chitter chatter away all day.
- For sure. Chitter chatter.

353
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,242
You'd sit harmlessly on my shoulder
and talk until I say,

354
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,743
"Be quiet."

355
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,537
- "Shh."
- Ah, that's funny.

356
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,581
Jeong-su sure does seem at ease.

357
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,377
- I'm finding this side of him attractive.
- Yeah, me too.

358
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,546
When he was with Si-an or other girls,

359
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,841
I was like,
"Gosh. What's wrong with this guy?"

360
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,137
But just now,
when he was talking with You-jin,

361
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,390
I feel like his demeanor with her
was really charming.

362
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,558
Yeah.

363
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,562
Now that I think about it,
Jeong-su seemed very experienced at first,

364
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,064
but maybe that was just him being nervous.

365
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:14,153
So, he was probably making a big effort
to fully focus on the experience.

366
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,073
PARADISE
YUK JUN-SEO & LEE SI-AN

367
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,492
- Wow.
- This has a unique look.

368
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,952
It does.

369
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,163
Thank you so much.

370
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,080
Wow.

371
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,336
Do I look better with my hair down?

372
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,882
I think you look better
with your hair down.

373
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,593
You give off a different vibe
with your hair up.

374
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,012
Let's go.

375
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,977
Thoughts on coming back in just ten hours?

376
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,604
Has it been ten hours already?

377
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,521
Yeah.

378
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,815
I thought it was less.

379
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,609
I know.

380
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,240
I'm so tired today though.

381
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,620
Well, you had to exert yourself.
How many matches did you have?

382
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,205
I only played three.

383
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,289
- Only three?
- Yeah.

384
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,629
The streets are so confusing
and there's too many cars.

385
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,350
Do you have a feline or puppy face?

386
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,686
What do you think?

387
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,604
Feline?

388
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,605
Yep, that's right.

389
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,065
Yes! I got it right.

390
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,691
And you…

391
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,860
You just kind of look like a beast.

392
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,696
Why do you keep calling me a beast?

393
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,365
Beast.

394
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,457
Oh!

395
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,043
- Wow.
- Gosh! This is insane.

396
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,836
Oh!

397
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,213
- No way.
- Oh, my gosh.

398
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,965
Seriously, what is this?

399
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,968
- Today's the real deal.
- It's the best one yet.

400
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,427
Thank you.

401
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,345
Eat up.

402
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,723
- What should I have?
- Wow.

403
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,268
For the winner.

404
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,396
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

405
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,481
Some wasabi.

406
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,150
Do you like wasabi?

407
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,404
It's not bad,
and it goes well with beef.

408
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,197
Mm…

409
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,702
- Wow…
- Wow.

410
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,289
- Hmm. Jun-seo.
- Yeah?

411
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,001
- Is it radish? Radish?
- Try this.

412
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,545
No, well, don't…

413
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,216
Whoa. They've become really close.

414
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,011
You see, watching those two
make physical contact,

415
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:48,223
those aren't something you see with people
who are just getting to know each other.

416
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,475
Those two actually feel like a couple.

417
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,811
Spending the night together
made them close.

418
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,939
Even in the car earlier,
making physical contact like this is…

419
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:56,898
Oops, sorry.

420
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,902
A puppy.

421
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,362
No, I…

422
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,365
- Jin-kyung…
- She rested her chin on her hand.

423
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,700
You were so surprised.

424
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,577
It happened so quickly.

425
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,247
- These physical…
- That physical touch…

426
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,625
Or how he had his arm around her
while entering the restaurant.

427
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,003
- Yeah, exactly.
- Or how she spoon-fed him.

428
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,006
- That's what we see couples do.
- It doesn't seem forced.

429
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,925
- Like they've been dating for a year.
- I know.

430
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,845
How sweet is this first-place reward?

431
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,931
- Mm…
- I told you so.

432
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,350
Hm? That I'd win.

433
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,312
YESTERDAY EVENING

434
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,481
But still, don't think or worry too much.

435
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,150
Yeah, you're gonna come here
with me again.

436
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,027
Because I'm gonna win tomorrow.

437
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,614
I said I'd win so we could come back.

438
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,074
You weren't torn at all?

439
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,742
- I was torn.
- Um…

440
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,745
- Just messing around.
- Get out.

441
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,832
- If I place first in a women's game…
- Yeah.

442
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,960
I'll give you some thought.

443
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,093
Hey, how many times have you been here?

444
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,345
Is this your fifth time now?

445
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,055
Tell me.

446
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,681
I don't know.

447
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,851
- Count your blessings.
- There…

448
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,937
- What, no, I never said how many.
- Yeah.

449
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,814
Count your blessings.

450
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,912
Wow. Delicious.

451
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,081
Oh.

452
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,374
Really tasty.

453
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,562
- You cold?
- Mm.

454
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,482
Did you bring something warm?

455
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,693
I didn't bring much outerwear.

456
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,947
This bottle is nice.

457
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,005
Let's go if you're done.

458
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,048
Let's go if you're done.

459
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,551
Huh.

460
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,066
You can tell by that look on her face.

461
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,152
Jun-seo's being way too comfortable.

462
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,362
I mean, that's just
what he's like, though.

463
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,072
- True.
- Gosh.

464
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,908
- Oh, no.
- This is not good.

465
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,784
- I'm sensing a strange vibe.
- Right.

466
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:58,163
- He's not focusing on her.
- I wonder why though.

467
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,126
This is so nice.

468
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,757
What would you have done
if you hadn't placed first?

469
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,883
Oh.

470
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,053
What if you placed second
and the winner already chose me?

471
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:13,970
Yeah.

472
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,680
Who would you have picked?

473
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,806
Um…

474
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:21,937
If I placed second, I honestly think
you wouldn't have been an option.

475
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,357
So first off, I'd like to say
that I'm very glad that I won.

476
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,319
If I placed second
and you had already been chosen,

477
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,740
then I would've chosen the second person
I went to Paradise with.

478
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,034
- Min-seol?
- Min-seol.

479
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,370
- Oh…
- Wait.

480
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,039
Oh…

481
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,376
Why? Can I ask you why?

482
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,877
- Why her?
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,588
She intrigues me.

484
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,426
- Oh, does she really?
- Yeah.

485
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,805
Oh! Did you see her clenching her jaw?

486
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,432
- Like, "Oh, does she really?"
- I saw it. Yeah.

487
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,268
That put a damper on things.

488
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,688
But isn't Si-an a bit interested
in other guys as well?

489
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:08,400
But it's a different story if you say
that out loud to the other person.

490
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,904
- Oh, does she really?
- Yeah.

491
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,197
- I had no idea.
- Yeah.

492
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,865
- Honestly.
- No one does.

493
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,955
- Well…
- Hm?

494
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,374
- In Paradise…
- Mm?

495
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,459
We definitely talked a lot.

496
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,087
We were cracking jokes
over 90 percent of the time.

497
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,046
Mm-hmm.

498
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,841
- It was fun.
- Mm.

499
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,759
- She's very funny.
- Mm.

500
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,720
She's a bit of a tease too.

501
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,430
But then I…

502
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,765
Then, we came back the next day…

503
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,353
And I've been seeing her
around Inferno since.

504
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,440
But she just seems pretty down,
unlike when she was with me.

505
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,525
She tells me that she isn't down,

506
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:54,446
but the Min-seol I got to know in Paradise
isn't the one in Inferno.

507
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,114
I was even rooting for her.

508
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,451
And I told her that I thought
she'd be pretty popular in Inferno.

509
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:02,287
But, yeah, she hasn't been the same
for a while now.

510
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,288
Hm.

511
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,666
I guess I do sort of feel sorry for her.

512
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,419
I can't help but look out for her.

513
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,838
Mm…

514
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,964
Okay, I get that.

515
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,175
I didn't know all that.

516
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,266
<i>I had a lot on my mind.</i>

517
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,978
I have been interested in Min-seol
without even realizing it.

518
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,899
I really just wanted
to be honest with Si-an.

519
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,069
So I told her
that I had Min-seol on my mind.

520
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,988
That's why I couldn't focus solely
on my date with Si-an.

521
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,577
You seem to be thinking about her a lot.

522
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,412
Are you going to act on it?

523
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,330
I'm not sure.

524
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,958
Are you considering talking to her
when you get back?

525
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:49,876
Dunno.

526
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,046
Hmm…

527
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,298
- Why?
- What?

528
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,299
Why do you ask?

529
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,342
No reason.

530
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,763
- Why are you asking me though?
- For no reason.

531
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,680
Okay.

532
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,226
Man, why are you being so cold?

533
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,603
You know what?
I have something to say too.

534
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,314
Let me be honest,
you're being too cold right now.

535
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,232
- Me?
- Mm.

536
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,441
Why?

537
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,693
- Could you be a bit sweeter?
- Seriously?

538
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,404
- Mm.
- Was I being cold?

539
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,169
Can't you treat me more gently?

540
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,087
How so?

541
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,714
You're getting comfy too quickly.

542
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,007
- I am?
- Mm.

543
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:39,717
I'm not comfortable.

544
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,595
What I'm saying is…

545
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,597
Forget it.

546
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,433
I'm really not comfy though.

547
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,268
- Do I seem comfy?
- Yeah.

548
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,061
I'm just a little…

549
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,855
Or am I?

550
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,030
Am I not being gentle?

551
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,659
I think you're just a bit tired today.

552
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,203
I feel normal.

553
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,414
This has nothing to do
with me being tired.

554
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,833
- You're usually like this?
- Yeah.

555
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,042
Okay. Got it.

556
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,390
Am I doing something wrong here?

557
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,727
Hmm.

558
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,525
<i>I suddenly had a lot</i>
<i>to think about.</i>

559
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,403
I'm not so sure what he's thinking.

560
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,490
Well, it's just that
he said a lot of reassuring things to me

561
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,116
during our first date.

562
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,287
I was excited about our date
in Paradise the next day,

563
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,122
but he was just there to eat.

564
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,626
He finished eating, and then said,
"If you're done eating, let's go."

565
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:59,714
I was seeing something very different
from what I'd seen on our first trip.

566
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,758
It caught me off guard a bit.

567
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,513
- Playing mind games?
- Why are they playing mind games?

568
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,556
- What's wrong with them?
- A little odd.

569
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,976
I think things moved too fast
so now his feelings have waned.

570
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,314
Si-an could be sensing this from him.
They became too close too quickly.

571
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,317
Jun-seo definitely seems like
he has a lot on his mind.

572
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,819
- He does.
- Yeah.

573
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:24,155
And inevitably,
Si-an has a number of choices right now.

574
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,073
So I think…

575
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:30,787
Si-an unconsciously keeps sizing him up
a little this time around in Paradise.

576
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,706
- A lot of guys like her now.
- A lot.

577
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,918
If I were him, I'd be annoyed.
I'd feel that way more over time.

578
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,671
- Jun-seo is annoyed.
- That's the vibe I'm getting.

579
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,966
I'd already be pretty annoyed.
Like, "What's wrong with her?"

580
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,094
He doesn't want to put up
with everything she has to say.

581
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,347
I'd be thinking, "I have feelings too.
Why I only cater to her?"

582
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,141
But when Si-an said,
"Can't you treat me more gently?"

583
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,686
Jun-seo should've
swallowed his pride and said,

584
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,605
"Oh, I'm really sorry.
That's not what I meant."

585
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,941
He should've pulled her back in like that.

586
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,235
Instead, he just went, "Was I like that?"

587
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,820
That won't fix anything.

588
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,990
Or maybe he really is exhausted?

589
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,326
He said he had a hangover
from all the drinking yesterday.

590
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,913
I think Jun-seo
just has too much on his mind.

591
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:18,501
He's like, "This is how I usually am.
I'm not being like this because I'm tired.

592
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,963
This is what I'm like.
This is Yuk Jun-seo. This is me."

593
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:22,922
This is tricky.

594
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,592
Yeah, the vibe's gotten weird,
we didn't expect that.

595
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,719
It's a bit nerve-racking.

596
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,306
Should we go?

597
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,810
- You cold?
- Mm.

598
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,188
- Should I look for a blanket?
- It's okay. Mm-mm.

599
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,025
Maybe this could warm you up a little.

600
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,359
Yeah, put it on me.

601
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,403
Let's cover you up.

602
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,448
- Do you wear cologne?
- No.

603
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,326
- Then, what am I smelling?
- I don't wear any.

604
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,620
You have your own unique scent.

605
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,580
What scent?

606
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,625
I guess how your skin smells?

607
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,711
- I notice when you pass by.
- Really?

608
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,588
Yeah. You have this distinct scent.

609
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,928
- This feels warmer now.
- Mm-hmm.

610
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,138
Yeah, I'm warmer.

611
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,562
- I'll cover you more.
- Mm.

612
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,872
- She's satisfied.
- Is this what she wanted?

613
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,999
- Things like that?
- She's all better now.

614
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,125
For goodness' sake.

615
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,544
- Oh, come on.
- He's sweeter now.

616
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,513
How did it turn out this way so suddenly?

617
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,639
With you.

618
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,932
- With me?
- Yeah.

619
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,394
- I think we have good timing.
- Mm.

620
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,063
It was good yesterday,
and it still is good today.

621
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,022
Mm-hmm.

622
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,651
When we first got
to our hotel room yesterday…

623
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,569
- What?
- …you were all soft and gentle.

624
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,613
- Me?
- That's the vibe you had.

625
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,781
Can I ask why?

626
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,616
- Soft and gentle?
- Were you sleepy?

627
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,743
What do you mean by soft and gentle?

628
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,830
You know, your eyes were looking drowsy.

629
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:24,043
You kept giggling while you were picking
at those rose petals.

630
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,004
- Yeah.
- Remember that?

631
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,153
- What? What about it?
- Huh?

632
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,613
What about it?
Did it give you butterflies?

633
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,366
Yeah, I liked seeing that side of you.

634
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,789
You just being there and doing nothing.
That casual side of yours seemed natural.

635
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,999
And it was nice to see.

636
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:12,800
I was mostly looking forward to all
the conversations we'd be having today.

637
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,560
- Are they holding hands?
- Are they?

638
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,952
- Hold my hand properly.
- Hm?

639
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:43,372
Hold my hand properly.
You held it just fine yesterday.

640
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,624
Did I?

641
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,464
I like it when a guy is expressive.

642
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,966
- You want me to be expressive?
- Mm.

643
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,928
Should I go take some classes on it?

644
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,056
No.

645
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:02,558
Oh.

646
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,144
What's your idea of expressive?

647
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,979
- Hm?
- Saying "I love you" and stuff?

648
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,981
Just as an example.

649
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,691
Oh, you love me?

650
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,860
I've barely used that word in my life.

651
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,654
Dang.

652
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,115
You don't really need to say it

653
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,034
if you can show your feelings
through actions.

654
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,119
No.

655
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,830
It's better to say it
and show it through actions.

656
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,747
You think?

657
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,252
Is that so?

658
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,420
So you've hardly said "I love you"?

659
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,338
Right.

660
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,185
Well, this proves the situation early on
was just a lovers' quarrel.

661
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,312
- Is that right? I see.
- That's all it was.

662
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,231
We took it too seriously.

663
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,568
- Like, "Jun-seo, just be nicer to me."
- "Be nicer to me already."

664
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,862
- A quarrel to fall deeper.
- Exactly.

665
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,948
- We got worried.
- They like each other a lot.

666
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,867
- Just needed a push.
- I get it now.

667
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,784
Geez.

668
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,748
Oh…

669
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,833
Wow.

670
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,253
- Nice.
- They have everything.

671
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,047
- Hmm…
- Hmm, dart machines.

672
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,091
How do you play that?

673
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,930
It takes pictures.

674
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:23,890
Do we move back?

675
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,857
I didn't think
we'd come to a place like this.

676
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,650
Awesome.

677
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,068
It's so nice.

678
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,905
- Wait. Are they going to meet? Here?
- What?

679
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,575
- Wait. What?
- Wait.

680
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,911
- Wait, what?
- Wait.

681
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,454
- Wow.
- Whoa, what?

682
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,874
- This is insane!
- So glad to see you.

683
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,209
Jeong-su, my love.

684
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,628
- You-jin, my love.
- What took you so long?

685
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,712
Geez.

686
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,839
Do we finally get to drink now?

687
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,051
- This awkwardness was driving me nuts.
- Why were you awkward?

688
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:03,429
- Is this yours? Can I drink it?
- Yeah. Drink anything you want.

689
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,432
- They made them meet up like this?
- Ah…

690
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,059
In this case…

691
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,979
- Ah, this could be really dangerous.
- Well, this is entertaining.

692
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,065
Right, this is no ordinary double date.

693
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,234
- It's not.
- Jun-seo wasn't being sweet.

694
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,153
But now Jeong-su can use
some of his sweetness on her.

695
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,572
- He could sway her.
- A déjà vu moment?

696
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,531
Yeah.

697
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,159
- Might shake things up.
- Right timing to get swayed.

698
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,705
- It's good to see you guys.
- I know. It's crazy to see you both here.

699
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,251
- Do you remember, on day one?
- We all came here day one.

700
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,127
- We're here again.
- Is that right?

701
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,797
Something's different.

702
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,049
It is. Then, should we switch seats?

703
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,968
- Diagonally.
- What do you think?

704
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,136
Let the diagonal talks officially begin.

705
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,097
What is this? A social experiment?

706
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,811
You both placed first and second last time
and today as well.

707
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,145
How do you two feel?

708
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,314
- I lost again.
- You lost again?

709
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,691
- Oh, right.
- I lost again.

710
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,819
He kept saying that he'd never move up
from being a runner-up.

711
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,779
He's no match for me.

712
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,698
I wanted to beat you at least once.

713
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,286
I'm shaking.

714
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,415
Anyway, I had no idea
that you'd choose You-jin.

715
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,582
- You didn't?
- No.

716
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,001
- Mm.
- You had her in mind?

717
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,460
She's my Oompa-Loompa.

718
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,962
Why's that?

719
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,215
- He wants to carry me around in a jar.
- Uh, what?

720
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,967
What? Is that some pickup line?

721
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,303
He must have
found me entertaining yesterday.

722
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,013
Oh, really?

723
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,223
I guess I was funny.

724
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,599
You're unbelievable.

725
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,644
Thank you. I'll take that as a compliment.

726
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,065
- You're charming.
- Right.

727
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,067
You're infectious.

728
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,944
Cheers.

729
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,571
Cheers.

730
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,739
Cheers.

731
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,540
- This is better than I thought.
- So refreshing.

732
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,126
Mm…

733
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,003
You wanna try some?

734
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,087
Is it sweet?

735
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,714
If so, I'll try it.

736
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,008
Oh, right, you like sweet food, don't you?

737
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,219
- Is it sweet? If so, I'll try it.
- I don't like sweet drinks.

738
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,097
I guess it's yours now.
I'll just have a Coke.

739
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,476
Mm…

740
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,020
- Like it?
- It's not quite my taste.

741
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,480
- I'm good.
- Oh, it's not?

742
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,775
- Si-an's not liking that.
- He's being too sweet.

743
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,236
Right, she just said it with her eyes,
"Watch and learn."

744
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,697
- Like it?
- It's not quite my taste.

745
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,240
- I'm good.
- Oh, it's not?

746
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,536
How is being with
the same person two days in a row?

747
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,748
- Si-an is looking…
- Stop eating, Jun-seo.

748
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:39,418
You've been eating all day.
Come on. Please stop eating.

749
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,714
How is being with the same person
two days in a row?

750
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,592
- Now that you've been here twice.
- What do you think?

751
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,970
Is the communication better?
Are you more comfy with each other?

752
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,556
Yeah, it's definitely flowing.

753
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,600
Or maybe not so much.

754
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,684
Just kidding.

755
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,522
We're communicating as best as we can.
It's been fun.

756
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,905
I definitely feel more comfortable
being with her for the second time.

757
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,542
- Good at pool, Jeong-su?
- Let's play.

758
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,835
Let's play in pairs.

759
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,295
I've only played it
three times in my life.

760
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,213
Three?

761
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,091
Oh…

762
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,509
Good job.

763
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,802
You did fine.

764
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,762
- Try it.
- Do I hit the white one?

765
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,598
- Shoot the white ball to hit this.
- I'll give it a try.

766
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,559
- Like this?
- Know how to hold the cue?

767
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,687
- She knows how to hold the cue.
- Only three times, huh?

768
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,773
- It's true, I swear.
- You got into position right away.

769
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,774
Only three.

770
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,653
- Don't take her word for it.
- What?

771
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,531
Try to aim slightly left of center.

772
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,910
- Yeah.
- Oh, no. It's getting tough again.

773
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,121
I know, right? This one makes it tricky.

774
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,540
This move is going to be tough to do, huh?

775
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,376
- Strike here to scatter these.
- Sounds good.

776
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,628
Ugh, it's getting stuck.

777
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,255
Do it this way.

778
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,549
- Like this? That's new.
- Yeah.

779
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,302
Use the bottom one here
to help choose the direction.

780
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,513
- The direction?
- Place this here, shoot in that direction.

781
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,140
- There you go.
- Got it.

782
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,766
Oh…

783
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,352
Right, you've just gotta
teach her like that.

784
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,146
- How sweet are they?
- They are.

785
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,189
Good job.

786
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,566
It barely touched the ball,
but I still got it.

787
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,694
Can you shoot this one over there?

788
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,737
Let's see…

789
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,822
You might make it.

790
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,782
- Hey.
- You're so strong.

791
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,243
Don't do it halfheartedly
even if you'll mess up.

792
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,541
He's speaking like some coach.
He sounded like one just now.

793
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,378
- He's Mr. Coach.
- Oh, dear. This is not good.

794
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,423
What should I do? Look, the yellow stripe.

795
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,467
- Like this? Not too bad?
- It's doable.

796
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,220
- I'll go again…
- Yeah, but…

797
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,723
Wow.

798
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,309
- Ah.
- Wow, you did great.

799
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:06,065
I guess I'm good at stuff
that requires physical skills.

800
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,442
- I knew it.
- I have a good eye for detail.

801
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,361
- You do?
- Don't I?

802
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,197
A dance major's eye for detail.

803
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,448
No?

804
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,825
Can you quiet down a little?

805
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,537
We're trying to focus here.

806
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:23,958
Whoo!

807
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,919
Shoot however you want.

808
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,212
Whoa!

809
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,881
- Ah.
- Ugh, that girl really is…

810
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,884
I have to say,
I guess I do have a sharp eye for detail.

811
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,010
You're incredible.

812
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,014
- Just hit it hard?
- Try to shoot it that way.

813
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,433
Good.

814
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,311
"Good."

815
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,313
Is Jun-seo in a competition right now?

816
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,107
Unbelievable.

817
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,151
- He's competitive.
- They're different.

818
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,655
What's the score?

819
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,533
- I'm getting competitive.
- We're crushing them.

820
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,993
We're winning.

821
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,869
- We are.
- Really?

822
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,038
I better beat Jun-seo in this, at least.

823
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,623
Right, you have to. Go for it.

824
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,709
Let's get you first place. We can do it.

825
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,169
Maybe I used up
all my luck earlier.

826
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,504
Okay.

827
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,965
I don't see any good shots.

828
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,385
- Look at that row.
- I'm getting competitive.

829
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,053
- Break them?
- Yeah.

830
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,931
- Should we aim here?
- Go for it. Let's go. We can do it.

831
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:25,019
Losers write their names
with their butt.

832
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,272
It's a little off. Hey, hey.

833
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,525
- "Hey, hey."
- He's way too blunt.

834
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,820
He should stop addressing her like that.
He keeps saying it.

835
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:38,073
- It honestly doesn't seem okay.
- Why does he do that?

836
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,200
- Annoying.
- Her buttons have been pushed.

837
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,411
- She's annoyed now.
- No, I… I mean…

838
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:45,831
- Can't let that go.
- It's the way he speaks.

839
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,376
Hey, can't you discuss
your move with me first?

840
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,796
- This is our chance.
- This is a tough one.

841
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,007
- Don't be nervous.
- That's not it.

842
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,467
Tricky to shoot from here.

843
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,761
- Go get that bridge stick.
- Bridge stick?

844
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:02,014
No, I don't want to get any help
for the final shot.

845
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:05,476
- Want to write your name with your butt?
- Okay, go already.

846
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:11,231
- Let's end the game here.
- Think and look before you shoot.

847
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,900
- Hey.
- Call me Si-an.

848
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,152
- Stop calling me "hey."
- Oh, Si-an. Si-an.

849
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:18,197
I want you to come a little to this side.

850
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,783
Uh-oh. Conflict is brewing.

851
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,661
- Fight, fight.
- Let's use it to our advantage.

852
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:24,870
Good job.

853
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,380
- Geez, they're like con artists.
- They are.

854
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,506
It was fun.

855
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,092
- Where should they do their punishment?
- Fun game.

856
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,927
- Hey.
- Likewise.

857
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:40,969
You're good.

858
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,388
Yeah, I guess I am.

859
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,352
The difference keeps showing.

860
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,230
Si-an can't stand
how he's treating her in front of them.

861
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,981
Ugh, this is so bad.

862
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,609
How does second place feel?

863
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,197
Fine, as long as we do well
in the official games.

864
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,826
- It's fun to be on a double date.
- I was dozing off.

865
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,787
- But this woke me up.
- Mm.

866
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,331
- Did we make you mad?
- A little.

867
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,958
Ah, my blood pressure.

868
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,292
Gosh.

869
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:16,255
- Still, it was fun. We were neck and neck.
- Right, it was a close game.

870
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,132
- Ladies are so good.
- They're good.

871
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,925
Why are you so good?

872
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:23,053
I'm a bit of a perfectionist,
maybe a bit controlling.

873
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,596
That's my Oompa-Loompa.

874
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,101
Gosh, You-jin really is crazy.

875
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,396
You're the real deal.

876
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,149
Thank you very much.

877
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,653
It's good.

878
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,990
Anyway, are you in a bad mood?

879
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,283
No.

880
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:47,244
- From coming in second.
- Come on.

881
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,537
Gosh.

882
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,751
- Cheers for the last time.
- Cheers.

883
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,256
- Cheers.
- Bye.

884
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,466
What's with the "bye"?

885
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,599
Um, to be honest,

886
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,351
I was already feeling disappointed
by Jun-seo.

887
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,145
Maybe that's why…

888
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,233
Jeong-su's sweet behavior
drew my attention even more.

889
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,947
His actions really reminded me a lot
of my first date in Paradise

890
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,449
when I came with him.

891
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,660
So, it's definitely given me
a lot to think about.

892
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,248
- Did you have fun?
- Mm.

893
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,416
That's good.

894
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,584
Did you?

895
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,503
Mm, it was really fun.

896
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,256
I think that Paradise is…

897
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,510
actually a super important place to be.

898
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,594
Paradise?

899
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,012
Yes, it's so important.

900
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,348
- Yeah.
- So, so much.

901
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,517
It's super crucial.

902
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:08,075
- Interesting words.
- She keeps bringing it up.

903
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,870
What do you think she meant by
"Paradise is an important place to be"?

904
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,789
She wanted Jun-seo to hear that.

905
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:14,748
Right.

906
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:19,086
"Now I'm more certain about my feelings
from spending time in Paradise."

907
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,921
I guess that's what she meant.

908
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,633
It sounded like
she was giving him a warning in a way.

909
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,803
"This is an important place,
so you better behave and listen."

910
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:28,720
What?

911
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,265
"Come to your senses
before it's too late."

912
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,934
But I doubt he noticed
that warning at all.

913
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,061
Yeah, that seems to be the problem here.

914
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:39,356
You have to make an effort to change
for the person you like.

915
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,191
She's mentioned it multiple times.

916
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,026
But his behavior is just…

917
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,861
Is he looking down on her or what?

918
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,198
- It's the way he speaks.
- It's just out of habit for him.

919
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,451
He's been like this for 30 years,
so that must be why.

920
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,203
He got so competitive.

921
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,582
This means they don't click well.
They should just part ways here.

922
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,793
Da-hee, that was so direct.

923
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:03,672
What? I mean, isn't it obvious
what their future will look like?

924
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:06,133
They're incompatible.
They should end it here.

925
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,385
What if he's like "I can fix this habit"?

926
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,512
Never. He can't change how he speaks.

927
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,682
- Are you empathizing with Jun-seo?
- I'm just heartbroken.

928
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:17,060
He's like, "It's a habit of mine
for 28 years. I can't help it.

929
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,104
I don't want be like this. I don't."

930
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:22,608
- How long you need to fix it?
- "Give me time. At least three months."

931
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:25,652
If Jun-seo said, "Give me time."
She would've said, "Sure."

932
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,613
But that's not how he's handling it.

933
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,657
He's more like,
"You don't like it? Take it or leave it."

934
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,825
It was a double date!

935
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:35,996
That makes it embarrassing to hear
your partner keep calling you, "Hey, hey."

936
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,165
Seeing the other being sweet doesn't help.

937
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:41,585
It was a stark contrast.
This is why you shouldn't do double dates.

938
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,211
Gosh, these double dates.

939
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,881
This double date
will bring about some huge changes.

940
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,425
I know.
This one was actually pretty pivotal.

941
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,430
PARADISE
KIM TE-HWAN & BAE JI-YEON

942
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,765
Ooh…

943
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,975
This is so private.

944
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,228
- Shall we go in?
- Okay.

945
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,271
Yeah!

946
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,150
It's nice, actually. It's not too bad.

947
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,652
- Really? It's not bad?
- Yeah.

948
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,737
Ooh.

949
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,697
- Feels nice.
- Does it?

950
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,615
Yeah.

951
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,284
This feels good.

952
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,745
You know what? You look cute in this pool.

953
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:17,954
- Really?
- Yeah.

954
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,499
Hiya!

955
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,711
You look like a puppy.

956
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,964
- Having my feet in feels nice.
- Mm.

957
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,008
I know.

958
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,885
This is fun.

959
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,136
- Is it?
- Mm.

960
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:38,141
Usually, it's the other way around.
I guess he doesn't wanna get wet.

961
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,644
- Ji-yeon is taking initiative.
- Yeah.

962
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,814
- You asked me about my dream.
- Yeah.

963
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,190
What's yours?

964
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,069
Well, the thing is, the work I'm doing now

965
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,613
is truly about creating
a whole new culture.

966
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,242
I want to nurture
and grow this new culture

967
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,077
into something incredible.

968
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,788
I want it to be
over a thousand times bigger

969
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,623
than what it currently is right now.

970
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:06,211
I want everyone to know that it was me
who fostered its development.

971
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,587
Mm…

972
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,840
So, becoming someone who can be respected

973
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,426
by those who love that culture
is my dream.

974
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,302
Mm…

975
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,179
Mm-hmm.

976
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,811
Whoa, he's got a big dream.

977
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,981
- He wanna go down in history.
- "Go down in history."

978
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,817
- I've never even imagined such a dream.
- Right?

979
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,821
I believe that Koreans
are deprived of chances

980
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,282
to expand their tastes and perspectives.

981
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,325
- Right.
- It's such a shame.

982
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,580
But fortunately, there are already
a lot of people these days

983
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:44,374
who started to seek out their own
unique professions.

984
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,876
- That's great.
- That's true.

985
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,294
You know?

986
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,799
Te-hwan seems to like
talking about his work.

987
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:57,012
He likes to talk about
the work he's doing quite a bit.

988
00:50:57,095 --> 00:51:00,265
But the problem is,
he only ever talks about himself.

989
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:04,269
He never says,
"Okay, this is me. What about you?"

990
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,815
So I always work really hard
to introduce good music to everyone.

991
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,904
"I'm this, I'm that."
He just talks like that all the time.

992
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:17,491
<i>As the night went on, I became tired of it</i>
<i>so I didn't respond much.</i>

993
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,620
I only want to be known
by those who actually see my worth.

994
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,707
I only want to be recognized
by those individuals or groups

995
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,417
that are on the same wavelength.

996
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,085
Hmm.

997
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,256
- Yeah, to put it lightly, that's my dream.
- Hmm.

998
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,510
That's putting it lightly?

999
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:39,679
I didn't know
his self-esteem was high until now.

1000
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,807
He's odd, that's for sure.

1001
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,894
What's your non-work-related dream?

1002
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,730
I definitely wouldn't say
I'm against marriage.

1003
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,401
But you could say
I lean towards that idea.

1004
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:56,029
I just wanna be with the culture I love.

1005
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,282
What is he, some future culture president?

1006
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,535
- Minister of Culture.
- President of Culture.

1007
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,577
That's what he is.

1008
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,998
I wanna be with the culture I love
for the rest of my life.

1009
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,335
Living happily
with friends I connect with.

1010
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,711
I'd say that's my dream.

1011
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,005
Happiness first.

1012
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,508
A happy life is the ultimate goal.

1013
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,595
- Okay.
- Mm.

1014
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:26,518
Usually, when you like someone,
do you tell them you're not into marriage?

1015
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,938
I'm sorry, but I also think
it's too early to even mention marriage

1016
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,648
when it comes to Te-hwan.

1017
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:35,777
The point here is I said that my dream
was to create a happy family of my own.

1018
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,028
What's your dream?

1019
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,447
Right, you asked me about my dream.

1020
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,369
My dream is to become a caring wife
and a devoted mother.

1021
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:47,038
- That's my lifelong dream.
- Sounds hard.

1022
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,373
Yeah, it is.

1023
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:53,920
I mentioned to him I wanted to get married
and create a family of my own.

1024
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:59,259
So I was a little confused
about his reaction to that yesterday

1025
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,136
as well his answer today.

1026
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,348
<i>When we should be walking together,</i>

1027
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,976
<i>he just walks ahead</i>
<i>without thinking about me.</i>

1028
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:13,440
- I'm getting the hang of it now.
- Oh, are you?

1029
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,233
<i>When we were skating,</i>

1030
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,528
<i>he was having all the fun by himself</i>
<i>without noticing me at all.</i>

1031
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,532
Who knew there's a twist to that scene.

1032
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,201
Seriously.
He only focused on skating, huh?

1033
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,912
THIS MORNING

1034
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,413
Yeah. Um…

1035
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,133
- You're so focused on eating.
- Mm-hmm.

1036
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,428
- I've got to eat a lot to stay healthy.
- Oh, okay.

1037
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,889
THIS EVENING

1038
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,891
Wanna ask me anything else?

1039
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,100
Hmm…

1040
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,147
- I'll ask if I think of anything.
- Huh?

1041
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,440
If I think of anything.

1042
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,525
"I'll ask when I think of any"?

1043
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:01,488
Most men are simple-minded,
but they don't answer like he does.

1044
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,572
Exactly!

1045
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,325
I'll ask if I think of anything.

1046
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,534
If I think of anything.

1047
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,954
- You're putting me on the spot.
- Am I?

1048
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,580
Yeah, I'm drawing a blank.

1049
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:17,253
<i>I wonder</i>
<i>if he really does have feelings for me.</i>

1050
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,549
He keeps on telling me
that he likes me this much,

1051
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,135
but it only feels like this much.

1052
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,721
I'm trusting my gut here,

1053
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,516
and it's telling me
that he's not being honest with me.

1054
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,934
So I'm a little confused.

1055
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,854
This is like
a <i>Sixth Sense </i>level plot twist.

1056
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,856
That's why
she didn't want him to choose her.

1057
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,485
Ji-yeon meant it when she told him
to go to Paradise with someone else.

1058
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,113
She wanted to stay in Inferno,
give it some thought.

1059
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,865
He could've used the time
to get to know someone else.

1060
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,702
But Te-hwan didn't get the message
and chose her.

1061
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,662
If you like someone,

1062
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:54,374
you never say you'll ask questions
if you end up thinking of any.

1063
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,877
- It's just not possible.
- You wanna know everything.

1064
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,381
If you can't think of one right away,
you wouldn't say it like that.

1065
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,174
Come up with something, like,

1066
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,343
- "I have many to ask."
- "What's your favorite color?"

1067
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:09,055
"There's so many questions. Hold on.
What should I ask first?"

1068
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,766
- That's how you come up with things.
- Right.

1069
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:16,396
Te-hwan seems to have a strong sense
of who he is as a person.

1070
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,899
But I think he's behaving
and speaking within that strict standard

1071
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,943
that he's holding himself to.

1072
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,529
He could've gone in the pool with her.

1073
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,740
- But instead, he just…
- Did he not go in?

1074
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,160
- He's already made up his mind.
- Didn't he go in later?

1075
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,870
He just didn't want to get wet.

1076
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,122
His stubbornness came through.

1077
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:38,126
Maybe it isn't good to go to Paradise
with the same person twice in a row.

1078
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,377
It isn't a good idea.

1079
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,839
This trip could be important
because now they really know each other.

1080
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,466
I guess it really is important.

1081
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,843
- All couples aren't working?
- Nope.

1082
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,345
Seriously, this sure
wasn't Paradise today.

1083
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,184
- Everyone looks somber.
I'm just…

1084
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,643
Why are you down? Tell us.

1085
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:59,939
I've been stuck in Inferno
that I don't know what it's like outside.

1086
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,274
I won't go tomorrow either.

1087
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:03,860
Why don't you think so?
We'll help you out.

1088
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,612
- With what?
- Dong-ho!

1089
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,406
- Just stay put.
- She wants you to stay put.

1090
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,283
- Why?
- Look at you chuckling.

1091
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:13,912
- She can fend for herself.
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm doing great.

1092
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,956
You might get to go tomorrow.
Don't stay behind.

1093
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,250
I have no choice.

1094
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:23,004
I'm saying it's okay to be more forward.
You know?

1095
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,424
Are we not allowed to share
who we voted for and interested in?

1096
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,759
No, that's up to us.

1097
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,512
If you're being cautious,
you can keep it to yourself.

1098
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:34,057
I've been careful.
I thought we needed to keep it a secret.

1099
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,434
Be honest
with us now, then. Go on.

1100
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,478
- What?
- Who?

1101
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,564
- Who did I pick?
- Who you have in mind?

1102
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,525
Jong-hoon.

1103
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,652
- Oh…
- Mm…

1104
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,569
Jong-hoon.

1105
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:48,738
- Oh…
- Mm…

1106
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:49,739
What?

1107
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,076
- What's happening?
- What is this?

1108
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,327
Whoa, Hye-jin.

1109
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,538
- That was great timing.
- She nailed that.

1110
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,040
I also picked Jong-hoon.

1111
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,668
Man,
you're pretty clueless, Jong-hoon.

1112
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,546
- This time? Even before that?
- Amazing. You're awesome.

1113
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,005
- How cool is that?
- I will…

1114
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,090
Pat on the back.

1115
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:10,009
- Should we swap seats?
- I'll keep choosing Jong-hoon.

1116
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,932
I can't stop cringing.

1117
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,475
Why?

1118
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,727
I'm just telling you.
I'll do that for sure.

1119
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,813
Oh!

1120
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,106
Nice move, Hye-jin.

1121
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,900
It wasn't cringy at all.
It was really cool.

1122
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,779
- I'll do that.
- I had no idea. I didn't know.

1123
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,072
How could you not sense?

1124
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,866
- That's my fault.
- Why?

1125
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,952
I've hardly expressed my feelings
since he got here.

1126
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,163
He was kind to me at first
and I sensed it.

1127
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,581
I was really grateful.

1128
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,125
- I haven't followed through.
- She's shaking.

1129
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,668
Geez, I am shaking now.

1130
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,254
I saw quite a lot of Polaroids of you two.

1131
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,923
- Let me go talk to Hye-jin alone.
- Okay.

1132
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:51,759
That was fast.

1133
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,762
I love that they're acting quickly
on this. Good for them.

1134
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,764
This is healing my soul. So cathartic.

1135
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,433
Hye-jin's so honest.

1136
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,481
I'm grateful and touched
that you have feelings for me.

1137
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,149
It's a nice feeling.

1138
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,738
You know, every time I see you…

1139
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:14,491
you're so pretty.

1140
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,703
And you give me butterflies
every single time.

1141
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:20,955
- Really?
- Yeah.

1142
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,081
- You mean it?
- Mm.

1143
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,667
- Because I believe what I hear.
- Mm-hmm.

1144
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,794
- So tell me the truth.
- I am.

1145
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,004
Don't be like Jeong-su.

1146
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,756
Why, how is he?

1147
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,549
Never mind, it's nothing.

1148
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,467
Okay.

1149
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,678
I just couldn't bring myself to tell you.

1150
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,556
Even today, you were wearing a scarf
or something, right?

1151
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,474
A scarf?

1152
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,976
- You had it wrapped around your neck.
- Yeah.

1153
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,895
<i>It looked so great on you.</i>

1154
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,230
- <i>Really?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1155
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,732
<i>That outfit</i>
<i>and the yellow outfit.</i>

1156
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:48,650
<i>Okay.</i>

1157
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:52,111
You know, it's not a big deal to say,
"You look pretty in that."

1158
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,866
But it was hard to build up
the confidence to say that to you.

1159
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:58,660
Hmm…

1160
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,871
I found it so hard to talk
and tell you that.

1161
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,665
- Mm.
- Yeah.

1162
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,961
That's understandable.
Then, I'll keep approaching you first.

1163
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,297
- It's okay. Now, I will…
- It's okay now?

1164
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,549
Yeah, it's fine.

1165
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,509
I'll approach you first from now on.

1166
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,098
I really hope we…

1167
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,893
go to Paradise together.

1168
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,187
- Us two?
- Yeah.

1169
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,105
Wow.

1170
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,695
I will absolutely keep choosing you,
that's for sure.

1171
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,780
Jong-hoon, Jong-hoon, Jong-hoon.

1172
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,073
An Jong-hoon.

1173
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,161
Let's take a picture
to remember this.

1174
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,705
- All right.
- Yeah.

1175
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,790
I'll stretch my arm as much as possible.

1176
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:53,006
<i>♪ Let's take up the cloud</i>
<i>Till I hold you ♪</i>

1177
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:53,923
There.

1178
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,969
Nice, I like it.

1179
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,597
- Oh!
- That happened fast.

1180
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,682
I never expected to see this in Inferno.

1181
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:06,060
I just felt so troubled by everything
I was seeing in Paradise.

1182
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,605
Right. Hye-jin was actually
really cool just now.

1183
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:11,357
- So cool.
- It might work out between the two.

1184
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:15,194
- These two will make it to the end.
- Yeah, they'll go to Paradise next.

1185
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,240
Does anyone wanna have a chat
with someone here?

1186
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,451
We can do what we want, so feel free.

1187
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,745
- Yeah, I wanna have a chat.
- Huh?

1188
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:27,832
Who do you wanna talk to?

1189
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,292
- Dong-ho.
- Go ahead.

1190
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,127
Three of us can chat.

1191
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,421
I'm going to go bed
after we talk.

1192
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,883
- You're not gonna stay and talk to us?
- We should talk.

1193
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,968
I'll be back after I grab some lip balm.

1194
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,888
The female contestants take charge.

1195
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,349
- A-rin is looking upset again.
- Yeah.

1196
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,725
I wanna stroll.

1197
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,518
- Do you like walks?
- Let's walk.

1198
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,733
What about you?

1199
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,986
- Do you have a lot on your mind?
- Curious.

1200
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,237
Well, I just…

1201
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,700
I could be completely wrong,
but he gave me enough reassurance.

1202
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:09,248
I'm roommates with Hae-lin and You-jin,
so it's just a little tricky.

1203
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,377
- That's why you're quiet in there?
- It's hard to say anything.

1204
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,922
I'd like to talk about what I did,
what I liked, what we discussed.

1205
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,007
But I can't even share that with them.

1206
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,384
Right, you shouldn't.

1207
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,969
I don't know how things are going.

1208
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,722
I haven't talked to Dong-ho
since we came back today.

1209
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,392
- Talk to him later.
- I'm sure those two talked today.

1210
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:30,186
So I'm wondering
if she's just pursuing him

1211
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:33,272
even after he gave her a clear answer
and turned her down,

1212
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,358
or if he gave her mixed signals.

1213
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:42,490
- We just came back from Paradise.
- You really lose track of time here.

1214
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,785
Gosh, and we had Americanos yesterday.

1215
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,161
In the morning.

1216
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,539
- You're right.
- Did you get one?

1217
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:52,041
- I did.
- I'm so envious.

1218
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,502
- Are you craving coffee?
- I'm dying here.

1219
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:57,380
Those good old times.

1220
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:58,965
Why "good old" times?

1221
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,635
Those good old times…
Well, these are better times, of course.

1222
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,807
If the girls compete
for Paradise tomorrow,

1223
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,600
is it okay if I kidnap you?

1224
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,356
- I'll choose you anyway. No question.
- Yeah. Okay.

1225
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,108
For sure.

1226
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,445
I'm definitely gonna win first place.

1227
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,447
What?

1228
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,866
- What?
- You're really determined.

1229
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,744
I really need to go to Paradise right now.

1230
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,205
Let's go, together.

1231
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,040
Let's go together.

1232
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,252
You're doing that smile again.

1233
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,087
Smile? What smile?

1234
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,843
You're doing it again.

1235
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,762
No, It's just awkward.

1236
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:48,514
I smile when I feel like that
but I look more awkward.

1237
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,099
Mm.

1238
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,060
There it is.

1239
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,729
He can't pull it together.

1240
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,774
He only smiles like that
when he's hanging out with Hae-lin.

1241
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,319
- I didn't tell you this?
- Tell me what?

1242
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:03,863
- When I talked about my ideal type…
- Mm.

1243
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,908
…I didn't mention
that I love when people blush, did I?

1244
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,993
- I don't think you did.
- I wonder why.

1245
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:12,789
In my interview, my ideal type
was someone who blushes when they get shy.

1246
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,165
Then, you showed up.

1247
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,501
Oh, oh…

1248
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:21,130
- I wouldn't say I'm being shy.
- Are you flustered, not shy?

1249
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:24,342
Well, it's just that I have never met
anyone like you before,

1250
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:29,055
someone who's so straightforward
with their feelings.

1251
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,182
I hope we get to choose tomorrow.

1252
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,436
I'll let you sleep in the big bed.

1253
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,192
At this point,
I just get a kick out of teasing you.

1254
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,613
- She's coming in full force.
- "Full force."

1255
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,616
- She is no joke.
- Yeah.

1256
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,370
Doesn't know what to do
every time she acts like that,

1257
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,330
but Hae-lin finds that so amusing.

1258
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,749
She's enjoying it.
Yeah, and she likes him.

1259
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,002
Right, this feels like
a comic book situation.

1260
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,671
There's this very shy male lead.

1261
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:05,716
And suddenly, the bubbly female lead
shows up and gets all cute with him.

1262
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,010
Like in school,
there's always that it-girl

1263
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,180
who's friends with everyone,
like, "Hey, did you sleep well?"

1264
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,765
I keep picturing it like that.

1265
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,142
The male lead gets drawn
to the female lead

1266
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,435
before he even knows it.

1267
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,436
Yeah.

1268
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,650
They're taking so long.

1269
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,903
- I'm nervous.
- Hae-lin and Dong-ho?

1270
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,281
I'm sure they talked
with each other earlier.

1271
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,408
Oh, that's true. They did talk earlier.

1272
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,369
Yeah, they did, right?
I saw them walking around.

1273
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:36,080
They had a one-on-one conversation.

1274
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:37,081
Hmm.

1275
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,834
What really got me…

1276
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,505
was finding out
that we work in the same building

1277
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,924
and that we even live
in the same neighborhood.

1278
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:48,426
Also…

1279
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,430
Both of our parents
live in the same neighborhood.

1280
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:54,098
- Crazy, right?
- What?

1281
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,518
Plus, we were born in the same month.

1282
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,895
Sounds like fate.

1283
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,772
Yeah, that's honestly
why it was so shocking for me!

1284
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:05,192
And the surprise of it all
made me feel butterflies in my stomach.

1285
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,403
I thought, "What? What even is this?"

1286
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:09,155
- Could it be fate?
- Oh!

1287
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,573
That's how I felt.

1288
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,867
When he told me about himself,
it all hit me.

1289
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,494
That's why my feelings grew so quickly.

1290
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,623
I bet they all went inside.

1291
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:19,749
They haven't.

1292
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,751
- Still here.
- Yeah.

1293
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,546
Do what you'd like.
I'm gonna get some water.

1294
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,131
Oh.

1295
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:28,966
They're back!

1296
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,886
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
- How was the talk?

1297
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:34,263
You talked for, like, two or three hours.

1298
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,557
- The sun might come up.
- What?

1299
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:37,725
What time is it?

1300
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,560
Come on. You're so mean.

1301
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,980
Did you two have a drink or something?

1302
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,566
- No. My eyes are feeling dry.
- Really?

1303
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:49,862
I thought you'd keep going till morning.
I almost went to bed.

1304
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:52,782
Ah, you guys are scary.

1305
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,661
I'm so tired. I almost went to sleep.

1306
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:57,578
I know.

1307
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,039
I don't want to wash up…

1308
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:03,209
You're talkative considering
you only slept two hours.

1309
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,211
Uh-oh.

1310
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:08,589
Ah, this is so entertaining.
All the fun is in Inferno.

1311
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,342
The two of you can go talk.

1312
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:14,261
We couldn't wash up
since we were waiting.

1313
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,430
We can talk another time if you're tired.

1314
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:17,348
Let's go.

1315
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,432
Let's go.

1316
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,517
Sneeze alert.

1317
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,521
Do you just wanna sleep?

1318
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,191
He's feeling cold,
so he wants to go inside.

1319
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,485
He's even cold in the summer.

1320
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,988
Let's go. It won't take long anyway.

1321
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,823
Shall we?

1322
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:37,785
Okay.

1323
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:40,329
Let's go.

1324
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,040
I said we could talk tomorrow
if you were tired.

1325
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:44,917
You're being super obvious.
You're yawning.

1326
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,003
- I'm not.
- Why ask if I was gonna sleep?

1327
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:50,423
Let's make it quick and go to bed.
I'm so tired.

1328
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:54,468
Well, I…

1329
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,513
- Didn't you two talk earlier today?
- We did.

1330
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:01,434
So I was just wondering why you needed
to talk to her again tonight.

1331
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:04,729
And you guys… talked for so long.

1332
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,522
I'm curious what you talked about.

1333
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,733
She just wanted to talk with me.

1334
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:09,734
Oh.

1335
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,277
I mostly just listened.

1336
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,531
I listened to what she had to say.

1337
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,576
I pretty much listened the whole time.

1338
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,204
Okay.

1339
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:27,126
I was just curious,
but I used it as an excuse to talk to you.

1340
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:31,005
Plus, you played that game earlier.

1341
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,550
But we didn't get to talk afterward.

1342
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,302
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1343
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,930
I thought I'd have more time
to spend with you today.

1344
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:42,850
- The other girls kept approaching you.
- Yeah, the others…

1345
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:45,728
We were talking,
You-jin asked if she could talk to me,

1346
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,813
so I had to talk to her right after.

1347
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:51,275
That's how they do things?

1348
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:54,403
Hmm.

1349
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,740
Well, honestly, I'm not curious

1350
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,950
to know exactly
what you guys talked about.

1351
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,410
It's just that…

1352
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,832
I wanted to let you know
that I'm thinking about you.

1353
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,212
I really don't care
what you guys talked about at all.

1354
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:18,010
Because we talked a lot before that,
and even in Paradise.

1355
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:25,059
That's where I'm at.

1356
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:29,688
That's all.

1357
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:37,655
What? What is it?

1358
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:39,990
Bedtime?

1359
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:42,576
No, no. Let's just stay a little longer.

1360
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,661
You want to?

1361
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:46,539
I was worried
you'd get the wrong impression.

1362
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,415
- I didn't!
- I wanna stay.

1363
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,084
- Yeah.
- You know that, right?

1364
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,168
Just sleepy.

1365
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,003
- Ah, you're sleepy?
- Yeah.

1366
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:55,214
Dang, let's go then.

1367
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,091
We really didn't get much sleep.

1368
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:02,471
- These two are feeling iffy.
- Feeling off.

1369
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,765
This love triangle
revolving around Dong-ho.

1370
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:08,561
But given the evening conversations
we just saw,

1371
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,896
I believe there's no need for confusion.

1372
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,774
I'm certain
that he's more drawn to Hae-lin.

1373
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,319
But do you remember
what A-rin mentioned earlier?

1374
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:20,990
We wondered
if A-rin wasn't taking initiative enough.

1375
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:22,867
But from their conversation earlier,

1376
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,911
I sensed that she wasn't feeling
the need to approach him

1377
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,873
because he'd given her enough reassurance.

1378
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:31,667
But wouldn't that be
a major miscalculation on her part?

1379
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:35,296
This must be the first time Dong-ho
has experienced anything like this.

1380
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:38,257
I don't think he will show
how he is actually feeling.

1381
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:41,385
- A little…
- Even if he's drawn to Hae-lin.

1382
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,095
PARADISE
YUK JUN-SEO & LEE SI-AN

1383
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,806
Gosh, the air's so crisp tonight.
I love it.

1384
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:49,059
This sure is Paradise.

1385
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:51,604
Do you agree?

1386
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:55,566
Don't you think?

1387
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,276
Mm.

1388
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:06,368
- She turned her head.
- Stop talking to her like that.

1389
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,245
Please stop being so rude.

1390
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,628
This is because we're tired, right?

1391
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,088
Wanna shower first?

1392
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,382
Yeah, after we talk a bit more.

1393
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:22,009
You wanna talk?

1394
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,553
Should we talk after the shower? Or…

1395
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:25,971
I think that's best.

1396
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:36,982
How's your second time
in Paradise with me?

1397
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,945
- My second time with you?
Yeah.

1398
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,371
- You sleeping?
- "You sleeping?"

1399
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,749
- Ridiculous.
- You're kidding.

1400
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,042
There's no way.

1401
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,799
What if he is asleep?

1402
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:03,634
- What?
- They're so done.

1403
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:06,053
- It's over, for sure.
- Is he asleep?

1404
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:12,935
You asleep?
