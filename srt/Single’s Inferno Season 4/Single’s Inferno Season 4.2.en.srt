00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,619
[Master] Singles,
another Paradise-bound couple matching

350
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,120
will take place today.

351
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,664
[exciting music playing]

352
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,123
My hands are shaking.

353
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,794
[Master] The matching
will begin in one hour.

354
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,921
Should we head out?

355
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,131
Let's go.

356
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,051
[sighs]

357
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,931
[relaxing music playing]

358
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,859
-Hello.
-Oh.

359
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,611
-"Oh."
-Hello.

360
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,280
-[Theo] May I sit?
-Oh, sure.

361
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,661
What brings you here?

362
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,787
I chose to come here.

363
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,539
-[Si-an] Oh, really?
-Yeah.

364
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,291
I've been wanting to talk to you too.

365
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,543
-Really?
-Yeah.

366
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,837
-This worked out well.
-It did.

367
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,214
Oh. What a fancy necklace.

368
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,842
-[chuckles]
-[Theo] It has all those pearls.

369
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,135
Ah.

370
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,928
[clears throat]

371
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,763
Can I get you water?

372
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,932
I'd love that.
Where do you get water here?

373
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,100
Water?

374
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,520
I had to fill that up earlier today.
You can stay there.

375
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,155
[whimsical music playing]

376
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,573
[laughs softly]

377
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,658
Oh, how manly. [chuckles]

378
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,119
-[laughing]
-What did he just do?

379
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,620
[Jin-kyung] What's he doing?

380
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,414
He sure moves with confidence.

381
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,417
I guess, but it's so unnecessary.

382
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,960
[cackles]

383
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,006
So, you were the first one to pick me?

384
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,924
Why?

385
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,012
I thought you had this cold demeanor,

386
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,222
so I decided to challenge myself.

387
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,849
-Challenge?
-[Theo] Yeah.

388
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,730
I had my hopes set on you so I wanted
to pick you right away, like pow.

389
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,649
Oh, to beat me to it?

390
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,069
Why does he keep doing that?

391
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,989
…like pow.

392
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,575
Oh, to beat me to it?

393
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:00,204
I wanted to make a lasting
first impression since they're important.

394
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,373
Your personality is somewhat…

395
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,709
[slurps loudly]

396
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,503
[laughs]

397
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,088
You're a manly guy.

398
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,130
[Theo] No.

399
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,715
I think you're pretty macho.

400
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,509
I'm just cheeky.

401
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,141
I like someone fiery,
someone who's straightforward,

402
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,685
-talkative, easygoing.
-Easygoing.

403
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:28,232
Someone who yells and puts up a fight
but doesn't hold grudges.

404
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:29,900
That's what I like.

405
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,278
Sounds exactly like me.

406
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,321
Really?

407
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,156
Gosh, this is bad.

408
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:37,908
Really bad.

409
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,703
Should I send a video message
to my mother-in-law?

410
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,456
-[Kyuhyun] Theo, please.
-[Jin-kyung] Wow.

411
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,291
Take it down a notch.

412
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,002
-He's rushing things.
-[Kyuhyun] Yeah.

413
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,296
He's really trying to stir the pot, huh?

414
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,758
Should I send a video message
to my mother-in-law?

415
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,468
[chuckles softly]

416
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,139
I've never met anyone like you before.

417
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,598
[Theo] Is that a compliment?

418
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,225
-I'll take that as one.
-I mean…

419
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,311
-Even if it's criticism.
-[Si-an] You sure are one of a kind.

420
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,357
[Theo] She was really enjoying
talking to me.

421
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,484
I sensed she could be a little wild too.

422
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,319
We hit it off.

423
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,905
Personality-wise,
she's the closest to my type.

424
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,491
Hi.

425
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,576
[Theo] A-rin.

426
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,911
-Did you have a good talk?
-[A-rin] Yeah.

427
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,706
What are your overall thoughts?

428
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,543
It's the first time we're meeting,
so we're all a bit awkward.

429
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,754
But since we've been told
to make a choice…

430
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,923
-Right.
-I'm finding it difficult.

431
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,217
I've had a lot of conversations, but…

432
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,135
[Theo] Yeah.

433
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,016
-When it's time to make your choice…
-[A-rin] Yeah?

434
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,310
…you've go with your gut
and trust yourself.

435
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,187
Don't make the decision beforehand.

436
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,771
-[A-rin] You think?
-Yeah.

437
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,359
Whoa. You're just…
You're really different from me.

438
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,652
[laughs]

439
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,029
-It's true.
-Personally,

440
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,823
I think it's necessary
to think about every aspect,

441
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,950
so that you regret as little as possible.

442
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,121
When it comes to people
and feelings you have in your heart,

443
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,751
I don't think it's the best choice
to make decisions only using logic.

444
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,379
There should be more to consider
when choosing someone.

445
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,507
If you only have logic,
that person's charm won't last.

446
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,343
That's what I think.

447
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,513
He's an interesting character.
He's a bit funny, but unique.

448
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,724
Seeing how different we are
made me curious,

449
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,476
which put me in a tough position.

450
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,938
What was your first impression of me?

451
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,607
When I first saw you,

452
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,068
I immediately thought you…

453
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,820
resembled a cat.

454
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,447
What animal do I look like?

455
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,492
I can't…

456
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,827
-A carrot?
-[Si-an] No. [chuckles]

457
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,997
Well, you kind of look like
an adorable donkey.

458
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,707
-A donkey?
-[Si-an] Yeah.

459
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,918
I like that. Seriously!

460
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,003
[both laughing]

461
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,050
-Well…
-[Si-an] You are adorable.

462
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,468
-Oh, am I?
-[Si-an] Yeah.

463
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,097
You have an adorable face,
and donkeys are cute.

464
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,933
I'm never forgetting that.
It's a first for me.

465
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:08,850
[Si-an] Really?

466
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,936
When she said I looked like a donkey,

467
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,146
it left quite the impression,
in a good way.

468
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:14,898
[chuckles]

469
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,526
What's your ideal type?

470
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,239
I don't think that I tend
to laugh or smile very much,

471
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,285
so I usually gravitate
towards someone who does smile a lot.

472
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,454
[bright music playing]

473
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,833
So, you like puppies, and I'm a donkey.

474
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,459
[Si-an] No, no.

475
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,836
-I liked that.
-You smiled.

476
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,129
I did?

477
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,882
-I really like it when you smile.
-[Dong-ho] Noted, I'll smile more now.

478
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,594
But it's hard for me
to consciously try to smile more.

479
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,640
When I see you,
I just want to make you laugh.

480
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,725
-Me?
-[Si-an] Yeah.

481
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,936
-Feel free! Give it a shot.
-[Si-an] No, I mean… [giggles]

482
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,272
-See? I saw your teeth again.
-Why do you…

483
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,606
[laughs]

484
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,400
I feel you're staring at my mouth.

485
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,860
[Si-an giggles]

486
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,363
Seriously though,
you're so charming when you smile.

487
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,282
[soft chuckle]

488
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,659
Oh, there it is.

489
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,287
-I mean…
-I can't stop staring at your mouth.

490
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,664
-[laughing]
-Oh, gosh.

491
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,750
[Si-an] You light up whenever you smile.

492
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,294
-Wow. You're a funny person.
-Okay, I'll stop.

493
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,546
[all laugh]

494
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,258
Huh. They're surprisingly entertaining.

495
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,139
[Dong-ho] Okay, then.
You-jin, do you have an ideal type

496
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,099
in terms of looks or personality?

497
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,644
Even if someone's looks
are exactly my type,

498
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:39,274
there's been times when I lost interest
because of the way they spoke or behaved.

499
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,944
You're meticulous,
taking time to truly get to know someone

500
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,113
rather than just looking
for a general fit.

501
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,074
That's true. I am kinda like that.

502
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,827
I'm looking for someone positive
with a pretty smile.

503
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,787
And…

504
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,706
I think I like someone who is cheerful.

505
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,170
I think we're pretty similar
in terms of what we look for in people.

506
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,297
We get a feel for their energy.

507
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,343
But it's tricky,
you can't tell right away.

508
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,803
Mm, right. You can't.

509
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,014
You may think someone's your type,
but, like you mentioned,

510
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,642
your feelings can change
as conversations progress.

511
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,686
First, you're just
eating sweet potatoes together…

512
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,856
Then, the more you talk,
the more curious you get.

513
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,151
I agree.

514
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:29,491
Dong-ho approached me
in a more polite way than the others.

515
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,036
I felt like he was the most similar to me
out of the guys here.

516
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,583
What do you think?

517
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,253
Any first impressions of the other women?

518
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,046
Hmm… They're nice.

519
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,381
[Si-an] Oh. [laughs]

520
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,593
-It's great to meet you.
-You as well.

521
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,594
How old are you?

522
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,096
-You can't--
-Wait.

523
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,597
-You surprised me.
-My mistake.

524
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,890
Don't worry, it happens.

525
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,267
"Wait. My mistake."

526
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,726
[both laugh]

527
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,645
-He seems young.
-[Da-hee] He does.

528
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,355
-Right?
-[Kyuhyun] Yeah.

529
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,817
He feels like a young boy
who's trying to act experienced.

530
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,944
How old are you?

531
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,445
-You can't--
-Wait.

532
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,363
You surprised me.

533
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,323
-My mistake.
-Don't worry, it happens.

534
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,658
Your name is Si-an.

535
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,243
-Mm.
-I'm Te-hwan.

536
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,120
-Te-hwan.
-Mm.

537
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,998
Tell me, are you usually this calm
and collected?

538
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,374
Me? Yeah, I am.

539
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,126
-Oh, okay.
-I'm pretty relaxed.

540
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,296
Except when my playful side comes out…

541
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,715
-You have that side too.
-Every now and then…

542
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,302
Yeah, when it does,
it gets out of control.

543
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,095
This isn't the place to show that…

544
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,763
-Why?
-I'm restraining myself.

545
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,348
-Just be yourself.
-Be myself?

546
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,559
Some people might find it more attractive.

547
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,394
Really? You may regret saying that.

548
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,479
-Oh…
-Maybe you can't handle it.

549
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,816
I'll try my best to handle it.
Act the way you want.

550
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,736
-It'll make you more charming.
-Mm…

551
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,239
Hearing you say that
makes me feel more at ease.

552
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,366
[Si-an] Mm… Then go for it.

553
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,830
To me, Te-hwan seems to act
a bit younger than Si-an.

554
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,625
Yeah. She's treating him
like a cute younger brother.

555
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,668
-[Kyuhyun] She's taken the reins.
-True.

556
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,671
Dong-ho is doing the best
so far out of all of them.

557
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,882
-He feels the most genuine and real.
-Yeah.

558
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,885
I think he may be more popular
than we anticipated.

559
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,595
He might get a lot of votes.

560
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,096
Who will Dong-ho choose?

561
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,765
-Si-an.
-Dong-ho?

562
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,849
[Hanhae] Si-an?

563
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,310
For some reason,
I feel like most of the guys

564
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,479
will go for Si-an this time around.

565
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,773
You-jin also seemed to click with Dong-ho.

566
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:25,982
[Da-hee] Hmm.

567
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,984
What do you think will happen to Theo?

568
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,947
-[all laugh]
-[Hanhae] He's an oddball.

569
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,783
He may be irresistible
once you start falling for him.

570
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,702
-We need to see more of his charm.
-Take him or leave him.

571
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,537
-[Hanhae laughs]
-I'm telling you.

572
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,998
PARADISE-BOUND COUPLE MATCHING

573
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,335
[Master] We will now begin
the Paradise-bound couple matching.

[groovy music playing]

575
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,846
You-jin, please name the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

576
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,473
and hand him your ticket.

577
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,436
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

578
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,025
[downtempo music playing]

579
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,072
Kook Dong-ho.

580
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,199
Kook Dong-ho.

581
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,162
Here.

582
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,998
CHUNG YOU-JIN SELECTED KOOK DONG-HO

583
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,260
[Master] Kook Dong-ho,

584
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,555
please name the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

585
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,015
and hand her your ticket.

586
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,437
I would like to go to Paradise with…

587
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,443
[soft, suspenseful music playing]

588
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,698
-I think he's going to pick Si-an.
-Yeah.

589
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,658
-He got along with You-jin too.
-Right.

590
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,452
Either Si-an or You-jin.

591
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,123
I would like to go to Paradise with…

592
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,374
Kim A-rin.

593
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,002
Kim A-rin.

594
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,425
[all] What?

595
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,343
Hmm?

596
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,802
This is unexpected.

597
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,887
[Da-hee] Seriously.

598
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,680
KOOK DONG-HO SELECTED KIM A-RIN

599
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,639
Thank you.

600
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,772
[chill music playing]

601
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,821
[Dong-ho] You-jin gave me
a good impression.

602
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,115
But ultimately, I ended up choosing A-rin

603
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,993
because after having
the conversation we had last night,

604
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,164
I found myself wanting to talk to her more
and learning more about her.

605
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,707
That's why I chose her.

606
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,669
Just because I expressed that
I was interested in a different person,

607
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,173
that doesn't mean my curiosity
for A-rin had disappeared,

608
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,717
so in the end,
I stuck to my initial decision.

609
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,305
He follows his own set of principles.

610
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,807
He's like, "Take a number."

611
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,559
[Hanhae] You need to take a number
and wait in line.

612
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,229
[Master] Kim A-rin,

613
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,565
please name the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

614
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,983

615
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,154

Jang Theo.

619
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,298
-What?!
-What in the world?

620
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,926
Totally unexpected.

621
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,931
KIM A-RIN SELECTED JANG THEO

622

623
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,189
[chuckles softly]

624
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,025
What if no one matches?

625
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,819
What if no one goes to Paradise?

626
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,032
[Master] Jang Theo,

627
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,536
please name the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

628
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,121
and hand her your ticket.

629
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,168
I'd like to go to Paradise with Lee Si-an.

630
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:15,920
Lee Si-an.

631
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,590
What's wrong with him? Seriously.

632
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,091
[all chuckle]

633
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,427
-"Lee Si-an."
-"What's wrong with him?"

634
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,432
JANG THEO SELECTED LEE SI-AN

635

Gosh.

00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,412
[Master] Kim Te-hwan,

640
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,916
please choose the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

641
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,459
and hand her your ticket.

[upbeat music playing]

00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,694
[Master] Lee Si-an,

646
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,198
please name the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

647
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,616
and hand him your ticket.

648
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,790
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

649
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,546
[intriguing music playing]

650
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,010
[Si-an] All three of them are different.

651
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,096
So different.

652
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,977
Dong-ho has a very pretty smile.

[both laughing]

654
00:30:56,771 --> 00:31:00,149
He keeps making me laugh
and I want to make him laugh.

655
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,527
I have to admit, he's been on my mind.

656
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,738
Theo is a bit… [chuckling]

657
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,490
He's a little weird.

658
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,828
Should I send a video message
to my mother-in-law?

659
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,582
[Si-an] He's weird,
but I'm a bit curious about him.

660
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,296
As for Te-hwan,
I don't remember much about him.

661
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:25,425
I wasn't really attracted to him
when we talked, so, yeah.

662
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,970
-She chooses Theo, she goes to Paradise?
-That's a match.

663
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,388
Either Theo or Te-hwan.

664
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,181
Uh-huh. Yeah, that's right.

-Me too.

-[Hanhae] It's Theo.
-Let's go, Theo.

00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,674
-Seriously.
-[Theo] What's the problem? What is it?

694
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,717
[Si-an] I mean…

695
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,388
-[Si-an] It's a little irritating. Yeah.
-[Theo] Really? Isn't that good?

696
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:37,849
No?

697
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,435
They're entertaining.

698
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,894
[Kyuhyun] It might be fun.

699
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,104
[Hanhae] Theo is funny.

700
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,775
Si-an can't help but laugh
when she thinks about him.

701
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,818
[Da-hee] Yeah.

702
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,779
And I would say
that's definitely a positive sign.

703
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,865
Comedians marry beautiful women.

704
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,074
-Uh-huh.
-They do.

705
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,577
-A good sense of humor wins.
-[Kyuhyun] Yeah.

706
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,328
It's really an addictive quality.

707
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,246
[Hanhae] True.

708
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,332
[mellow music playing]

709
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,175
It feels like rejection.

710
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,554
Maybe I got the wrong signal,
or maybe there was another reason.

711
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,639
I am curious to know.

712
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,726
I guess this is Inferno after all.

713
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:30,735
I'm feeling a little bit disappointed
that no one decided to choose me.

714
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:34,030
All of a sudden,
I really miss having Jun-seo here.

715
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,869
I mean, he chose me right away
out of all the other women

716
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,996
who were standing there on the first day.

717
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,289
Yeah, I miss that.

718
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,962
[A-rin] I felt a little regretful.

719
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,967
If I'd given it a second thought,
I would've chosen Dong-ho for sure.

720
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,179
I didn't think it through,
which gave me regrets.

721
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,143
[Dong-ho] My interest in someone
doesn't mean that it's mutual.

722
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,980
I wonder if it'll make her uncomfortable
if I keep expressing my interest.

723
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,984
If I get another chance
to have a conversation with someone,

724
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,238
I'd like to chat with You-jin.
I only chatted with her briefly.

725
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,990
Her turn's over.

726
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,535
-[Da-hee] He's moved on pretty quickly.
-Right.

727
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,453
-"Okay, next."
-He's onto the next.

728
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,372
-[Jin-young] Her time's up?
-Yeah.

729
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,458
-I see. She needs another number.
-[Kyuhyun] And wait.

730
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,793
[Hanhae] This is crazy.

731
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,340
[propellers whirring]

732
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,217
LET'S GO, SI-AN!

733
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,182
[Theo] Ohhh.

734
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,478
[thrilling music playing]

735
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,647
We don't have to wear these.

736
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,281
Ah.

737
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,699
[both laugh]

738
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,787
-Huh?
-[Jin-kyung] Wow.

739
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,164
Did you see that skill?

740
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,833
He acted like it wasn't a big deal
and held her hand.

741
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:09,917
[Jin-young] Exactly.

742
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,253
-Can we rewatch that?
-[Hanhae] He's joking…

743
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,130
One more. Let's watch his technique.

744
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,214
Here's the thing.

745
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,009
-How did he do it like that? How?
-[Kyuhyun] Wait, this…

746
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,348
Ah.

747
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,391
[both laugh]

748
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,440
[all] Whoa!

749
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,733
-This is crazy.
-Damn.

750
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,569
-[Da-hee] I have full body chills.
-[Jin-young] Wow.

751
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,904
I'm getting goosebumps.

752
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,697
-Wow.
-I think he's a total pro.

753
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,657
-[Hanhae] He is.
-[Kyuhyun] Indeed.

754
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,493
Well, it was so smooth.
Everything about that was.

755
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,704
-Si-an just gave him her hand.
-Right.

756
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,789
-He did this, and bam.
-[Hanhae] Bam.

757
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,918
[chuckling]

758
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,554
[romantic music playing]

759
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,856
It's your second time.
So it's not too fascinating?

760
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,107
That's not true.

761
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,025
Wow!

762
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,073
How pretty.

763
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,824
You're very pretty.

764
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,495
[groans]

765
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,831
-What did we just see?
-[Hanhae] Wow.

766
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,959
What I initially found weird about him

767
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,336
is now becoming charming
the more I watch him.

768
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,965
If Si-an is head over heels for Theo
when they return from Paradise…

769
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,175
-[Kyuhyun] Yeah.
-We have to admit it.

770
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,844
-[Jin-young] We certainly should.
-Theo is a charmer.

771
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,764
PARADISE
JANG THEO & LEE SI-AN

772
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,433
[chill music playing]

773
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,769
-Oh.
-Wow, this is amazing.

774
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,437
-[Si-an] Huh.
-[Theo] Ooh.

775
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,981
Wow.

776
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,942
-[softly] Ooh.
-[gasps]

777
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,568
Look at the view.

778
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,155
It looks amazing at night.

779
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,078
[romantic music playing]

780
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,162
[Si-an] Smells good.

781
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,039
[Theo] There's pizza.

782
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,500
-[Si-an] Since we're hungry…
-Should we dig in?

783
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,751
-Yeah, let's.
-Great

784
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,630
-[Theo] Bon appetit.
-[Si-an] Thank you.

785
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:21,966
Hot sauce?

786
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,884
Please.

787
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,553
Actually, never mind.

788
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,722
[chuckles]

789
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,684
Let's drop the honorifics.

790
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,853
Okay, then…

791
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,771
How old are you?

792
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:36,856
Me?

793
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,649
I'm 29.

794
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,318
Born in 1994.

795
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,944
Hmm.

796
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,654
-You're pleased?
-I'm not.

797
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,741
-You're older than me.
-[Theo] Yeah. Of course.

798
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,492
-You're older.
-It's obvious.

799
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,493
That you're older?

800
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,995
Mm.

801
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,455
You look young.

802
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,498
How old do you think I am?

803
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,541
Twenty-four.

804
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,459
Twenty-four?

805
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,544
Twenty-seven?

806
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,296
-Six.
-[Theo] Twenty-six.

807
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,464
Mm. 1999.

808
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,590
-'99?
-[Si-an] Yeah.

809
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,924
Mm-hmm.

810
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,093
No wonder.

811
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,846
The way you act has that tinge
of freshness to it.

812
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,765
[laughs softly] Tinge of freshness?

813
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,976
I like that.

814
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,561
-You do?
-Yeah.

815
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,772
-I chose the right words?
-Totally.

816
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,815
I've never been called "fresh" before.

817
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:20,900
It's true.

818
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:25,279
It's a quality that made me feel
more attracted to you right away.

819
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,700
You were full of surprises.
Unexpectedness played a big part.

820
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:31,952
What's your job?

821
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,996
I'm an actor.

822
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,085
A few years ago, I considered quitting
because of the toxic people and stress.

823
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,461
-So, you act?
-[Theo] I do.

824
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,216
It was hurting me more than helping me.

825
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,095
But then, the second
I was about to give it up,

826
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,679
I got to be in a movie abroad.

827
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,558
And I realized acting in English
was kind of fun, so now…

828
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,937
I want to act abroad, instead of in Korea.

829
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,607
-That's why… It explains your energy.
-My dream now

830
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,359
is to be a Hollywood actor.

831
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,944
-Oh.
-[Theo] Yeah.

832
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,862
[uplifting music playing]

833
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:07,947
[Theo] I'm an actor.

834
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,492
Yeah, I have seen… I have… They're like…

835
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,412
[Theo] My ultimate goal
is to become a Hollywood actor.

836
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,915
Recently, I've been challenging myself
to act in English abroad.

837
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,752
JANG THEO
29 YEARS OLD, ACTOR

838
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:26,298
A few months ago, I flew to New York
to take acting lessons near Broadway.

839
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,301
-So happy…
-Must've been nice.

840
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,637
I loved every day
that I got to spend there.

841
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,766
-So, you're adventurous.
-Mm.

842
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,767
Yeah?

843
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,895
But now that I've talked to you,

844
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,567
you feel different,
like, I'm seeing a new side to you.

845
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,901
-New?
-[Si-an] Mm.

846
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,111
But thrilling?

847
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,904
-Yeah, it is.
-[Theo chuckles]

848
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:49,822
Thrilling.

849
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:52,950
I like this…

850
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,493
Your personality.

851
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,411
[stifled laugh]

852
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,706
I take personalities seriously,

853
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,167
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't care about looks.

854
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,168
Come on.

855
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,045
Admit you care about looks,
it's the first thing you see.

856
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,547
[laughs]

857
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,299
I just care about good looks.

858
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,216
[chuckles]

859
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,887
I think we're hitting it off.

860
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,972
[both laugh]

861
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,265
If you're done eating…

862
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:17,933
[Theo] Let's go.

863
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,608
Long skirts look really good on you.

864
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,527
When you came out, I was surprised.

865
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,114
-Your heart skipped a beat?
-It really did.

866
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,493
Is that necklace yours too?

867
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,328
-[laughs]
-[Theo] Yeah.

868
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,580
Didn't you mention it earlier?

869
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,207
That's why I kept it on.

870
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,124
[Theo] Really?

871
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,542
For you.

872
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,793
[both laugh]

873
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,588

874
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,805
[sweet music playing]

875
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,978
You have these puppy-dog eyes.

876
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,105
-Me? Oh, really?
-[Si-an] Mm. Yeah.

877
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,483
-Puppy-dog eyes?
-[Si-an] Yeah.

878
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,609
Really?

879
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,610
Gosh, it's my…

880
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,197
I've never heard that before.
People have polarizing opinions about me.

881
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,281
Especially women.

882
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,408
A lot of them aren't fond of me.

883
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,744
They think
my intimidating looks are scary.

884
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,748
People hardly approach me.
They find it difficult.

885
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,876
Is it the same for you?
You come off a bit cold.

886
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,836
-[Si-an] Yeah, I hate it.
-You do?

887
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,464
So that's why I try to smile more often,

888
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,301
to make people feel more comfortable
when they're around me.

889
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,514
[Theo] You do
kind of have cat-like features but…

890
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,058
you're sweet like a puppy.

891
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,977
Talking with you now,

892
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:47,106
you're way different
than my first impression of you.

893
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,107
-You think?
-Yeah.

894
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,359
When I first saw you, you gave off a vibe…

895
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,987
"You're amusing,
I'll pencil in some time for you."

896
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,947
-I did?
-[Theo] Yeah.

897
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:59,368
I may have felt that way
because I thought you were a tough cookie.

898
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,037
-Turns out, you're gentle.
-I have to say--

899
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,541
When we all first met,
you stood out the most.

900
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,458
-Really?
-Mm.

901
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,376
Why?

902
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,546
Your looks.

903
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,175
-My tough looks?
-No.

904
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,304
-You have that clean-cut handsome look.
-[Theo] Seriously?

905
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,388
-Mm.
-Clean-cut?

906
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,347
Yeah.

907
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,433
Oh. Interesting.

908
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,980
You see me the exact opposite way
from how others usually see me.

909
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,398
Hmm.

910
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,234
Parents don't like my looks.

911
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,447
You're handsome. Mm.

912
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,364
-Thanks.
-Mm.

913
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,282
You're pretty.

Ohhh…

00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,332
-Oh, my gosh. What's going on?
-Oh, wow. This is a little…

916
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,292
-They're flirting.
-They really are.

917
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,002
I'm getting too invested.

918
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,838
He's just got this charisma about him.

919
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:53,881
Theo?

920
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:57,051
He sounded so natural
when he said, "You're pretty."

921
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,844
It's so American of him.

922
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,220
-[Hanhae] Totally.
-It is.

923
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,599
Si-an's new demeanor has left
a strong impression on me.

924
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:07,645
Yesterday, it seemed like she was putting
on appearances with Jeong-su.

925
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,939
But today, I could tell
she was showing her natural self.

926
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,484
-She seemed like herself today.
-Right?

927
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:18,405
They weren't talking about much,
but I found myself absorbed.

928
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,534
Seeing them praising each other
made my heart race.

929
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,414
I have to admit,
I'm still a bit unsure about them…

930
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,875
I can tell that they are being transparent

931
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,169
and expressive in their conversations,

932
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:36,298
but I haven't seen any genuine actions
that prove their feelings.

933
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,676
So, I'm not really sure what to say.

934
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,638
I can't put it into words,
because I'm still very uncertain.

935
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,308
For sure, she's slowly getting
wrapped around his finger.

-that I got yesterday.
-Really different.

1178
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,946
I feel closer to them
compared to yesterday.

1179
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,739
-Same.
-But we saw them for what…

1180
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:45,991
For, like, 30 seconds?

1181
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,534
That's true.

1182
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,245
We didn't even get a chance
to talk to them yesterday,

1183
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,873
so maybe that's why they seemed
a little scary at first.

1184
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,919
After having a conversation with Jun-seo,
I guess he's not that scary.

1185
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:58,878
Yeah.

1186
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,756
-But I think he's clumsy, don't you think?
-Yeah.

1187
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,300
I'm curious to get
to know him better though.

-[Hye-jin] Him?
-Really?

1189

I'm curious about both of them.
I'm sure we all are.

1190
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,808
His personality
could be full of surprises.

1191
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,059
So I'm curious.

1192
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,937
People with intimidating looks
are often nicer.

1193
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,147
[Ji-yeon] True.

1194
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,189
[Hye-jin] Okay.

1195
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,774
I'll keep an eye on him.

1196
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,904
Seems like the ladies
are attracted to Jun-seo.

1197
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,824
Jun-seo triggers
a woman's maternal instincts somehow.

1198
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:31,786
He makes them want to take care of him
and he has a tender side.

1199
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:32,871
Mm.

1200
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,874
But Jeong-su feels more manly.
More like a boyfriend.

1201
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,961
I guess contestants
with distinct personalities like Jun-seo

1202
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,921
draw more attention from the start.

1203
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:46,342
This may sound a bit forward,
but I'm into one person.

1204
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,260
-Huh?
-What?

1205
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,554
There's one
I'd like to go to Paradise with.

1206
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,972
-[Kyuhyun] Who is it?
-Who?

1207
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,849
-It's Ji-yeon.
-Oh.

1208
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,267
-[Hanhae] Ji-yeon?
-Why?

1209
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,563
She looks kinda like Sana's doppelgänger.
I'm a fan of hers.

1210
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,982
-She's similar to Sana.
-She does look similar.

1211
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:01,983
-Seriously.
-Right.

1212
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,069
I think Ji-yeon has a charming face.

1213
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,447
-[Kyuhyun] She does look like Sana.
-I see it too.

1214
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,158
As I was watching,
Ji-yeon kept catching my attention.

1215
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,076
Oh, really?

1216
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,328
If placed first,
I would've chosen Ji-yeon.

1217
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,872
-Shouldn't you be objective as a panelist?
-Right.

1218
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:19,542
[light music playing]

1219
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,585
Cheers.

1220
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,128
-With these?
-[chuckles]

1221
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,298
They might make a great couple.

1222
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,092
I wonder how they'll get along.

1223
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,427
-You just want to see Ji-yeon.
-[laughs]

1224
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,012
Yeah, that too.

1225
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,348
Is it good?

1226
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,852
Did you steam these yourself?

1227
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:38,937
-Me?
-Yeah.

1228
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:39,938
I steamed them.

1229
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:40,897
-Made these?
-Yeah.

1230
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,065
-For real?
-No.

1231
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,150
[giggles]

1232
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,986
You're good at cooking, huh?

1233
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,154
I like to cook.

1234
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,074
-I cut myself chopping wood.
-Yeah.

1235
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:51,991
Really?

1236
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,952
-Right here.
-You should be careful.

1237
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:57,705
-Avoid doing any manual labor. Okay?
-Could I ask for your help?

1238
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,499
-I also have.
-Earlier, you said…

1239
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,792
Your finger!

1240
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,669
"I also have…" [cackling]

1241
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,212
"I also have," he said.

1242
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:06,589
-[Kyuhyun] Gosh, I love him.
-[laughing]

1243
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,591
[Kyuhyun] I really like him.

1244
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,260
-I also have…
-Earlier, you said…

1245
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,177
Your finger!

1246
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,222
-We have the same injury.
-Misery loves company.

1247
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,434
-I'm still able to help you.
-[Ji-yeon] Hmm.

1248
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,062
You've already met

1249
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,356
-all the female contestants, right?
-Yup.

1250
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,400
-Only you have.
-Right.

1251
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,402
What was your first impression of me?

1252
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,112
-My first impression of you?
-Mm.

1253
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,490
You were the second one,
next to the one I chose.

1254
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,368
Were you in green yesterday too?

1255
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,203
-Hmm? Mm-mm.
-Sorry. Geez.

1256
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,497
-Hmm? Mm-mm.
-Sorry. Geez.

1257
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,999
I should keep my mouth shut.

1258
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:44,461
-That's why "silence is golden".
-You would've been golden.

1259
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,963
Your hair and outfit seemed colorful.

1260
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,674
That's why I thought you were wearing
a primary color.

1261
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,885
Anyway, you did stand out.

1262
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,261
Hmm.

1263
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,680
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

1264
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:59,976
I know I had a frown on my face
and I just had to choose someone.

1265
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,811
How did you feel in that moment?

1266
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:05,231
-The person next to me got chosen.
-Yeah.

1267
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,400
[Ji-yeon] So, my heart,

1268
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:11,112
I'd be lying
if I said my heart didn't sink a little.

1269
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:12,655
[giggles]

1270
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:14,866
I sulked a bit.

1271
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,327
She's cute.

1272
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,870
[all laugh]

1273
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,042
They make a good couple.
They have good chemistry.

1274
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,378
-You have a good personality.
-[Ji-yeon laughs]

1275
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,257
How do you think I would've reacted
if I was in your situation?

1276
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,217
In my spot?

1277
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,552
-Like, "Shoot."
-You may have gone,

1278
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,387
"Ugh, whatever."

1279
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,598
-I might've been like--
-Like a manly man.

1280
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,601
"Pft" or something.
You really have a good personality.

1281
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,314
Anyway, tell me,
how do you pull off that color?

1282
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,440
-This?
-Yeah.

1283
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,943
Do you like that? The color green?

1284
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,529
-I've liked wearing colorful clothes.
-Ah. Mm.

1285
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,531
It goes well with your hair.

1286
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,698
-[Ji-yeon] Really?
-Yeah.

1287
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,494
You're gonna keep those sunglasses on?

1288
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,204
-These?
-I wanna see your eyes.

1289
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:04,749
I can't do it. I'll take them off
when the moment's right.

1290
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,876
Then I'll just look in another direction.

1291
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,127
[laughs]

1292
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,171
Oh, my. The weather's so nice.

1293
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,339
Your nails are pretty.

1294
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,257
-They are?
-Yeah.

1295
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,925
Did you just get them done?

1296
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,093
Yeah, three days ago.

1297
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,219
[giggles]

1298
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,931
Based off my first impression,

1299
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,767
he seemed charismatic but also a bit cold.

1300
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,104
But now that I've had a chance to chat
with him, he laughed a lot.

1301
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,690
He was very different
from my first impression.

1302
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,567
I'm starving.

1303
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,902
-Peeling meticulously.
-I know. You want some?

1304
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:33,987
Sure. Why not?

1305
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,533
-How was it…
-[Jun-seo] Huh?

1306
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:43,830
…to see the girls you left behind
yesterday acting so miserably?

1307
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:44,956
Miserably?

1308
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,458
[playful music playing]

1309
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,961
I felt really sorry, to be honest

1310
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:52,755
but, I mean,
I was only enslaved to the system.

1311
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,675
-No, I don't think so.
-[Jun-seo] I'm telling you.

1312
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,762
-[Min-seol] Really?
-I wanted to take all six of you.

1313
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,599
-That would be inappropriate.
-That'd be wrong.

1314
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,101
There are rules to follow. I just did…

1315
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:06,686
as I was told.

1316
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,606
I can tell you're introverted

1317
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,108
because when we were with others,
you were quiet.

1318
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,735
But you're talking more now.

1319
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,112
-Well, I'm an introvert. Yeah.
-You know?

1320
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:18,281
-I've become more introverted.
-[chuckles]

1321
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,949
So, what's your MBTI?

1322
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,284
[Min-seol] Take a guess.

1323
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,744
-[Jun-seo] E.
-E?

1324
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,579
Mm. ENTJ?

1325
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,707
You think I'm T? I'm ENFP.

1326
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:28,833
[sighs deeply]

1327
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,209
One hundred percent.

1328
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,003
-You don't look like one.
-Really?

1329
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:35,798
A lot of my friends are that one
and they get along so well with INTP.

1330
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,342
-[Min-seol] I'm ENFP.
-Really?

1331
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,301
It suits me.

1332
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:41,804
It could be a coincidence,
but when I run that test on my friends,

1333
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,556
most of their results are ENFP.

1334
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,350
Isn't that fascinating?

1335
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:46,726
It is.

1336
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,228
[Jun-seo] The truth is…

1337
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,940
How should I put it?
You look a little stuck up.

1338
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,485
-That's my first impression.
-I get that a lot.

1339
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,445
You do, right? You looked a little…

1340
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,197
How do I say this? Kind of cold.

1341
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,531
-Right.
-So I was scared.

1342
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:01,532
-Really?
-Yeah.

1343
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:04,118
-You realize I'm not?
-[Jun-seo] I know you aren't.

1344
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:08,373
[Min-seol] But it was the same for me.
Yesterday, you looked…

1345
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,042
you know, you had your hair untied.

1346
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:12,794
You looked scary.

1347
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:18,591
I thought, "Geez, he's so scary.
I better not talk to him until the end."

1348
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:21,427
But after today, I realized I was wrong.

1349
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,640
Today, you've just been
so friendly towards me.

1350
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:27,809
Well, I'm not so bad.

1351
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,060
[goats bleating]

1352
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,522
The goats agree.

1353
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,315
-Thanks, goats.
-Yeah!

1354
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,360
Why this gesture? [laughing]

1355
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:38,778
It's a sign of gratitude?

1356
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:39,737
-Yeah.
-Really?

1357
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,073
-Has different meanings.
-Goes like this, huh?

1358
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:46,160
The goats are climbing so high.
Some of them are way up there.

1359
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,954
They're welcoming us.

1360
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:48,871
They are.

1361
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,916
He mentioned that ENFP
and INTP were a good match.

1362
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,127
That helped me feel comfortable.

1363
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:56,963
She sure is Gen Z.

1364
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:57,922
[Hanhae] Gen Z.

1365
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,465
-For real.
-[Jin-young] So Gen Z.

1366
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,302
I keep wanting to joke with him
and tease him a bit.

1367
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,929
I get so mischievous.

1368
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,432
What's your ideal man?

1369
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,308
-My type?
-Yeah.

1370
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,601
Take a guess.

1371
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,937
-[Jeong-su] About your type? [chuckles]
-Yeah.

1372
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,606
Okay, fine, my ideal man?

1373
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:19,402
I like someone who is fun
and complements my personality.

1374
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,319
Hmm.

1375
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,654
What are you like?

1376
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,072
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

1377
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,615
People tell me I'm eccentric.

1378
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:28,202
When I'm with my friends,
they often say that I'm funny.

1379
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,747
-Oh. You joke around a lot?
-[laughs]

1380
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,040
-With my friends.
-I wouldn't guess that.

1381
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:34,125
-Really?
-Mm-mm.

1382
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,377
Well, that's what everyone says.

1383
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:40,131
So, you're a weirdo?

1384
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,424
Oh, my gosh.

1385
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,259
-[Jeong-su] Sorry. I'm sorry.
-Stop.

1386
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,802
-I do get that a lot.
-Really?

1387
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,429
-Yeah.
-Then you probably are.

1388
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,222
[both laugh]

1389
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:51,476
Those people are fun to be with.
I really like those types.

1390
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,685
-You do?
-Yeah.

1391
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,771
I'm not sure that I'm a weirdo.

1392
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,689
Well, weirdos never admit it.

1393
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:00,651
-I can't accept that. I won't admit it.
-Right, sure.

1394
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,322
So, tell me,
what was your first impression of me?

1395
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,157
-Huh?
-I mean, you didn't choose me.

1396
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,202
-What?
-You didn't choose me. How did I look?

1397
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,369
-At first?
-Yeah.

1398
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:13,122
Well…

1399
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,500
-to be honest…
-[Hye-jin] Yeah.

1400
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,417
…I was torn.

1401
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,169
You were torn?

1402
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,212
-Really?
-Mm.

1403
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,129
Oh.

1404
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,634
I was torn,
but you didn't smile much at first.

1405
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,594
-I didn't?
-Right.

1406
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:30,014
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was pretty nervous at first.

1407
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,391
I'm shy around strangers.

1408
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,393
[chuckles softly]

1409
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,520
I can see that.

1410
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:36,562
[laughs]

1411
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,231
-Are you being shy with me?
-Huh?

1412
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,441
-A little.
-You're keeping your distance.

1413
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,819
No, that's not true.

1414
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,405
We should all get to know each other.

1415
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,950
[chill music playing]

1416
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,620
First thing I noticed,
we had a similar sense of humor,

1417
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:54,580
so I wanted to talk with him more.

1418
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,916
We only talked for a short amount of time.

1419
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,044
[Min-seol] How should I do
my hair tomorrow?

1420
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,380
This and…

1421
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,424
Wait. I may not get to go. Calm down.

1422
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,136
All this fuss and I might not go.

1423
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,681
I take it back.

1424
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,725
I have a feeling that Min-seol won't go.

1425
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,477
-Why?
-I just feel like she won't.

1426
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,813
-I feel like she'll be left alone.
-Really?

1427
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:22,191
I think Ji-yeon and Jun-seo
are both into each other.

1428
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,235
-Mm.
-They have chemistry.

1429
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,612
Right, they have nice chemistry.

1430
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,656
I'm guessing they'll choose each other.

1431
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,659
Ji-yeon's a former UDT soldiers' favorite?

1432
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,911
-[Da-hee] UDT soldiers?
-[Hanhae] UDT's fav.

1433
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,246
-The favorite.
-I guess.

1434
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,748
[engine revving]

01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,502
[exciting music playing]

1436
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:45,047
[Master] We will now begin
the Paradise-bound couple matching.

1437
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:55,558
Kim Hye-jin,

1438
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:59,228
please name the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

1439
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,897
and hand him your ticket.

1440
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,736
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

1441
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,408
Kim Jeong-su.

1442
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,411
Kim Jeong-su.

1443
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:23,794
KIM HYE-JIN SELECTED KIM JEONG-SU

1444
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:27,173
[suspenseful music playing]

1445
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:34,722
[Master] Kim Jeong-su,

1446
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:38,684
please name the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

1447
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,353
and hand her your ticket.

1448
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,107
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

1449
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,527
Kim Hye-jin.

1450
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,739
Kim Hye-jin.

1451
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:58,537
I knew it. Jeong-su isn't attracted
to delicate ladies. I can see that.

1452
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,665
-Come on, delicate ladies?
-Naive girls.

1453
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:03,376
And they don't have
any control over him either.

1454
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,585
Ohhh.

1455
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:07,129
KIM JEONG-SU SELECTED KIM HYE-JIN

1456
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,637
[Master] Bae Ji-yeon,

1457
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:19,141
please name the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

1458
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,768
and hand him your ticket.

1459
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:26,065
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

1460
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,149
I can't wait.

1461
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,239
[gripping music playing]

1462
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,036
…Yuk Jun-seo.

1463
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,498
[Hanhae] Yes! The former UDT soldier.

1464
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:44,208
That's right.

1465
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:47,294
[upbeat music playing]

1466
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:51,799
BAE JI-YEON SELECTED YUK JUN-SEO

1467
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,978
[Master] Kim Min-seol,

1468
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,898
please name the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

1469
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,608
and hand him your ticket.

1470
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:12,570
[tense music playing]

1471
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,906
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

1472
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:24,707
Yuk Jun-seo.

1473
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,626
[intriguing music playing]

1474
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:37,386
Gosh, her face.

1475
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,138
She's staring.

1476
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,765
Competition's firing up.

1477
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:41,849
My goodness.

1478
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,936
KIM MIN-SEOL SELECTED YUK JUN-SEO

1479
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:51,400
[intriguing music continues]

1480
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:02,953
[Master] Yuk Jun-seo,

1481
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:07,041
please name the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

1482
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,584
and hand her your ticket.

1483
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,506
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

1484
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,971
-Gosh.
-Please, let it be Ji-yeon.

1485
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:24,433
I think he'll choose Ji-yeon.
With Min-seol, he talked about goats.

1486
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,979
-But they got along in my eyes.
-True, he gets along with both.

1487
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:32,858
His conversation with Min-seol
sounded more like friends.

1488
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,489
If you try to fake something,
it'll be obvious.

1489
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:41,200
But things felt the most real
with the girl I chose.

1490
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,870
During our conversation,
we were both being our true selves

1491
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,455
and that's what made us click.

1492
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,249
So I want to take her.

1493
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,550
I'm leaving if it's not Ji-yeon.

1494
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:05,182
[vibrant music playing]

1495
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:10,146
