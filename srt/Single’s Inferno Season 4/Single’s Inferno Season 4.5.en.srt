SINGLE'S INFERNO

14
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,883
<i>The one-on-one conversations are done.</i>

15
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,934
<i>Only one of the three men</i>
<i>who participated in the conversations…</i>

16
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,732
<i>will join</i> Single's <i>Inferno.</i>

17
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,525
What?

18
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,736
What?

19
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,945
This is crazy!

20
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,072
Seriously?

21
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,615
This is crazy, it's so cruel.

22
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,784
It's an audition?

23
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,453
- What on earth?
- Come on. This is too cruel.

24
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,915
This is crazy. Seriously.

25
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,000
This is truly insane.

26
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,461
I feel so bad.

27
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,505
Wow.

28
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,844
Being chosen out of the three men
would make my entrance more meaningful.

29
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,180
So I considered this to be
a big opportunity.

30
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,933
I have a 33 percent chance.

31
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,226
That's not too bad.

32
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,310
It'll be fun.

33
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,022
If I'm not as popular as the other two,

34
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,358
it's an even playing field in Inferno.

35
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,486
If one of the contestants
is more charming than me,

36
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,321
he has every right to succeed.

37
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,324
But I doubt such a person exists.

38
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,077
- They already knew.
- Ahh.

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,287
Wow, I think I'm getting goosebumps.

40
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,415
This might have surprised
our viewers a bit,

41
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,168
but the participants
were informed beforehand

42
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,255
that there would be eliminations,
and all three agreed to it.

43
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,050
Apparently, this competitive aspect
was more appealing to them.

44
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,135
Oh.

45
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,137
They're just that confident.

46
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,472
These guys aren't used to losing
in real life.

47
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,516
They must be feeling confident.

48
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,726
They all thought
they'd make it to Inferno.

49
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,936
Here's the catch.

50
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,438
The women didn't know
there would be an elimination

51
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,357
until after the conversations.

52
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,067
Oh, they didn't?

53
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,444
They probably thought
it was some get-together,

54
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,447
they ended up being tasked
with a serious responsibility.

55
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,950
- Wow.
- Who do you think will survive?

56
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,745
- I think the second guy will survive.
- With his broad shoulders.

57
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,248
- I have a feeling. Yeah.
- I agree with that.

58
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,375
Seong-bo kept smiling with his eyes.

59
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,502
- And his dimple.
- He has one dimple.

60
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,337
He's tall and has striking looks.

61
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,090
- Seong-bo is adorable.
- Look at that dimple.

62
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,676
- Those are first impressions.
- He probably earned…

63
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,636
- His dimple's really cute too.
- Wow.

64
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,722
Ki-ha left a strong impression on me.

65
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,517
He has an adorable face,
but a muscular body.

66
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,728
I feel like he'd be popular
with the girls.

67
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,189
My gut's telling me it'll be Ki-ha.

68
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,400
- He believes in himself.
- Really?

69
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,943
- Inferno material.
- Is he?

70
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,154
Ki-ha's perfect <i>Single's Inferno</i> material.

71
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,698
- You think?
- I totally agree.

72
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,075
The final results will depend

73
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,620
on the female contestants'
personal preferences.

74
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,000
1 HOUR AGO

75
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,045
<i>Now, we'll begin</i>
<i>the one-on-one conversations.</i>

76
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,049
- Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

77
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,092
Have you been to Paradise?

78
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,802
- I've never been.
- Not yet?

79
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,971
No, I was in Inferno the whole time.

80
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,515
Based off my first impression,
I'd assume you had.

81
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,683
- Really?
- For sure.

82
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,684
Yeah.

83
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,270
Is there anything you wanted to ask?

84
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,397
Sure. What's your usual dating style?

85
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:56,277
I usually gravitate towards people
who are on the same wavelength as me.

86
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,696
- Uh-huh?
- That's really important.

87
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,283
- But also, I can be quite playful.
- Mm.

88
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:08,289
Honestly, I'm quite a playful person too.
I like to joke around a lot.

89
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,291
Do you tend to be expressive?

90
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,794
I'm very expressive.

91
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,547
So when I like someone, I'm the type
to make sure she feels reassured.

92
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,716
- Mm.
- Yeah.

93
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,176
Nice.

94
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,596
Having that conversation
with Ki-ha,

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,099
I could tell that we were
on similar wavelengths.

96
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,101
We talked a lot about little things.

97
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,227
It was fun.

98
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,814
What's your usual dating style?

99
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,274
My dating style?

100
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,862
I prefer relationships where we can feel
comfortable around each other

101
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,782
- and be very considerate of each other.
- That's nice.

102
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,827
I like to have a lot of conversations.

103
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,540
So, I would say that I'm capable
of being a good listener, for sure.

104
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,875
Your hair is poking your eye.
Doesn't it hurt?

105
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,836
- Could you get it for me?
- Sure.

106
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,254
Is it really obvious?

107
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,381
Yeah. It's literally touching your eye.

108
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,841
- Hold on.
- Thank you.

109
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,134
This should do it.

110
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,385
All good?

111
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,344
All good.

112
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,888
- Yeah. No worries.
- Thank you.

113
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,392
What I'm getting
from our short conversation

114
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,185
is that you make good eye contact.

115
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,354
- Your presence is very comforting.
- I see.

116
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,856
Really? Thank you.

117
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,025
I feel like we'll have good conversations.

118
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,402
- You do?
- Yeah, I think we'll hit it off.

119
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:20,987
Yeah.

120
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:26,451
My first impression of Ki-ha was that
he was like this glossy gemstone.

121
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,538
"Glossy."

122
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,042
At first, he felt
like a rock-solid, stoic guy,

123
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,586
but he was more
detail-oriented than I thought.

124
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,630
What is your usual type?
As in, type of guy.

125
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,384
I like someone humorous
who vibes with me personality-wise.

126
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,343
- Got it.
- Yeah.

127
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,971
I also like people
with a similar sense of humor.

128
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,891
And I like someone
who is full of surprises.

129
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,227
I like someone with sharp looks,
but a softer personality.

130
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,270
Ah…

131
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,857
Mm-hmm, yeah, exactly.

132
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,317
I'm a bit like that too.

133
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,028
People tell me
I look intimidating at first,

134
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,155
but that doesn't match my personality.

135
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,910
Ki-ha
has an innocent-looking face,

136
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,453
but if I'm being honest,

137
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,998
he has got one of the hottest bodies
I've ever seen.

138
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,920
He was
extremely comfortable to talk to,

139
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,172
and ten minutes went by so fast with him.

140
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,176
That's why…
I need to talk with him some more.

141
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,762
What do you think?

142
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,598
More nerve-wracking than expected?

143
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,183
Much more.

144
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,434
- Really?
- Yeah.

145
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,105
Believe it or not, I'm never this shy.

146
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,941
- Oh, you're being shy?
- Yeah, this place, it's really…

147
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,318
I can't seem to calm my nerves.

148
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,236
Yeah.

149
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,907
I understand. I've been through it too,
but you'll get used to it quickly.

150
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,493
The guys are really great,
they'll help you.

151
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,540
I'm not sure if it's okay to tell you
this so soon, but…

152
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,543
- You articulate so well.
- Really?

153
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,212
Yeah. You speak very eloquently.

154
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,674
- You think so? Wow. Thank you.
- Hm.

155
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,925
How do you do that?

156
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,427
I've seriously never been told
that before.

157
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,394
The most memorable one for me
was definitely Seong-bo.

158
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,813
His outfit was my taste.

159
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,733
Talking with him wasn't as awkward
as I thought it'd be.

160
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,068
I was very comfortable.

161
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:26,821
Have you had fun?

162
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,909
Well, it's fun at times, but it can also
kind of mess with your head.

163
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,162
Why? What makes you say that?

164
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:39,292
Well, some people are left behind
in Inferno while others get to leave.

165
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,712
Seeing that happen again and again
has definitely got me thinking.

166
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,717
- What? What?
- You're very…

167
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,137
I feel like you could be in the arts
or teach kids.

168
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,182
Is it because I elaborate too much?

169
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,144
You explain things so well
as if you're talking to a child.

170
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,771
Not to mention…

171
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,607
your smile.

172
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,986
- You smile a lot. It's really nice.
- It is? Thank you.

173
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,405
- It's a pretty smile too.
- Thank you so much.

174
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:18,039
When he first came in to meet the girls,
I saw him just sitting there,

175
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,791
and I didn't initially think
his overall looks

176
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,668
gave off a kind-hearted impression.

177
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,838
But he smiled at me
while looking into my eyes,

178
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,924
so that was an unexpected surprise.

179
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,472
Do you often hear
that you have a pretty smile?

180
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:35,973
- Me?
- Yeah.

181
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,433
Oh.

182
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,102
Only from people
who see me in a good light.

183
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,812
I'd say it's your default.

184
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,856
Is it?

185
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,359
- I have a smiling default face too.
- Yours too.

186
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,110
I can recognize one of my own.

187
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,655
True.

188
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,323
I see you don't drink champagne,

189
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,991
so let's toast with water?

190
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,159
Sure. Thank you.

191
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,000
- On a different note, what's your type?
- Mine?

192
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,545
I mentioned just now.

193
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,716
- I like a guy with a pretty smile.
- Why do I feel you're hesitating?

194
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,428
No, it's just that I mentioned
you had a pretty smile,

195
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,181
so it's embarrassing to say
I like someone with one.

196
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,684
- What else? Appearance-wise.
- In terms of looks?

197
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,145
Someone with thin, elegant eyelids.
I don't like when they're thick.

198
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,939
- But mine look okay?
- They do.

199
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,857
Don't worry.

200
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,820
What's your type?

201
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,739
Honestly, I like someone
with a sense of humor.

202
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,991
Hmm.

203
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,910
- I like someone who vibes with me.
- That makes sense.

204
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,454
I also like someone with a quiet,
feminine nature…

205
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,957
Oh, I wanted to say something.

206
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,083
Quickly.

207
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,710
I wanted to play a joke on you.

208
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,879
- Next time.
- Okay.

209
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,964
Bye.

210
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,133
He said, "Next time."

211
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,097
My heart.

212
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,769
That won't leave my head now.

213
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,315
- What?
- You said you wouldn't waver!

214
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,608
Hold up.

215
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,901
- Oh, whatever.
- No surprise here.

216
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,613
- Come on. My gosh.
- I knew she'd waver.

217
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,865
You said your name's Hye-jin?

218
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,408
- Yes. Yeah.
Right? Great.

219
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,201
You have a good memory.

220
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,663
I couldn't memorize all the names,
but I memorized yours.

221
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,748
Hye-jin.

222
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,751
I heard that you already went to Paradise.

223
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,960
I did.

224
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,046
I see.

225
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,133
I guess one of the guys over there's
interested in you.

226
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,010
There was one.

227
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,220
Wait, that was past tense?

228
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,182
- Yeah.
- You went with him, but he wasn't…

229
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,309
I think I'll be having a change of heart.

230
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,102
A change of heart?

231
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,438
- What did you first think of me?
- First impression?

232
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,690
I thought
you kind of have that Barbie look.

233
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,900
Oh.

234
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,026
Mm.

235
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,404
Kind of like, "Oh, a talking doll?"
Something like that.

236
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,823
Wow.

237
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,950
Jong-hoon is good. Uh…

238
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,578
"Oh, a talking doll?" Something like that.

239
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,621
For real?

240
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,706
Yeah, that's why, you know…

241
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,001
Out of all six women,
you're the first to come here

242
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,588
and you've made this so relaxing for me
that I'm really enjoying this.

243
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,008
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yeah. I am.

244
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,844
After talking to him,

245
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,222
I have a feeling
that Jong-hoon is a sweet guy.

246
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,725
Looks-wise, he's got the best body,

247
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,144
so he's closest to being my ideal type.

248
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,481
Do you like drinking?

249
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,566
It depends.

250
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,861
I like pairing drinks
with my food, sometimes.

251
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,863
Is there anything here we could pair?

252
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,117
I'm coming here from Inferno,
so everything just tastes so good.

253
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,870
I'm sure we'll finish it all really fast.

254
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,080
- For sure?
- Yeah.

255
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,124
You definitely smile a lot.

256
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,751
- I never knew that about myself.
- Really?

257
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,503
But people have been saying that.

258
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,839
Earlier when I was over here,

259
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,383
you were sitting at the very end, right?

260
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,635
But I noticed how you kept smiling.

261
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,761
Yeah.

262
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,888
Yeah, I guess I do smile quite a bit.

263
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,225
- I bet you're pretty popular.
- Oh, you think so?

264
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,687
So then, what's your type of guy?

265
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,022
I like someone that's dignified.

266
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,023
Someone dignified?

267
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,404
You know, someone distinguished who still
has a positive attitude towards life.

268
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:22,116
Just anyone who I think fits into my idea
of being a dignified person.

269
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,951
I like people who are well-mannered.

270
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,081
When I asked him about his type,

271
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,251
he said he liked someone who smiles a lot
and is well-mannered,

272
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,254
which was similar
to what I had in mind as my type.

273
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,049
So in that sense,
I imagine we'd get along very well.

274
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,429
You speak very softly.
What's your personality like?

275
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,182
It depends if I'm at work
or with my friends.

276
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,476
Oh, okay. Well, how would you treat…

277
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,810
- Girlfriends?
- Yeah.

278
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,980
Honestly, I always try
to be really good to them.

279
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,733
- So you're sweet?
- I try my best to take care of them.

280
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,902
Compared to seeing you from afar,

281
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,154
you give off
such a different vibe up close.

282
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,280
Oh, different how?

283
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,825
From a distance,
you seemed quite intimidating,

284
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,828
but up close,
I see that you have a sweet face.

285
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,413
- Really?
- Yeah.

286
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,540
I'd say a pretty and kind-looking face.

287
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,458
I'm glad.

288
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,002
- That's a compliment, right?
- The best compliment.

289
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,216
- When I was first walking towards you…
- Yeah?

290
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,552
- …I started smiling.
- I have a funny face?

291
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,554
- 'Cause you were smiling.
- Oh, was I?

292
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,182
- And honestly, it made me feel great.
- Why?

293
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,852
I usually don't care so much about looks,

294
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,230
but in that moment, that's when I thought,

295
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,690
"Oh, wait,
maybe I do actually care about looks."

296
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,651
- Oh, really? Do you?
- Yeah.

297
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,236
I mean…

298
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,155
Your face is so engaging.

299
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,156
Thank you.

300
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,037
I could sense
that he was flirting with me.

301
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,957
I guess that left quite
an impression on me.

302
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,875
Wow.

303
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,753
- They have their own unique charms.
- They do.

304
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,049
I thought Seong-bo
was adorable and charming from the start.

305
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,803
Hearing him talk made me realize
he's even more charming than I'd thought.

306
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:06,971
Yeah.

307
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,931
Min-seol seems
to have fallen for Seong-bo.

308
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,057
For sure.

309
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,725
She might even choose him.

310
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,310
And they look good together.

311
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,691
Ki-ha could've controlled his nerves a bit
while having those conversations.

312
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,608
Exactly.

313
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,279
His nerves probably made him less charming
to the female contestants.

314
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,739
Seong-bo shined the most here.

315
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,075
I agree, he was the least forced.

316
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,370
I didn't think Jong-hoon
would be a smooth talker,

317
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,706
so that was a bit of a pleasant surprise.

318
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,292
It felt like Jong-hoon
was putting his all into it.

319
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,794
- He seemed very committed,
- "Very committed."

320
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,590
Despite his strong features,
he talks so softly and…

321
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,675
His features soften when he smiles.

322
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,343
He's good at giving compliments.

323
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,433
<i>The one-on-one conversations are done.</i>

324
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:57,646
<i>Only one of the three men</i>
<i>who participated in the conversations…</i>

325
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,858
<i>will join</i> Single's <i>Inferno.</i>

326
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,777
What?

327
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,697
No way.

328
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,115
This is crazy.

329
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,534
This is crazy. Seriously.

330
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,578
- This is truly insane.
- Wow.

331
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,207
<i>The contestant who gets to join</i>
<i>will be chosen by you.</i>

332
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,375
Gosh.

333
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,710
I'm getting goosebumps.

334
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,129
It's so brutal that we have to choose.

335
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,339
I know.

336
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,468
<i>The other two men</i>
<i>who do not get chosen today</i>

337
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,846
<i>will be eliminated…</i>

338
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,932
- What?
- Eliminated?

339
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,058
<i>…and sent home today.</i>

340
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,643
Oh…

341
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,312
This was a survival game for them.

342
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,396
Insane.

343
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,357
What do we do?

344
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,651
Wow, I mean…

345
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,195
I thought it was super cruel.

346
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,155
I never would've imagined.

347
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:53,118
Based on my choice,
the two others will have to go home,

348
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,246
and the thought of that
is a lot of pressure.

349
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,498
I know.

350
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,294
I had one person in mind
who I'd like to go to Paradise with,

351
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,631
but knowing two will be eliminated,
I'm suddenly torn.

352
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,549
Exactly.

353
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,969
Have you decided?

354
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,056
My head hurts.

355
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:19,937
I just keep thinking that the man I like
may not get to go to Inferno with us.

356
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,565


357
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,416
Min-seol will choose Seong-bo.

358
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,501
- Yeah.
- Don't act torn.

359
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,586
Come on.

360
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,602
<i>The results will be announced.</i>

361
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,357
Oh, my.

362
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,319
<i>The man</i>
<i>who has been chosen will be…</i>

363
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,156
<i>revealed now.</i>

364
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,783
Is there a grand entrance?

365
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,702
- He'll fling the door open.
- Oh, gosh.

366
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,328
I wonder who it's gonna be.

367
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,044
I voted for Kwon Ki-ha.

368
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,882
The talk I had with him
left a lasting impression on me.

369
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,761
I voted for Hong Seong-bo.

370
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,055
My talk with him was the most fun.

371
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,183
See? I knew she'd choose him.

372
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,560
- It was pretty obvious.
- Definitely.

373
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,733
Because he's closest to my type,
I chose Jong-hoon.

374
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,903
KIM HYE-JIN SELECTED AN JONG-HOON

375
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,197
They're so divided.

376
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,491
- They each got one vote.
- Gosh.

377
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,909
They must be nervous again.

378
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,790
I chose the person
who I wanted to stay the most.

379
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,999
I voted for Jong-hoon.

380
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,628
LEE SI-AN SELECTED AN JONG-HOON

381
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,466
He felt the most truthful,
so I voted for Hong Seong-bo.

382
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,968
KIM A-RIN SELECTED HONG SEONG-BO

383
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,518
I thought
spending time with him in Inferno

384
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103
might change things for me,

385
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,562
so that's why I chose him.

386
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,858
Down to the last vote.
You-jin's vote is unpredictable.

387
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,152
She mentioned all three in her interview.

388
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,655
I think it might be Jong-hoon.

389
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,990
I think it might be Seong-bo.

390
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,785
- I guess Jong-hoon.
- I'm guessing him too.

391
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,166
It's opening.

392
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,796
Who?

393
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,422
- Someone's coming.
- Who is it?

394
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,847
Who?

395
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,694
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

396
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,736
Oh.

397
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,863
Wee.

398
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,284
It's Jong-hoon.

399
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,994
It's Jong-hoon. Whoa.

400
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,163
He got half of the votes.

401
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,544
You must be delighted.

402
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,046
Yeah, I feel great.

403
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,965
- Thank you.
- Wow.

404
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,303
- What a relief.
- Yeah.

405
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,721
Awesome.

406
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,473
Oh, gosh.

407
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,852
He has a pretty smile.

408
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,813
He looks macho,
but he has a softness to him.

409
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,608
- His smile is a pleasant surprise.
- He's cute.

410
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,281
<i>We will now begin</i>

411
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,825
<i>the Paradise-bound couple matching.</i>

412
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,580
Whoa.

413
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,665
Poor them. The tables have turned.

414
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,250
I'm so curious who he'll pick.

415
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,044
<i>An Jong-hoon,</i>

416
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,714
<i>you may now choose two female contestants</i>

417
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,758
<i>that you would like to go</i>
<i>to Paradise with.</i>

418
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,800
What?

419
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,178
- It'll be so much fun.
- Wow.

420
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,846
Maybe You-jin and Si-an?

421
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,973
Si-an is going for sure.

422
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,017
The question is, You-jin or Hye-jin?

423
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,687
With You-jin, he complimented her smile
a lot during their chat.

424
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,688
Right.

425
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,067
But remember, he also said Hye-jin
was like a talking Barbie.

426
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,198
I am choosing to go to Paradise with…

427
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,920
Kim Hye-jin.

428
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,005
Kim Hye-jin.

429
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,051
And I also choose Lee Si-an.

430
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,599
Thank goodness it's done.

431
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,936
I feel sorry for You-jin.

432
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,355
Her smile didn't work for her this time.

433
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,441
Then why did he tell her
she had a pretty smile?

434
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,987
INFERNO

435
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,780
Dinner time already?

436
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,366


437
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,623
- The sun's too bright. Let's sit here.
- Okay.

438
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,625
In the shade.

439
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,627
- On one side?
- Sure.

440
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,337
- Okay.
- What's with the menu?

441
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,547
You're kidding me.

442
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,215
Enjoy, guys.

443
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,591
Bon appetit.

444
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,051
- Enjoy.
- Bon appetit.

445
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,430
Why do I feel so weak?

446
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,307
- Same.
- I have no energy.

447
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,102
What kind of guy do you think will join?

448
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,229
Probably someone muscular.

449
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,565
- Athletic.
- 190 centimeters tall?

450
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,482
That's crazy.

451
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,068
Probably someone perfect in every way.

452
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,408
I'm curious.

453
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,995
- I wonder what he's like.
- Same.

454
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,039
Everyone's…

455
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,458
- They've become timid.
- Why are they so gloomy?

456
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,876
There are no girls.

457
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,259
Oh, someone's here.

458
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,511
- Who?
- Someone new.

459
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,306
- It's only fair the guys get someone.
- Oh.

460
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,725
Time to light a fire under them.

461
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,907
It might be someone cheerful?

462
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,743
I have a feeling
he'll be the total package.

463
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,496
They're not expecting anything.

464
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,248
They're only talking
about the new male member.

465
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,793
- Then, suddenly…
- A change is coming.

466
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,675
Wait.

467
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,887
What?

468
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,182
Who's that?

469
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,270
Hello.

470
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,106
- Have a seat.
- Gosh.

471
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,441
- Have a seat.
- Hello.

472
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,489
Who is she?

473
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,867
At first,
I thought the girls might be back.

474
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,079
She got closer and I was surprised,
an unfamiliar pretty face.

475
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,914
Hello.

476
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,999
Gosh.

477
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,544
<i>My name's Park Hae-lin.</i>

478
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,088
- She's so gorgeous.
- She's pretty.

479
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,214
Yeah.

480
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,926
If I were to describe my personality
in a few words,

481
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,596
I'd say I'm cool, accountable,
lovable, and sweet.

482
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:57,602
<i>People are always charmed</i>
<i>by my height and unique proportions.</i>

483
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,439
<i>I'm such an extrovert,</i>

484
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,609
<i>so I may seem</i>
<i>like a bulldozer on the outside.</i>

485
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,404
But the truth is,
when I'm around someone I like,

486
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:11,366
I sometimes get really nervous,
awkward and clumsy in my own way.

487
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,786
My favorite part of dating
is seeing someone blush

488
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,539
and then become all shy
when I flirt with them.

489
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,791
It makes my heart race.

490
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,295
Hello.

491
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,796
- Do I sit here?
- Yes.

492
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,424
- Please take a seat.
- Okay.

493
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:28,884
Take a seat here.

494
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,430
I thought she had an exotic beauty to her.

495
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,016
She could be
the most beautiful one here.

496
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,226
Her looks immediately struck me.

497
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,271
Those big eyes of hers were glowing.

498
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,149
The atmosphere in Inferno
is definitely gonna change.

499
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,988
So, what's your name?

500
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,367
My name is Park Hae-lin,
spelled with an A and E for "Hae".

501
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,036
- Park Hae-lin.
- Yes.

502
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,038
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

503
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,956
The air shifted suddenly.

504
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,334
We were all leaning back
like this earlier.

505
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,337
You like to laugh.

506
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,550
It's hot.

507
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,804
Have you had dinner yet?

508
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,890
I actually just had lunch.

509
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,353
Oh, then have this for now,
and later, we can…

510
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,896
You wanna eat?

511
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,441
- Can I just have water, please?
- Sure

512
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,610
- Thank you.
- Wow.

513
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,279
Wow.

514
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,490
- If you eat now, we…
- You move fast.

515
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,159
Since when was Te-hwan that quick?

516
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,245
Why is he taking initiative?

517
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,169
We were all really bored,
but now that you're here,

518
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,295
we're all smiles now.

519
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,424
We were expecting to see
the new guy instead.

520
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,718
- We were all sure.
- We were 100 percent sure.

521
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,178
How come? Why?

522
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,848
Because we currently have five men
and six women.

523
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,184
Which means there might be
two new guys there.

524
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,352
It's a possibility.

525
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,229
What do you mean, "there"?

526
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,358
All of the female contestants
went to Paradise.

527
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,196
Just the women?

528
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,489
Just them.

529
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,865
Really?

530
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,867
Then, it's just gonna be us today?

531
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,287
- We don't know.
- We can't be sure.

532
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,622
Oh, there's really no way to find out?

533
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,624
The predictions we made were wrong.

534
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,126
What kinds of predictions?

535
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,713
Some guy who's 188 centimeters tall.

536
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,882
- Taller, with a muscular build.
- Above 190.

537
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,884
Honestly, I was so happy.

538
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,096
Since only the men were there,

539
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,599
I thought it would be a good opportunity
for me to stand out more.

540
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,893
I wanted one-on-one conversations.

541
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,022
One was my ideal man personality-wise,

542
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,857
the other was ideal looks-wise,

543
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,775
so I wanted to get to know them.

544
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,403
So, what do you think?

545
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,324
In terms of first impressions,
she's my top pick.

546
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,950
- Nice.
- Yeah, in my opinion…

547
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,830
- she'll do well…
- Yeah.

548
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,457
…as the game changer.

549
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,710
I know, right? She's really cheerful too.

550
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,504
She's got the traits that men like.

551
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,340
She seems to have a lot.

552
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,343
- Her personality is…
- It's great.

553
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,012
And I was fascinated by all her responses.

554
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,598
She seems to be quite self-assured too.

555
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,350
What about her looks?

556
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,934
Her overall appearance.

557
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:30,148
Looks-wise, she's very close
to what I had in mind as my ideal woman.

558
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,025
I thought so. You like that kind of…

559
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,485
- Hm.
- Yeah.

560
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,446
She's definitely sexy
but with a tinge of cuteness.

561
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,698
- Right.
- So, yeah, she's very attractive.

562
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,119
She's the closest
to what I've envisioned as my ideal woman.

563
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,164
I think she's really charming.

564
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,667
Remember when we all took
a Polaroid together earlier?

565
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,962
Do you all have
to stay in a line like that?

566
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,839
- Should we…
- What do you want to do?

567
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,841
- Should we huddle?
- Tell us what you…

568
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,719
- I can take the picture from there.
- I'll go behind you.

569
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,680
- Good?
- Yeah.

570
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,016
Two, three.

571
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,730
She looked like
a celebrity in a magazine.

572
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,025
- Like being with someone famous.
- She looks amazing.

573
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,528
- She stands out.
- She seems cool and stylish.

574
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,114
The thing is,
the girls don't know about this.

575
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,533
I feel like this will put them on edge.

576
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,744
- She's like on a whole other level.
- She's steep competition.

577
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,581
- We haven't seen someone like her yet.
- Yeah.

578
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,126
Jeong-su doesn't usually fall
this quickly.

579
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,335
- Right.
- He doesn't.

580
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,379
Now he's saying she's his ideal woman.

581
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,090
Plus, she's not the sassy type,

582
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:40,176
she's social and gets along with everyone,
makes her more appealing.

583
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,344
That's true.

584
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,477
Hello.

585
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,604
- You only took a beer, so…
- Wow.

586
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,733
I thought, since we were all talking,
you wouldn't have eaten.

587
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,025
Oh, great.

588
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,694
- I thought…
- Yeah?

589
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,030
- You might be starving later.
- Okay.

590
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,575
Like the Last Supper.

591
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,576
How is it?

592
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,829
Different from what you expected?

593
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,664
It is.

594
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,460
- Why the honorifics?
- Mm.

595
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,377
1 HOUR AGO

596
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,005
- You guys haven't dropped the honorifics?
- No.

597
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,466
- Just in case?
- We don't know each other's age.

598
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,968
- Let's drop them.
- For real?

599
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,930
But is it really okay if I call you
by your first name?

600
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,015
Go ahead.

601
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,019
- I kinda…
- Yeah.

602
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,313
…needed some downtime.

603
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,648
I get that.

604
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,651
It's warm here though.

605
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,069
If only the wind stopped.

606
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,654
Yeah, I think that would help.

607
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,574
Now isn't the best time to enjoy the view.

608
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,076
- You're right.
- It's beautiful during the day.

609
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,121
- I can hardly see anything but…
- Yeah.

610
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,498
…this view isn't bad.

611
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,958
- This view?
- This view.

612
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,543
Wait, what?

613
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,170
I'm touched.

614
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,507
No, I mean… Move over a little,
I wanna see the view behind you.

615
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,225
So, how was Paradise?

616
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,351
Paradise?

617
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,019
It was nice.

618
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,815
Was it? How did you get to go there?

619
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,819
Well, it just…
Due to the circumstances, I had to go.

620
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,237
"Circumstances?"

621
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,697
I take that back,
since I did choose someone.

622
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,115
Oh.

623
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,534
Hm.

624
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,744
"Circumstances."

625
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,373
He tends to be a little evasive, that guy.

626
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,334
- Da-hee, why are you so angry?
- It's nothing, it's just…

627
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,461
- He wants to get on her good side.
- He does.

628
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,505
Saying that was a bit cowardly.

629
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,549
- Right.
- Yeah, even he realized

630
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,717
what he said was wrong,
so he took it back.

631
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,804
It shows how interested he is in Hae-lin.

632
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:52,559
It's true, now that I've been there twice,
who you go with does matter.

633
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,726
It makes a difference.

634
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,645
It felt totally different.

635
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,273
I came back as friends with one of them.

636
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,109
- Friends?
- We were even shoulder-checking.

637
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,403
- Like, "Hey, bro."
- What about the other one?

638
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,031
- I… I talked with her a lot.
- I see.

639
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,950
What is she like?

640
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,164
- Mm, she has a different vibe from you.
- Does she have more of a…

641
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,542
- Uh-huh?
- …pure and innocent vibe?

642
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,587
- Is that right?
- You don't think that's your vibe?

643
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,629
Honestly,

644
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,716
I don't give off
pure and innocent.

645
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,427
- You're right.
- I bombarded you with many questions.

646
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,428
Not at all.

647
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,222
I have many questions, in general.

648
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,266
Your hair, the wind is… I'll help.

649
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,811
Your hair, the wind is… I'll help.

650
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,273
I don't think there's much he can do.

651
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,322
- Keep an eye on my hair.
- Okay. I'll keep an eye on it.

652
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,324
Got it.

653
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,160
So, there's no one you like yet?

654
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,248
Well, I mean, I guess
I'm still getting to know them.

655
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,541
I get that.

656
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,044
Honestly, yesterday
was my first night in Inferno

657
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,463
and there was someone
I only just met yesterday.

658
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,924
I haven't had a proper chat
with some of them.

659
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,844
- Okay.
- So…

660
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,555
Mm.

661
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,683
But there's one I'm interested in.

662
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,272
And you?

663
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,151
I also… I actually…

664
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,571
I think…

665
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,867
I feel like you're older than me.

666
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,370
Sorry, I used honorifics again.

667
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,499
So far, you're closest
to how I picture my ideal man.

668
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,458
Really?

669
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,589
I mean, when you smile, you have these…
Do you call them dimples?

670
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,757
What are they called?

671
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,010
- Those little crevices?
- Dimples?

672
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,888
Yeah, those.
I like people with those features.

673
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,515
- Hm. Thank you.
- Yeah.

674
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,393
That's just me.

675
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,228
Geez.

676
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,854
I'm going a little crazy.

677
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,147
- You are?
- Huh?

678
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,401
Really? Maybe I was being too direct.

679
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,445
- Me too.
- Hm?

680
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,323
Out of all the girls here,

681
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,785
your looks are the closest to
what I've imagined for my ideal woman.

682
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,787
- Really?
- Yeah.

683
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,164
What does your ideal woman look like?

684
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,253
Not sure, but I saw you
and thought you were pretty.

685
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,046
- Thought you were pretty.
- You did?

686
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,466
- I like that.
- I bet.

687
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,719
So…

688
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,138
We better talk a lot then.

689
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,598
Yeah, we need to talk
to get to know each other.

690
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,811
Am I moving too fast? I have to though.

691
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,106
In your case, you need to move fast.

692
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,900
Mm.

693
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:49,902
I should.

694
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,824
I think you need to and that's why
I'm being so forward and honest.

695
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,830
Love must be conquered.

696
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,459
Conquering. Is that what you're doing?

697
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,210
It is.

698
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,673
Yeah.

699
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,884
What?

700
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,557
- Their chemistry is just…
- Wow.

701
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,018
- They're on a roll, these two.
- Wow.

702
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,146
If someone acted all lovable
towards me like that,

703
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,981
I might fall under her spell.

704
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,858
- Right?
- Just like that.

705
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,735
They're both so desirable…

706
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,947
that they must be used to having
experiences like this all the time.

707
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:35,907
Sure.

708
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,993
That's probably why
they're so smooth and effortless.

709
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,080
I don't see any awkwardness
or shyness at all.

710
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,083
They're so good-looking,
it gives them confidence

711
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,751
to be open with their feelings.

712
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:51,464
But she mentioned her ideal man
would have a personality like hers, right?

713
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,381
Yeah.

714
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,634
It's great between these two.

715
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,595
- Hi.
- What were you doing?

716
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,223
Just waiting for you.

717
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,766
What do you think?

718
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,270
Is there anyone here
that you're already vibing with

719
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,980
and want to get to know more?

720
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,275
If I'm being honest,

721
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,362
you, Dong-ho…

722
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,989
Should I address you by your first name?

723
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,659
- You can call me "bro" if you want.
- Mr. Dong-ho…

724
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,577
Hey, that's way too formal.

725
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,455
Based off first impressions,
your personality's the best.

726
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,332
Yeah.

727
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,126
So…

728
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,336
Well, I was torn,

729
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,257
because it was taking longer
than I expected to talk to everybody.

730
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:40,138
I couldn't decide if I should talk
to you last, after everybody else, or not.

731
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,349
Whether to treat me
like the main dish, or some appetizer?

732
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,600
What are you saying?

733
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,603
- I'm just playing, it's a joke.
- You're so funny.

734
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,606
I thought about that,
but I decided to see you sooner.

735
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,193
It was nice to see
that you weren't acting awkward at all

736
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,989
around all these new guys
who were already friends with each other.

737
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,949
Mm.

738
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,326
I've always found
such qualities in a woman

739
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,078
to be interesting and charming.

740
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,748
- I've always thought that.
- Mm.

741
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,297
How would you describe your personality?

742
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,465
- Mine?
- Yeah, just be honest.

743
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,802
- How would you?
- So far, I've been very honest with you.

744
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,389
Some people try to impress others
without realizing it. I do.

745
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,602
I'd be lying if I said I never did that.

746
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,147
Normally, I'd sit like this,
but I looked it up online.

747
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,025
- It said you should…
- Why'd you look that up?

748
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,694
If you look up "cool guy poses",
this pose comes up.

749
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,614
- What? Like this?
- Sit up straight.

750
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,158
Straighten your back.
Like this, so I'm doing it.

751
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,785
- What a random search.
- For real? Mm.

752
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,120
Like this?

753
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,833
Anyway.

754
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,670
Oh, right,
you were asking about my personality.

755
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,131
I tend to be a perfectionist

756
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,259
when it comes to things in my life
that I enjoy.

757
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,221
Especially when it comes
to dating and work.

758
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,849
When I get obsessed with something,
that's all I focus on.

759
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:10,019
What about you?
How would you describe your personality?

760
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,771
I'm the total opposite,

761
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,482
but I think that's why
I like you even more.

762
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,277
Ah, got you.

763
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,490
For me, in terms of my work,
there's always so much I want to do.

764
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,203
So I've always needed someone
to help balance me out,

765
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,038
who can keep my feet on the ground.

766
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,248
Oh.

767
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,333
- That's fascinating.
- Mm.

768
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,629
Seeing how you talk
so comfortably with men,

769
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,091
you're probably
just as comfortable with women.

770
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,759
No one's caught your eye so far?

771
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,012
I wouldn't put it that way.

772
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:49,058
You can't always expect chemistry
with the person you're interested in.

773
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,059
That's true.

774
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,477
It's only been a few days.

775
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,606
When I first got here,
I was more serious than I needed to be

776
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,191
and had lots of ups and downs.

777
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,986
I tried asking others for advice,

778
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,906
but people here have
an easy-going approach to life.

779
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,702
I used to get in my head when I was alone,

780
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,747
I'd just be waiting nonstop
for the person I thought was the one.

781
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,958
- Who's that person?
- I used to do that.

782
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,711
I'd be waiting
for the person I thought was the one.

783
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,463
- Who's that person?
- I used to do that.

784
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,008
- I'm joking.
- But on day four…

785
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,010
Geez, you're getting me all flustered.

786
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,595
You're really messing with me.

787
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,683
- He's cute.
- He's crumbling.

788
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,102
But this is what makes him so charming.

789
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,191
- It's been tough? The past three days?
- It really wasn't.

790
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,445
Well, it is Inferno.

791
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,324
And now?

792
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,077
Well, now…

793
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,414
What, you weren't prepared
for that question?

794
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,630
When she's with Dong-ho,
she's showing a different side.

795
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,967
Absolutely. Personally,
this side of her felt more entertaining.

796
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,844
I do think it's because Dong-ho

797
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,306
always kept his poker face
no matter who he was talking to.

798
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,099
- Right.
- Always had his guard up.

799
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,727
This is the first time
I've ever seen him crumble.

800
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,312
- Right.
- He got flustered.

801
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,439
You can tell by his facial expression.

802
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,984
Him smiling slightly
and his eyes lighting up.

803
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,529
- He's forgotten about A-rin.
- His eyes are like…

804
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,198
towards Hae-lin.

Hmm.

828
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:31,262
The reason is because ten minutes
went by the fastest with you.

829
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,139
I mean it.

830
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,767
Those ten minutes
really felt so short with you.

Oh, really? Okay, then.

…out of all six of you,
I wanted to talk to you some more.

Our turn was last, right?

835
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,112
- That's right.

00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,118

00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,162
You gave off the best one.

00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,413
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

839
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,498
'Cause you flashed that bright smile.

840
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,250
If I remember correctly,

841
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,379
you were standing in the middle
of all the other girls, right?

00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,966
I just remember seeing someone in white
showing me the brightest smile,

and that was you.

844
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,845
Yeah, so I thought,

845
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,057
"This might be fun.
I want to go to Inferno."

846
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,559

You're so honest.

857
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,090
I see.

00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,220
During my date with Si-an,

859
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,513
it was awkward at first,

860
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,099
but it became comfortable
as we got to know each other's jobs

861
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,768

00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,562
Oh.

873
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,479
Mm.

874
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,233
Well, do you think
we should drop the honorifics?

875
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,276
Sure.

876
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,902
All right.

877
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,656
I feel like we'll become close
much quicker if we drop them.

878
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,284
You're right, that's true.

879
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,368
For sure.

880
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,914
I know we'll get to know each other
more and more as we talk,

881
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,083
but based on first impressions,

882
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,754
I honestly thought
it would be really hard to talk to you.

883
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,756
But then you…

884
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,718
Do you remember earlier,
there were some dishes on the table?

885
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,261
- Bar snacks--
- Dessert.

886
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,929
- I mean, dessert.
- "Bar snacks."

887
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,266
I must've said that out of habit.

888
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,604
There was dessert
and you were the only one who had some.

889
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,314
- Really?
- Yeah.

890
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,940
But it was there for us to eat.

891
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,193
- Of course. We were meant to eat it.
- I just really wanted some.

892
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,364
I know, but seeing the way you ate,
I found it really adorable.

893
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,907
I found it really adorable.

894
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:39,908
- You did?
- Yeah.

895
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,787
So, how was Inferno?

896
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,539
Inferno?

897
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,207
You can talk after you finish.

898
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,460
- Okay.
- Have some water.

899
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:58,010
I thought you'd have an attitude like,
"No, I'm not interested."

900
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:01,430
I thought you'd be like that,
by your looks, but you were actually…

901
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,932
easy-going.

902
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,477
You were trying
to make things comfortable for me.

903
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,355
I really liked that a lot.

904
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,234
I can't wait to go to Inferno.

905
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,904
I bet it's exciting, with all that ocean.

906
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,740
- It's fun.
- Is it?

907
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,741
Yeah.

908
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,868
- Now it'll be more fun.
- Okay.

909
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,495
I can't wait.

910
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,540
As for my date with Hye-jin,

911
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,793
I was comfortable from the very beginning.

912
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,713
She was really engaging,
she was a good listener and talker.

913
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,174
Yeah, so I enjoyed the date.

914
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,844
Jong-hoon has a peculiar charm.

915
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,349
His face looks different depending
on which angle you're seeing it from.

916
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,350
- Hm.
- True.

917
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,935
He has different vibes.

918
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,479
He looks super different
with his glasses on too.

919
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,399
And he'd be great at ASMR.

920
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,235
He gets your attention
with his soft voice.

921
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,363
He talks slowly,
which makes us focus more.

922
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,906
Slow and laid back.

923
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,201
Jong-hoon enjoyed his dates
with both Si-an and Hye-jin.

924
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,620
Which one do you think he enjoyed more?

925
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:11,166
It didn't feel like he was leaning
one way or the other, so I'm not sure.

926
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,002
Right. I also felt like
it was around 50-50.

927
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:19,508
I think he's keeping his options open
with Si-an and Hye-jin.

928
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,926
Are you copying Jong-hoon?

929
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,386
Mm.

930
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,889
Let's talk quietly,
so people really have to focus.

931
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,391
Yeah, that helps.

932
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,111
I can't peel these.

933
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,707
I was waiting for Si-an and Min-seol.

934
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,750
I was surprised they weren't back yet.

935
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:57,588
I thought the female contestants
would've returned from Paradise by now.

936
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:04,720
I was waiting for Si-an,
but she was taking her sweet time.

937
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,479
We had so much fun
in Paradise, didn't we?

938
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,981
- We did.
- It was great.

939
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,233
Hi, Inferno.

940
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,027
- Hi.
- We're back.

941
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,239
- They're back.
- Here they come.

942
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,618
Wait. I only see three guys.

943
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,369
Why?

944
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,788
- What?
- What's going on?

945
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,081
Hi.

946
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,374
- Hi.
- Hi.

947
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,792
How's it going?

948
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,587
Where are the rest?

949
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,714
Why are there only three of you?

950
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,925
We have so much to tell you. Hurry up.

951
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,136
- Did something happen?
- We have so much to tell you!

952
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,222
- Let's see who has more.
- So much.

953
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,848
- Have a seat.
- What's going on?

954
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:50,766
Did you eat?

955
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,852
- We have to stuff ourselves.
- We haven't eaten. I'm hungry.

956
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,020
Yeah.

957
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,980
- It looks good.
- Let's have some.

958
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,525
Well…

959
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,361
I guess you're hungry.

960
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,573
We meet again.

961
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,075
I know, right?

962
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,826
We keep bumping into each other.

963
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,704
Jun-seo was glad to see me.

964
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,373
Was it because I was gone?

965
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,585
I noticed that he was being a tiny bit
more forward since I got back.

966
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,381
Tell us what happened.

967
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,049
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

968
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,635
So you guys left, right?

969
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:27,594
- Us?
- Yeah.

970
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,180
- After you left…
- Scoot over a little.

971
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,307
- …a new girl…
- She's a game changer.

972
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,394
- …just showed up.
- Are you serious?

973
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,563
- You're not lying?
- Why would we?

974
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,565
It's true.

975
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,652
She ended up going to Paradise
with the two guys she picked?

976
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,821
Two. She chose two out of us five.

977
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,782
Dong-ho and Jeong-su went with her.

978
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:51,368
- Dong-ho and Jeong-su.
- They left in the morning.

979
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,328
- In the morning?
- This morning.

980
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,415
THIS MORNING

981
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,750
Finally, we're off.

982
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,837
- We're off.
- How are you feeling?

983
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,133
- Having two men beside you like this.
- I'm happy.

984
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,679
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

985
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,931
- Let's go.
- I'm excited.

986
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,272
Today?

987
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,025
- This morning.
- A little while ago.

988
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,945
I obviously was expecting Dong-ho
to be there when I got back.

989
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:31,617
I was looking forward to talking to him,
but it was such a shame he wasn't there.

990
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,955
I was relieved to know that the person
I was interested in, Te-hwan,

991
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,498
had been left behind,

992
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,875
so we could talk more.

993
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,463
- You must be nervous.
- Yeah.

994
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,340
I feel a little nervous to be here.

995
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,343
"No disclosure of job or age."

996
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,471
INFERNO RULES
PROFESSIONS AND AGES CANNOT BE REVEALED

997
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,264
Wait, what?

998
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,020
- There they are.
- They're here.

999
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,523
- Hello.
- Hello.

1000
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,860
- They're here.
- Here they come.

1001
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,404
- They're so cheerful.
- Yeah.

1002
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,532
Hello!

1003
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,993
- I thought he was Jeong-su.
- I know.

1004
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,871
- I'm Jang Theo, nice to meet you.
- I am An Jong-hoon.

1005
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:18,914
An Jong-hoon.

1006
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,208
- Nice to meet you. I'm Yuk Jun-seo.
- Hi.

1007
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,669
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hi there.

1008
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,420
- I'm Kim Te-hwan.
- An Jong-hoon.

1009
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,589
- An Jong-hoon? Nice meeting you.
- Yes.

1010
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:28,674
You too.

1011
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,675
Where do I sit?

1012
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,220
Oh, is this seat taken?

1013
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,056
It is. You can sit over here.
We'll set a place for you.

1014
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,771
Should I sit over there?

1015
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,109
Thank you.

1016
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,489
I could tell he was muscular.

1017
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,325
If I have to compete with him,
I'm worried I'll lose.

1018
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,373
Is he there to fight or what? He can't be.

1019
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,417
Why's he only thinking about fighting?

1020
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,253
- He's hilarious.
- My goodness.

1021
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,047
He's in war defense mode.
He's ready to battle.

1022
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,926
Even though Jong-hoon just joined,
I'm not worried.

1023
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,180
We have different qualities.
I don't think we'd go for the same person.

1024
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,975
When Jong-hoon arrived,
I said, "Hey. I'm Jang Theo,"

1025
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,310
but my eyes were on Si-an. That's it.

1026
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,315
- What'd you do? Oh, please.
Thought about you.

1027
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,234
You're annoying.

1028
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,529
- Wait. Where are the other men?
- Two guys.

1029
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,697
Two guys.

1030
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,117
- And the female game changer came.
- Is she pretty?

1031
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,160
Huh?

1032
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,163
Two of the guys left with her.

1033
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:44,166
- Who?
- Jeong-su and Dong-ho.

1034
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,127
- Ah, okay.
- Dong-ho and Jeong-su.

1035
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,128
Okay, then.

1036
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,713
When did they leave?

1037
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,632
- This morning.
- When we woke up, they were gone.

1038
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,301
- They already left?
- Yeah.

1039
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,220
They'll be back tomorrow.

1040
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,890
- Okay.
- They left today but come back tomorrow.

1041
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,978
Is she bothered by Jeong-su again?

1042
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,980
- She has feelings.
- It seems like it.

1043
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,857
She still has feelings for him?

1044
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,151
Jeong-su…

1045
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,111
I tried hard to act calm.

1046
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,947
We've all seen he's well-mannered

1047
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,824
and knows how
to make a woman's heart flutter

1048
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,785
so that's what bothers me.

1049
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,872
I hope he doesn't ask her to apply
a facial mask for him or massage her hand

1050
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,082
because she's having motion sickness.

1051
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,338
For real?

1052
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,340
She has strong feelings for him.

1053
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,677
She's forced herself to get over him
but I don't think it's working for her.

1054
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,514
- Her first trip left a strong impression.
- Exactly.

1055
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:48,939
Oh, shoot.

1056
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,067
Do you need napkins?

1057
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,278
Hm? Yeah, I'm done.

1058
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,700
Hold on. I…

1059
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,452
- Did you spill?
- Yeah, thanks.

1060
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,704
- Did you spill?
- Yeah, thanks.

1061
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,589
- Have you been well?
- Yeah.

1062
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,592
Could you pass me my bag?
Okay, I'm good. Thank you.

1063
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,357
What's with this soap opera right now?

1064
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,776
- That smile.
- All the feels.

1065
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:39,656
But the thing is, Si-an seems
to be pretty drawn to Jeong-su,

1066
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:43,994
so if Jun-seo doesn't speed things up,
it won't be easy to change her mind.

1067
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,872
And Theo seems focused on one person too.

1068
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:50,876
Si-an's so popular. She's got something
going on with four guys.

1069
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,210
I feel bad for Theo.

1070
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,046
He didn't even take a breath
before he answered,

1071
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,090
- "I thought about you."
- That was meh.

1072
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:01,386
If it goes wrong, he could just feel
like some AI on autopilot.

1073
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:04,180
- Or his feelings could be disregarded.
- You're right.

1074
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,850
Theo was being impatient.

1075
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,102
- But he's sincere.
- True.

1076
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:11,479
<i>♪ I've been up, I've been down… ♪</i>

1077
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,941
- Wow.
- Whoo.

1078
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,694
- Whoa!
- Wow.

1079
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:21,448
Yesterday was no fun.
Let's go all out today, Te-hwan.

1080
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,200
- For sure.
- This thing's pretty powerful.

1081
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,746
It shoots like this, Te-hwan.

1082
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,373
- Oh!
- Oh.

1083
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,877
The sun's up,
it's gonna get warmer.

1084
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,422
- Oh!
- How brave.

1085
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,925
You're entering risky territory.

1086
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,886
You didn't even hesitate coming in.

1087
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,721
- Well, it's no…
- Oh!

1088
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,556
It's no big deal.

1089
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,766
No biggie, huh?

1090
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,727
They're like seals.
They just love the water.

1091
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,730
- I wanna get on this.
- Let's help you up.

1092
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,148
One, two, three.

1093
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,444
You flipped it? I know you did.

1094
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,489
Okay, okay.

1095
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,787
Min-seol's just there thinking,
"How lame."

1096
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,413
This one won't flip over.

1097
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,584
You can hoist yourself up
like a mermaid.

1098
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,795
- This?
- Get on.

1099
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:17,879
Like that.

1100
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,717
- Nice.
- Ouch!

1101
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:23,718
It hurts.

1102
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,720
- You scraped yourself?
- Yeah.

1103
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,431
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

1104
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,849
- No?
- You'll be okay.

1105
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,601
Oh! Oh, wait.

1106
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:33,770
Hold on.

1107
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,313
Let me…

1108
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,565
I need to look pretty. Hold on.

1109
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,154
When Jun-seo was hovering
around Si-an, I was like…

1110
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,324
"Hovering around."

1111
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,327
I always find that expression so funny.

1112
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,206
When Jun-seo was hovering around Si-an,

1113
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,167
I was like, "Fine.
Go ahead and get to know her.

1114
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,836
I doubt she'll be as fun as me."

1115
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,882
It's nice, I love this. Ah!

1116
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,176
His head…

1117
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,929
Hey!

1118
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,474
Don't yank my hair.
I've been losing a lot of hair lately.

1119
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,187
You're dangerous.
I'm defending with my feet.

1120
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,693
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

1121
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,155
You look envious.

1122
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,032
- I didn't put sunblock on.
- What did you say?

1123
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,700
- I missed it.
- Those are mine.

1124
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,994
- Oh, these are yours?
- Let me see.

1125
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,996
They all look so similar.

1126
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,205
Let me borrow these.

1127
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,249
- These are Jun-seo's?
- I guess.

1128
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:37,584
Use these too.

1129
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,753
What? These. You brought them with you?

1130
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,841
I laugh the most when I'm with him.

1131
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,259
I never overthink it.

1132
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,012
But I'm frustrated.

1133
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,433
How's someone that lovable?

1134
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,976
- She's adorable.
- She's cute.

1135
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,940
- Let's put the fruit here.
- You okay?

1136
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,068
- Huh?
- How you feeling? You cold?

1137
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,652
- It's so cold.
- Is it?

1138
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,030
Let's take a picture together.

1139
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,616
Just us? I'm too shy.
I'll take the picture.

1140
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,035
- Want me to?
- Okay.

1141
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,704
These are strange.
There's gotta be one more.

1142
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,082
- You took it so suddenly.
- It'll come out well.

1143
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,958
The angle from above was nice.

1144
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:22,837
Hye-jin, look at me.

1145
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,050
- My heart skipped a beat.
- Mine too.

1146
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,635
- Right?
- "Hye-jin, look at me."

1147
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,053
Hye-jin, look at me.

1148
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,935
It came out really nicely.

1149
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,565
- A boyfriend does that.
- Yeah. They're totally a couple.

1150
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,859
"Hye-jin, look at me."

1151
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,905
- Let's have dinner.
- I wonder what we're having.

1152
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,281
Let's open this up.

1153
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,368
- Oh, sausage stew.
- What is it? Sausage stew?

1154
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,787
- It looks good.
- Yes, spicy.

1155
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,373
Thank you.

1156
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,923
- How should we scoop the rice?
- The rice is there.

1157
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,216
- Inside.
- Okay.

1158
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,052
- Get rice paddles.
- They weren't there.

1159
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:14,347
- Aren't there utensils on that side?
- Oh, you're right.

1160
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:16,808
I guess you're near-sighted.

1161
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,727
Here. That's where we keep them.

1162
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,229
Ah, I'm starving.

1163
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,191
Is it good?

1164
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:26,943
- Bring one more.
- Okay.

1165
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,031
Do you want a lot?

1166
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:33,741
Sure.

1167
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,201
- Do you?
- Yeah.

1168
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,079
- More?
- No.

1169
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,748
Eat up,
you went swimming and stuff.

1170
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:41,666
Good.

1171
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,925
- How much do you want?
- Uh…

1172
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:51,843
Good?

1173
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,351
- Just a little.
- Okay.

1174
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,687
- How much is a little?
- Up to here.

1175
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,148
Do you want more rice?

1176
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,195
He's like a puppy.

1177
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,197
Theo's really so committed.

1178
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,076
Do you like ham?

1179
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,411
Yeah, I like it.

1180
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,746
I'll get you your stew.

1181
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:26,628
Stew…

1182
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,516
How much ham are you having?

1183
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,894
I'm a meatatarian.

1184
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,562
Here you go.

1185
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,651
I'm so hungry.

1186
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,113
Wow!

1187
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,824
I don't have enough.

1188
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,826
- Oh, you're right.
- This is so little!

1189
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,703
Give it here. Pass it.

1190
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,957
Someone said you don't eat much,
so I only scooped a little.

1191
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,584
She should see
how much rice you got, right?

1192
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,880
Come on,
who got the stew for Jun-seo?

1193
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,298
Who scooped mine?

1194
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,717
Careful.

1195
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,636
Okay.

1196
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,264
Why did I follow you?

1197
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:23,268
- I only care about my stew.
- How rude of you.

1198
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,527
- Enjoy, everyone.
- Dig in.

1199
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,653
Bon appetit.

1200
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,406
I wonder who scooped my rice,
it's so much.

1201
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,116
Okay, eat up.

1202
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,617
Eat up, everyone.

1203
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,420
You eat a lot.

1204
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,089
It's good.

1205
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,302
- You don't eat quail eggs?
- Quail eggs?

1206
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,762
- Yeah, you want one? They're good.
- Give me one.

1207
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:02,807
Thank you.

1208
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,225
I'll get you more later.

1209
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,854
I'll go through the whole stew
and pick out all the quail eggs for you.

1210
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,814
Delicious.

1211
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:12,025
Why do we never have side dishes?

1212
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,860
- Kimchi.
- Kimchi?

1213
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,279
I'll get you some.

1214
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,033
- Jun-seo takes charge. Mm.
- He takes initiative.

1215
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,960
How is the kimchi so good?

1216
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:31,961
Eat up.

1217
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,095
Te-hwan, can you pass some paper towels?

1218
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,641
- I'll get you a bunch.
- Thanks. That's enough.

1219
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,601
Thank you.

1220
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,478
May I have one?

1221
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:57,904
Thank you.

1222
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:04,118
Why just me and Hye-jin?

1223
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,037
What?

1224
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:09,457
Because you're within my reach, so…

1225
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,634
What? What was that?

1226
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:22,553
- This is so uncomfortable to watch.
- Did you see that?

1227
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:25,139
- He was so timid.
- He moved it closer to her.

1228
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,308
- "I did something for her."
- "Look at me."

1229
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,351
Wait, I missed it.

1230
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:31,521
He moved her water cup,
in case it got in the way.

1231
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,855
- He's cute.
- Here, watch.

1232
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,738
Just a centimeter.

1233
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,408
- "I did one thing for her!"
- Oh, geez.

1234
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,868
How are they all so cute?

1235
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,912
This is crazy. I love it.

1236
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:50,748
You do cute things when you like someone.

1237
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,584
We can spot these behaviors,

1238
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:57,380
but the person who matters
won't even notice, and that's sad.

1239
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,090
She had no clue.

1240
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:03,970
But Si-an doesn't seem interested
in Jun-seo or Theo.

1241
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,180
- You mean, Si-an?
- Yeah.

1242
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:09,559
She said, "You hardly have any,"
to Jun-seo and got him more food.

1243
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,561
That was just out of friendship.

1244
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:14,439
I feel like she already
has her heart set on Jeong-su.

1245
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:18,276
Si-an's not interested in Jun-seo?
I feel like she is.

1246
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,527
- Not at all.
- You think?

1247
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,279
- Not even a little?
- She's not.

1248
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,822
- Zero.
- It's just friendship.

1249
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:23,781
Friendship?

1250
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,075
She has no romantic feelings
for him at all.

1251
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,285
- For real?
- Zero.

1252
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,788
Theo and Jun-seo have eyes on Si-an.

1253
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,958
Min-seol has eyes on Jun-seo
while keeping tabs

1254
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,585
on what's going on around her.

1255
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,962
This is all so complicated.

1256
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,839
So complicated.

1257
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,009
<i>♪ Sunshine on my face ♪</i>

1258
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,552
What's this?

1259
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:47,805
- I wonder what snacks we're having.
- Here they are.

1260
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,265
Awesome.

1261
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,933
Sweet potatoes.

1262
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,561
It's a little soggy, but it's good.

1263
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:56,147
You're really enjoying it.
Aren't you full?

1264
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,192
- What would you like?
- I'll take some of this.

1265
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,071
Hey, let's talk.

1266
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,073
- What?
- I wanna talk.

1267
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,284
- Hurry up, then. Come on!
- Huh?

1268
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:12,830
- Be a man and say, "Come on. Let's go."
- That's not what I meant though.

1269
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,874
What do you mean, then?

1270
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:18,336
- More like, "I wanna talk with you."
- Si-an is a busy girl.

1271
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,171
What do you mean, then?

1272
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,925
- Nothing.
- Come here.

1273
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,510
Yes, sir.

1274
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,639
Let's find a place that's not too windy.

1275
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:32,099
Where we can be alone.

1276
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,727
It's been a while.

1277
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,979
- You missed it, didn't you?
- I did a little.

1278
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,857
I didn't say a word yesterday
since you weren't here.

1279
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:40,900
You didn't?

1280
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,652
- Yesterday…
- Mm.

1281
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,862
…people asked why I was so down.

1282
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:48,616
And they said I cheered right up
since you were here today.

1283
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:56,123
Wow.

1284
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,086
I saw this view yesterday
and thought of you.

1285
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,840
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yeah.

1286
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,759
- Should we watch from there?
- What?

1287
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,011
- From the train car?
- Sounds good.

1288
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,099
Ah, this is beautiful. Whoo!

1289
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,728
- It's cold.
- That's why I brought these.

1290
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:19,480
For real? What are these?

1291
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,399
- My hoodies.
- Why did you bring two?

1292
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,652
Wouldn't it be better
to put it over your shoulders?

1293
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:27,280
- You won't be as cold.
- Yeah. Put it on me.

1294
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,159
Wrap it around

1295
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:33,744
like a cape.

1296
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,038
Not my neck.

1297
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,915
It looks good on you.

1298
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,375
- Okay.
- Just my style.

1299
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,626
Uh… Thanks.

1300
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:43,629
Wear it the way you want.

1301
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,925
Cheers!

1302
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:51,554
Mm.

1303
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:52,597
Hmm.

1304
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,105
- What?
- What are you looking at?

1305
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:03,691
I'm enjoying the sunset
and you're just in the way.

1306
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:06,235
- Well, I'm gonna enjoy the sunset too.
- Huh? Okay.

1307
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:10,615
- It is beautiful.
- Right?

1308
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:11,741
Yeah.

1309
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,330
So pretty.

1310
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:21,459
- I said, "So pretty."
- What?

1311
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,878
Thanks.

1312
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:26,339
- I meant the sunset.
- Yeah, sure.

1313
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,091
- Geez.
- That sigh.

1314
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,260
- Nice to hear once in a while.
- I'm sure.

1315
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:32,386
Oh, gosh.

1316
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:36,724
I guess you're really letting loose
after holding back in there.

1317
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:43,564
You would feel uncomfortable if I flirted
with you in front of everyone,

1318
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:45,566
so that's why I decided to hold back.

1319
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,197
- Right?
- Mm… Good job.

1320
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:57,078
You left without saying bye
to me yesterday.

1321
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:58,996
- You're right.
- You must've missed me.

1322
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,040
Mm.

1323
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,293
I left without even getting
to see your face yesterday, right?

1324
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,795
- Exactly.
- Hm.

1325
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:06,837
Were you anxious?

1326
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:09,840
Why would I be?

1327
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,551
Why? Because the game changer is here.

1328
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,223
- You think I'd feel anxious?
- You're so annoying.

1329
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,228
Weren't you too worried to eat?

1330
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,647
- In Paradise? I ate so much.
- Mm.

1331
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,858
- Was it different from our trip?
- Totally different.

1332
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:29,902
But…

1333
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,155
the food was better with you.

1334
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,408
That's good.

1335
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:46,752
I'm embarrassed.

1336
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,130
For real? Ooh, I kinda like that.

1337
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:51,590
No, come on, that's not it! You're too…

1338
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,758
Okay.

1339
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:58,014
After I washed up yesterday,
gosh, I was so bored.

1340
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,976
- I saw some pretty flowers.
- Oh.

1341
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:03,310
Cool.

1342
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:06,480
So, I thought to myself,
"Should I get one for Si-an?"

1343
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:10,026
I realized
they were all stuck to the wall,

1344
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,111
so I couldn't pick any of them for you.

1345
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,779
Mm.

1346
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,657
- You mean these flowers?
- Similar to those.

1347
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:18,909
But I managed to pick some.

1348
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,661
- Why?
- For you.

1349
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,374
Wait. The ring.

1350
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,667
Check out this ring.

1351
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,170
A flower ring. Ta-da.

1352
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:31,672
Isn't it pretty?

1353
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:38,929
I made it yesterday
knowing you'd have this reaction.

1354
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,639
Unbelievable.

1355
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,558
What is this?

1356
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:56,072
Keep it on until you throw it out later.
Others might laugh if they see it.

1357
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:57,823
- I won't throw it out.
- You won't?

1358
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,825
No. I'll keep it on like this.

1359
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,332
Wait, when did you make this?

1360
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,751
Last night, by myself.

1361
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:10,711
- Out here?
- I scoured the whole place.

1362
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:52,711
I trimmed the sharp edges
with a nail clipper.

1363
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:56,340
- That's real devotion.
- I know.

1364
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:58,175
- It's so touching.
- Mm.

1365
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,179
Oh, gosh.

1366
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:05,891
Mm.

1367
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,477
It's cute.

1368
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:11,897
I wondered
if it was the right thing to do,

1369
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:15,067
but I remembered you mentioned,
"a romantic and happy life".

1370
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:16,902
DAY 2 IN PARADISE

1371
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,863
What is your goal or dream?

1372
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:22,408
To live a romantic and happy life.

1373
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,410
Oh, I like that.

1374
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:26,829
Good job.

1375
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:30,082
That crossed my mind so I thought
it'd be okay to do it for you.

1376
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,793
Good job. I mean it.

1377
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:40,593
It's a little cringey, even for me.

1378
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,639
- You did well. Mm.
- Yeah?

1379
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:47,057
I'm touched.

1380
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,685
Wow.

1381
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:50,978
- Wow.
- "Wow."

1382
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:53,355
- Wow, a flower ring.
- "Wow, a flower ring."

1383
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:55,524
<i>♪ I'll never let you down ♪</i>

1384
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,569
<i>♪ Give me a sign ♪</i>

1385
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:01,989
<i>♪ Would you take me on a… ♪</i>

1386
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:03,324
The sky's red now.

1387
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:06,493
- It's so pretty.
- It is, right?

1388
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:11,540
- Let's take a selfie?
- Why not?

1389
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:15,753
One, two, three.

1390
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:21,342
Oh, hang on, we have to do one more, okay?

1391
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,261
- Nah, I'll just keep it.
- Why?

1392
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,889
I'll keep it for myself.
And give it to you later.

1393
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:27,806
Okay.

1394
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,104
Ah.

1395
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,399
- He's a romantic.
- I know. So romantic.

1396
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,359
Wow.

1397
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,194
- Has to be true love.
- It does.

1398
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:43,197
I feel like Si-an
has feelings for him, right?

1399
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:46,742
Could you see it on her face?
Falling under his spell.

1400
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,452
I think she was really moved.

1401
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:51,413
But I feel like this is the calm
before the storm.

1402
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:53,958
Theo is so cool.

1403
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:57,127
Here's what I think about Si-an.

1404
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,380
She's really grateful and happy

1405
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:02,508
for how assertively Theo
expresses his feelings for her.

1406
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:05,552
But she wants to get to know
other guys too.

1407
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,764
She's curious about Jeong-su, for example.

1408
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:11,600
- She seems to have a lot on her mind.
- Mm. Yeah.

1409
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,269
Theo's such a great guy.

1410
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:19,191
- I'm a little tipsy. Yeah.
- Really? Drink slowly then.

1411
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,068
Is my face red?

1412
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:23,028
- Not too red.
- Really?

1413
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,656
- Why do I feel like I'm super red?
- You do?

1414
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,161
- Cold?
- I'm fine.

1415
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:34,081
You sure? Do you want my jacket?
I'm not cold.

1416
01:11:34,748 --> 01:11:36,875
You're not?
I'll let you know if I get cold.

1417
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:38,210
Let me see.

1418
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:42,256
Let me check.
Oh, you must not be that cold.

1419
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:45,009
- I'm all right. I'm okay.
- No goosebumps.

1420
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:47,553
Just tell me
'cause I'm not cold at all right now.

1421
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,348
Mm.

1422
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:54,226
How long was your longest relationship?

1423
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,645
- My longest was two years. Mm.
- Mm.

1424
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,857
After that, my most recent ones
lasted one year.

1425
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,066
Mm, I see.

1426
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,277
- You and I have similar tendencies.
- We do?

1427
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:06,947
When I date, I focus entirely on dating.

1428
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:07,948
I see.

1429
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,493
I tend to become too devoted
when I date someone.

1430
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,495
Me too.

1431
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:20,836
- I'm curious how devoted you can be.
- If I fall in love, I can't fall out.

1432
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:22,254
- Really?
- Yeah.

1433
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:26,717
Once a guy falls for me,
he never falls out of love with me.

1434
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,303
- You're confident you're that charming?
- Of course.

1435
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:33,807
I've only shown ten percent
of my true self before tonight…

1436
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,185
Really? Show me a little more.

1437
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:38,437
Don't be afraid to show your true self.

1438
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,647
Heart. Heart.

1439
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:43,317
Is that not it?

1440
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,985
I take it back.

1441
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,865
- She's cute.
- I like how she took it back.

1442
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:52,743
Wait, I just remembered something.

1443
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:55,162
- Do you usually wear glasses?
- Yes.

1444
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:56,372
- Really?
- When I drive.

1445
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:59,041
- You'd look really good in glasses.
- Really?

1446
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,835
I'll wear glasses
when we have breakfast tomorrow.

1447
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,295
- You will?
- Yeah.

1448
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:05,756
You're gonna look great.

1449
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:09,510
- Wear the ones that suit you best.
- Got it.

1450
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:10,469
I can't wait.

1451
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:13,138
Did you say you wore contact lenses
for eight years?

1452
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,057
How many years did you say?

1453
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,476
I never told you that!

1454
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,144
- You didn't?
- Oh!

1455
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:21,438
Oh, no.

1456
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:22,773
Oh, dear.

1457
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:24,400
I never told you that!

1458
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:25,776
You didn't? No, you…

1459
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:27,945
You're confusing me with another woman.

1460
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:30,364
When we were talking back
at the room, you said…

1461
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:32,825
I never said eight years.

1462
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,661
Just knock her out so she forgets.

1463
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,705
I don't think
I said I wore contacts.

1464
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:42,501
- I wonder who you're confusing me with.
- Sorry.

1465
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,170
- I mean it. I'm sorry.
- Right to my face.

1466
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:49,591
I was just guessing.

1467
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,885
- Really?
- I wasn't confusing you with anyone.

1468
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,178
You weren't?

1469
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:55,013
I'll drink as an apology.

1470
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,890
As a punishment?

1471
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:58,725
- I'll join you. Cheers.
- Cheers.

1472
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,939
Who had contacts for eight years?

1473
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,567
He was trying to prove
that he had a good memory.

1474
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:10,154
So he mentioned
that weird eight-year fact he heard.

1475
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:12,072
Yeah, he slipped up.

1476
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:14,158
Tried to prove himself, it fell through.

1477
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:16,452
- He seems younger than her.
- He's younger.

1478
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,245
He's trying to prove something.

1479
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:19,955
- Mm. Yeah
- Can't you tell?

1480
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,207
He wants to show
what kind of person he is.

1481
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,417
He wants to be manly.

1482
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:26,879
- As long as Ji-yeon likes him.
- That's right.

1483
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,967
- Did you drink a lot?
- This is my one can.

1484
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,635
- You gonna drink it?
- Of course.

1485
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,429
"Of course."

1486
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,431
Real guys don't hold back.

1487
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,100
Then don't and keep drinking.

1488
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:41,435
Mm.

1489
01:14:43,353 --> 01:14:46,315
You know, we had so much fun together
in Paradise.

1490
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:47,441
It was fun.

1491
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:49,943
And the experience
made me really care about you.

1492
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,862
- It did?
- Yeah.

1493
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:54,239
I could tell you weren't
in a great mood today.

1494
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,574
- Really?
- Yeah.

1495
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,993
You were so quiet during lunch.

1496
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:00,829
- You went like this.
- I talked a lot.

1497
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,247
- Not to you.
- Seriously?

1498
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,209
- Why didn't you talk to me?
- I thought you were avoiding me.

1499
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:08,754
I kept trying to talk to you like,
"Are you okay?" I kept checking in.

1500
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,088
- When?
- Uh…

1501
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,257
You didn't notice me checking in on you.

1502
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:14,760
Like, "Eat up."

1503
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,513
Really? I didn't know.

1504
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,682
I guess I mostly mumbled,
"Hey, Min-seol. Eat up."

1505
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,434
How was I supposed to catch that?

1506
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,769
That's true.

1507
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:27,981
We're Paradise buddies,
but I didn't even notice you saying that.

1508
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:29,441
Exactly.

1509
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,026
But you're always on my mind.

1510
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:34,988
I'll pay attention with all my senses
next time, so keep it up.

1511
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:37,366
Got it!

1512
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,661
Okay. I will.

1513
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:42,371
It's so funny.

1514
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,165
- You know…
- It's…

1515
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:47,167
- You know what's funny?
- What?

1516
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:50,212
When we went to Paradise,
I did most of the talking.

1517
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,881
- Yeah?
- Now, you're doing most of the talking.

1518
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,259
- It's 'cause I'm drunk.
- You weren't like this.

1519
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,052
- I wasn't?
- No.

1520
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,805
- "I wasn't?"
- "I wasn't?"

1521
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:02,349
I was?

1522
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,977
- Are you drunk?
- Can't you do the talking?

1523
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:09,231
- That would make you comfortable, huh?
- You're cute when you're talkative.

1524
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,528
You're not just talkative.
You're fun to listen to.

1525
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,738
People should see that side of you more.

1526
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:17,698
- You think?
- Yeah.

1527
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,701
From my perspective,

1528
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:23,829
I've seen you all day,
but you look the most comfortable now.

1529
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,206
Really? I do feel
most comfortable with you.

1530
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,124
Same.

1531
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,752
Honestly, I feel comfortable
and even carefree.

1532
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,380
Same.

1533
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:36,258
When I'm with you,
it makes me wanna have a good time.

1534
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,093
Is that a good thing?

1535
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:41,221
Should I tell you
what I really like about you?

1536
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,931
What?

1537
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:46,476
I wasn't gonna tell you, but for a girl…
This is just my opinion.

1538
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:53,275
You're so quick to get ready.
You get yourself ready just like that.

1539
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:54,192
For what?

1540
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,570
- When you get ready.
- Like putting makeup on?

1541
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,530
I love it.

1542
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:01,742
Is he just saying this to please her?

1543
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:04,328
- She seems perplexed.
- She does.

1544
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:06,830
Is that a good thing?

1545
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:09,124
It's a great thing, brat.
It's your strength.

1546
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:13,629
"Brat"? Did you just call me a brat?
Soon you'll be swearing. Oh.

1547
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,214
- You'll be swearing.
- Min-seol.

1548
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,508
I'm saying it's a good thing.

1549
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:19,885
- Is it?
- Yes.

1550
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,387
Do you wanna talk to anyone else?

1551
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,225
Is there someone you wanna talk to
before leaving?

1552
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,394
Well, Si-an.

1553
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:31,104
- Si-an?
- Yeah.

1554
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,272
Go talk to her then.

1555
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,398
I should.

1556
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,151
- I wanna talk to Theo.
- Should we change it up then?

1557
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:37,402
Yeah, should we?

1558
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,321
- Where are they?
- Right over there.

1559
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:41,323
- Let's go.
- After talking a bit more.

1560
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:43,617
What? You just said we should go.

1561
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,870
I never said that.
I asked who you wanted to talk to.

1562
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,211
She kinda felt something just now.

1563
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:56,463
- He even called her a brat.
- Yeah. A brat.

1564
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:59,466
How is he so easy to read?

1565
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,260
It's clear from the way he speaks.

1566
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:05,972
But honestly, I like that about him.

1567
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:09,226
He could be flirting with Min-seol
to keep stringing her along,

1568
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:10,602
but he doesn't do that.

1569
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,770
- I know.
- It looks…

1570
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,523
- Uh-huh.
- He honestly said he likes Si-an.

1571
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:19,820
What are you thinking?

1572
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,114
You've been on dates
more than any girl here.

1573
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,282
I'm curious to know
what your thoughts are.

1574
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,034
How come you never share?

1575
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,453
No, no, no. I had no time
to share my thoughts.

1576
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,747
- You're too busy getting asked out.
- I'm too…

1577
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:32,249
- Gosh.
- Uh…

1578
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:34,167
You still like Theo?

1579
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:38,922
Theo's the only one I actually chose
to go to Paradise with.

1580
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:40,006
Right.

1581
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:44,177
- And Theo never makes me confused.
- Mm.

1582
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:46,513
But honestly…

1583
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:50,851
there's a little part of me deep down
that still says Jeong-su.

1584
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:53,562
- Just when you think you forgot…
- I know, right?

1585
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:57,107
The first Paradise trip left me
with a strong, lasting impression.

1586
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,527
Now you're leaning towards Theo.

1587
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:01,737
That's right.

1588
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,865
In any case, I'm more drawn
to Theo at the moment.

1589
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:07,826
Theo never makes me feel pressured.

1590
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:09,453
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1591
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:13,248
He never asks how my dates were
or who I find attractive.

1592
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,208
He doesn't say anything like,

1593
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:17,919
"I like you, I need to know
what you think about me."

1594
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:20,046
When someone asks you that, it can be…

1595
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,758
It's a lot of pressure.
It's like, "Okay, no thanks."

1596
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,509
He never does anything like that.

1597
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:26,595
He just expresses how he feels about me.

1598
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:28,513
He says, "I like you.
You're the one for me."

1599
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,348
- That's it.
- The end. That's all.

1600
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,186
I think that's what's so cool about him.

1601
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,646
That means he doesn't care who you like.

1602
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,356
He just knows that he likes you.

1603
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:42,778
Yeah, and he's always trying
to make me feel at ease.

1604
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:47,032
It's also really touching.

1605
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:50,285
What he does for me is touching,
and it feels genuine,

1606
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,621
so my heart keeps opening up to him.

1607
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:58,418
Does that mean that you don't
want to chat with anyone else here?

1608
01:19:58,502 --> 01:19:59,669
- No.
- Just Theo.

1609
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:02,422
Well, yeah, no one here.

1610
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,175
She said, "No one here."

1611
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:07,135
Jun-seo's not even on her mind.

1612
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:10,138
- I guess not.
- You're right. This is unexpected.

1613
01:20:11,681 --> 01:20:14,017
- Here…
- Get off me.

1614
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,268
What on earth?

1615
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:17,479
- Si-an, where have you been?
- I saw it all.

1616
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:18,939
I've been looking for you.

1617
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:20,482
Don't make me laugh.

1618
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:22,317
- Tell her.
- He wants to talk to you.

1619
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,944
- Yeah.
- Really? I've been here.

1620
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:26,613
We found her too easily
like it was nothing.

1621
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,574
- You were looking for her?
- Need a drink?

1622
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:30,617
Whatever.

1623
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,412
Jun-seo speaks to Min-seol the same way!

1624
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,747
- Right.
- It's how…

1625
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,291
"Whatever." No couples
say that to each other.

1626
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,709
Yeah.

1627
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,256
- Hey, you… Oh, gosh.
- I don't mind.

1628
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:47,342
- I keep addressing you like that.
- Whatever you want.

1629
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:48,844
We dropped the honorifics.

1630
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,140
It's nice and windy.

1631
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:59,771
- You let your hair down.
- I did.

1632
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:03,358
I was torn about getting it cut
before coming here.

1633
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:05,986
But I decided not to
and now it's out of control.

1634
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:08,530
I wanna try
flat ironing your hair.

1635
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:09,823
- You do?
- Totally.

1636
01:21:09,906 --> 01:21:12,367
I try straightening it myself
but it doesn't work.

1637
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,578
It doesn't?
Then, I'll do it for you later.

1638
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:17,539
- Seriously? Come over.
- I want to make it really straight.

1639
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:20,375
- How about tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

1640
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,502
- Tomorrow?
- Come over tomorrow morning.

1641
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:24,254
- You come over.
- Do I have to?

1642
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:26,506
- Yeah, you should.
- You're doing it for me.

1643
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,511
You're right. I could come over.

1644
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:34,097
- Yeah, just come over.
- I will.

1645
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,724
- You want volume?
- A little.

1646
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:37,893
For sure. Hair should have some volume.

1647
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:45,442
So?

1648
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:47,152
Have you narrowed it down yet?

1649
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,280
Hmm.

1650
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,034
Who is it? Do you mind if I ask?
