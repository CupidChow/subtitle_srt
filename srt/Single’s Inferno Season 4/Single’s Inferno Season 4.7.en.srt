00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,820
LAST NIGHT

174
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,238
[You-jin] Let me try that.

175
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,909
Jun-seo, is there someone
you wanna go to Paradise with?

176
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,370
-Why'd you do this to me?
-[chuckling]

177
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,997
[deep sighs]

178
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,792
[Jun-seo smooches lips]

179
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,921
-I'll drink.
-[groans]

180
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,595
This whole time,
I've been talking to Theo a lot,

181
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,806
so I'm pretty aware of the extent
of his feelings for you.

182
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,727
That's why I had to be…

183
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,605
a bit more careful.

184
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,025
I have a clear idea
of who has feelings for you,

185
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,737
so I didn't wanna drop your name like that
during some drinking game.

186
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,489
Since I'd never told the others.

187
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,825
So there.

188
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,829
[romantic music playing]

189
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,042
-She's pleased.
-I like his answer.

190
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,960
-It was a good one.
-[Hanhae] Right.

191
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,713
-He was considerate of his rivals.
-[Kyuhyun] Yeah.

192
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,344
If I'm being honest with you,

193
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,138
as for the guys
I've been to Paradise with,

194
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,266
I do think I've been withholding
my feelings from them.

195
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:44,810
Why?

196
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,773
Because my mind keeps changing.

197
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,318
If I expressed myself more,
it could be taken as a reassurance,

198
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,363
which could lead
to potential misunderstandings.

199
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,656
[Jun-seo] I understand.

200
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,242
That's why I sometimes become
less expressive than I'd like to be.

201
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,160
[Jun-seo] Hmm.

202
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,371
[Si-an] Well…

203
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,957
I think that after today,

204
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,461
I'll be… able to gather
my thoughts quickly.

205
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,379
[Jun-seo] Yeah.

206
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:18,260
I just wanna express my feelings
and be honest about liking someone.

207
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,763
[gentle music playing]

208
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,807
Still torn? You have mixed feelings?

209
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,602
There's a lot to consider,
I have a lot on my mind.

210
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,733
At first, I was just happy
and having fun here.

211
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,985
-But now…
-[Jun-seo] Mm-hmm?

212
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,779
I'm scared.

213
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,780
Yeah.

214
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,367
I think it started today.

215
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,245
I suddenly felt so under the weather.

216
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,621
-[Jun-seo] Really?
-Mm.

217
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:48,416
I get that, but you being
concerned and confused,

218
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,127
that's just the kind of person you are.

219
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,257
In my opinion, you'll have
to make those decisions later anyway,

220
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,342
so put those concerns aside for now.

221
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,677
-[Si-an] Right.
-Eat good food,

222
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,137
enjoy this conversation,

223
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,140
and have fun until our time's up
and we go back.

224
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,182
All right.

225
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,600
Just take it easy.

226
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,311
-There's no need to get too serious. Mm.
-[Si-an] Okay. Mm.

227
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,356
I really do plan to focus
only on you for today.

228
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,358
-[Jun-seo] Good.
-Mm.

229
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,152
Gosh.

230
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,070
This is rather…

231
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,656
Talking to Jun-seo seems
somewhat therapeutic.

232
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,158
Exactly.

233
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,411
The solution he was giving
seemed to really put her at ease.

234
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,956
They're on the same page
of how honest they're being.

235
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,500
-They have similar personalities.
-They are.

236
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,419
They're both frank, it's not like…

237
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,713
-They don't take things seriously.
-Exactly.

238
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:40,259
I hope Si-an will give herself a breather,
and enjoy her time with Jun-seo.

239
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,554
It seems like people
who have so many choices

240
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,348
and constantly weigh their options
always end up alone.

241
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,434
[boisterous laughter]

242
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,644
I'm telling you.

243
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:55,524
I mean, those who don't have many options
get married the moment they find someone.

244
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,861
I've seen that happen to so many people.

245
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,448
I'm not saying
that Si-an will end up alone.

246
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,991
She'll live a happy life.

247
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,620
-Being popular creates an endless…
-They get overwhelmed

248
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,289
and end up not being able
to make a choice.

249
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:14,502
Right, and Si-an's not just saying that,
she genuinely seems concerned.

250
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,340
-[A-rin] Salad, fruit, and champagne.
-[Dong-ho] Fruit? How nice.

251
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,466
Here.

252
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,383
Thank you.

253
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,803
Wait. This is the difficult part.

254
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,098
-Are you good at this?
-Good luck.

255
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,475
It's a first for me.

256
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,230
-You okay?
-[Dong-ho] I'm good.

257
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,314
[cork squeaks]

258
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,357
There.

259
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,693
-[bottle pops]
-[squeals]

260
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,614
[jazz music playing]

261
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,950
Looks nice.

262
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,867
To meeting you.

263
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,327
-To meeting me?
-Yeah.

264
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,707
[A-rin] Mm.

265
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,960
Mm.

266
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,128
It's Paradise, all right.

267
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,423
-I have nothing to compare it to.
-Tastes like champagne.

268
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,343
[A-rin] What's this? Tofu?

269
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,929
[Dong-ho] Let's try it.
It looks like tofu.

270
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,888
[A-rin] Right?

271
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,974
-Hand me the knife?
-Sure.

272
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,603
-This knife?
-[A-rin] Any knife will do.

273
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,105
It's all so complicated.

274
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,651
[quirky music playing]

275
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,279
That side of him is charming.

276
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,155
-That clumsy side.
-[Da-hee] Yeah.

277
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,491
-He isn't acting experienced.
-Refreshing.

278
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,201
I should act that way too.

279
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,495
[collective laughter]

280
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,914
-All right, enjoy.
-Enjoy.

281
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:39,879
It's good.

282
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,006
[tableware clinking]

283
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,343
-All the food in Inferno is hard as rocks.
-It is.

284
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,972
You could practically chew the food
here with your gums and be fine.

285
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,474
Avocados are perfectly chewable
with your gums.

286
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,559
True.

287
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,562
I'm so curious
about your job and your age.

288
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,730
Especially your age.

289
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,773
Should I take a guess?

290
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,025
Especially my age?

291
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,818
-Actually, your job.
-My job?

292
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,279
To be honest, you're younger
than me for sure.

293
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,448
I imagine you're a 20-something.

294
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,160
[playful music playing]

295
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,329
[Dong-ho sharp inhale] Twenty-something.

296
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,331
So around…

297
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,292
Twenty-six?

298
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,585
[gasps]

299
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,546
Actually, three years
younger than that, so 23.

300
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,548
-I'm on point, right?
-Be honest.

301
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,592
-Twenty-three. Yeah.
-Twenty-three?

302
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,886
I'm 25.

303
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,097
Wait, you glared at me
like you were gonna bite my head off

304
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,891
'cause I was off by one year?

305
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,935
-That's a huge difference.
-It is.

306
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,186
One year's huge.

307
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,354
Twenty-five.

308
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,023
Now guess mine.

309
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,483
-You could be older.
-Uh-uh.

310
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,693
I might look mature
'cause I've been through a lot.

311
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,696
-[A-rin] I don't buy that.
-What makes you so sure?

312
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,033
I mean…

313
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,372
you seem older, but I don't think
you're in your 30s, so 29.

314
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,290
[A-rin] Wait!

315
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,460
Add one more year, so 30.

316
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,630
-You changed your guess 'cause I liked it?
-So you're 30?

317
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,673
Yeah, I'm 30.

318
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,424
-Seriously?
-[Dong-ho] Yup, 30.

319
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,259
Mm!

320
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,720
You're right.

321
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,265
You look your age.

322
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,351
-[chuckles]
-[A-rin giggles]

323
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,354
Okay, now your job.

324
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,733
Well, given how you dress and stuff,

325
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,444
you obviously know
what suits you and what doesn't.

326
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,862
You're probably a model,

327
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,199
or something that involves
being in front of a camera, no?

328
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,701
-Yeah.
-I'm right?

329
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,786
You're right, I'm a commercial model.

330
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,665
[A-rin] I am a commercial model.

331
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:44,253
Most recently, I have been the face
of a beauty brand for three years.

332
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,341
I shoot with various brands ranging
from beauty and bridal to fashion.

333
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,972
KIM A-RIN
25 YEARS OLD, MODEL

334
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,598
-Okay, I see.
-[A-rin] Yeah.

335
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,810
It's like, flash, flash, right?
You pose with your shoulders?

336
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,979
You seem to know a lot. [chuckles]

337
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,940
-I use my shoulders when I pose.
-Isn't that how they do it?

338
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,610
That's interesting. Have you walked
down the aisle for wedding shoots?

339
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,820
I have.

340
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,447
How many times?

341
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,657
I've done around three weddings.

342
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,242
Wow, what a glamorous life.

343
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,370
-[both chuckle]
-You suddenly seem so…

344
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,413
[Dong-ho] What?

345
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,207
I didn't know it was this fun
to make random guesses.

346
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,169
I had no idea either.

347
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,589
-What? My job now?
-[A-rin] Yeah, yours.

348
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,382
Give it a shot.

349
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,551
I think something corporate.

350
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,720
I need a corporate job to earn money.

351
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,431
Don't I? Did you think I just sat
at home all day?

352
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,183
I have a corporate job.

353
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,518
I got that right, you work in an office.

354
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,771
Yeah. I'm an accountant, a CPA.

355
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,314
-[A-rin] Accountant?
-Mm-hmm.

356
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,944
Amazing. I thought you'd have
a white-collar job, for some reason.

357
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,698
Is your office in the Yongsan area?

358
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,616
[Dong-ho] Yeah.

359
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,785
-Because I--
-It's Amore…

360
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,536
-Can I not say it?
-How did you know?

361
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,289
-I went there for a shoot.
-They're all in that area.

362
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,875
-[A-rin] You know Etude in that building?
-Sure.

363
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,044
I do a lot of jobs there.

364
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,130
-We could've run into each other.
-Ah. Possibly.

365
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,091
They have great restaurants.

366
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,050
Right?

367
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,344
-[A-rin] I've been to most of them.
-How recently?

368
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,055
I go there at least once
every two or three months.

369
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,557
-We might have crossed paths.
-I know.

370
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,310
You were so close by.
Wow, this is fascinating.

371
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,187
-[Kyuhyun] Gosh.
-They have a connection.

372
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,314
[inhales] She goes every two months.

373
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,941
Right? It's not that often.

374
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,568
I doubt they could've run
into each other often.

375
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,569
[giggles]

376
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,530
-Then--
-I wanna know where you live.

377
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,323
I'm curious about that too.

378
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,242
-Since you work in Seoul.
-True.

379
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,493
Okay, well…

380
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,995
if you do a lot of shoots,

381
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,958
then you'd probably live in places
like Nonhyeon or Apgujeong, no?

382
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,459
Or Cheongdam? Gangnam?

383
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,086
Sinsa?

384
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,546
Where do you live?

385
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,506
I live in Wangsimni.

386
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,383
Wangsimni.

387
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,635
-Really?
-[A-rin] Why?

388
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,928
-[Jin-young] What?
-Why?

389
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,179
Does he live there?

390
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,181
-Why?
-I live in Wangsimni.

391
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,266
-For real?
-Yeah.

392
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,601
-Wait, really?
-Wow.

393
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,187
[Hanhae] I got goosebumps.

394
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,314
They might have seen each other around.

395
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,483
-They might have.
-[Jin-young] Wow.

396
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,028
[Dong-ho] I live in Wangsimni.
It's been around eight or nine years.

397
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,781
-I've been there for around two years.
-Wangsimni.

398
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,909
I've lived there for so long.
It feels like forever.

399
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,871
-We're practically neighborhood buddies.
-I know.

400
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,206
-That's why you got all wide-eyed.
-Wait.

401
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,586
We might've taken the same subway
to the same office building.

402
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,879
[Dong-ho] Wow.

403
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,046
Is this for real?

404
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,092
-Wow. It really is.
-[A-rin] Fascinating.

405
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,556
We found really unlikely commonalities
between us.

406
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,684
It even got me thinking, "Is this fate?"

407
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,939
The fact that they live in the same
neighborhood is a big discovery.

408
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,443
It might make them closer,
knowing they're neighbors.

409
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,154
-Like a sudden sense of closeness.
-Right, that too.

410
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:01,033
Plus, they're seeing that this
romantic connection might really be fate.

411
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,204
It's better
it took us a while to get here.

412
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,290
We kept missing each other
when we could've matched day one.

413
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,293
I still feel so bad about it. I regret it.

414
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,838
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

415
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,007
[Dong-ho] Kim A-rin.

416
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,508
Oh, thank you.

417
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,803
Jang Theo.

418
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,104
Well, that was the first…

419
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:36,026
you know, shocking incident
that happened to me in Inferno.

420
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,075
If I'm being honest with you,

421
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,620
no one else is sparking
my curiosity now at all.

422
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,790
I don't even wanna ask
anyone else to chat.

423
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,709
I wanna stop
being this concerned and torn.

424
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,546
As soon as you returned today,

425
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,509
I went looking for you to pull you aside
and say, "Let's talk for a bit."

426
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,593
Oh, really?

427
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,845
I was mustering up all my courage.

428
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,515
Si-an suggested that we sit down
and wait, so we did,

429
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,017
and that's when you came back
with Jeong-su.

430
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,479
Oh, so that's how the four of us
ended up sitting down together.

431
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,273
Yeah, we all sat down, but then,

432
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,609
it was a little embarrassing
to pull you out of that situation.

433
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:22,030
But it took me a lot of courage
to knock on your door in the first place.

434
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,116
[Dong-ho] It takes guts to do that.

435
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,702
What surprised me at first was…

436
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,996
It's about our harmless beast, Jun-seo.

437
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,498
Why did he have to sit there?

438
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,709
-You didn't expect him to sit down?
-No.

439
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,087
-He was holding a toothbrush!
-If that was me, I would've left.

440
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,463
He asked to sit with us.

441
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,090
-We couldn't say no.
-Mm-hmm.

442
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,425
Hey. Yo!

443
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,844
-[chuckles]
-[Jun-seo] What's up?

444
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,429
-We're just talking.
-Yeah?

445
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,347
-Yep.
-[Jun-seo] Can I join you?

446
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,433
-Sure, if you want.
-[Jun-seo] Okay.

447
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,768
-What's going on?
-[all chuckle]

448
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,937
-He wasn't reading the room.
-[Jin-young] Right.

449
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,022
Oh, yeah.

450
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,898
My gosh.

451
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,319
He was seated across from us,
like some boss at a job interview.

452
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,571
I thought, "This isn't going to work out."

453
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,615
And because he was there,
others started to come over too.

454
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,036
I was also thinking,
"Well, it's over for me.

455
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,912
Why isn't anything working out?"

456
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,875
I felt so frustrated and upset
that I had to get myself out of there.

457
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,588
We kept missing each other.
We took a detour to get here.

458
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,509
-A very long detour indeed.
-That's true.

459
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,347
-Some people are just meant to be.
-[Jin-kyung] It's nice.

460
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,640
Watching them makes me feel good.

461
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,769
-Our first real couple, then.
-Right. Congratulations.

462
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,521
-Dong-ho and A-rin, our favorite couple.
-They are.

463
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:40,233
I don't wanna spoil the mood,
but what about Hae-lin and Dong-ho?

464
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,985
You think they'll get together?

465
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,488
-Yeah?
-I keep getting this feeling.

466
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,073
-Okay.
-[Jin-young] Hmm.

467
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,366
Dong-ho couldn't think straight with her.

468
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,203
-That's true.
-I doubt this will end smoothly.

469
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,413
Dong-ho's feelings matter most here.

470
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,792
-[Te-hwan] You must be hungry.
-[Ji-yeon] Totally.

471
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,086
I'm starving. I'm so hungry.

472
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,504
[Te-hwan] So hungry.

473
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,798
-Let's eat. Bon appetit.
-Enjoy!

474
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,093
[crunches]

475
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,053
-Let me move this closer.
-Mm.

476
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,640
You know how to open it?

477
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,101
-[bottle pops]
-Oh, gosh.

478
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,185
That startled me.

479
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,562
[laughter]

480
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,981
-That could've gone so wrong.
-I know.

481
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,274
He was born in '03.

482
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,276
Oh, gosh.

483
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,736
Ah, that startled me.

484
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,030
Thanks.

485
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,157
-It was easy, it surprised me.
-I know!

486
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,410
Thank you.

487
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,288
Oh!

488
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,540
Oh, my gosh.

489
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,750
[all laughing]

490
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,378
-He's just so cute, isn't he?
-Adorable.

491
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,839
I wanna have a drink with Te-hwan.

492
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,674
-I love these two.
-[Hanhae] Same.

493
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,510
[chuckles, sniffles]

494
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,179
Should I go first?

495
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,764
-Will you?
-Are you curious?

496
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,475
I'm torn whether to hear
your age or your job first.

497
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,601
Really? Pick one.

498
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,020
Let's take turns revealing
our jobs, then ages.

499
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,105
Sure.

500
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,691
-Well, I am a…
-Mm-hmm?

501
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,442
-[Te-hwan] Yeah?
-…designer.

502
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,113
-Oh, that suits you.
-But I'm a spatial designer.

503
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,364
[Te-hwan] Ah, okay.

504
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,410
[Ji-yeon] I currently work
as a spatial designer.

505
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,831
I help companies stay on brand
during their hosted events

506
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,250
by helping
with their furniture arrangement

507
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,004
or providing my opinion
for their overall design projects.

508
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,508
BAE JI-YEON
SPATIAL DESIGNER

509
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,386
-[Te-hwan] Me? So I am…
-Your job?

510
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,722
…a DJ and an artist.

511
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,848
Oh!

512
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,726
-I mainly compose electronic music.
-Gosh, really?

513
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,019
And I own a nightclub.

514
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,520
-For real?
-[Te-hwan] Yeah.

515
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,230
-He's a DJ?
-[Da-hee] A DJ?

516
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,274
-[Kyuhyun] He runs a nightclub?
-What a twist.

517
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,692
Te-hwan's a DJ?

518
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,321
[Te-hwan] I am a DJ.

519
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,365
I also run my own
underground nightclub in Itaewon.

520
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,784
[house music playing]

521
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:58,788
Unlike what most people in Korea
expect when they think of nightclubs,

522
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,124
we mostly play house music.

523
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,920
Korea isn't familiar
with house music and party culture.

524
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,590
So I'd like to pioneer a movement here
to promote this culture

525
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,426
so that this kind of music
becomes more popular.

DJ & NIGHTCLUB OWNER

527
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,848
Really? [chuckles]

528
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,350
I never would've guessed.

529
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,061
It's a little surprising, isn't it?
Didn't expect it?

530
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:24,522
Honestly, you doing music
hadn't even crossed my mind.

531
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:29,486
The reason is, I thought you'd have
some kind of office job.

532
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,403
Hmm.

533
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,989
You had no idea
I'd be running a nightclub, huh?

534
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,158
-Not even once.
-Right, right.

535
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,078
I find it hard to imagine
even after hearing it.

536
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,204
I bet.

537
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,498
[Ji-yeon giggles] It's hard to picture.

538
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,917
I'm curious about your age.

539
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,252
Guess.

540
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,255
-I'll reveal mine first this time.
-[Ji-yeon] Okay.

541
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,506
Mm.

542
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,217
Thirty-one?

543
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,552
-I got it?
-Hmm.

544
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,054
-Are you? For real?
-Yeah.

545
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,889
[Te-hwan chuckles]

546
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,141
-[hosts gasp]
-My gosh.

547
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,644
-He's much older than we imagined.
-He's 31?

548
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,688
-Older than me!
-[Hanhae] He's the oldest there.

549
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,982
We all thought he was
super young, like 22.

550
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,526
-[Te-hwan chuckles]
-Really?

551
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,486
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah.
-I assumed you'd be around 30.

552
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:15,323
What? You assumed I'd be 30?
Then, why did you add one year? I'm hurt.

553
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,742
I take it back.

554
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,828
[laughter]

555
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,540
-Gosh, I really got it right?
-Yeah, I'm 31.

556
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,959
That's no fun, then.
I got it right in one go.

557
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,086
You did. Let me guess yours, then.

558
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,004
[Ji-yeon] Okay.

559
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,548
[Te-hwan] You're twenty…

560
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,926
seven?

561
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,970
-Twenty-seven?
-[Te-hwan] Twenty-six.

562
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,013
Six?

563
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,806
-Five.
-Five.

564
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,641
-[gasps] Really?
-[Ji-yeon] I'm 25.

565
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,476
You have that mature vibe going on.

566
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,688
-Oh, do I really?
-That's why I thought you'd be older.

567
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,897
Oh, okay, I get that.

568
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,524
I was sure she was older.

569
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,775
-I know, right?
-Same.

570
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,527
I better apologize to him.

571
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,321
-[Jin-young] I know.
-We're sorry.

572
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,742
You were talking to the game changer
a lot today, right?

573
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,411
-I was talking to the game changer a lot?
-Yeah.

574
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,121
-The female one?
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah.

575
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,165
Earlier when we had lunch.

576
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,044
After the game.
Hae-lin sat next to you, right?

577
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:09,961
Yeah.

578
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,087
TODAY DURING LUNCH

579
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,465
Wow, that's a look I've never seen before.

580
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,133
-Me? Really?
-[Si-an] Yeah.

581
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,886
-I guess you like wearing shades.
-I brought a few.

582
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,096
Oh, yeah? Let's see you without them.

583
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,099
-[Jun-seo] He looks cool.
-[Si-an] A spoon.

584
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,768
[Jun-seo] Aw, shame they're off.

585
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,440
I was bothered by how jealous she looked.

586
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,816
[snickers]

587
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,568
Mm.

588
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,070
-That's all.
-[Te-hwan] Okay.

589
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,530
A little. I wasn't too bothered,
just a bit.

590
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:42,077
I kept looking at you, but every time
I did, you were never looking my way.

591
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,871
So I was like, "Well, this is new?
A little suspect."

592
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:50,460
Well, I was looking at you.
And our eyes met pretty often too.

593
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,461
Really?

594
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,255
I thought we had
a telepathic thing going on.

595
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,382
[laughs]

596
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,092
-Did you?
-Yeah. [chuckles]

597
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,887
Ji-yeon seemed a little jealous.

598
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,597
It was cute seeing her like that.

599
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,976
Whether I'm in Paradise or Inferno,
I don't care as long as I'm with Ji-yeon.

600
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,272
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, wow.
-Have you been to this ice rink before?

601
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,316
[Ji-yeon] Yeah, I've been here once.

602
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,277
-Here they are.
-[Te-hwan] Sit here.

603
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,409
How do we put these on?

604
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,036
There.

605
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,998
Wait. Hold on. You have to tighten them
so that you don't hurt your ankles.

606
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,625
Press your foot down.

607
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,503
Mm! Oh, got it. Nice.

608
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,754
[Ji-yeon] Oh, so tight.

609
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,339
-[Te-hwan] It's tight?
-Yeah.

610
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,633
-He's suddenly so smooth.
-I know.

611
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,343
He could be awesome at skating.

612
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,679
What if he lands a triple axel? [laughs]

613
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,141
-But he doesn't seem very athletic.
-[Da-hee] Aw.

614
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,600
[Ji-yeon] Let's go.

616

-Gosh.
-I haven't skated in a while.

617
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,858
Wait. It's been a while for me too.

00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,070
Yay! [giggles]

620
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,447
I'm pretty good, huh?

621
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,282
-You're good.
-Better than expected?

622
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,162
-[Ji-yeon] Do I look like Kim Yuna?
-Huh?

623
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,997
-Like Kim Yuna?
-Try a triple axel.

624
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,166
[Te-hwan panting]

625
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,876
[gasps, chuckles]

626
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,793
Like this?

627
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,171
Nice. You're good.

-That looks fun.
-Gosh.

637
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,151
I love this.

638
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,986
-They're like little kids.
-I know.

639
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,447
Hold on. Pull me.

640
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,657
[Te-hwan] Come here. All right, off we go.

641
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,868
-[Ji-yeon] I'll hold still.
-Okay.

Oh!

00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,252
Ah!

645
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,885
[Te-hwan] It feels like you're pushing me.

-[Ji-yeon] Should I pull you?
-[Te-hwan] Sure.

-[both chuckle]

648
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,354
[Ji-yeon] Gosh, sir, you're heavy.

649
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,775
-[Te-hwan] This is nice.
-Yeah, it feels nice.

650
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,109
[Te-hwan] It really does.

651
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,741
[hosts] Oh!

652
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,909
That was so soothing.

653
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,994
These two are really something.

654
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,747
I mean, their date
was so purifying for the soul.

655
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,333
I think my mood's been lifted
from seeing that date

656
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,544
and how they interact with each other.

657
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:41,339
Out of everything I've seen
the contestants do on Single's Inferno,

[Jun-seo] Get something warmer.

-I didn't bring anything. It's cold.
-Did I bring something?

663

[Jun-seo] I only have this.

-Really?

Hey, do you have
a side profile you prefer?

I doubt you do,

-Here we go.

847
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,536
At this rate,
I'll sink to the bottom soon.

848
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,040
Let's go again. I'll do it for you.

849
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,751
[A-rin] It's so different from Inferno.

850
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,421
[sharp exhale]

851
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,089
Let's compare our arm lengths.

852
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,925
-Here, put your back to the wall.
-I have long arms.

853
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:28,843
Mine are long.

854
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,970
-The reach.
-[Kyuhyun] Wait.

855
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,305
-He did this with Hae-lin, right?
-Yeah.

856
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,350
-[Dong-ho] This is strange.
-Mine are long.

857
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,726
-Why?
-My arms are longer…

858
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,313
Of course, your arms should be longer.
You have a bigger build.

859
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,065
[both chuckling]

860
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,776
[Dong-ho] What else did you wanna do here?

861
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,070
There must be something you had in mind.

862
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,449
I just wanted to talk with you a lot.

863
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,075
And you wanted to swim too?

864
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,328
Yeah, that and swimming
were what I was looking forward to.

865
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,211
No.

866
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,006
[playful music playing]

867
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,215
Here.

868
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,300
Done.

869
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,598
[Dong-ho sighs]

870
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:20,019
When you return tomorrow, you're gonna
feel super disappointed by reality.

871
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:24,023
You'll pack your bags
only to be back in Inferno.

872
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,818
-Does that bother you at all?
-No, not anymore.

873
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,654
What do you mean "anymore"?
Because you have no regrets?

874
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,781
Yeah, I was in Inferno for a long time,

875
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,201
now I'm in Paradise
with the person I wanted.

876
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,787
I'll remind myself I'll have
more chances to talk with you,

877
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,165
so being there won't bother me anymore.

878
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,382
I wonder if we'll have to play a game
to come here next time.

879
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,470
Or maybe we'll have a final choosing.
What do you think?

880
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:59,183
-You must have the same feeling.
-I think there will be another men's game.

881
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,978
The winner might be given another chance
to come to Paradise.

882
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,066
[A-rin] Who knows?
There might be no game at all.

883
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,693
-What if there's a women's game?
-[A-rin chuckles]

884
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:11,946
[A-rin] No way.

885
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,659
-Do you think you could do it?
-Mm.

886
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,827
Take me with you. Give it your best.

887
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,793
-Excuse me?
-[Dong-ho] What?

888
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,586
[Jin-young] Look at her face.

889
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,671
She's in love.

890
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,675
-[Dong-ho] You want beer?
-[A-rin] Sure.

891
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,053
[beer can fizzes, crackles open]

892
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:41,934
Cheers.

893
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,439
Do you cook at home? Since you live alone.

894
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,276
I used to cook when I felt motivated.

895
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,779
But I honestly don't feel
like that anymore.

896
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,823
It's hard to find time when I work.

897
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,826
-Are you a good cook? Nice.
-Yeah.

898
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,536
I can cook almost anything.

899
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,913
[Dong-ho] For real?

900
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,665
[A-rin] I can even make kimchi.

901
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,545
That's awesome. You know
how men would see that, right?

902
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,299
It's something most men
would find appealing.

903
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,759
You can make kimchi?

904
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,595
[A-rin] You find that charming?

905
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:21,724
When people talk about cooking,
stuff like pasta earns the brownie points,

906
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,768
but I'm good at making stuff
like green onion kimchi.

907
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,733
Cook for me next time.
Make some green onion kimchi for me.

908
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,652
Yeah? You want me to make you something?

909
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,907
I'm at that age where I always have
the possibility of marriage in mind.

910
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,492
[A-rin] Me too.

911
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,912
-Let's pretend we're getting married.
-[chuckles]

912
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,919
[A-rin] 'Cause of my green onion kimchi?

913
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,921
You're stuck on that. I'll make some.

914
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,757
I'll have it delivered to you.

915
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,426
-[A-rin sighs]
-Like we're married.

916
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,763
Oh, my gosh,
you're making me feel embarrassed.

917
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,264
[Dong-ho] No, don't be.

918
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,059
[A-rin] You've got a knack
for annoying people.

919
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,394
This must be why people enjoy Paradise.

920
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,190
It's fun to tease you
and see how you react.

921
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,692
Maybe this is why people
tend to date younger.

922
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,112
[playful music playing]

923
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,030
[clears throat]

924
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:23,410
They seem comfortable, like they've grown
so close in no time, right?

925
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,578
They have.

926
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,539
I see Dong-ho taking the lead
when he's with her.

927
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,457
[Jin-young] Yeah.

928
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,920
But when he was with Hae-lin,
it seemed like he didn't know what to do.

929
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,381
That's why I feel
that if Hae-lin does something

930
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,801
to throw him off when they get back,
it will drive him crazy again.

931
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,636
-Similar feeling.
-Same.

932
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,390
Dong-ho expresses his feelings well,
but strangely, we're all feeling…

933
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,308
-I'm feeling uneasy.
-You're right.

934
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,937
It's like I'm seeing
ominous clouds slowly approaching,

935
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,397
rolling in behind them.

936
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,234
-Dong-ho doesn't seem entirely sure yet.
-[Kyuhyun] I agree.

937
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,277
-They're a pleasant couple.
-Mm-hmm.

938
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,405
PARADISE
LEE SI-AN & YUK JUN-SEO

939
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,782
-[Jun-seo] Don't drink too much.
-[Si-an] Okay.

940
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,575
[glasses clink]

941
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,580
-[gulps]
-[Jun-seo exhales]

942
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,417
[both chuckling]

943
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,585
Hey, I keep reaching for this snack.

944
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,046
Stop calling me "hey".

945
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,465
-Call me Si-an.
-Si-an.

946
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,802
Man, I hardly call people by their names.

947
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,097
-I like being called by my name.
-Okay, Si-an.

948
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,891
-Mm.
-Guess what I'll do, since you asked.

949
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,228
-I might say, "Hey, Si-an."
-Oh.

950
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,147
-That's fine.
-Is that fine?

951
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,485
When you have a girlfriend,
how often do you see her?

952
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:39,987
-Me?
-[Si-an] Yeah.

953
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:41,947
About once a week.

954
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:45,284
-Gosh, that's too little.
-Once or more.

955
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,911
-[laughter]
-I see her at least once.

956
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,037
Hmm.

957
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,665
I make time to see her
at least once a week.

958
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,377
When you argue, what usually causes it?

959
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,378
When we argue?

960
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,630
I'm pretty stubborn.

961
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,340
-I see.
-Yeah.

962
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,760
Sometimes I force things to go my way

963
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:07,723
without taking into consideration
what the other person's perspective is.

964
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,727
That's something I really need to work on.

965
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:16,482
I remember all of my ex-girlfriends
found that tough to deal with sometimes.

966
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,983
You do seem argumentative.

967
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,612
-But I don't think arguing is wrong.
-Not at all.

968
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,030
-Do you?
-Of course not.

969
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,824
It's a learning experience
for everyone though.

970
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,452
Arguing often gives us an opportunity

971
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,288
to understand ourselves
and each other better.

972
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,667
I may argue often,
but being in a relationship

973
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,420
is sometimes the only way
to learn about myself.

974
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,507
I don't know any other way.

975
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,760
I have learned a lot
through my romantic relationships.

976
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,679
What kind of relationship
do you want to be in then?

977
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,932
-What kind do I want?
-Mm-hmm.

978
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:54,394
I think the priority is to find someone
I truly want to be with.

979
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,562
Okay.

980
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,941
If everything goes well on that front,

981
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,736
I think everything else
will be smooth sailing from there on.

982
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,739
Follow your heart.

983
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,244
I must say, I think I communicate
with you the best.

984
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,120
-[Jun-seo] Really?
-Totally.

985
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,334
It really feels like we're connecting.

986
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:19,253
It does.

987
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,341
[Jun-seo gulps] I usually…

988
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:25,676
[Si-an] Hmm?

989
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,095
…don't ever ask questions like this.

990
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,180
-[Si-an] Yeah.
-So is it okay if I ask?

991
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:31,765
It's okay.

992
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,850
-You sure? Okay, so…
-Of course.

993
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,520
Well, I've been a bit curious, actually,

994
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,856
about how you thought of me at first,
versus how you feel now.

995
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,983
Um…

996
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:48,323
Honestly, you were not
on my radar at all to begin with.

997
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:54,830
But oddly enough, you were the only
male contestant that I hardly talked to.

998
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,458
And you didn't even talk
to me unless you had to.

999
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,501
[Jun-seo] Mm-hmm.

1000
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:04,381
So yeah, I was curious.
I wanted to try talking with you.

1001
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:08,176
I wanted to become close
with you at first.

1002
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,219
Mm-hmm.

1003
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,846
When we finally got close,

1004
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:16,476
I realized you were so different
from what I'd expected, in a good way.

1005
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,728
Oh.

1006
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:24,484
So I thought we should go
to Paradise at least once.

1007
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,321
Now that we're here,

1008
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,825
-it's honestly really nice.
-Yeah.

1009
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:36,580
I'm finding myself more interested in you,
so it's surprising, but really confusing.

1010
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,581
Mm.

1011
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,249
Right.

1012
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,127
I feel a similar way.

1013
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,299
I honestly think that our date today…

1014
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,052
Well, it felt like an actual date.

1015
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,637
Yeah.

1016
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,265
[Si-an] All of it
from when we drove over here,

1017
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,769
when we walked over to have dinner,
and when we drove back here.

1018
00:48:58,852 --> 00:48:59,936
[Jun-seo] How is it?

1019
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,189
I feel like I've been on an actual date.

1020
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,399
-You do?
-Yeah.

1021
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,110
This feels so good. Wow.

1022
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,741
Every moment felt like a real date.

1023
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,410
And when I talk to you…

1024
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,748
I feel like I can fully be myself.

1025
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,209
You make me feel calm and open,
I have a chance

1026
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,502
-to be myself.
-I see.

1027
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,087
You do.

1028
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,840
I speak without having
to put much thought into it.

1029
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,927
But that's just who I really am, you know?

1030
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,596
Mm-hmm.

1031
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,685
That's why I think we communicate so well.

1032
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,689
That's good. But you still seem
to have a lot on your mind.

1033
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:48,985
Yeah, I do.

1034
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:51,988
It's just because…

1035
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,742
-[Jun-seo] Yeah?
-I have so many things to consider.

1036
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,538
[serious music playing]

1037
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,603
-[Jun-seo] What's on your mind now?
-That my eyes feel so dry.

1038
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,564
-They feel dry?
-Mm-hmm.

1039
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,527
-And?
-[Si-an nervous chuckle]

1040
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,155
That this is really nice.

1041
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:35,824
And?

1042
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,493
Just that it's nice.

1043
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,629
[snickers]

1044
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,426
I want you to…

1045
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,724
This is from the bottom of my heart.

1046
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,021
-You don't have to choose me.
-Yeah.

1047
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,356
I just want you
to be more sincere with me.

1048
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,734
Instead of saying,
"It's nice. It's so nice."

1049
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:11,735
[Si-an] Yeah.

1050
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,573
You're allowed to say,
"I'm thinking about someone else"

1051
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,117
or "I can't get that person
out of my head."

1052
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,870
I would appreciate it
if you were honest like that.

1053
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:22,996
[Si-an] Okay.

1054
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,837
We're alone here, so you don't have
to hide your feelings or pretend.

1055
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:32,798
[Si-an] Okay.

1056
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,550
You look very confused right now.

1057
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,803
I'm happy, just so sleepy too.

1058
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,681
Both? You're drinking too much
for someone who is just happy.

1059
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,768
-[Si-an gulps]
-I don't think that's the case here.

1060
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:49,940
So here's the thing. I like you.
That's why I'm confused.

1061
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:50,899
[Jun-seo exhales]

1062
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,360
-Tell me more about that.
-Know what I mean?

1063
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,322
-I have been coming to Paradise every day.
-Yeah?

1064
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,617
And each day, my mind's been changing.

1065
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,954
I was so sure I didn't
have feelings for you up until yesterday,

1066
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,998
but my feelings for you
have grown now that we're here.

1067
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,835
This change in me is what's
making me feel confused.

1068
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:13,338
[deep breath]

1069
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,756
Who do you like most?

1070
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,308
Right now, Theo.

1071
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,936
-Theo?
-[Si-an] Yeah.

1072
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,272
Why?

1073
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,402
Why Theo?

1074
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,237
Well, he's expressive.

1075
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,154
[Jun-seo] Yeah.

1076
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,828
-He's expressive and…
-[Jun-seo] Mm.

1077
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,462
He's on my mind.

1078
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,600
-[Si-an chuckles]
-That's more like it.

1079
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,235
[sighs]

1080
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:20,405
Spending time with you

1081
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:24,200
has made me grow the same feelings
for you and it's confusing me.

1082
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,994
That's what I'm trying to say.

1083
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,709
-[deep breathing]
-[glass clinks]

1084
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,313
[sniffles]

1085
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,733
[chuckles]

1086
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:58,735
-What?
-[Si-an] Huh?

1087
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,819
You okay?

1088
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,821
I don't know.

1089
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,659
[sad music playing]

1090
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,672
-[sighs] I think I'm drunk.
-Why are you crying?

1091
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,839
I don't know.

1092
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:28,974
Don't cry.

1093
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,561
-I'm just feeling a little drained is all.
-It's okay.

1094
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,648
But since my mind is truly
all over the place right now.

1095
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,277
No need to explain. I get it.

1096
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,325
-You must feel perplexed.
-[sniffles]

1097
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,800
[deep sigh]

1098
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,057
I'm going to the bathroom.

1099
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,023
[Si-an] I'm so tired, seriously.

1100
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,819
[Si-an breathing deeply]

1101
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:26,364
[Jun-seo] Say everything you're feeling
and cry as much as you want.

1102
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,866
[Si-an] But that's not it.

1103
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:32,620
Even I don't know what I want for certain,
that's why I'm being like this.

1104
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,790
Just go away already. Go.

1105
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,542
[Si-an sighs heavily]

1106
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,087
I can't stop crying.

1107
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,922
-[Si-an sobbing]
-[faucet running]

1108
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,389
[Si-an sniffles]

1109
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:55,769
I think I was just feeling
a bit heartbroken.

1110
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:59,397
Seeing myself being this indecisive
left me feeling…

1111
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,233
I didn't like myself in that moment.

1112
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,487
I felt like I had no backbone.

1113
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,784
But at the same time, I thought,
"Well, this is no big deal.

1114
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,953
This is just what I'm honestly
feeling on this trip."

1115
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,289
But my mind was already
all over the place.

1116
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:20,502
That's when Jun-seo's words
made me burst into tears.

1117
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,423
[Hanhae] They're getting deep over drinks.

1118
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,385
I get it. What she's feeling
is something like,

1119
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:34,599
"I like this guy, this guy, and even
this guy. What's wrong with me?"

1120
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:39,062
This could be what she's going through.
Like, "I shouldn't be like this."

1121
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,564
But this is Single's Inferno after all.

1122
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:45,527
No phones and they're confined solely
for the purpose of dating each other.

1123
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,280
She's doing things
that she wouldn't usually do.

1124
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,741
That must be why
she's so confused right now.

1125
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,326
Just my thoughts.

1126
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:57,038
But now I'm confusing myself
since I said that I understand her a bit.

1127
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,833
[laughter]

1128
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,002
-This show is confusing people.
-I feel so confused.

1129
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,922
-I do get her.
-They're not in an ordinary environment.

1130
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:06,840
-Yeah.
-True.

1131
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:10,552
So she was already at her wit's end
when she came here with Jun-seo.

1132
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:11,761
[Si-an sniffles]

1133
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:13,721
[exhales deeply]

1134
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,354
[Si-an sighs heavily]

1135
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,273
-[Jun-seo sighs]
-[sniffs]

1136
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,108
Gosh.

1137
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,196
But still, talking with you…

1138
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,239
[Jun-seo] Yeah.

1139
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,659
[sighs]

1140
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,828
…it's definitely clarified
a lot of things.

1141
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,455
-[Jun-seo] Really?
-[Si-an] Mm.

1142
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,587
-I just feel more at ease now.
-[Jun-seo] Yeah.

1143
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,130
So thanks.

1144
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,506
[Jun-seo snickers]

1145
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:55,263
I really am… going to follow my heart now.

1146
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,306
[Jun-seo] Good.

1147
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,229
I mean, we're given ten days.

1148
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,899
I had no idea this was possible,
to be honest.

1149
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,869
But still, don't think or worry too much.

1150
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,497
-Okay. I really feel…
-You're gonna--

1151
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,624
You're gonna come here with me again.

1152
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,084
-[light music playing]
-[chuckles]

1153
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,963
-[Kyuhyun] What?
-Oh!

1154
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:30,965
[sighs]

1155
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,675
[gasps]

1156
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,593
Yuk.

1157
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,597
Those are words spoken
with a lot of confidence.

1158
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,310
What is going on? I feel like
I'm a fly on the wall right now.

1159
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:46,397
Seriously. Overhearing things
that don't fully make sense.

1160
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,692
-Jun-seo really likes her.
-They're closer than we thought.

1161
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,152
-Yeah.
-For sure.

1162
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,531
If we look back
on Si-an's initial interview,

1163
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,616
she did say that she wanted someone

1164
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:00,161
who could reliably
and confidently wait for her

1165
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,288
because of her indecisive tendencies.

1166
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:06,918
In a way, Jun-seo was able to comfort her
and voice such a bold statement

1167
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,212
even in that less-than-ideal situation.

1168
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:13,174
[Da-hee] I think it got Si-an
to open up to him a little more.

1169
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,552
But for me, to be honest,

1170
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:18,846
I keep thinking it could be dangerous
to date somebody like her.

1171
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,517
Just considering how her feelings
can be so easily influenced

1172
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,395
by all sorts of factors,
you know what I mean?

1173
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:30,567
If I were her partner, I would
honestly feel a little anxious about that.

1174
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,945
But she hasn't started a relationship
with someone just yet.

1175
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,989
She's still processing everything,

1176
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:40,034
which is why I think it's perfectly okay
to be like that at this stage.

1177
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,829
When she said she got a lot of clarity,

1178
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,707
do you think she's made up
her mind on one person

1179
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,709
and that she will follow her heart?

1180
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,586
This is what she meant by clarity?

1181
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:53,464
-"I'm just going to follow my heart."
-[Da-hee] She did say that.

1182
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:56,217
-Isn't that what she's been doing?
-[chuckling]

1183
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,760
No, seriously.

1184
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,972
She's been going on dates
with people she's liked.

1185
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,141
She's been following her heart's desires.

1186
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,852
The difference is
she was feeling guilty before.

1187
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:09,022
-She's decided to not feel that way.
-"What's the point?

1188
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:12,400
I didn't join Single's Inferno
to care what others think of me."

1189
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,152
[Kyuhyun] Yeah.

1190
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:16,821
Whatever. We don't know
how she's feeling, either.

1191
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,657
-[Hye-jin] Wanna go chat?
-[Jeong-su] A chat?

1192
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,618
-What do you say? Let's go.
-[Jeong-su] Okay.

1193
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,162
-Follow me.
-[Hye-jin] What is this?

1194
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,164
[Jeong-su] This feels like a hideout.

1195
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,791
-I forgot about this place.
-Hmm.

1196
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,628
That trip you and I took to Paradise.

1197
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:32,754
Yeah.

1198
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,505
Feels like a very long time ago.

1199
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,257
-I know, right?
-So long. Yeah.

1200
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:39,302
When you were away,
you weren't on my mind.

1201
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:42,722
[Hye-jin] So…

1202
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,559
I mean, I just really wanna know
how you feel now.

1203
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:52,190
For some reason,
I just feel a little lost right now.

1204
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,860
-The way I see it…
-[Jeong-su] Yeah.

1205
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:59,739
…you are being way too nice
and chatty with everyone.

1206
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,577
I feel like you're treating
everyone equally.

1207
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,331
-Personality-wise…
-You know you're doing that?

1208
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:09,749
Huh?

1209
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:15,254
Regardless of gender, I always feel
inclined to take care of people.

1210
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,676
But when you're doing that
to everyone, it can be a little…

1211
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:22,637
you know…

1212
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:25,807
confusing.

1213
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,395
-It's confusing?
-[Hye-jin] Yeah!

1214
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:31,396
You think?

1215
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,107
Isn't that a natural reaction?

1216
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:38,403
Am I right?

1217
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:41,698
That's right.

1218
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,242
Wait. [chuckles]

1219
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,828
What do you mean
when you say, "That's right"?

1220
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,164
You're right.

1221
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,251
[zipper rasps]

1222
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,338
[Hye-jin sighs]

1223
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,132
Tch.

1224
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,844
So tell me who your first choice is.

1225
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,972
-My first choice?
-[Hye-jin] Yeah.

1226
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,517
[Jeong-su] Hmm.

1227
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,310
I'd say…

1228
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:13,604
Si-an.

1229
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,441
Oh, is it really?

1230
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,570
I kind of expected that though.

1231
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:24,449
[serious music playing]

1232
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:25,867
Hmm.

1233
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,872
[Jeong-su] I'm not good at multitasking,

1234
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:31,789
[Hye-jin] Yeah.

1235
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,207
So I wanted…

1236
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,377
to get to know Si-an better first.

1237
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,963
-[Hye-jin] Yeah.
-You know?

1238
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,047
You should do that.

1239
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:43,968
I think so too. I just want to get
to know her better first. That's all.

1240
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:47,013
Well, I'm not sure
if she's the right choice,

1241
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:50,391
but I'm not going
to overcomplicate things at this point.

1242
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,642
Mm-hmm.

1243
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,853
Good luck.

1244
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:54,937
Thanks.

1245
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,939
[laughter]

1246
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,316
I'm rooting for you.

1247
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:00,443
-I'm rooting for you too.
-[Hye-jin] Yeah.

1248
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,947
They don't sound like
they're rooting for each other.

1249
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:09,702
But seeing him be honest
with her is really so refreshing.

1250
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,329
-Not to confuse her.
-Yeah.

1251
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:12,580
He did well.

1252
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,792
Let's go now.

1253
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:16,918
-Why?
-[Hye-jin] Huh?

1254
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,127
Why?

1255
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,005
-I've heard enough. I'm done talking.
-[Jeong-su] Okay.

1256
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,759
-What?
-What?

1257
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,385
-Huh? What?
-What?

1258
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:30,139
-I mean, let's go and hang out.
-[both chuckle]

1259
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,558
Why? Let's hang out here,
just the two of us.

1260
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,270
Just go back now. That's enough.

1261
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,940
-There's nothing to do there.
-What's he getting at?

1262
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,442
Let's go hang out.

1263
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,945
Why? Let's hang out here,
just the two of us.

1264
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,822
-What the…
-[Jeong-su] What?

1265
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,950
-See? You're doing the same thing again.
-Doing what?

1266
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,409
[chuckles]

1267
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:52,829
Geez.

1268
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:54,872
Gosh.

1269
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:56,958
Should we go?

1270
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,709
-[Hye-jin] What?
-Should we go?

1271
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,670
If you have nothing to say, let's go.

1272
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,047
-Come on.
-I have a lot to say.

1273
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,300
-Gosh. Stop it already.
-Stop it.

1274
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,053
-This is his problem.
-[Kyuhyun] Go! Just stand up.

1275
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,388
I have a lot to say.

1276
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,641
Don't give me that, seriously.

1277
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,603
-Shall we go?
-[Hye-jin] We shall.

1278
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,232
I was getting a bit angry
when we were talking back there.

1279
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,945
Jeong-su had been expressing
his feelings for me quite a bit…

1280
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:28,990
which is why I kept feeling so confused.

1281
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:33,578
But then, he admitted
that his number one was Si-an.

1282
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:37,748
So after having that talk with him,
I've definitely had a change of heart,

1283
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,083
and now I'm like,

1284
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:42,128
"Fine, I'll happily focus
on Jong-hoon from now on."

1285
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,755
Did I send mixed signals?

1286
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,174
[sighs]

1287
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,635
She said I had, so I actually…

1288
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:54,307
Well, I mean, I'm not someone
worth hurting her feelings over,

1289
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,934
so that's why I tried
to be nice about everything.

1290
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:02,273
I guess that's why she thought
I was sending her mixed signals.

1291
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:03,858
That must be what it was.

1292
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,903
-Jeong-su.
-[laughter]

1293
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,404
What's with him?

1294
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:09,947
[Kyuhyun] My goodness.

1295
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,491
When it comes to someone
you're not interested in,

1296
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,202
instead of trying to please everyone,

1297
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,497
it's more admirable
if you state your feelings clearly.

1298
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,750
That last part was really unnecessary.

1299
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,711
"Let's stay longer.
Let's talk, just the two of us."

1300
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:27,882
There's no reason to spend more time
with a guy who has someone else in mind.

1301
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:28,883
Yeah.

1302
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:31,135
If we try to see it from his perspective,

1303
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:33,846
they have to see each other
for another 3 or 4 days,

1304
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,474
so maybe he wanted
to avoid ending things awkwardly.

1305
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:37,808
You're thinking too hard.

1306
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:41,020
Maybe he didn't want to make things
uncomfortable between them.

1307
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,191
-[You-jin] Don't we smell good today?
-[Theo] Mm.

1308
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,484
You got any concerns?

1309
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,819
No concerns.
I just need a confidence boost.

1310
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,404
A confidence boost. Okay.

1311
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,326
-I kind of have a question for you.
-Uh-huh.

1312
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:58,245
Say you see the person
you like choosing someone else.

1313
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,206
Would you feel okay if that happens?

1314
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,165
-Me?
-Yeah.

1315
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:04,961
Yes. I mean, it's not
that I'm totally fine with that.

1316
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:08,130
[Theo] I already told Si-an
when we went to Paradise together,

1317
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,882
I knew it was highly unlikely,

1318
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:13,177
that she would like me so much
that she'd only have eyes for me

1319
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,762
until this competition ends.

1320
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:18,099
I told her, "I got to know everyone,
but you're the one for me."

1321
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:21,102
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah, I told her that. What about you?

1322
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,144
-[You-jin] Me?
-Mm.

1323
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:27,984
Well, I actually think that I'm finally
able to express my true feelings now,

1324
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,277
-Go on.
-But I'm feeling depressed.

1325
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:31,278
[Theo] You feel…

1326
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,698
I'm suddenly depressed.

1327
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,825
-Mm.
-[You-jin] After all that.

1328
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,079
And A-rin sleeps right next to me.

1329
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,248
-[cackles]
-This is her bed.

1330
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:45,501
But who knows? You have tomorrow
and the day after tomorrow.

1331
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:46,460
Mm-hmm.

1332
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:47,712
Go fight your battle.

1333
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:51,298
You can be like,
"How was it? Wanna chat later?"

1334
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:54,260
Gosh, you're so smooth.

1335
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:57,513
But that's the difficult part for me.

1336
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:01,642
I bet you'll be much smoother
if you say it in a confident tone.

1337
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:02,935
I'm telling you.

1338
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,522
I mean, it's easier
because I'm comfortable with you,

1339
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,274
-but I just can't…
-Right.

1340
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,484
-I get so awkward.
-[chuckles]

1341
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:14,113
[in robotic tone] Did you have fun
in Paradise?

1342
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:17,658
Want to go chat right now?

1343
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,660
[cackles]

1344
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:22,413
[laughter]

1345
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:24,040
You-jin's let herself loose.

1346
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,000
-[cackles]
-She's showcasing her act.

1347
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,626
-Oh, goodness.
-Wow.

1348
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,881
She finally feels like a real human being
now that she's loosened up.

1349
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,174
[Hanhae] Yeah.

1350
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:37,470
You better muster up the courage.
You don't wanna have any regrets.

1351
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,639
Man, it looks like
it's gonna be war tomorrow.

1352
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,600
We might keep making eye contact.

1353
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,101
Should I?

1354
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,102
Yeah?

1355
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:47,063
What do you think? Should I do it?

1356
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,315
[both laughing]

1357
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,400
[liquid pouring]

1358
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:53,527
What are you doing?

1359
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,489
[Hae-lin] I felt so lonely.

1360
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:59,075
-[Jeong-su] Are you alone?
-Why are you alone?

1361
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,410
-I read a book and stuff.
-[Jeong-su] Hang out with us.

1362
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,411
Let's hang out.

1363
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,537
[Hae-lin] All right.

1364
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,999
[liquid pouring]

1365
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,211
[in robotic tone] Are you still
drinking water?

1366
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:12,797
Are you drinking water?

1367
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,548
-Is she drunk?
-[collective laughter]

1368
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,008
[You-jin in normal tone] No.

1369
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,636
This one's my cup.

1370
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,221
Why do I find her so funny?

1371
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,305
You think I'm funny?

1372
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:23,557
I don't wanna be
this season's comic relief.

1373
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,434
-You are…
-[You-jin] I am.

1374
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,977
…Donald Duck as of today.

1375
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:30,439
Friends shouldn't call each other names.

1376
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:31,857
-I know.
-Did you two chat?

1377
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,400
No, we haven't yet.

1378
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,777
-Shall we?
-Go ahead.

1379
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,820
-You good?
-Mm.

1380
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:37,780
-Aren't you tired?
-Yeah, I really am.

1381
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:40,449
-Yeah, you seem tired.
-Nah, I'm good. Let's go talk.

1382
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:45,246
-[Jeong-su] I want water too.
-[Hae-lin] Let's go get some.

1383
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,999
Can I ask who you chose earlier?

1384
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,837
-Me?
-Is it a secret? Shall we not go there?

1385
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:58,425
-Si-an.
-[Hae-lin] Si-an. Okay.

1386
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,472
Hmm…

1387
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,558
I wanted to talk some more with her.

1388
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:11,605
As of now, I'm feeling something
towards two different people.

1389
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,315
[Hae-lin] Okay.

1390
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,402
I just wanna figure out
if they're genuine feelings or not.

1391
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,949
[Jeong-su] Yesterday, I spent time
with you and it was so much fun.

1392
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,702
You're my ideal type, looks-wise.

1393
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,121
-We talked about this. Mm.
-Mm.

1394
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:32,793
I like you, but one thing about me
is I'm not really good at multitasking.

1395
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,464
So I thought the way to go
was to spend some more time with Si-an,

1396
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,508
which is why I chose her today.

1397
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:42,928
-I get that.
-That's my situation.

1398
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:43,846
[Hae-lin] Right.

1399
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,765
I feel just as confused right now.

1400
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,392
-[Hae-lin] I bet you are.
-Yeah.

1401
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,520
What do you find charming about her?

1402
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:54,481
You mean, her personality?

1403
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,025
How is she different from me?

1404
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,736
You're complete opposites.

1405
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,907
-Really, how so? [chuckles]
-[Jeong-su] What?

1406
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,742
-Well, as for you…
-[Hae-lin] Go ahead.

1407
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:06,493
I want to take care of you.

1408
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:09,371
-Ah.
-[Jeong-su] I want to do more for you.

1409
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,040
Mm-hmm. But?

1410
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,376
[sharp inhale] There is no difference.

1411
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,129
So you wanna take care of her too?

1412
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:19,924
[Jeong-su lips smack]

1413
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:23,552
I think she might be weighing on my mind.

1414
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:25,221
What's he saying?

1415
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,476
I think she might be weighing on my mind.

1416
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:32,436
"Weighing on your mind"?

1417
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,566
I don't get what you're feeling.

1418
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,151
Hmm?

1419
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,028
I don't understand what that means.

1420
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:43,197
Okay.

1421
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,077
I'm not sure
what you're trying to say either.

1422
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,039
To shift the focus a bit,

1423
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:55,125
I was curious whether or not
you had any feelings for me.

1424
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:58,379
I'm not asking
if you only have feelings for me,

1425
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:00,798
but I'm asking
if you're genuinely drawn to me.

1426
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,051
Because I see
how you usually are to people.

1427
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,637
You're generally sweet
and caring to everyone.

1428
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:10,057
But that's what made me confused.

1429
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,851
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, it's been a little confusing.

1430
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:17,189
No, I'm not as caring to the others.

1431
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,733
-[Hae-lin] You aren't? Was I mistaken?
-[chuckles]

1432
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,610
You seemed to be pretty caring.

1433
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,698
It made me start to wonder.

1434
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:30,828
It's cold.

1435
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:32,621
-You're cold?
-[Hae-lin] Yeah.

1436
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,164
Do you want this?

1437
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:36,041
[Hae-lin] No, it's fine. It's okay.

1438
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,085
[snickers]

1439
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:40,045
I'm feeling hot now.

1440
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:41,380
Really?

1441
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,429
Seriously, tell me if you're cold.

1442
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:50,973
-[Jeong-su] Okay, I'll tell you.
-You better.

1443
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:54,184
I should've slept that extra 30 minutes.

1444
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,853
Go to bed. Go now.

1445
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,690
-Sleep.
-[Jeong-su] I mean…

1446
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,191
I'm feeling

1447
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:03,902
a bit groggy now.

1448
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:05,863
Let's go to bed, then.

1449
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:07,740
Let's go.

1450
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,575
That'd be a shame.

1451
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,119
There he goes again.

1452
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:14,038
Get some rest if you feel groggy.

1453
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,040
-Go inside and sleep.
-[Kyuhyun] Yeah.

1454
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:18,834
That'd be a shame.

1455
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,212
-Don't you think?
-I don't understand you.

1456
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,714
-[Jeong-su] Me?
-Yeah.

1457
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:26,133
You're so wishy-washy with your words.

1458
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:28,802
[chuckles]

1459
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:31,430
-Am I really?
-[Hae-lin] Yeah, you definitely are.

1460
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,934
I hate getting mixed signals, honestly.

1461
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:39,438
I made it clear for you
so that you wouldn't feel that way, no?

1462
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:40,773
When?

1463
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,442
-[Hae-lin] When?
-Didn't I?

1464
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:45,569
[groans]

1465
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:48,155
-So annoying.
-[Jin-young] Look at Hae-lin's face.

1466
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:49,281
[Jin-young chuckles]

1467
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,450
I mean…

1468
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,912
Do you wanna talk and hang out?
Because I honestly don't know.

1469
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,290
No, I want to hang out. I want to stay.

1470
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,584
But, given the state
that I'm in right now,

1471
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:04,588
I'm wondering if my state
is actually causing you harm.

1472
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:05,881
[Hae-lin] No, I'm fine.

1473
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:13,764
I would've admired him if he actually
said, "I really like Si-an" instead.

1474
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:19,686
His ambiguous way of speaking was just
not something I was vibing with.

1475
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:26,026
I thought it was rather important
to be straightforward,

1476
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:29,696
to be clear about
what my feelings are to Hae-lin,

1477
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,616
so I was honest with her and told her

1478
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:35,202
that I was leaning more
towards Si-an right now.

1479
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:38,122
Was I not clear about that either?

1480
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,581
[chuckles]

1481
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:40,666
[sighs]

1482
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,251
He wasn't clear at all.

1483
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,628
He said he chose Si-an today.

1484
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:47,381
He also said he really liked
spending time with her

1485
01:13:47,464 --> 01:13:49,133
and that he liked them both.

1486
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:51,844
So he wasn't being very clear.

1487
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:56,223
I think he made it clear to Hye-jin,
but he wasn't being as clear with Hae-lin.

1488
01:13:57,057 --> 01:14:00,060
Or maybe he wanted to explain
why he chose Si-an,

1489
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,520
but he was half asleep, so…

1490
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:05,023
-He wasn't thinking clearly?
-Maybe that's what he meant to say

1491
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,859
but he wasn't saying much.

1492
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:10,529
Wanting to take care of someone
versus someone on your mind, same thing?

1493
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,573
-Which is it?
-It's the same thing.

1494
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:13,949
-Know what?
-[hosts] What?

1495
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:15,492
He made it up on the spot.

1496
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,119
"He made it up."

1497
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:18,162
Right, I think so.

1498
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:19,413
-[Da-hee] Really?
-Yeah.

1499
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:22,166
-He just started to freestyle on that one.
-[Jin-kyung] Freestyle.

1500
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:23,125
I'm serious.

1501
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,127
-So he just misspoke.
-Right.

1502
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,920
There's no reason to analyze it.

1503
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,339
Let me make this easier to understand,

1504
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,675
"What's the difference
between liking someone

1505
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:34,970
and wanting to get started with someone?"
That's what this is.

1506
