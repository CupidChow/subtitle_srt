How's your second time
in Paradise with me?

17
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,141


18
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,018
- My second time with you?
Yeah.

19
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,736
- You sleeping?
- You sleeping?

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,114
- Come on. That's ridiculous.
- You're kidding.

21
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,199
There's no way.

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,744
You asleep?

23
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:18,953


24
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:19,871
No.

25
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,333
- Oh.
- Thank goodness.

26
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,667
What a relief.

27
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,547
How do you like being in Paradise
for the second time with me?

28
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,673
For the second time?

29
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,760
How did this second trip happen again?

30
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,683
Geez.

31
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,018
How did trip this happen?

32
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,022
Because you won the game.
You won first place.

33
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:46,940
That's right.

34
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,236
Do you think it's worth coming here again?

35
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,153
What?

36
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,531
What do you think?

37
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,698
This isn't cutting it.

38
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,160
- It isn't?
No. We didn't get to talk much today.

39
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,078
I know.

40
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,956
I thought
today would be important.

41
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,290
Me too.

42
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,127
I'm honestly not so sure.

43
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,172
About how you're even feeling

44
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,216
in this moment.

45
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,343
Honestly…

46
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,141
we didn't talk much at all this time.

47
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,228
I've just…

48
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,898
I've been wondering if you're even still…

49
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,151
curious about me, you know?

50
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,906
I'm just trying to convince myself that…

51
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,826
you're just tired.

52
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,122
That's what it feels like.

53
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,583
Still…

54
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,712
I've been making a good effort,
all things considered.

55
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:51,880
Hm.

56
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,550
So, from your perspective,
the fact that I'm looking too tired,

57
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,803
is that bothering you a lot on this trip?

58
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,013
Is that what you mean?

59
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:00,930
Mm-hmm.

60
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,392
Yeah. Because you seem so different
from yesterday.

61
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,612
You know I'm not a man of many words.

62
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,155


63
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,782
I'm not the type to express
my feelings with words.

64
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,869
So you express yourself
in your own macho way?

65
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,746


66
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,539
I don't understand that, honestly.

67
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,125
Ah, dang it.

68
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,801
I'm not fit for how fast-paced
this whole thing is.

69
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,886


70
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,722
I mean, how do we make
such an important decision

71
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,932
in just a day or two?

72
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,685
I'm not telling you to make a decision.

73
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,979
I'm just asking
how you're feeling right now.

74
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,940
I'm feeling good right now.

75
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,693
Then why can't you be
a little sweeter towards me?

76
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,862
This is who I am.
What can I do about that?

77
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,326
I'll try to change though.

78
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,705
You could be more gentle with me.
Be gentle with me, please.

79
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,250
Have I ever been gentle with you before?

80
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,460
- Yeah. You were yesterday.
Yesterday?

81
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,631
Okay.

82
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,092
I'll give it a shot.

83
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,054
Don't ask me for a high five right now.

84
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,558
- Don't do that!
- He should give her a hug.

85
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,023
- Why is he being like that to Si-an?
- Geez.

86
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,150
Why would you even do that?

87
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,112
- He's all like…
- Kyuhyun's been very patient until now.

88
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,447
Kyuhyun is speaking for Si-an right now.

89
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,076
A high five at a time like that?
Like, "All right. Okay. Let's do this."

90
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,869
Are you actually kidding me?

91
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,042
Don't ask me for a high five right now.

92
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,627


93
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,712
You're so annoying.

94
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,754


95
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,717
But the ideal relationship
that I eventually want

96
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,927
can't be achieved
through effort, you know?

97
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,430
Especially a romantic relationship.

98
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,348
Mm-hmm.

99
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,977
But adjustment and compromise
is the basis of any good relationship.

100
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,894
Right.

101
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,731
You and I obviously grew up
in different environments.

102
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,982
- That's true.
Right?

103
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:16,899
Hm.

104
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,361
I'm just saying that we should both
make more of an effort.

105
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,947
- You're right.
If that's at all possible.

106
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,826
I do think that you
and I are similar in ways.

107
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,745
- Yeah.
And we're very different too.

108
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,955
I'll try to be better.

109
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,417
So that I can express
more gentleness towards you.

110
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,629
Cover up.

111
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,885
Bedtime?

112
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:44,802
Okay.

113
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,638
Let's do that.

114
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,731
- That was a nice conversation.
- I get where they're coming from.

115
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,068
I think that they had a bit
of a bumpy ride there for a second,

116
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,112
but that last conversation
was very beautiful to watch.

117
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,697
It felt super comfortable.

118
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,199
- It was nice.
- Yeah.

119
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,035
Like what Si-an mentioned,
it does go both ways

120
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,121
when it comes to making an effort
to finding a happy medium.

121
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,791
But at the same time,
you shouldn't attempt to fix

122
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,794
or change the person
you're trying to be with, because…

123
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,171
You shouldn't try
to change the other person

124
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,881
to the way you want them to be.

125
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,218
People don't change drastically
for someone else.

126
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,345
It's rare to find someone that'd do that.

127
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,847
This wasn't the first time
she brought that up.

128
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,059
- She'd been repeating herself.
- It's an ongoing issue.

129
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,727
- Yeah.
- But here's the thing.

130
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,939
They're drawn to each other,
while knowing they're incompatible.

131
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,649
- They're drawn to each other.
- Yeah.

132
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,321
What Jun-seo said was interesting, though.
"Have I ever been sweet to you before?"

133
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,031
It's just…

134
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,451
I was surprised
that he could be that blunt to her.

135
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,329
It's not easy to be that blunt.

136
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,998
He even topped it all off
with that high five.

137
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,835
But even if Jun-seo
were more gentle like Jeong-su,

138
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,462
I just don't think
it would suit him at all.

139
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,382
Even just asking that of him
is pushing it.

140
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,509
She knows he isn't that kind of person…

141
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,719
And she liked him for exactly who he was.

142
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,763
Usually, you keep trying to change

143
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,558
the person who's probably thinking,
"This is who I am."

144
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:17,186
Saying, "You weren't like this yesterday.
You used to be different."

145
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,689
just shows
that she's dwelling on the past.

146
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,649
And Jun-seo doesn't think he's changed

147
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,943
so he's saying,
"I've always been like this."

148
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,529
They're in the early stages
of their relationship,

149
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,031
so their expectations
are causing this, right?

150
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,018
Same room.

151
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,229
Oh, it's just the two
of them right now. Gosh.

152
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,572
It's Min-seol.

153
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,742
Is she here to vent again?

154
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,619
Min-seol?

155
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,120
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

156
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,038
Hi!

157
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,581
I'm just here to hang out.

158
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,294
Did you make up your mind?

159
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,213
You're asking me?

160
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,173
I think…

161
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:29,884
Go on.

162
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,219
I'm just gonna go for it.

163
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,887
With Jun-seo?

164
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,514
Nice.

165
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,681
That's amazing.

166
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,312
But, don't you think that he chose
to go to Paradise with Si-an yesterday…

167
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,607
to make up his mind about her?

168
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,319
The best thing to do is talk to him
when he's back.

169
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:52,240
I am planning to talk to him, but I'm more
concerned about how to talk to him.

170
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,866
Like, how should I bring it up?

171
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,536
Seriously, he's the hardest kind of guy
to deal with.

172
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,122
But, honestly, it's about time
he made things clear to me.

173
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,541
For sure.

174
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,961
It's not like we don't have something
going on between us.

175
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,587
Something's definitely there.

176
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,882
He has to tell me how he feels.

177
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,177
So I can sort my feelings out.
Why do I have to suffer like this?

178
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,890
I say you just ask him.
You should talk to him first.

179
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,601
And say what?
Should I suggest Johnnie Walker?

180
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,774
Is "Let's get a drink" better, or…

181
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,527
"Will you drink Johnnie Walker with me?"

182
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,862
I like, "Let's go drink Johnnie Walker!"

183
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,615
- Yeah, that's cuter.
- Let's practice then!

184
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,701
- What?
- One of you has to play Jun-seo.

185
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,578
- Practice.
- Let me start?

186
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,537
Go on.

187
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,330
"Jun-seo, I need to talk to you."

188
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,665
"Sure. Okay."

189
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,208
Stomp-stomp-stomp…

190
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,669
- And we walk. We sit down.
- We walk and sit down.

191
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,130
- What a character.
- What?

192
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,673
- Keep going.
- We sit down.

193
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,509
"How was Paradise? Was it fun?"

194
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,637
- "We talked about this…"
- This is hilarious.

195
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,681
"Did you get to drink Johnnie Walker?"

196
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,142
Let's say that he didn't.

197
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,315
She's so cute.

198
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,400
Don't worry, he didn't drink any.

199
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,694
"You asked me--"

200
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,113
Tell him that's why
you got the wrong idea.

201
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,783
"I really don't know, Jun-seo.
I feel lost and confused right now."

202
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,951
That's what I'll say.

203
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,202
How are you so funny?

204
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,622
"I swear, I couldn't even sleep, Jun-seo!

205
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,916
Why did you ask me if I wanted to go
to Paradise with you?

206
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,045
Why did you make it seem
like you were gonna pick me?"

207
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,881
Just tell him you were upset.
Like "I was upset!"

208
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,508
- "I was upset!"
- Yeah! "I thought you'd pick me!"

209
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,553
"My roommates thought I'd go.
We even exchanged goodbyes!"

210
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,138
- Nice one.
- I better say that.

211
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,348
- You should.
- Not bad?

212
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,141
- It's great.
- You think it's okay?

213
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,602
That's what I'd do.
You're so cute.

214
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,023
Min-seol really brightens
the mood in Inferno.

215
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,359
I'm so grateful for her presence. Truly.

216
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,568
A breath of fresh air.

217
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,904
I really do love her positive energy.

218
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,452
<i>Bye.</i>

219
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,083
Getting on this thing
always gives you that dopamine boost.

220
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,546
You sleepy?

221
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,174
Lean on me.

222
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,343
I actually used to like
this kind of stuff.

223
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,929


224
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,014
We're above the clouds.

225
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,770
Oh?

226
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,980
Man, Jeong-su… Oh!

227
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,691
- Why did they sit next to each other?
- I know!

228
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,277
Gosh, if I were Jun-seo,
I'd switch seats with her.

229
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,012
Go on, get some sleep.

230
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,974
I better.

231
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,569
On the helicopter, she had her head
on Jun-seo's shoulder next to me.

232
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,404
And…

233
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,157
I can be…

234
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,284
a bit on the conservative side.

235
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,494
I find those things unacceptable.

236
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,289
So it definitely got me thinking.

237
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,625
Oh, I didn't know he was conservative.

238
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,088
If he finds that unacceptable
then what's she supposed to do?

239
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,256
Lean on his shoulder?

240
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,926
But whether you're conservative or not,
seeing someone you like

241
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,345
leaning against another man's shoulder

242
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,889
is bound to bother you.

243
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,265
It's annoying.

244
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,517
It's definitely enough to show him

245
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,145
that she's more drawn to Jun-seo
than him now.

246
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,438
Right.

247
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:56,233
But if we look at the flip side
and see how Jeong-su is feeling,

248
00:12:56,317 --> 00:13:00,821
the fact that he is jealous about this
proves that he has feelings for her too.

249
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,908
Considering how drawn he is to Si-an,

250
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,744
I don't think
he's given her enough reassurance…

251
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,828
or any at all.

252
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,206
Neither one of them
has been expressive to her.

253
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,332
Don't you think?

254
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,000
He's made up his mind now.

255
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,920
But Si-an doesn't know
that he's made up his mind.

256
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,507
- True, she has no idea.
- Yeah. The timing's just off.

257
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,802
- This looks great.
- It came out so well.

258
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,180
I think this came out well too.

259
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,598
That's so cute.

260
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,476
- Aw, Theo.
- Look. He's lost weight.

261
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,561
- He's looking so gaunt.
- No. Look at him.

262
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,604
I get why.

263
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,441
- Is that Si-an next to you?
- I took a picture like this.

264
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,901
The flower ring I gave her.

265
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,153
- Where?
- You look like a couple.

266
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,321
This one is so cool.

267
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,115
No, okay. No, this is--
Oh, wait…

268
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,671
You miss her, don't you?

269
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,588
What?

270
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,632
I know you miss her. You miss Si-an.

271
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,425
Shush.

272
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,636
What? Why, what is it?

273
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:09,306
His eyes were getting all misty
while staring at her in this picture.

274
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,891
- I was yawning.
- The clips.

275
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,810
- That's why I asked.
- I was yawning.

276
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,648
I was looking at it
because Si-an was away in Paradise.

277
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,610
The thing is you never know if being
in Paradise will deepen the relationship

278
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,529
or leave it at a standstill.

279
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,949
I wanted to distract myself
from becoming impatient.

280
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,205
Where is everyone?

281
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,832
We're back.

282
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,375
Not like that.

283
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,752
- I'm not going to greet like that today.
- Okay.

284
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,965
Today, I'm going for elegant and chic,
just like my outfit.

285
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,509
You're already failing, then.

286
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,766
Thank you for carrying my bag.

287
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,352
- My pleasure.
- See you later.

288
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,896
Do you…

289
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,772
need help?

290
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,566
Si-an is getting it.

291
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,984
Thank you.

292
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,569
You're back already?

293
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,696
Hello!

294
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,780
What's up?

295
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,703
How was it? I'm dying to know.

296
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,413
- Us?
- Yeah.

297
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,917
It was super fun and pleasant.

298
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,629
- We became quite close in Inferno.
- Nice.

299
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,130
Si-an's all ears now.

300
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,048
- Mm.
- Mm.

301
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,386
Going to Paradise after getting close
made it much more comfortable.

302
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,764
- It felt different from before.
- Sounds fun.

303
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,974
- I guess you hit it off.
- It was funny.

304
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,476
Yeah. Unexpectedly.

305
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,729
We were both playful with each other.

306
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,650
Since I've only seen him in Inferno,
I never expected to see this side of him.

307
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,610
A different side.

308
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,452
I think I've been
so unlucky here with the guys,

309
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,120
couple matching and everything.

310
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,538
I better go see Hye-jin.

311
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,835
She's here.

312
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,587
- She's back.
- Hye-jin?

313
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,632
- Look who it is.
- She's finally arrived.

314
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,468
Come on, baby.

315
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,514
- Why are you guys back so soon today?
- I know.

316
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,808
- What'd you do yesterday?
- Yesterday?

317
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,852
We had <i>ramyeon</i>
and just partied amongst ourselves.

318
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,854
Then we all got together and chatted.

319
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,148
Gosh, that sounds nice.

320
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,527
Also, yesterday,
Theo was being incredibly funny.

321
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,028
Really? Why?

322
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,989
Just the way he was talking and stuff.

323
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:30,906
Oh, okay.

324
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,324
Theo.

325
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,493
Theo…

326
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,705
No.

327
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,873
No?

328
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,791
Mm.

329
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,334
Did you have fun?

330
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,920
It's just…

331
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,172
Yeah, it was fun.

332
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,052
But I'm not so sure anymore.

333
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,179
I don't know. I guess he was tired.

334
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,140
Yesterday in general was just not…

335
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,350
I don't know.

336
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,187
I think I got my hopes up a little,
because we had fun the day before.

337
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,605
Because you two went twice?

338
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,650
Right. I was feeling optimistic
since it's our second time.

339
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,445
I just wanted
a deeper emotional connection maybe?

340
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,990
I just wanted to see if we could be
more expressive to each other.

341
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:18,203
Jun-seo isn't exactly the sweetest guy
on earth, as you would know, Min-seol.

342
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,580
True. He's not.

343
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,957
He's more macho. Kind of like a beast.

344
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,834
- "A beast."
- Yeah.

345
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,627
He kept saying, "Hey, just do it."

346
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,464
- Like, "Hey, did you do it?"
- Like, "Hey, you do it?"

347
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,550
So, I wasn't the only one.
It hurt my feelings, you know?

348
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,970
Me too. And I kept saying,
"No, call me Si-an. Call me Si-an."

349
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,432
- He kept calling me, "Hey…"
- He addresses you with "hey"?

350
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,060
- He always goes like…
- He's like, "Hey. Hey, hey."

351
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,019
Yeah, it's like…

352
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,647
We went to Paradise,
I asked if he was usually like that

353
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,816
or if he was just too comfortable with me.

354
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,318
I also asked.

355
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,737
I mean, he said he was enjoying himself.

356
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,113
But…

357
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,407
I just can't tell, to be honest.

358
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,910
- If he truly means it?
He says he did.

359
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,913
Like "Sure. It was nice."
But that's all he said about it.

360
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,331
Same with me.

361
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,124
- What?
- He does that to me.

362
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,963
That's exactly it. Like, "It was nice,"
and that's all he ever says.

363
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,299
Oh, my gosh. This is not good.

364
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,430
So, I'm not really sure
at the moment. I'm a bit…

365
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,433
The things is,
he keeps saying that he likes me,

366
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,936
but I just don't feel it from him.

367
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,397
- He told you he liked you?
I know exactly what you mean.

368
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,024
- Why do you think that is?
And I…

369
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,984
- What?
Why don't you feel it?

370
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,361
I'm not sure.

371
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,156
Maybe he was too tired yesterday,

372
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,200
or maybe I was just expecting too much,

373
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,536
or maybe we just do things differently.

374
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,747
Anyway, I told him
what I didn't like about him.

375
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,960
And I actually had to ask him
to be a little kinder and sweeter to me.

376
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,087
- Then he said he'd change for me.
And?

377
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,506
- Or that he'll make an effort at least.
Okay.

378
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,592
So you guys
have really talked about these things?

379
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,637
- Yeah.
- Well, I guess he's all in for Si-an then.

380
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,182
I didn't know you were talking so much.

381
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,769
No, but… Oh, you know what?

382
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,689
When we had dinner,
we were talking about this and that,

383
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,816
but then he brought you up, Min-seol.

384
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,318
Like "I'm a bit hung up on Min-seol."

385
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,321
He said something like that.
"She's been on my mind."

386
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,574
- I think that was it. Anyway…
Really?

387
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,243
He mentioned your name,
and I was so shocked.

388
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,203
Okay.

389
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,207
Seriously, Kim Min-seol, that girl…

390
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,585
Look, she's grinning.

391
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,631
- How can someone be so obvious?
- She doesn't care what people think.

392
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,885
He mentioned your name,
and I was so shocked.

393
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,636
Okay.

394
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,597
That's what I'm feeling.

395
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,601
I really thought
that he only saw me as a younger sister,

396
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,937
or just as a friend, but to know
that he was thinking about me,

397
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,230
over there in Paradise,

398
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,817
I feel sorry for Si-an,
but it was pleasing to hear.

399
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,195
I had a hard time
stopping myself from smiling.

400
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,364
Okay…

401
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,825
Well,
I have something to say too.

402
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,912
He's the one who came
to ask if I wanted to go to Paradise.

403
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,955
- Really?
- Yeah!

404
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,166
He asked if I wanted to go to Paradise.

405
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,879
He said that he liked whiskey.
Particularly, Johnnie Walker.

406
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,049
So, I suggested that we drink it
next time we go to Paradise.

407
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,510
I heard you had whiskey yesterday,
so I asked, "You had whiskey?"

408
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,721
and he said
"I didn't have Johnnie Walker."

409
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,642
- He said that. That's why I thought…
- My gosh.

410
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,853
I thought I was going,
so I was looking forward to it.

411
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,147
You two were like,
"See you tomorrow," right?

412
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,274
- That's right.
- Then, he chose you, Si-an.

413
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,860
- I thought he'd pick Min-seol.
- I was stunned.

414
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:41,031
So if I get a chance to talk to him,
I wanna ask why he said that to me.

415
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,824
Seriously, I wanna know so badly.

416
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,660
The thing is…

417
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,583
When we went to Paradise together,
for the first time,

418
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,170
the pressure of it all
made me feel so conflicted and emotional.

419
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,507
But there was one thing
I clearly remember him saying.

420
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,134
"You don't have to choose me,
but you're it for me."

421
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,803
- Really?
That's what he told me.

422
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,471
- The other day?
Yeah.

423
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,891
- The first time you went together?
When we first went to Paradise.

424
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,769
But then, the next day,

425
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,982
we're having dinner, and he was mentioning
that you were on his mind.

426
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,860
It kind of seemed like
he's having trouble focusing on our date.

427
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,196
It could've been
because he was tired though.

428
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,657
My point is, why did he have
to say that to you?

429
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,451
Why did he have to tell you
I was on his mind?

430
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,663
He was in a bad mood for the whole trip.

431
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,124
It was an uncomfortable feeling. You know?

432
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,960
When we finished dinner, he went like,

433
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,796
"Let's go" and just stood up,
when we had barely talked.

434
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,006
What?

435
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,550
What the heck?

436
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,885
Seriously, what?

437
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,845
I know.

438
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,223
This confusion that I'm feeling…

439
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,977
I just really hope that it's not because
there's something wrong with me.

440
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,064
So fascinating.

441
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,191
It seriously is.

442
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,609
So interesting.

443
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,278
Oh, my gosh.

444
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,489
The conversation
could be the tipping point

445
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,824
for Si-an to waver again.

446
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,534
This will totally make her waver.

447
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,079
'Cause the person who she thought
was focused on her,

448
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,832
turned out to have said
something similar to Min-seol.

449
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,751
- Yeah.
- This could mess with her head.

450
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,710
Exactly.

451
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,505
With Min-seol, rather than trying
to turn Si-an against her,

452
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,134
she just seems to be sharing her thoughts
on what's been confusing her,

453
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,219
there's nothing malicious there, right?

454
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,930
The moment she heard
that she was on Jun-seo's mind,

455
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,640
she couldn't keep quiet anymore.

456
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,851
That's why
she brought up the whiskey story.

457
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:33,810
Yeah.

458
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,563
- She's not lying here.
- She's laying out the facts.

459
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:40,817
But given Si-an's current situation,
she might twist her words a little bit.

460
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,779
Jun-seo--

461
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,696
Oh, gosh.

462
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,656
<i>Once again,</i>

463
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,867

<i>Contestants,</i>
<i>please gather by the pool.</i>

467
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,461
Why is it
the swimming pool again?

468
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,879
This is crazy.

469
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,882
- I'm really stressed all of a sudden.
- I'm stressed too.

470
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:04,800
Please…

471
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,103
- You have to push them off.
- You're right.

472
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,979
Looks like a pushing game.

473
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,314
They're here.

- Seriously.
- It's scary.

479

Oh, please. Seriously.

480
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,926
I really wanna go
to Paradise this time. Please.

481
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:48,969
That could be it.

482
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,429
This one's making me feel very nervous.

483
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,389
Same.

<i>for a date in Paradise.</i>

486
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,773
THE WOMEN'S GAME FOR A DATE IN PARADISE

487
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,944
<i>The top three winners of this game</i>
<i>will get the chance to pick</i>

00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,536
<i>Today's game is…</i>

490
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,205
<i>Push Off the Buoy.</i>

491
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,543
- We have to push this thing?
- We go up and push the others.

492
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,003
Oh, we're standing on that?

493
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,340
<i>Women,</i>
<i>please stand on the buoy and wait.</i>

494
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:32,470
<i>When you hear the signal, you may start</i>
<i>pushing your opponent off the buoy.</i>

495
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,347
WHOEVER PUSHES THE OPPONENT OFF FIRST WINS

496
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:38,476
The risky thing about this game
is that it'll show your victories,

497
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,770
but it'll highlight your losses even more.

498
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,815
I feel like they'll compete really hard
in this game.

499
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,443
Hae-lin, A-rin, and Min-seol
will go hard, for sure.

500
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,070
Wow, the girls will be out for blood!

501
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,363
Oh. Oh, no.

502
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,656
Oh, my gosh. Come on.

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,327
<i>The three winners of the preliminary round</i>

00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:00,123
<i>Your first opponents</i>
<i>will be determined through a draw.</i>

507
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,630
<i>the preliminary round</i>
<i>will be a three-way fight.</i>

508
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,090
Okay.

509
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,258
A three-way fight?

510
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,802
- That'll be tough.
- Depends who you're up against.

511
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:13,970
That'll be important.

512
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,514
I just really wanna avoid Si-an.

513
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,560
<i>Starting off with Kim A-rin,</i>
<i>please draw a ball.</i>

514
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,022
Not a three-way match.

00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,485
- It's green.
<i>Kim A-rin picked the green ball.</i>

516

What color is it?

517

This is nuts.

- You better go easy on us.
- Oh, no.

529
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,701
Yeah.

530
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,452
- It won't be easy.
- Okay.

Hae-lin, I wanna go to Paradise.

But I want to go too.

- Hope I don't see you later.

541
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,982
Seriously, not today.
We've had enough of each other.

542
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,734
Yeah. The three of us need space.

543
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,235
One of us will stay here.

544
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,988

They look so cold.

552

Ooh.

555
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,929
I'm so scared, Ji-yeon.

556
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,973
Are you athletic?

557
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,267
Are you? I think you might be.

558
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,187
Well, I've never done
anything like this before.

559
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,190
Ji-yeon seems like
she works out a lot.

560
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,734
- Both of them might be athletic.
- Are they?

561
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,612
You-jin has strong legs,
she might be good at balancing.

562
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,696
Yeah.

563
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,783
Gosh. You look so stable.

564

"I'm scared."

574
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,195
- Whoa! Dang.
- Ji-yeon!

575
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,159

- Ji-yeon got out of it.
- Wow.

584
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,655
What if she yanks her hair?

585

Wow. Whoa, Ji-yeon.

- Brownie points for creativity.
- Tickle, tickle.

590

Tickle, tickle.

591

No.

592
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,016
- It won't work on her.
- Oh, my gosh!

593
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,851
No.

594
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,687
Wait a second. Wait. Hey, wait.

595
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,938
Oh, no.

596
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:34,856

600
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,447

- They're competitive than us.
- I'm sorry.

603
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,998
She pushed her with her head.

604
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,000
Wow, this is honestly really fierce.

605
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,085
- Wow, this game is so much fun.
- Oh, my goodness.

606
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,046
- Ji-yeon wins for cuteness.
- I agree.

607
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,381
That "tickle, tickle"
was so cute.

608
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,842
Good job, You-jin.

This game is…

614
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,733
Min-seol and Hae-lin are desperate.

615
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,777
- They are.
- Gotta win no matter what.

616
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,363
- They aren't for the same guy, right?
- They aren't.

617
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,991
Why does it have to be us two?

618
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,660
I know.

619
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,121
I haven't been to Paradise in days,

620
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,749
I have no idea what's going on
in the outside world.

621
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,336
I need to win this game so I can go
to Paradise with Jun-seo today.

622
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,838
There's no going back.

623
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,131
I'm pretty strong.

624
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,927
And I'm tall,
so I thought I might have an advantage.

625
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,929
My heart's beating so fast.

626
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:49,806

631
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:09,868
Get lower!

632
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,704
She's so good.

633
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,252
- Oh, no, Min-seol. Hold on!
- Min-seol, grab her leg.

634
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,962
Hold it. Lower.

635
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:22,797
Hold it.

636
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,007
Lower.

637
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,677

- The tables have turned!
- Seriously?

640

She's taking his advice.

641
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,852
- Nice one. Keep it up!
- Yes. A little more!

642
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,440
- Wait, it's not over yet.
- Go for it!

643
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,150
- Push her!
- You can do it.

644
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,693
- Just push!
- Push her.

645
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,112
You can do it! You can do it!

646
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,322
I'm getting tired.

647
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,907

She's back up.

649
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,160
She's back up.

650
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,912

651
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,960
Oh, no!

652
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,047
- No!
- Legs split!

653
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,215
I won't budge!

654
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,384
No, not a chance!

No, not a chance!

661
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,065
I refuse to be pushed!

662
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,444
- No, come on guys, no.
- No, Min-seol.

663
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:32,450

Okay, just don't get pushed off.

00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,044
Oh.

668
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,755
Oh.

672
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,768
- There goes our youngest contestant.
- My gosh.

673
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:02,063
- That one was so intense.
- She really tried her best.

674
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,316
- Good job.
- Good game, you two.

675
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,486
Hae-lin did really well on that one.

676
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,328
- She seems really upset.
- Gosh.

677
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,581
- I can't wait for the next one.
- Same.

678
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,793
All three of us want different guys,
so it's a little more…

679
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:24,836
I'm so nervous.

680
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,547
You can't complain.
This is all because of you!

681

I'm just so nervous.

682
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,466

This match looks like a tough one.

687
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,937
They might go after Si-an first.

688
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,689
The other two will team up.

689
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,775
She's proven herself already.
She seems fit too.

690
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,776
She does.

691
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:50,820
I can do this.

692
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,120

- Good luck!
- Go, Hye-jin.

695
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,595
<i>You may begin</i>
<i>once you hear the signal. Ready.</i>

696
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,942
Do two against one.

697
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,779
Ahh!

698
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,697
Ahh!

699
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,657
- Wow, what…
- Wait, what?

700
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,909
Wow.

701
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,285
Ahh!

702
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,581
Wait! No, stop!

703
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,125
My gosh!
She's trying to push them both off?

704
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,005
Hang on!

705
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,048
Wow.

706
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,132
Whoa.

707
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,300
Whoa…

708
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,679
Hang on!

709
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,140
Wow, what…

710
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,475
- Hang on!
- Wow.

711
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:03,893
Oh?

712
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,564
See? It's game over now. Wait!

713
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,486
<i>Kim A-rin is out.</i>

714
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,363
See? It's game over now.

715
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,948
- No match for her.
- Wait.

716
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,909
No, wait.

717
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,828
Hold on just a second!

718
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,371
- Okay.
- Wait.

719
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,206
- Get up.
- Please go easy on me.

720
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,879
What if she just pushes her off?

721
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,382
- Just go easy on me for once. Okay?
- I will.

722
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,342
- Wait.
- Okay?

723
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,430
- Wow!
- Come on.

724
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,225
She's crumpling up like paper.

725
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,521
No! Hye-jin, get up! Come on!

726
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,148
Come on, you can do it!

727
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,704
- Gosh. Look at these two!
- Look! She's kicking her.

728
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,626
Ow!

729
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,129
Ow!

730
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,757
Hye-jin is good.

731
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,009
She's so strong.

732
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,135
Keep it up!

733
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,805
Okay, wait. Hold on.

734
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,183
This is too tiring.

735
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,104
They look like that show, <i>Slave Hunters.</i>

736
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,194
Hold on.

737
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,826
You need to sit down.

738
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,995
- No!
- Okay?

739
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,540
- You need to sit down.
- No!

740
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,793
No!

741
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,255
- No!
- No, she slipped. No, no!

742
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,924
No!

743
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,301
- Wait.
- No way!

744
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,221
- She just survived it!
- She didn't fall off the buoy.

745
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:04,680
No!

746
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,432
I'm so tired.

747
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,684
Wow.

748
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,102
She's back, she's back on.

749
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,609
Oh!

750
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,906
- Just push her!
- Yes!

751
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,908
- Push harder! Go!
- Yeah!

752
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,081
Oh, hang on. Oh!

753
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,042
Oh!

754
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,053
Babe.

755
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,304
- Babe.
- Wait…

756
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,517
Oh, my gosh, these two
are really impressive… Seriously.

757
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,977
They're incredible.

758
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,564
- Gosh. They must be so tired.
- Gosh, just fall off already.

759
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,525
I'm dying right now.

760
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,071
- You can do it!
- It's so draining.

761
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,614
I thought I was gonna die.

762
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,283
- You can do it.
- Let's go!

763
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,076
- Keep it up!
- You got this!

764
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,830
Wow.

765
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,708
Keep going! One last push!

766
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,336
Keep going! One last push!

767
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,754
Aah!

768
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,342
Oh? Oh!

769
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,136
She might be overpowered.

770
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,929
- She's holding out.
- Hold out.

771
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,398
Push her off.

772
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,316
No!

773
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,777
Oh!

774
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,737
Yes, lift her!

775
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,821
Can she do that?

776
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,114
Push her off.

777
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,490
No!

778
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,201
Hold out.

779
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,412
- Just hold out.
- Oh, whoa.

780
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,581
- Oh, my gosh.
- <i>Kim Hye-jin is out.</i>

781
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,666
<i>The winner of this round is Lee Si-an.</i>

782
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,002
- Ahh.
- Goodness gracious.

783
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,379
- Gosh, Si-an's really strong.
- She is.

784
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,090
- That was no joke.
- That was incredible.

785
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,216
You guys did so well.

786
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,718
- Seriously.
- Gosh.

787
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,972
Seriously, you're too strong.

788
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,147
<i>The final round</i>
<i>will be a three-way fight.</i>

789
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,776
<i>Chung You-jin, Park Hae-lin,</i>
<i>and Lee Si-an,</i>

790
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,361
<i>please come up and get ready.</i>

791
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,071
Just push through.

792
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,032
It must be exhausting, huh?
I don't think I can watch this.

793
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,995
Wow, my arms have gone limp.

794
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,501
- Is it raining?
- Dong-ho, have fun in Paradise.

795
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,671
I'll be right here,
you go have fun.

796
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,675
Hae-lin is good.

797
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,720
You've gotta have long legs
and arms to use your strength.

798
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,723
This might be tough for Si-an,
she just finished her match.

799
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,058
Right, she must be tired.

800
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:57,061
So I told them to gang up
and eliminate one person first.

801
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,522
The two of them both want Dong-ho.

802
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,523
Yeah.

803
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,568
<i>You may begin</i>
<i>once you hear the signal.</i>

804
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,486
<i>Ready.</i>

805
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,628
- What the…
- Whoa.

806
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:26,006
They're going up against each other.
They both want Dong-ho.

807
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,842
- It's the Dong-ho War.
- Dong-ho…

808
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,009
What the…

809
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,054
I just needed to push You-jin off.

810
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,601
Hae-lin came at me right away, like,
"Oh, this one's for Dong-ho."

811
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,107
Come on, Hae-lin.

812
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,152
Just let me!

813
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,321
"Just let me."

814
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,573
"I'm scared."

815
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,283
Just let me!

816
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,498
Hae-lin is really good.

817
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,001
- She's crazy.
- She might be the dark horse.

818
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,299
Oh, my goodness! No!

819
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,343
Oh, my goodness. No!

820
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,679
Come on, hold out!

821
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,722
- Wait.
- Hold on.

822
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,932
- They joined forces!
- She's going down.

823
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,769
Oh, my goodness. No!

824
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,939
No, come on, hold out!

825
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,774
- My goodness.
- Her body's twisted.

826
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,195
Come on, hold out! Hold on a bit longer.

827
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,906
- Whoa. Oh.
- <i>Chung You-jin is out.</i>

828
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,450
Ah.

829
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,993
I was punched in the stomach.

830
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,287
I wanted to hold out,
but I couldn't breathe.

831
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,875
Then Si-an came
and she just pushed me right off.

832
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:44,835
Ah.

833
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,004
Hae-lin is really strong.

834
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,556
- She flipped her.
- Whoa. Practically over now.

835
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,686
She's scary. Oh, my goodness!

836
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,447
My goodness. Look.

837
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,576
Gosh. I have to give it to her.

838
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,245
She just shoved her at the end.

839
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,830
- Oh, my.
- She's scary.

840
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,333
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, my goodness. Look.

841
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,252
Oh, my goodness. Look.

842
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:30,130
<i>Park Hae-lin is out.</i>
<i>The final winner of the game is Lee Si-an.</i>

843
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,507
Crazy…

844
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,510
- I'm a little scared of her now.
- She's a warrior.

845
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,844
Very strategic.

846
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:36,804
So adorable.

847
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:41,100
<i>Announcing the final rankings</i>
<i>of the women's game</i>

00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,563

854
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,576
<i>they'd like to go to Paradise with.</i>

855
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,213
Si-an's impressive.

856
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,757
Out of all the women's games
we've seen until now,

857
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,384
this was the fiercest yet.

858
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,511
She did two three-way fights in a row.

859
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,179
- Exactly.
- This was fun.

860
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,140
I had so much fun watching.

861
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,976
It was almost like watching men
in a combat zone.

862
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,352
- Yeah.
- It was intense.

863
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,855
I guess Si-an is just Paradise material.

864
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,317
- It's just her fate to live in Paradise.
- Yeah, it's her fate.

865
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,154
Is she the only contestant who's managed
to go to Paradise every time?

866
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,033
Gets chosen a lot, good at games,
and strong. It can't be helped.

867
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,868
- She's a triple threat.
- Yeah.

868
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,288
What I kept on wondering
was why Si-an was trying so hard.

869
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,374
Do you think
she just wanted to get the chance

870
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,543
to be the one to choose the guy this time?

871
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,546
- Maybe.
- It's competitiveness.

872
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,756
Her competitiveness?

873
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,134
No, I believe Si-an had someone
she wants to go to Paradise with.

874
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,510
Hmm.

875
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,512
There aren't that many days left now,

876
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,182
so she has to confirm her feelings
for who she wants.

877
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,684
- Mm.
- In my humble opinion…

878
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,102
You think Jeong-su?

879
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,147
I think that Si-an will end up
with Jeong-su in the end.

880
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,941
We need to know
who she was fighting for in the game…

881
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,194
It should be revealed to us shortly.

882
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:18,489
Aside from Si-an,
we had the amazing Dong-ho War,

883
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:21,033
where two ladies
were competing over Dong-ho.

884
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,534
Yeah, because last night,

885
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:26,121
Hae-lin kept saying that she'd go
to Paradise with Dong-ho this time.

886
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,873
- No matter what happens.
- She did.

887
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,667
Hae-lin seemed the most desperate.

888
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,962
The look in her eyes and her demeanor
showed she was determined to take Dong-ho.

889
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,172
- That's true.
- Yeah.

890
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,092
<i>Min-seol seemed determined.</i>

891
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,219
- For real.
- "I refuse to be pushed off!"

892
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:41,679
Yeah.

893
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,056
Si-an's first match
was like the final match.

894
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,140
Yeah, basically.

895
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,393
- Watching it got me all tense.
- Right?

896
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,604
I could barely watch it. It was scary.

897
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,065
But Hae-lin,
I didn't expect her to be that good.

898
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:57,111
She did mention she was confident
when it came to winning games.

899
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,947
- You-jin placed third, right?
- Mm, third place.

900
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,782
If Hae-lin doesn't choose Dong-ho,

901
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,326
there's a very high chance
that You-jin will.

902
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,747
If she had a good time with Jeong-su,
it could be him.

903
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,165
- Did you have fun?
- What?

904
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,708
- Was it fun?
- She's hilarious.

905
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,544
She's super funny. She is charming.

906
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,586
I feel the same.

907
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,297
- I'm curious how she feels.
- Her feelings?

908
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,383
We had a double date at a pub yesterday.

909
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,469
And You-jin and Jeong-su
seemed to be having so much fun.

910
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,388
They were in high spirits.

911
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,307
- Yeah. You were in the best mood.
- But not in that way.

912
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,892
- No?
- She's just a friend.

913
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,645
You guys could just be
on the same wavelength, though.

914
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,192
What matters is who Si-an will choose.

915
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,111
I'm the most curious about that.

916
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:42,781
If Si-an chooses to take Jeong-su,
You-jin won't be able to choose him.

917
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,827
Si-an and Jeong-su?
I didn't see you together much,

918
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,413
so I wouldn't know if
you had anything going on.

919
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,707
She might choose him
because of that, though.

920
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,916
Hmm.

921
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,877
I think she'll choose Theo.

922
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:59,423
That could be seen as a confirmation
of her feelings towards him, so--

923
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,300
It's about time we confirmed things.

924
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:04,595
Right. I'm just saying
she might be confused at the moment.

925
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,223
If I was her,
I'd pick whoever I was more drawn to.

926
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,394
If it's Jun-seo, then Jun-seo.

927
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,314
If it's Theo, then Theo.
If it's Jeong-su, then Jeong-su.

928
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:19,276
- That should be her deciding factor.
- That seems to be her way of doing things.

929
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,196
It's pointless to make things confusing
at this stage.

930
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,617
It's unnecessary to think about someone
you don't have a connection with.

931
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,620
I'm sure Si-an's finding it the toughest.

932
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,371
Si-an's head must be exploding.

933
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,668
Seriously, we're not meant for games.

934
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,672
How did I look back there?
Did I look desperate?

935
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,132
You looked really pretty.

936
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,175
- Yeah.
- Really?

937
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,762
Near the end, I shouldn't have
held her leg like he said.

938
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,432
Why'd he tell me to grab her?
He doesn't know anything!

939
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,808
Min-seol, grab her leg.

940
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,644
Hold it.

941
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:54,770
Lower.

942
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,774
Why did he tell me to grab her leg?
He doesn't know anything!

943
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,860
I should've just pushed her,
but he told me to grab her leg.

944
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,988
That's too funny. Gosh.
It's a shame, though. Don't you think?

945
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,282
- It's disappointing.
- I know. It really is.

946
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,077
Still, I did my best.
And that's all that matters.

947
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,913
- That's right!
- I gave my all, it just didn't work out.

948
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,206
It's not like I gave up.

949
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:17,918
It just wasn't successful,
but there's nothing I can do about that.

950
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,463
It's just my luck to be up against people
I have no chance of beating.

951
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,341
Right, you tried your best.
That's what matters.

952
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:25,425
Exactly.

953
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,928
The result that follows?
What's done is done.

954
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,221
That's true.

955
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:32,349
It's better than winning
because someone went easy on you.

956
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:35,894
Losing after trying your best is better
than winning out of sympathy.

957
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,440
- The three who didn't make it.
- Right. They never made it.

958
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,028
I can't wait to find out
who Si-an chooses.

959
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,739
- I know. I think she'll choose Theo.
- I think so too.

960
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,784
She already went with Jun-seo twice.

961
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,372
I just really hope that Jun-seo
doesn't go to Paradise today.

962
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,669
Ooh. Hi.
You're all dressed up looking great.

963
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,505
Geez.

964
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,090
Want to talk in my room? Or…

965
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,258
Over there.

966
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,010
- Where?
- Let's go there.

967
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,596
Or over there. It's pretty.

968
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,513
Okay.

969
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,641
Si-an, there's only two days left.

970
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,351
- I know.
- Time flies, doesn't it?

971
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,769
- Yeah.
- Goodness.

972
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,820
Do you have a lot on your mind?
Or is it clearer now?

973
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,365
I wanted to ask, is it uncomfortable
when I'm being like this?

974
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,283
No.

975
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:35,746
I've even been telling the others,
"Theo never puts pressure on me."

976
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,415
Well, what I actually want
to ask is if by chance,

977
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:42,294
since you're coming back from Paradise,
as we finish this experience,

978
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,547
if your heart's leaning
more towards Jun-seo,

979
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,342
then me saying, "Go, Si-an"
could be uncomfortable.

980
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,427
You might worry about his feelings too.

981
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,849
So I just wanted to ask you
how yesterday went.

982
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:56,892
The truth is…

983
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:57,976
Mm?

984
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,898
After going to Paradise
with Jun-seo twice,

985
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,775
my feelings for him have grown.

986
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,363
But that doesn't mean
I'm all set on Jun-seo.

987
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,405
Okay.

988
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:12,741
Actually…

989
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,914
It's a bit tough for me to say
these things to you, but…

990
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:25,128
Rather than hearing it from someone else,
it's better you hear it from me.

991
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,046
Yeah.

992
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:35,013
I think I'm making you uncomfortable
pulling you aside.

993
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,724
Do you want me to keep going?
Do you have me in mind?

994
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,519
You have to tell me,
because I need things to be clear.

995
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,780
If I rank last,
out of the three you have in mind,

996
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:56,326
then I don't wanna pressure you,
unless I'm the runner-up.

997
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,499
Because we only have two days left.

998
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:08,296
So you have to make up your mind.
Do as you will.

999
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,590
As will I,
which is why I'm telling you this.

1000
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,175
I, uh…

1001
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,396
- For me…
- Go on.

1002
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,939
It's Jun-seo…

1003
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:26,982
Yeah.

1004
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,361
Or…

1005
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,071
- Jeong-su.
- Mm.

1006
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,156
Okay. I'm third.

1007
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,032
- I'll decide between them.
- Okay.

1008
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,576
- Thanks.
- Theo.

1009
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,785
I needed to hear that.

1010
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,835
Did all the flirting
make you feel uncomfortable?

1011
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,670
No, I'm truly grateful.

1012
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:49,588
Hm.

1013
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,549
You're just so…

1014
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,467
Yeah?

1015
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:58,472
Yeah…

1016
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,562
Gosh, I'm too…

1017
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,105
Oh, boy. This is tough.

1018
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,025
To be honest, I only went for one person.

1019
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,611
But I went ahead with it
knowing I could get hurt.

1020
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:18,074
No, honestly, you were always
very expressive with me,

1021
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,286
so I was very drawn to you too
from the beginning.

1022
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:26,374
But since I have been going
to Paradise consistently,

1023
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,835
I had to be physically
apart from you, you know?

1024
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,086
I get that.

1025
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,923
It was an "out of sight,
out of mind" kind of thing.

1026
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:36,426
- I agree.
- That honestly was the biggest thing.

1027
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,637
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1028
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,806
You don't have to cry over me right now.

1029
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,517
You seriously don't have
to feel sorry for me either.

1030
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,187
I honestly have no regrets right now.

1031
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,732
I get expressive like this
outside of here too when I like someone,

1032
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,568
but I don't fall for them
this quickly and deeply.

1033
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,612
I don't fall in love easily either.

1034
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,283
But I thought a lot
about why I was being like this with you.

1035
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,201
Yeah.

1036
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,412
I was treating you the same way
I did when I first fell in love.

1037
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,832
That's probably
why I fell for you this quickly.

1038
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,377
So I truly have no regrets.

1039
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,421
Since I did everything I could,
with the flowers and all…

1040
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,548
A flower ring.

1041
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,383
Ta-da.

1042
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,635
Isn't it pretty?

1043
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,136
I've missed you.

1044
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,183
- Gosh, I'm leaving.
- Go. Take these.

1045
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:29,604
I'd chop up some firewood
and cook you a warm meal.

1046
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,442
I'm grateful to you too.

1047
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:37,112
I value the time
and feelings I had with you as well.

1048
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,448
My goodness.

1049
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,081
Should've brought tissues.

1050
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,710
Oh, gosh.

1051
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,803
I have no regrets. I'm just grateful.

1052
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,140
What's wrong with me?

1053
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,768
When you think of me,

1054
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:13,523
I want you to remember
that everything I gave you or did for you

1055
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,734
was with the emotions
of a pure first love.

1056
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,819
Hm. I know that, Theo.

1057
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,363
That's what makes me feel worse.
Just a moment.

1058
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,117
I was honestly so happy, and, uh…

1059
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,870
Oh, dear.

1060
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,083
- I'm sorry, Theo, truly.
- No, it's okay. It's fine.

1061
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,462
Hearing the truth,
even though she was in tears,

1062
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,881
made me feel relieved and pleased.

1063
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,592
No, not pleased.
I'd say it was a feeling of sadness.

1064
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,178
I think that's exactly why
I fell for Si-an.

1065
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:46,806
She's honest with her feelings.
Clear about what she likes and dislikes.

1066
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,477
Oh, please. What's wrong with you?

1067
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,811
Are we going this way?

1068
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,855
I don't even know. Seriously.

1069
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,654
Ah.

1070
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,410
You're handsome.

1071
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,871
- Yeah? You're pretty.
- Mm.

1072
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,586
Well, then.

1073
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:18,672
I feel relieved.

1074
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,594
- Gosh, while I was in Inferno…
- Mm?

1075
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,600
…I just wish we could've spent
more time together.

1076
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:39,651
It's…

1077
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:46,866
I told him I was sorry and expressed
that our feelings weren't mutual.

1078
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:51,287
It was much harder for me
because it was Theo, you know?

1079
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,667
He never pressured me in any sort of way.

1080
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,461
But instead,

1081
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:02,507
he just always continued to express
his honest feelings to me no matter what.

1082
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,803
That's what made it much harder
to turn him down.

1083
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,054
I was so sad.

1084
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,691
She knows what a great person he is.

1085
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:22,652
Turning him down must've been
a mixed bag of emotions,

1086
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,196
knowing that she had to do
what was right for her.

1087
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,616
For a man to admit
so proudly that he loved you,

1088
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,161
the same way that he loved his first love…

1089
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,454
- It's beautiful.
- It is.

1090
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,789
I was almost brought to tears from that.

1091
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:38,209
Listening to him say
that he loved her like his first love.

1092
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,294
Gosh, it's so…

1093
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,673
If you love someone like that,
you don't have any regrets.

1094
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,259
You have no regrets at all.
If you give your all,

1095
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:49,220
even if you break up
and have to get over the other person,

1096
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,764
you'll have no regrets.

1097
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,432
Theo is an admirable person.

1098
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,934
- I bet he's really at peace.
- I bet he is.

1099
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,269
Si-an won't forget him.

1100
00:55:56,352 --> 00:56:00,148
- It's Si-an who'll be thinking of him.
- Lifelong memories she'll hold on to.

1101
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,485
Theo makes you think
so deeply and seriously.

1102
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,572
How are you doing? You holding up okay?

1103
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,574
- Do I seem fine?
- No. You really don't.

1104
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,034
You don't seem okay.

1105
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,577
I'm so depressed right now.

1106
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:16,915
So just go talk to Jun-seo.
He went into the guy's room just now.

1107
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,710
Just ask him
and end things if you have to.

1108
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,254
I think that's better
if you're feeling unsure.

1109
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,215
How about I talk to him after dinner?

1110
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:29,177
He might not even be here.
Yeah, I think it's better you do it now.

1111
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,347
- Cause he has a lot on his mind too.
- Yeah.

1112
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,264
You think?

1113
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,309
Okay. I'll go and ask him, then.

1114
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,234
Wanna chat with me?

1115
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,194
- Me?
- Yeah.

1116
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,196
You must have a lot on your mind.

1117
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,864
No, I actually don't, really.

1118
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,699
You don't?

1119
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,494
But Min-seol does.

1120
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,289
<i>- I've heard it's nice here.</i>
<i>- It's not too shabby.</i>

1121
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,125
<i>It's my favorite place in Inferno.</i>

1122
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,417
<i>- Oh, really?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1123
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,799
You must feel so bad.

1124
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,759
- Yeah, I do feel bad.
- Mm.

1125
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,595
It would've been nice
if you got to go to Paradise more.

1126
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,141
Yeah. I was determined
to win the game today.

1127
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,100
I know.

1128
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,102
But I got eliminated miserably.

1129
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,979
Yeah. So, why did you fall off?

1130
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,773
- Beats me.
- You should've held on longer.

1131
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,110
- I could've given you more tips.
- I really did the best I could.

1132
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,239
- You're satisfied, aren't you?
- Why would I be?

1133
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,575
- You went to Paradise a lot.
- That's not true.

1134
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,034
You don't have to go today.

1135
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,953
Stop going.

1136
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,874
You've gone enough.

1137
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,835
- I'm okay with not going today.
- Yeah?

1138
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,463
But my heart might ache if I don't go.

1139
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,631
- Your heart?
- Yeah.

1140
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,633
- How so?
- It might get hurt if I don't.

1141
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,098
It wouldn't be because
I didn't get to go. Just…

1142
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,016
Yeah.

1143
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,768
You know what I mean.

1144
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:01,686
What?

1145
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,229
- What?
- What are you mumbling?

1146
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,564
Ah, don't worry about it.

1147
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,066
"What are you mumbling?"

1148
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,860
"What are you mumbling?"

1149
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,406
You have a lot on your mind.

1150
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,616
- Me?
- Yeah.

1151
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,703
I'm just really curious
to know exactly what you're thinking.

1152
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,873
- That's why I asked you to talk about it.
- About what?

1153
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,043
- I mean, you went to Paradise yesterday.
- Mm.

1154
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:29,172
But I'm curious to know why you wanted
to chat with me beforehand.

1155
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,089
Oh.

1156
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,969
I talked about this with Si-an too.

1157
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,638
- Yeah?
- I told her…

1158
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,184
that you felt like
a younger sister at first.

1159
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,645
- Hm?
- But that you were on my mind a bit.

1160
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,313
I see.

1161
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:49,192
That I wasn't sure
what this feeling actually meant yet.

1162
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,654
I told her when we had dinner,
even though I didn't have to.

1163
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:53,738
Yesterday?

1164
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:57,116
Okay, but I don't wanna know
what you did yesterday.

1165
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,953
I wanna know why you came
to talk to me before you left.

1166
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,831
I just told you
that's why I told Si-an about it.

1167
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,626
- You can't tell me?
- You've been on my mind.

1168
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,087
- Ah.
- That's why I had that talk with you.

1169
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,756
I chose Si-an
because I was leaning more towards her.

1170
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:15,760
So, basically, talking to Si-an
had its own difficulties.

1171
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,097
But, honestly, in the end,

1172
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,975
I was able to confirm my feelings
for Si-an yesterday.

1173
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,688
I've sorted out all of my thoughts.

1174
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:33,403
But right now, I'm even more concerned
that my absolute dedication towards Si-An

1175
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,655
might still not be enough for her.

1176
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,864
And that's where I…

1177
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:41,661
You could say that it was unnecessary
for me to tell her how torn I was,

1178
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,538
but I was just being honest.

1179
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:44,998
I guess it's up to her now.

1180
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,001
Ah.

1181
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,295
He's definitely made himself
very clear now.

1182
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,009
That's honestly part
of why I was wondering

1183
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,803
whether you only saw me
as a younger sister or not.

1184
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,555
I thought that's what it was.

1185
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:03,641
But I got a little torn and confused
in the middle somewhere.

1186
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:07,020
- After you came back from Paradise?
- Yep, after I came back. Yeah.

1187
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,439
You were torn and confused?

1188
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,316
Yeah, I was just a little confused.

1189
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,484
- What was the reason?
- Um…

1190
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:17,071
You were the second person
I went to Paradise with.

1191
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:17,989
Okay.

1192
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:20,366
So I had someone to compare
you with, you know?

1193
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,660
- You-jin.
- Yeah, you know what I mean?

1194
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,078
So, then,

1195
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,081
I wasn't trying to compare,

1196
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:30,251
but how situation A
and situation B were panning out,

1197
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,921
I naturally felt that I was enjoying more
when I went the second time.

1198
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,089
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1199
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,884
- That's just putting it simply, you know?
- Right, yeah.

1200
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,386
The food was more delicious.

1201
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,513
And the conversation was super fun.

1202
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:46,309
That's what made me think
that this must be the person for me.

1203
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:48,227
So I got confused.

1204
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,145
Hm.

1205
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,151
I get that.

1206
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,320
That was my situation.

1207
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,116
I had no idea
that you were so torn about it.

1208
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,202
You know that I hardly show my feelings.

1209
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,454
Right. That's why
I didn't show mine either.

1210
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:12,585
For me, you were constantly on my mind,
throughout this whole experience.

1211
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,257
- And I only went to Paradise with you.
- I know.

1212
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:22,178
Honestly, I had so much fun with you.

1213
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,639
I actually don't know much
about the others.

1214
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,308
That's been my situation.

1215
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:30,395
At this stage, I don't think
I could get to know anyone else.

1216
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,315
So, yeah.
Honestly, I intend to keep choosing you.

1217
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,029
I'm just saying.

1218
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,580
I'm not trying to pressure you.

1219
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:52,709
- I don't feel pressured.
- Oh, you don't?

1220
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:53,751
Well, it's…

1221
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,002
Some pressure, then?

1222
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,338
It's uncomfortable, but…

1223
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,297
With me?

1224
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,215
No.

1225
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,594
I've come this far
trying to stay true to my feelings.

1226
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,972
- Yeah.
- So I know how you feel.

1227
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,265
Okay, but honestly,

1228
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:10,059
I really don't want you
to feel pressured or anything.

1229
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,687
I do want you to keep thinking about me.

1230
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,735
But I never want you to feel uncomfortable
when you're with me.

1231
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,319
- No, I won't.
- Good.

1232
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,739
- I won't either.
- Mm.

1233
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,032
I wouldn't call it uncomfortable.

1234
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,618
I just feel sorry, you know?

1235
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:28,536
Hm.

1236
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,497
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about it.

1237
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,336
I'm grateful that you're telling me this.

1238
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:45,803
Well, if you don't go to Paradise,
let's just grab something to eat.

1239
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,263
"Grab something to eat."

1240
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,390
- We can chat too.
- Okay.

1241
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,771
My memories with Jun-seo
might linger for quite some time,

1242
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,063
even after this ends.

1243
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:58,107
I'm grateful to him, though.

1244
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,777
That's why
it's a love-hate kind of relationship.

1245
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,822
Literally, love-hate!
Seriously, love-hate!

1246
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,032
Gosh, I'm annoyed.

1247
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,993
But it can't be helped.
I guess I'll have to cope with it.

1248
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,122
She's just so lovable.

1249
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,833
She's baby Min-seol.

1250
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:16,751
A baby.

1251
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:21,881
Now that they only have a few days left,
things are sorting out.

1252
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,383
- Jun-seo made it clear to Min-seol.
- Yeah.

1253
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,386
- Min-seol won't be confused.
- I don't think she will be.

1254
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,139
They spoke to each other
in the best way possible.

1255
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:31,724
It's not just her.

1256
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,268
Jun-seo has no reason
to feel confused either,

1257
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,854
- I think he'll only go forward from here.
- I agree.

1258
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,943
Being chosen is more difficult
than doing the choosing myself.

1259
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:42,902
I agree.

1260
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,238
- I definitely feel that way.
Yeah.

1261
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:50,159
Yesterday, I was a little…
How should I put it?

1262
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:55,498
I barely expressed my affection,
or gave Si-an anything.

1263
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,545
I do regret that a little.

1264
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,091
- You didn't show affection?
I didn't.

1265
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:08,594
Chats and feelings
progress so differently in this place.

1266
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:14,183
Having to make a a confident decision
about becoming a couple or not

1267
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,519
had me wondering if it was even possible,

1268
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,897
based on the level that we've gotten
to know each other so far.

1269
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,609
It isn't easy.

1270
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:27,780
But from now on,
I'm going all in on Si-an, for sure.

1271
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,619
- For sure?
Yeah.

1272
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,746
- You've made up your mind?
Yep.

1273
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:48,843
So, who are you going to choose?

1274
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,720


1275
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:51,637
Me?

1276
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,558
Oh, gosh.

1277
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,768
- Go on.
Honestly, I must say I'm…

1278
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:58,728
What?

1279
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:01,647
…I'm realizing
that I'm more serious about all of this

1280
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,108
- than I ever thought I would be.
I know, right?

1281
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:05,693
You're even about to cry now.

1282
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,278


1283
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:11,532
I mean, having romantic feelings
for more than one guy in itself

1284
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,701
- was honestly a little…
Let's relax.

1285
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:15,202
All right, got it.

1286
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,873
It was tough. I mean, this would never
happen to me on the outside, ever.

1287
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,627
I am aware that it's only possible
because we're here.

1288
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:26,172
But being drawn to multiple people
at once has been crazy,

1289
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:29,175
- It's kinda felt like I've had…
Weight on your shoulders?

1290
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:30,968
No, it's not that. I've felt like…

1291
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:33,054
like I was trashy.

1292
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:34,430
Oh. Don't think like that.

1293
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:37,308
I know, but then…
Well, fine. I know I'm not.

1294
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,061
But my feelings
were changing every single day.

1295
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,772
They would change
when the guys did anything for me.

1296
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,024
I was constantly
like switch-switch-switch.

1297
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,610
- I was changing my mind all the time.
I get that.

1298
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:48,611
Yeah.

1299
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:50,571
It was driving me insane.

1300
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,908


1301
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:56,202
All this in the past few days…

1302
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,288
I guess I'm not… Well, I…

1303
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:03,960
When I date someone,

1304
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:07,755
I like to spend most of my time with them
so we can get close.

1305
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:10,174
I usually have
sweet emotional interactions

1306
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:12,343
that are lovey-dovey and cringe at times.

1307
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,262
But as for Jun-seo,

1308
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:19,350
he isn't exactly the sweet
or gentle type that I usually go for.

1309
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,352
He's definitely more of a macho guy.

1310
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:25,314
So, it got me wondering
if we'll have issues

1311
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,233
when we actually become a couple.

1312
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,151
I'm worried I'll get upset with him.

1313
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,363
It's impossible to change your tendencies.

1314
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:34,615
I'm definitely confused.

1315
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:35,533
So…

1316
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,869
I don't know.

1317
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,998
My head's gonna explode.

1318
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,380
Good that she's aware
of their differences.

1319
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,924
She knows
that people's tendencies hardly change.

1320
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,593
But Jun-seo might act cuter
when he dates someone.

1321
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:58,305
Some guys who seem indifferent
but show their affection in their actions

1322
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,515
are charming to women.

1323
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,683
They are indeed.

1324
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:03,102
But the problem
is the way he speaks to her,

1325
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,520
"Hey. Hey, you do it?"

1326
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,814
It could end up being
some pet peeve of hers.

1327
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:11,068
Si-an said she'd choose between the two,
either Jun-seo or Jeong-su.

1328
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,403
Yeah. That's right.

1329
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,530
I wonder if she'll give Jeong-su a shot.

1330
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:15,781
I think she will.

1331
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,242
- I also think she'll choose Jeong-su.
- And you?

1332
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:21,620
You think otherwise?
I feel like she'll choose Jun-seo.

1333
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,538
Oh.

1334
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:25,416
Because if she had a good time
with Jun-seo yesterday,

1335
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:27,626
like the first time they went to Paradise,

1336
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,421
she would've chosen
Jeong-su today for sure.

1337
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,173
But it didn't go so well.

1338
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:35,676
Going to Paradise with Jun-seo once more
to see if she has feelings

1339
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,219
would be more time-efficient.

1340
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,681
Rather than testing
her feelings for Jeong-su,

1341
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:43,726
weighing the two against each other
and be confused again,

1342
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:46,020
she should choose him and then cut him off

1343
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:48,105
if she decides he's not the one.

1344
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:50,524
If I were her, I'd do that. Yeah. Jun-seo.

1345
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:51,442
Yeah.

1346
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:53,903
- You're thinking logically.
- But…

1347
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:57,281
Si-an isn't a logical person, though.
She won't think like that.

1348
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,449
Yeah.

1349
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:01,619
She went to Paradise
for the very first time with Jeong-su,

1350
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:03,287
it seems to mean a lot to her.

1351
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:06,791
- I feel like she'll go with Jeong-su.
- She could go with him.

1352
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,334
Yeah, to be sure.

1353
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,211
So instead of regretting it later,

1354
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:14,215
she might choose to go with him
one more time before she makes a decision.

1355
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,758
But if she chooses Jeong-su,

1356
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:19,678
that might indicate that
she's all in with him, don't you think?

1357
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:25,142
I doubt she's reckless enough
to try getting to know someone new,

1358
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,561
especially this late in the game.

1359
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:31,232
I think so too,
'cause she made herself clear to Theo.

1360
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,275
What do you think, Hanhae?

1361
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,277
I also think she'll choose Jeong-su.

1362
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,780
Let's make teams.
Losing team pays for dinner.

1363
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,949
Yeah, I'm good with that.

1364
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,742
But why are you asking for that?

1365
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,119
It's not a final matching.

1366
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,454
I'm saying that right now
I'm absolutely sure.

1367
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,206
- You're that sure?
- Fine. I'm in.

1368
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,458
- We'll split the bill.
- Sounds good.

1369
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,878
I honestly just can't wait
to see who Si-an will choose.

1370
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:56,799
I feel like she'll make
a shocking choice. You think?

1371
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,259
It'll defy expectations?

1372
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:00,594
INFERNO

1373
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:03,931
<i>We will now begin</i>
<i>the Paradise-bound couple matching.</i>

1374
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:05,766
PARADISE-BOUND COUPLE MATCHING

1375
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,374
The guys. They must all be so nervous.

1376
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:32,418
We've gone through this before.

1377
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,421
- Their hearts might explode.
- "Will it be me or won't it?"

1378
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:47,183
<i>Starting with Lee Si-an,</i>
<i>who placed first,</i>

1379
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:51,854
<i>please choose the person</i>
<i>you'd like to go to Paradise with.</i>

1380
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:56,984
Probably Jun-seo. I think it will be.

1381
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:09,413
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

1382
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,292
After my second date with Jun-seo,

1383
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:17,338
I realized that Jun-seo and Jeong-su
have totally different personalities.

1384
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,675
Jun-seo is definitely more
on the macho side,

1385
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:25,054
while Jeong-su is more
on the sweet and gentle side.

1386
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,098
My biggest concern right now,

1387
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,476
is whether I'll prefer
being in a relationship

1388
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,436
with someone who's sweet,

1389
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:37,274
or if I should choose someone
who may not be as sweet towards me,

1390
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,276
but who I'm more drawn to.

1391
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,154
<i>That's my biggest issue.</i>

1392
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,742
Hmm.

1393
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,703
- Gosh, it's truly 50-50 for her right now.
- It is.

1394
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:53,207
Judging by her words,
she's definitely leaning towards Jun-seo.

1395
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,375
I know, right?

1396
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,126
She likes Jun-seo more.

1397
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:09,598
Wait, hold on.

1398
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,601
Why are we this curious
about who this girl named Lee Si-an

1399
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,645
wants to have a date with?

1400
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:16,939
I mean, I'm already busy with my own life,

1401
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:20,442
but I'm still dying to know
who she wants to have a date with.

1402
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,612
I'm so curious that my lips
are feeling parched right now.

1403
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,159
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

1404
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:49,013
<i>Lee Si-an has chosen…</i>

1405
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,744
Let's see.

1406
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:14,955
<i>I can really do anything.</i>
<i>I'm just gonna push ahead.</i>

1407
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,874
<i>There are so many issues tonight.</i>

1408
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:19,043
Do you have anything to ask me?

1409
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,295
I don't get curious
about things like that.

1410
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:23,964
His feelings for me
just don't seem genuine.

1411
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:26,425
<i>I only had eyes for Si-an,</i>

1412
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:28,552
<i>right from the very start.</i>

1413
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:34,308
You know, you've allowed me to engage
in this experience wholeheartedly.

1414
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,936
<i>We will now begin</i>
<i>the final matching.</i>

1415
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,316
I'd like to go to Paradise with…
