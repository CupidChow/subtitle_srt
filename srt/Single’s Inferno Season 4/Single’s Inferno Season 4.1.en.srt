that I can be very quirky sometimes.

174
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,730
Like, I will dance in the streets
when I get too excited about something.

175
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:29,110
So people around me have often said
that I'm a little unpredictable.

176
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,654
When I know I'm into someone,

177
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,198
I tend to stare at them
without even meaning to.

178
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,118
They all fall for me when I do that.

179
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,791
Still no male contestants.

180
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,209
Oh, you're right.

181
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,677
[ambient music playing]

182
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,143
My name is Kim A-rin.

183
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,854
I decided to join Single's Inferno,

184
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,315
because I was hoping
to meet like-minded people

185
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,068
who are attractive on the inside
and also on the outside.

186
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,405
I think I'm charming
because I'm full of surprises.

187
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:18,075
I often hear that I can come across
to people as cold and even snobbish.

188
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,454
But once you get to know me,
I'm really easygoing.

189
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,458
Since I was little,
I've often been told that I was pretty.

190
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,002
And some men would occasionally tell me

191
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,880
that I'm the prettiest woman
they've ever seen in their lives.

192
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:37,345
Gosh, this younger generation
is really all about being candid, huh?

193
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,263
That's what this show's about.

194
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,806
-Hello.
-[all] Hello.

195
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,808
-Hello.
-Hello.

196
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,855
[You-jin] The seat in the corner's
all that's left.

197
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,944
Hello.

198
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,536
[suspenseful music playing]

199
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,996
I'm feeling bad vibes now.

200
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,831
-Ah!
-[Kyuhyun] Just look at them.

201
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,126
-These contestants are the prettiest yet.
-[Kyuhyun] That's true.

202
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,753
Personally,

203
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,632
I think all of these women are flawless
when it comes to their appearances.

204
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,801
How did production find people like them?

205
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,012
I feel like 90 percent
of the male contestants

206
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,598
are going to fall for Si-an
at first sight.

207
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,643
I agree.
Si-an is certainly very eye-catching.

208
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,271
But if you take a closer look,
there's a cute wholesomeness underneath.

209
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,315
I think she's very charming.

210
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,402
But she did say she likes
relationships on the wilder side.

211
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,529
-[Jin-kyung] That's true.
-That scares me.

212
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,696
[laughs]

213
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,699
I think she'll go back and forth a lot
with her decisions.

214
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,245
The way I see it, Si-an and Min-seol
might actually end up

215
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,038
being the most popular ones.

216
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:51,627
As for Min-seol, she has a pretty smile
that even I found it very memorable.

217
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,380
-She's got a lovable attitude.
-Remember "ruff, ruff"?

218
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,591
Yes, but her cutesy demeanor
makes her very likable.

219
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,137
As for You-jin, she's so bubbly
and has a cheerful personality.

220
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,306
[Hanhae] She looks kind.
That's what people find attractive.

221
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,017
Are we only meeting
the female contestants today?

222
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,061
-What's going on?
-That may be the case.

223
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,896
-It's hard to predict.
-[Hanhae] Tell me about it.

224
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,982
Are they competing to go to Paradise?

225
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,735
[suspenseful music playing]

226
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,574
I think this is it. This is all of us.

227
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,578
It seems like it's just the women today.

228
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,913
What's going on?

229
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,332
[Ji-yeon] I wonder what this means.

230
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,879
[You-jin] I feel like we're just left
here stranded on this island.

231
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,673
-Wait. [gasps]
-[Hye-jin] What?

232
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:38,716
Whoa!

233
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,218
-[You-jin] Someone's coming.
-What?

234
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,643
[Ji-yeon] A guy is coming.

235
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,982
[dramatic music playing]

236
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,692
Whoa!

237
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,444
Look at those veins.

238
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,867
-Her expression's different now.
-They came alive. [chuckles]

239
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,244
But there are no empty seats.

240
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,662
There are no seats for him.

241
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,665
[Ji-yeon] You're right. What's going on?

242
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,210
[laughs]

243
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,087
-[A-rin] Do we say hello?
-[all] Hello.

244

[intercom chiming]

246
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,231
-[chiming continue]
-That scared me.

247
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,942
[Master] Hello, singles.

248
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,697
Ladies, please stand up from your seats.

249

[suspenseful music playing]

250
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,012
Starting now,

251
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,057
we will match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

252
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,058
Right now?

253
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,727
We will match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

254
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,145
Right now?

255
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,439
-Already?
-[Jin-young] Right away?

256
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,607
That's crazy.

257
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,234
[Hanhae] Isn't this too soon?

258
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,153
The guys aren't even here yet.

259
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,407
-We're doing it now?
-[A-rin] No way.

260
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,452
[Min-seol] At that moment,
I swear I got goosebumps.

261
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,371
[Ji-yeon] Oh! Already?

262
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,082
We only saw him for, like, ten seconds.

263
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,793
[Master] First-place male contestant,

264
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,838
you may now choose the woman
you'd like to take to Paradise.

265
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,590
[A-rin] Oh, gosh.

266
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,718
…you may now choose the woman
you'd like to take to Paradise.

267
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,845
-"First place?"
-[A-rin] Oh, gosh.

268
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,555
What? First place?

269
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,350
-I guess they've already competed.
-That's why his muscles are all pumped?

270
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,311
'Cause he just fought.

271
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,938
He placed first in what? What did he win?

272
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,441
-[Si-an] Is he back?
-[Ji-yeon] This is crazy.

-[Hanhae] Men's Inferno?
-[Jin-kyung] Separate infernos.

is looking gloomy already.

[upbeat music continues]

283
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,919
My name is Kim Te-hwan.

284
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,589
I'm full of self-love
and I live with conviction.

285
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,385
I've been aware of my good looks
ever since I was born.

286
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,179
People never stay angry at me

287
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,556
because they ease up
when they see my face.

288
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,808
Come on.

289
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,477
[Hanhae] He's not that hot…

290
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,854
-Oh, please.
-[Kyuhyun] He's not that handsome.

291
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,607
Sometimes when I look in the mirror,

292
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,068
I feel like I could get sucked
into my own eyes.

293
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,531
I've given up on countless career paths

294
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,825
and prioritized romance over work.

295
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:37,246
I doubt someone here takes relationships
more seriously than I do.

296
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,498
So he's been neglecting work?

297

[both laughing]

298
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,378
He's saying he's been neglecting work
to focus on dating.

299
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,630
In other words, he's a genuine person.

00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,602
My name is Kook Dong-ho.

302
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,441
If I had to choose my strongest features,

303
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,651
they would be my height and my big eyes.

304
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,949
People say that I can give off
a cold first impression,

305
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,161
but my personality
is rather sweet and tender.

306
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,496
[staff chuckles]

307
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,206
I'm sweet and expressive.

Oh, okay. After two seconds…

-Oh, he's cute.
-Always someone like him.

314
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,137
-He's pleasant, though.
-Yeah, he is.

315
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,973
Dong-ho's left a strong impression
on us for now.

316
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,394
I'm determined to approach the woman
I like and make her my own.

My name is Jang Theo.

00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,040
If I'm to describe my personality
in one word,

320
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,459
a lot of people say I'm like a bulldozer.

321
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:10,172
I'm daring, straightforward,
and I don't care what others think of me.

322
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,509
I'm not a calculating person
and I never play hard to get.

323
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,887
My looks get pretty polarizing opinions.

324
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:21,016
I'm popular with those who prefer guys
who look like bad boys.

325
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,310
But I'm pretty much neglected by women

326
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,522
who prefer their men to look innocent
or have a pretty face.

-Yo?
-[Hanhae] Yo?

331

A man who introduces himself with "yo"?

332
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,578
It's the worst introduction ever.

333
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,081
Even hip-hop musicians
don't say that anymore.

334
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,333
-Really?
-"Yo."

335
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,961
It's illegal to start
a conversation with "yo."

00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,979
-[Dong-ho] Jang Theo?
-Jang Theo. Right.

344
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,397
[Te-hwan] I'm Kim Te-hwan.

345
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,774
-I'm Kook Dong-ho.
-[Theo] Nice to meet you.

346
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,735
You're quite manly.

347
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,862
[laughs]

348
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,907
I went in giving a macho first impression

349
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,909
'cause I expected other muscular guys.

350
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,579
So I said, "Yo, 'sup?"

351
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,955
But as I said, "Yo",

352
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,208
they were so gentle with their hellos
it caught me off guard.

353
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,960
So I just said, "Oh, hello."

354
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,420
As soon as I saw them.

355
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,090
I guess the next three will be the ladies?

356
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,387
[upbeat music playing]

357
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,228
My name is Kim Jeong-su.

358
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:55,068
I think my best feature is my deep voice
which I'm told makes me seem trustworthy.

359
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,196
It's not something you can earn,

360
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,780
it's something you just have.

361
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,033
So I think it's my strongest feature.

362
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,995
I tend to be loyal and friendly
only to those I like.

363
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,539
I'm docile like a retriever.

364
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,626
My kinds of relationships
are the lovey-dovey ones.

365
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,295
But what if two more guys come?

366
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,298
I expected to see at least one woman.

367
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,133
I'm a little disappointed.

368
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,637
Someone's here.

369
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,307
[Te-hwan] I just saw someone pass by.

370
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,270
[ambient music playing]

371
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,065
What?

372
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,150
-Looks like it's a woman.
-[Kyuhyun] Ah.

373
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,332
[upbeat music playing]

374
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,796
What?

375
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,381
Wait.

376
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,299
This guy's looking pretty manly.

377
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,430
[Hanhae] Wait, what?

378
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,308
-Isn't that Yuk?
-It's Yuk!

379
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,310
-Isn't he famous?
-[Kyuhyun] He is.

380
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,939
I'm Yuk Jun-seo.

381
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,276
I decided to participate

382
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,821
because I wanted to experience
something different from my daily life.

383
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,075
I'm curious to see what kinds of bonds
I can make with new people here.

384
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,121
I constantly work out
and I'm a former UDT soldier,

385
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,248
so I'm confident with my physicality.

386
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,834
People say I look like I'd be popular.

387
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,628
But actually, I'm not popular.

388
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,088
I'm really not at all.

389
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,424
Unlike my stoic outer appearance,

390
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,509
some people have said that…

391
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,262
I'm rather adorable.

392
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,348
I've heard from other people
that I'm cute.

393
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,185
And that my personality
isn't as disciplined as they would expect

394
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,104
since they know that I was a soldier.

395
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,608
Honestly, I think that I'm like
any other ordinary guy my age.

396
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,943
And I'm even…

397
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,194
How should I say this?

398
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,696
I'm actually a bit sloppy.

399
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,199
Those who like that side of me
are ones who are calling me adorable.

400
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,744
Okay. [laughs]

401
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,747
He's a former UDT soldier.
Do you know him, Jin-young?

402
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,791
Not personally.
We were in different operating forces,

403
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,210
But he did serve his time
while I was enlisted.

404
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,839
He already created a buzz
through another reality show.

405
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,840
The Iron Squad.

406
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,592
-[Jin-young] Yeah.
-[Da-hee] Oh.

407
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,636
[intercom chiming]

408
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,890
[Master] Hello, singles.

409
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,269
You are currently isolated here

410
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,146
in Men's Inferno.

411
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:38,857
We were right.

412
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:43,153
[Master] The female contestants
are isolated in Women's Inferno.

413
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,739
How disappointing.

414
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,034
I was starting to get my hopes up.

415
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,535
[both laugh]

416
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,124
[Master] You are not allowed
to reveal your job or age in Inferno.

417
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,876
INFERNO RULES
PROFESSIONS AND AGES CANNOT BE REVEALED

418
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,170
Once you become a couple,

419
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,423
you get to escape
and spend a night in Paradise.

420
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,509
Now…

421
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,222
the men will be competing in a game
for a date in Paradise.

422
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,599
-Jumping right in.
-Already?

423
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,894
Please gather by the swimming pool.

424
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,730
-[intercom chimes]
-Darn it.

425
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,690
[sighs]

426
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,112
I was feeling a little bit disappointed.

427
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,823
Because I expected
the first date in Paradise

428
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,950
to be based on first impressions.

429
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,036
I was confident that I could get
the first date in Paradise.

430
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,833
Te-hwan seems to keep
having unjustified views of himself.

431
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,127
Wait, I'm so curious.

432
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,295
Did any of the men capture your attention?

433
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,672
If you ask my opinion,

434
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:48,426
I'll be keeping an eye on Dong-ho,
Theo, and Jeong-su.

435
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,972
Well, Dong-ho and Theo
seem to have opposite appeals.

436
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,976
Dong-ho seems very docile,
while Theo has a tougher demeanor.

437
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,644
He could even have a temper.

438
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:01,481
And of course, you know,
Jeong-su is my type, so I--

439
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,527
-[Kyuhyun] Which one has the best look?
-I feel like we'd click in so many ways.

440
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,405
[Jin-kyung] And he has a nice voice.
He really does.

441
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,949
I think if Te-hwan manages
to keep his mouth shut…

442
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,492
[all laughing]

443
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,995
If he doesn't speak, he might get chosen.

444
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,913
His looks are captivating enough.

445
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:21,293
[Da-hee] But if he talks just too much,
then he'll probably lose his charm.

446
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,712
Te-hwan does have the best physique.

447
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,754
I agree with you.

448
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,506
Theo seemed pompous at first.

449
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,594
But the way he puffed up his chest and
strutted around showing off his physique?

450
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,305
Might come off as adorable
to some female contestants.

451
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,599
-He seems a little mischievous.
-Uh-huh.

452
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,894
Jun-seo might be good at one-on-one dates.

453
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,564
[Kyuhyun] He's not the type
who puts himself out there.

454
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,525
He's like those characters
from romance comic books.

455
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,528
-He has the long hair.
-Those princes who are always ill.

456
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,155
-Ill?
-[Hanhae] Ill how?

457
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,366
-Those princes who are unwell…
-But when he takes off his shirt…

458
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,869
-[Da-hee] It's a surprise.
-[Jin-kyung] A twist.

466
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,653
[Dong-ho] He has such a long reach.

[Hanhae] Oh, gosh.

468
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,077
[Dong-ho] Wow.
It's about reach versus power.

Dang it.

472
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,047
He's like a dark horse, isn't he?

473
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,008
-A dark horse. I could see that.
-[Hanhae] A dark horse.

474
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,225
Whoa. [laughs]

475
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,726

00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,312
[Hye-jin] He's just standing.

488
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,314
I'm a little scared.

00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,899
[Hye-jin] I am too.

[laughs]

493
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,407
He needs to smile a little.

494
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,160
It's like he's choosing a battle opponent.

00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,622
[Master] First-place male contestant,

496
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,917
please select the woman
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

-This is fun.
-[Da-hee] I wonder who he'll choose.

[Jun-seo] Sorry. Let me see.

[ambient music playing]

502
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,201
Smiling like that will draw his attention.

503
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,036
It'll be captivating, for sure.

Ah, sure.

507
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,713
Wait, she runs her hand
through her hair, she just did that.

508
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,132
-It was a habit of hers.
-[Jin-young] There it is.

509

[chuckles softly]

510
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,226
He's fallen for it.
She's caught his attention.

511
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,269
-Has he?
-Yeah, for sure.

512
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,739
[Jun-seo] The one on the left.

513
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,659
I choose her.

514
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,578
-On the left?
-[Kyuhyun] The left?

[You-jin] Wow, I love this view.

689
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,499
It sure is Paradise.

690
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,334
-[Jun-seo] It is.
-[You-jin] Fancy.

691
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,460
[Jun-seo] Really is.

692
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,922
Wow.

693
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,716
-Here too.
-Gosh.

694
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,384
[Jun-seo] It's so nice.

695
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,928
[You-jin] We can sleep
in a comfortable place.

696
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,763
-Thank goodness.
-[Jun-seo] Finally.

697
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,224
-All that effort was worth it.
-[laughs]

698
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,642
-[You-jin] Thank you.
-Yeah!

699
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,187
-Thank you for choosing me.
-[Jun-seo] Pleasure's all mine.

700
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,274
[light music playing]

701
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,323
[Jun-seo gasps]

702
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,744
[You-jin] Wow. It looks so good!

703
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,871
We're finally eating together.

704
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,917
-Thanks to you. Let's enjoy the food.
-No, it's thanks to you.

705
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,837
-Help yourself.
-Okay.

706
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,048
Is this duck?

707
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,426
-Wait, maybe steak?
-[You-jin] Isn't it just tenderloin?

708
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,845
I rarely come across dishes like this.

709
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,472
[laughs]

710
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,726
-Can't believe I called this duck.
-Oh, gosh.

711
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:18,981
Your personality… It's really different
from my first impression of you.

712
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,025
I was frowning because of the sun…

713
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,985
-[laughs] Right, sure.
-[Jun-seo] Yeah.

714
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,529
Honestly, I felt a little awkward
standing alone.

715
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,281
[You-jin] Yeah, you came alone.

716
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,868
It's a mixture of the heat, the sun,
and feeling a little bit confused.

717
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,119
Mm-hmm.

718
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,371
[Jun-seo] But then…

719
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,956
we kept making eye contact.

720
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,292
-[You-jin] Right, we did.
-So I chose you.

721
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,420
You flashed a smile
every time our eyes met.

722
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,464
That really made an impression on me.

723
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,799
-[You-jin] Really?
-Yeah.

724
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,221
[chuckles]

725
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,603
-I think I chose well.
-[You-jin] Think so?

726
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,980
Thank you. [giggles]

727
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,941
[laughs softly]

728
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,528
So, how old are you?

729
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,695
-[Jun-seo] Me?
-Yeah.

730
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,947
I'm 28.

731
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,991
-[You-jin] I see, hmm, you're 28.
-Yeah.

732
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,286
-What about me? How old do you think?
-You're probably younger.

733
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,538
[both laugh]

734
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,207
-But what would your guess be?
-Twenty-five?

735
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:22,420
[laughs] Well, I'm actually 28 too.

736
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,965
-I was sure I was older.
-[chuckles] Oh!

737
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,551
Yeah, I thought
I'd be younger than you too.

738
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,302
-So it sounds like…
-Yeah.

739
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,263
we're gonna be on a first-name basis.

740
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,765
I even imagined myself saying,

741
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,017
"I can drop the honorifics
with you, right?"

742
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,937
But you're so calm and collected.

743
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,897
-You seem very mature.
-[Jun-seo] True.

744
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:45,401
That's the reason I thought
you must be older than me.

745
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,488
Now we know we're the same age,
wouldn't it be better to talk casually?

746
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,115
Shall we speak casually? Sure.

747
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,117
Good. Thanks.

748
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,619
That'll probably change our whole dynamic.

749
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,665
[romantic music playing]

750
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,419
-What do you do?
-Do for…

751
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,297
-I mean, for work.
-[Jun-seo] What do I do?

752
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,257
-Like, what is your job?
-Gosh.

753
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,509
Well, I draw for a living.

754
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,219
[You-jin] Mm…

755
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,431
[machine whirring]

756
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,645
[Jun-seo] I am an artist.

757
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,566
I have my own studio, and there,

758
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,111
I usually work on my pieces alone.

759
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:32,823
I'm always thinking about how to exhibit
my artwork in unique ways.

760
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,075
There are many types of art.

761
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:40,456
Such as three-dimensional art,
installation art, plastic art.

762
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,250
But I mostly focus
on two-dimensional drawings.

763
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,461
I didn't study the arts.

764
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:48,339
Just been drawing for a long time.
I draw what I want.

765
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,758
[funky music playing]

766
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,637
YUK JUN-SEO
28 YEARS OLD, ARTIST

767
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,139
I can see that. I can picture you drawing.

768
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,558
-I work very hard.
-[You-jin] I'm sure.

769
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,894
-Mr. Yuk Jun-seo, the artist.
-Yeah, I am.

770
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,813
-What you do for a living?
-Take a guess.

771
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,232
[laughs]

772
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,275
Why do you make me guess every time?

773
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,154
I'm curious. I want to hear your guess
based on your first impression.

774
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,406
Because you don't know anything
about me yet.

775
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,993
Well, to be honest,
I think you're an actress.

776
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,703
-An actress?
-[Jun-seo] Yeah.

777
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,914
You should be an actress with those looks.

778
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,583
-That's such a nice compliment.
-That's a compliment.

779
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,753
Actually, I… dance.

780
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,046
-You dance?
-Yeah.

781
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,214
Wow.

782
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:35,302
[You-jin] I graduated from the dance
department at Ewha Womans University.

783
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,097
And I'm currently studying
for a master's degree.

784
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,685
My major at the university
is Korean traditional dance.

785
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:47,565
The course is divided into traditional
and contemporary styles.

786
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,067
And I do both of them.

787
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,737
I have also joined a dance company
and I teach dance as well.

788
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,742
I teach students ranging
from children to adults.

789
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:02,621
I love teaching all kinds of dance
to a wide variety of age groups.

790
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:07,543
CHUNG YOU-JIN
28 YEARS OLD, DANCER

791
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,753
Wow. I never would've imagined.

792
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,797
-It's surprising, really?
-Yeah.

793
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,466
-Well, we're both in the arts…
-[Jun-seo] I know.

794
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,302
-I'm so glad we met.
-Hmm.

795
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,512
I never have anything to say
to business owners.

796
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,014
[both laugh]

797
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,557
I respect them so much.

798
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,393
-But I have nothing in common with them.
-Nothing in common.

799
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,190
You know, when I first saw you,

800
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,443
you seemed like such a quiet person.

801
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,904
-I thought you'd be all, like, "Ah, okay."
-Oh, really?

802
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,450
I expected you to be reserved like,
"Well, yes. Right."

803
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,744
But you're so witty…

804
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,705
and even pretty adorable,
if I'm being honest.

805
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,873
That's not true.

806
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,877
Your personality just took me by surprise.

807
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,962
And you look so pure when you smile.

808
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,131
-Let's say that I am.
-[You-jin] I mean it.

809
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,090
[chuckles]

810
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,676
What're your hobbies?

811
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,136
-[Jun-seo] My hobbies?
-Mm.

812
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,055
Looking at my niece's art.

813
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,390
[Jun-seo] One of the things I enjoy most.

814
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,435
But it's totally a one-sided
kind of affection.

815
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:10,230
-One-sided? She doesn't appreciate it?
-She kinda pushes me away a bit.

816
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,358
Why do women play games like that?

817
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,319
[Seo-jun] How am I supposed to play along?

818
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,821
-What do you think I should do?
-[You-jin laughs]

819
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,866
-I just don't know.
-Oh.

820
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,202
So you never play games with women?

821
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:26,205
-I don't understand that sort of thing.
-[You-jin laughs]

822
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,581
No, not at all?

823
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,875
-You're so funny.
-Where can I get some tips?

824
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,713
-Could I ask what type…
-[laughs]

825
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,758
You're clearly straightforward.
That's the sense I get.

826
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,972
-I meant to ask your type.
-[You-jin] Mine?

827
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,642
I prefer… the straightforward type.

828
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,227
-[Seo-jun] You do?
-Mm.

829
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,105
-Then I'll keep being me.
-[You-jin laughs]

830
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,940
[chuckling]

831
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,986
[chuckles] He's cute.

832
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,326
Jun-seo has a tender side to him
that's very unlike his appearance.

833
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,120
I think it's really charming.

834
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,580
-He's full of surprises.
-[Jin-kyung] He is.

835
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:12,543
Even after asking her a question,
he's too embarrassed to look in the eye.

836
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,962
He's too shy to come off as eloquent.

837
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:19,216
I expected him to be a man of few words,
but he's conversing with her really well.

838
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:23,262
It might be 'cause they already
have great rapport with each other.

839
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,596
They have things in common.

840
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,474
He's good at keeping
the conversation going.

841
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,726
She brings up
the right conversation topics.

842
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,937
-But it feels like…
-[Jin-young] Like what?

843
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,481
He takes the lead.
She keeps the vibes going.

844
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,775
PARADISE
KIM JEONG-SU & LEE SI-AN

845
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,027
-[Jeong-su] Let's go.
-[both laugh]

846
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:44,074
[both gasp excitedly] Wow.

847
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,827
-I'm hungry.
-Let's hurry up and eat.

848
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,747
-It looks so good.
-[Si-an] Delicious.

849
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,042
-Should we dig in?
-[Jeong-su] We should.

850
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:58,297
To start, you want some pasta?

851
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,257
-Mm!
-Or the salad…

852
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,717
Should we have that first?

853
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,552
-Let's start with pasta.
-Good idea.

854
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:08,474
[gentle music playing]

855
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,894
-[Jeong-su] Let me get you more.
-[Si-an] No…

856
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,396
-[Jeong-su] Want more?
-Yes, please.

857
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,856
[both chuckle softly]

858
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,609
Okay.

859
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,403
[Jeong-su] You're keeping me busy.

860
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,531
-Bon appétit.
-Enjoy.

861
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,743
[both giggling]

862
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,953
[Jeong-su] Mm…

863
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,583
Mm… [chuckles softly]

864
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,586
[moans softly]

865
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:41,840
Here you go.

866
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,970
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

867
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,722
-We're tired, huh?
-We are.

868
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,933
So how old are you?

869
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,559
-Me?
-Yeah.

870
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,353
-I'm 33.
-[Si-an] Oh, really?

871
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:55,812
And how old are you?

872
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:57,981
You look younger.

873
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,150
-You look young.
-Not true.

874
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,235
[laughs]

875
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,613
Me? How old do I look?

876
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,160
[playful music playing]

877
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,830
You present yourself
with a mature demeanor, but…

878
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,457
I feel like you're young.

879
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,501
Ooh, I like that.

880
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,171
Maybe… 25?

881
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,090
You're a good guesser.

882
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,179
Thanks.

883
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,182
You can speak casually, by the way.

884
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,396
-Shall we talk casually? Or not?
-[Si-an] Okay.

885
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,109
What do you do?

886
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,027
Guess that too.

887
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:45,988
[Jeong-su] Maybe…

888
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,991
-a news anchor or something?
-[laughs]

889
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,660
-Am I wrong?
-[Si-an] A news anchor?

890
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,953
No, I'm not.

891
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,497
A model?

892
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,374
-Correct.
-[Jun-seo] You're a model?

893
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,211
[Si-an] I am a model.

894
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:04,214
[funky music playing]

895
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,050
[Si-an] Currently a commercial model
for an athleisure brand.

896
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,680
I do various types of modeling
like beauty brands,

897
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,765
lookbook shoots, and commercials.

898
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:18,353
LEE SI-AN
25 YEARS OLD, MODEL

899
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,397
It suits you.

900
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,191
And you, oppa?

901
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,653
Now you're using honorifics?

902
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,488
[chuckling]

903
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:32,826
I… I run a food and beverage business.

904
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,620
[gasps softly] Oh…

905
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,831
-Like coffee shops and bakeries.
-[Si-an] Ah…

906
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,167
[Jeong-su] I run coffee shops.

907
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:46,423
I am currently running five shops,
including those in Seongsu and Hannam.

908
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,719
We roast our own coffee beans here

909
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,430
and we are very passionate
when it comes to coffee.

910
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,268
I also do hands-on work
like staff and facility management

911
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,394
and menu development.

912
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:03,774
KIM JEONG-SU
33 YEARS OLD BAKERY CAFÉ OWNER

913
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,942
So, you're a business owner?

914
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,486
You are, that's cool!

915
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,072
-[Si-an] Very cool.
-It's nothing.

916
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:16,662
How did you feel when I chose you?

917
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:17,704
[chuckles softly]

918
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,956
I was so excited.

919
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,249
-You were?
-[Si-an] Yeah.

920
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,046
When I saw you approaching…

921
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,215
Well, my type is kind of like…

922
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,344
someone who has a kind face,
kind of like a puppy.

923
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,889
-Oh, yeah?
-[Si-an] It looked like you were smiling.

924
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,475
And that made a good first impression.

925
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,852
-I thought I was expressionless.
-Not at all.

926
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,231
You looked you'd be so nice.
You made a great first impression.

927
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,654
You must've seen the other girls
who were standing there too.

928
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,409
They didn't… spark your interest?

929
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,622
[Jeong-su] I just saw this woman
in a white dress.

930
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,124
She had the prettiest smile.

931
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,545
[gentle music playing]

932
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,596
-[Jeong-su] She smiled.
-Oh, really?

933
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,432
-And…
-[chuckles]

934
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,392
I only looked for a couple seconds.

935
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:23,562
Honestly. I just trusted my instinct
and went for it.

936
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,483
[giggles softly]

937
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,655
I'm blushing. [giggles]

938
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:46,293
The conversation is flowing so naturally
between these two.

939
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,963
-They're not even trying to force it.
-It doesn't sound forced at all.

940
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:53,675
By the way, I couldn't see his face before
because of his bangs.

941
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:57,387
But after having a closer look,
I must say he's quite handsome.

942
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,638
[Kyuhyun] Yeah.

943
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,557
You were fond of him from the start.

944
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,267
-Really?
-Someone you mentioned.

945
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,353
I think I was just more attracted
to his voice back then.

946
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,105
You think he's got the looks too?

947
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,191
You can't get bored of a face like that.

948
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:14,154
Jeong-su has started to show
his true self and his strengths.

949
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:18,408
So the women might really enjoy the time
they get to spend with him.

950
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,119
I personally could tell
that Si-an was very into him.

951
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,331
The most crucial question
was when she asked him

952
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,708
about his first impressions
of the other women.

953
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,669
Women don't get curious
if they're not interested, right?

954
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,587
That's right.

955
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,048
When she asked,
"What about the other women?"

956
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,674
That question really struck me.

957
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,301
I sense that too.

958
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:39,554
And Jeong-su seems rather collected.
He's pretty calm.

959

-Wow.

00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,732
-[You-jin] A private swimming pool.
-[Jun-seo] Right? It feels private.

962
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:55,028
-[You-jin] Wait. It's warm!
-[Jun-seo] I know!

963
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,822
This feels so great.

964
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,535
It's really nice.

965
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,415
[You-jin] I'm surprised,
it's warmer than I expected.

966
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,918
What the… [chuckling]

967
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,211
You're dunking already?

968
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,798
-You're putting your head in?
-Well, I was competing earlier today.

969
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:15,966
[You-jin] I see.

970
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,635
And I was already fully submerged
at one point.

971
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,805
-[You-jin] Oh.
-I couldn't see anything.

972
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:24,683
-Nothing at all. Gosh.
-Wow, that's hilarious.

973
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,978
-[laughs] You did that? Seriously?
-[Jun-seo] Yeah.

00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,313

You're just like Aquaman. [laughs]

979
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,332
You're so similar.

980
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,792
[giggles]

981
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,295
-[You-jin] Are you gonna swim?
-Yeah, come on.

982
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,546
Let's swim.

983
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:57,215
He's like this stylish,
handsome-looking servant.

984
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,009
[all laughing]

985
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,303
I don't get why we former soldiers
are rough.

986
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:04,306
-"Former soldiers."
-Why are we so unsophisticated?

987
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,641
Gosh, this feels so good.

988
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,184
[chuckling]

989
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,228
What's happening tomorrow?

990
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,563
[You-jin] I have no idea…

991
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,399
-It doesn't seem to be on your mind.
-Tomorrow…

992
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,403
We might go back to Inferno
to play a game.

993
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,072
Then someone else
might get to come to Paradise.

994
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:22,908
Maybe.

995
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,452
I wonder what the game's gonna be?

996
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,455
[You-jin] I guess
I'll have to fight this time.

997
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,625
I think the women
will be competing tomorrow.

998
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,834
Makes sense.

999
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,670
I hope you do well
so you can bring me here.

1000
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,131
-Okay, sure.
-[Jun-seo] I'm holding you to that.

1001
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:40,425
[both laugh]

1002
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,510
[You-jin] Stop. You're too funny.

1003
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,554
I'm counting on you.

1004
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,641
-Oh, you are.
-Just playing.

1005
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,061
This is fun.

1006
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,817
Oh, that's where the leaves
were falling from?

1007
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,904
I've been wondering this whole time.

1008
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,823
I had no idea they were falling
from right above us.

1009
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,575
It's kinda romantic.

1010
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,119
How that leaf fell just now.

1011
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,497
Like I'm swimming in sugar water.

1012
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,666
-Sugar water?
-It feels so sweet right now.

1013
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,210
-So sweet.
-[You-jin] Sweet?

1014
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,837
-Is it?
-[Jun-seo] Yeah. It's so sweet.

1015
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,965
You're hilarious.

1016
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,175
Let's come here again.

1017
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:25,095

-Sounds good.

1023
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,615
I'll try to keep it quiet.

1024
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,159
Oh, I'm a little scared.

00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:50,996
Will it make a sound?

1026
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,497
-Will it be loud?
-No.

-Just like that?

-I did well, huh?
-Wow. You're good.

1034
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,935
He did it so smoothly.
He must've done this before.

1035
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,271
-He's done it a lot.
-How many has he opened?

1036
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,189
-It's not an easy task.
-He's experienced.

1037
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,442
-[Si-an] Cheers.
-[Jeong su] Cheers.

1038
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,068
-To what?
-I don't know.

1039
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,487
What should we toast to?

1040
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,281
To the first night in Paradise…

1041
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,158
-Wait, did you drink?
-No, not yet.

1042
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,784
To the first night in Paradise.

1043
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,161
Cheers.

1044
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,458
[sighs] That's good.

1045
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,252
-You like it?
-[Si-an] It's delicious.

1046
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:43,214
Don't you think we're a lot more
comfortable now than earlier?

1047
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,632
-[Jeong-su] We are.
-Right?

1048
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,469
-We finally built some connection.
-[Si-an] Exactly.

1049
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,512
Then we have to leave after one night.

1050

-And you are?
-[laughs]

1051

-Strangers again. Like, "Hello."
-But it will…

1052
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,646
It'll feel a little weird in a good way

1053

when I get to see you again
with all the others.

1054
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,233
Yeah.

1055
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,819
I'll root for you to come in first place

1056
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,489
and be the best
because we built this connection.

1057
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,657
That's a lot of weight on my shoulders…

[both laugh]

1059
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,745
I'm already tired
from carrying that bag earlier.

1060
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,164
That's just how I feel.

1062
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,128
I'll try my best.

1063

I have to say you looked really cool
when you made that first appearance.

-[Jeong-su] Face masks?
-[Si-an] Sure.

1074
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,728
-You brought some?
-[Jeong-su] Yeah.

1075
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,899
-Can you help?
-[Si-an] You want me to?

1076
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,068
Sure. Give it to me.

1077
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,278
It's too early.

1078
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:31,364
[warm music playing]

1079
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,118
Face me.

1080
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,122
It fits perfectly.

1081
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,874
Good job.

1082

[chuckling]

1083
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,589
-I don't think I'm good at this.
-[Jeong-su] You don't?

[giggles]

1085
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,926
Oh, geez.

1086
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,845
-Are you doing this on purpose?
-No.

1087
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,263
To tease me.

1088
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,684
Done.

1089
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,561
[Si-an] All good?

1090
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,021
Hold on.

1091
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,732
-[Jeong-su] Good night.
-[Si-an] Good night.

1092
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,694
Perfect.

1093
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,363
-Isn't it cold?
-Hmm?

1094
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,157
[Jeong-su] I'll turn the heat up.

1095
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,162
Okay.

1096
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,581
My legs are hanging off a bit,
but it's okay.

1097
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,375
-[Si-an] Just sleep on the bed.
-No.

1098
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,795
-You'll sleep better, though.
-I like it here.

1099

-[Jeong-su sighs]
-[Si-an laughs]

1101
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,729
Isn't it uncomfortable?
What if you fall in your sleep?

1102
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,314
[Jeong-su] It's perfect here.

1103
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,024
[Si-an] I mean…

1104
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,985
There's so much space on the bed.

1105
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,281
Look, your feet are hanging off.

1106
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,080
-[Jeong-su] You asleep?
-[Si-an] No.

1107
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,087
[Jeong-su] It's our first night.

1108
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,507
[Si-an] My first night in Paradise.

1109
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,675
All thanks to you.

1110
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,343
I mean it.

1111
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,056
Oh! [sighs]

1112
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:23,226
The tone of his voice,
the way he's breathing…

1113
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,061
Everything's…

1114
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:28,147
-He's so calm.
-He seems so at ease.

1115
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:32,110
I'm sure he's feeling awkward,
but he doesn't seem flustered at all.

1116
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:35,446
Si-an seems to have completely fallen
for Jeong-su.

1117
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,325
She's already wrapped around his finger
without her even realizing it.

1118
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,868
-[Jin-young] I agree.
-Yeah.

1119
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,621
But she probably feels like
she has to be careful

1120
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,915
being with someone that smooth.

1121
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,625
No, that's not it.

1122
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:50,628
He doesn't even make you feel
that he's experienced.

1123
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,550
We can grasp that from here,
but he's giving off a very genuine vibe

1124
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,760
to the person he's with in that moment.

1125
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,513
I've become a bit curious about Jeong-su.

1126
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,516
His conversations with Si-an
have a natural flow to them

1127
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,351
and have been going very smoothly.

1128
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:09,355
But I didn't sense any butterflies
between them, or anything like that.

1129
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,982
I could see it in Si-an.

1130
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,234
But I wonder if Jeong-su
would act different

1131
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,111
in front of someone he really likes.

1132
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,865
He might get awkward and clumsy
around someone he's interested in.

1133
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,200
That would be a pleasant surprise.

1134
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,535
[Jin-kyung] Yeah.

1135
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,872
But so far, his emotional state
hasn't really changed at all

1136
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,790
during their first night in Paradise.

1137
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,461
So, I can't be sure yet
if he has feelings for her or not.

1138
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:34,172
Yeah. This is what men in their 30s
are like now.

1139
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,674
-Huh?
-They're all just like him.

1140
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:40,261
Aside from their good looks,
they don't fall for people right away.

1141
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,680
You never see them go,
"I like you so much."

1142
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,140
Or "I'm really into you."

1143
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:47,518
They get to know their personality
no matter how pretty they are.

1144
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:52,315
Maybe he's calm at first
and eventually becomes passionate.

1145
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,192
I'm thinking that might be the case.
