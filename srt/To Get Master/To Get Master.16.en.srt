=Episode 16=

20
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:42,100
Mengdie,

21
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,301
the first time I saw you,

22
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:46,900
I knew you were the daughter of Mr. Chu.

23
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,740
Unlike that other girl,

24
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:50,301
your close friend,

25
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,700
who doesn't have a shred
of the hero's spirit.

26
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,260
You're on a different level.

27
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,501
Mr. Bai, you overpraise me.

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,021
I'm not worthy of that.

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,180
It's fantastic you agree
to reveal the second volume

30
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,260
of the Xiaoyao Technique

31
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,781
at the Houlang Conference.

32
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,861
It can revitalize

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,460
and stabilize the martial world.

34
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:11,061
Everyone,

35
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:13,540
let us all raise a toast.

36
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,860
To Miss Chu.

37
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,540
- Please.
- Please.

38
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,741
Well,

39
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,621
Young Master,

40
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,260
toast to Miss Chu.

41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,980
Miss Chu,

42
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:40,501
I toast to you.

43
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,860
Why, you!

44
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:48,741
I asked you to toast to Miss Chu.

45
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,621
Why did you drink first?

46
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,420
Last time, Young Master

47
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,260
banned me
from learning Xiaoyao Technique.

48
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,661
This time,

49
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,381
he'd be awkward seeing me again.

50
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:00,341
Mengdie,

51
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,661
now our two sects must unite
against the demon cult.

52
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,061
Those things before
were all misunderstandings.

53
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:07,181
Don't take them to heart.

54
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,020
Young Master,

55
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,020
Miss Chu is one of the top figures

56
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,860
in today's martial world.

57
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:14,540
Offer a sincere apology.

58
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:17,741
Don't let others
think Fengyu Valley is rude.

59
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,140
Mr. Bai,

60
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:21,661
I have long heard that Young Master

61
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:23,501
used to do menial tasks.

62
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,540
You have him interact with people.

63
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:26,941
I'm afraid he may not do well.

64
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,260
Be patient.

65
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,260
Teach slowly.

66
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:30,820
Exactly.

67
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:32,181
The Young Master

68
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,860
seems

69
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,860
a far cry

70
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:37,941
from the usual bunch

71
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,980
Fengyu Valley

72
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,061
picks.

73
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,501
Everyone, m-may I praise him like this?

74
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,420
I'm just a martial artist,
not good with words.

75
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,420
Not good with words.

76
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,181
A hero's past doesn't matter.

77
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
Plenty of legends

78
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,661
also started from menial tasks.

79
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:00,820
I have high hopes for him.

80
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:04,980
Baili,

81
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,100
after a few days of parting,

82
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,860
you still appear so reserved.

83
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:09,661
Why don't I just toast

84
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:13,501
to you with this one?

85
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,540
Young Master, hurry up.

86
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:30,900
I apologize for earlier.

87
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:36,301
Everyone,

88
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:38,340
I'm not feeling well.

89
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:39,741
I'll take my leave.

90
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,381
Take your time drinking.

91
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,140
Take your time.

92
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:47,660
Come on.

93
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:50,020
Gentlemen, let me offer
another cup to you.

94
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,861
Miss Chu,

95
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,660
I have long heard
of your extraordinary spirit.

96
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,541
Seeing you today,

97
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,421
you're every bit as strong as they say.

98
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:08,941
By the way,

99
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:10,741
why isn't Mr. Chu

100
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,260
here today?

101
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,101
My father locked himself away
for cultivation.

102
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,140
You are hurrying to the banquet, right?

103
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:19,140
It's in the front hall.

104
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,220
Please.

105
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,541
That's right.

106
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:22,780
Then I'll go ahead.

107
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,061
Catch you another day.

108
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,260
Please.

109
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:30,664
- You're...
- Chu Mengdie. Father's not here.

110
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,008
The banquet is in the front hall.

111
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:32,981
Please.

112
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:34,301
Thank you.

113
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,460
Miss Chu.

114
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,900
Stop. The banquet is in the hall.

115
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:42,421
It seems Miss Chu
is not in a good mood today.

116
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,020
It's you?

117
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:48,660
It's been a long time.

118
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:50,061
What?

119
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,460
Is it like one day apart
feels like three years?

120
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:54,700
You

121
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,301
miss me that much, huh?

122
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,660
The city wall

123
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:59,820
isn't as thick as your skin.

124
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,541
Stop with the sweet talk.

125
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:04,580
Given the current situation
of Jingyun Manor,

126
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,820
the second volume

127
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:07,861
is one of your few bargaining chips.

128
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,741
You're actually planning
to bring that out

129
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,580
at the Houlang Conference?

130
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,580
My father established Jingyun Manor

131
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,181
to guard the second volume.

132
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,981
He didn't want it
to fall into the clutches

133
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:24,260
of the demon cult
or anyone with bad intentions.

134
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,741
With the demon cult back,

135
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:27,381
I must bring out the manual

136
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,020
and do my part

137
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:30,260
for the martial world.

138
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,220
It's the least I can do

139
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,140
to honor my father's wishes.

140
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,780
I figured

141
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:39,820
I didn't need to say much about this.

142
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:41,501
But then I realized,

143
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:44,181
it's understandable

144
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,660
that someone like Mr. Nan

145
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:47,220
would have doubts.

146
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,140
You are forthright and straightforward.

147
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,780
I truly admire you.

148
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,621
However,

149
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:56,381
since you've got
the second volume of Xiaoyao Technique,

150
00:06:57,101 --> 00:06:58,700
it's about time

151
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,941
you gave back that jade pendant

152
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,220
you stole from me, right?

153
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:27,020
Senior,

154
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:29,061
do you really have no worries at all?

155
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:34,181
What should I be worried about?

156
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:37,260
The future of Fengyu Valley.

157
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,580
You wouldn't believe it.

158
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,220
At the banquet today,

159
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:41,580
Baili Xingchen

160
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,381
didn't even know how to make small talk.

161
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,301
I had to step in and ease the tension.

162
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:47,460
During the banquet,

163
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,220
a bunch of people

164
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,900
were throwing shade
at us from Fengyu Valley.

165
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,421
Baili Xingchen is just mediocre.

166
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,501
He's practically a fool.

167
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,861
In the future,

168
00:07:57,861 --> 00:08:00,101
he might mess everything up.

169
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,220
You think he is a fool,

170
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,900
but I see

171
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:10,020
his naivety and honesty

172
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,501
as strengths.

173
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,900
What makes you say that?

174
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,660
Baili Xingchen

175
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:18,020
is simple-minded,

176
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,460
just focused on training.

177
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:23,101
He's the perfect pawn.

178
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:25,340
More importantly,

179
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,301
his relationship
with Nan Chuimeng and Chu Mengdie

180
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:29,900
is unusually close.

181
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:31,460
At that point,

182
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,140
a gentle push will be enough.

183
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,020
But...

184
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,300
With his current martial arts,

185
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:39,821
at the Houlang Conference,

186
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,780
it's a risky bet.

187
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:45,381
Since you know,

188
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,300
turn things that are uncertain

189
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,621
into things that are certain.

190
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,341
I got it.

191
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:00,712
(Golden Goblet Restaurant)

192
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,660
It's a pity
that the flowering season is over.

193
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:12,861
Go ahead.

194
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:14,741
You need my help, right?

195
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,461
Shameless.

196
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,260
By the way,

197
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:36,501
Mengdie is now in Fengyu Valley, right?

198
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,341
You told me she was in trouble
at the manor last time.

199
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,621
How is she now?

200
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:41,940
She is fine now.

201
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,260
Now, she is

202
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:44,861
the head of Jingyun Manor.

203
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,701
Besides,

204
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:46,981
she's got the manual

205
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,940
as a prize for the Houlang Conference.

206
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,020
She is in the limelight.

207
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,900
I've been flipping through

208
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,821
the Jianghu News.

209
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,540
It mentions that almost half
of the martial world

210
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,400
will attend the Houlang Conference.

211
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,981
With the Xiaoyao Technique as the prize,

212
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:03,940
shouldn't you participate too?

213
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:05,420
Snag that top spot.

214
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,180
This is my most legitimate way

215
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:08,981
to reclaim the manual.

216
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:10,540
Then I will cheer you on

217
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,981
from the sidelines.

218
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:15,341
Song'er,

219
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,420
there's something

220
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,020
I'd like you to do for me.

221
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:22,060
I said I would cheer you on.

222
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,140
No.

223
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:25,180
I want you to sign up

224
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,101
and compete with me.

225
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,660
Are you crazy?

226
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,260
Me? I don't even know martial arts.

227
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:35,420
I'd just be making a fool of myself.

228
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,940
You'll be there with your husband.

229
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,540
We will be a perfect couple.

230
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:39,461
In the future,

231
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:41,221
it will be a wonderful tale.

232
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,900
Let me think about it.

233
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:26,221
Young Master,

234
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:27,741
Young Head invites you.

235
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,020
Who is Young Head?

236
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,660
Young Head of Jingyun Villa,
Chu Mengdie.

237
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,940
Oh, I see. I'm busy.

238
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,780
I'll go back.

239
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,140
Tell the Young Head,

240
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:44,701
the world is vast.

241
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:46,341
See her if fate allows.

242
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,981
W-What's wrong?

243
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,020
My lady doesn't like being refused.

244
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,660
Wait.

245
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:53,621
You... Wait.

246
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:54,701
Listen to me!

247
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,221
D-Don't be impulsive.

248
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,180
I always think carefully.

249
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
I am never impulsive.

250
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:06,341
Wait.

251
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:08,381
If you're not being impulsive,

252
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:10,621
what's this?

253
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,461
Baili, tell me.

254
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:14,741
Before, I was Lin Shu.

255
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,940
You took care of me well
in Fengyu Valley.

256
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:18,981
Now, I am Chu Mengdie.

257
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:21,461
You publicly banned me
from the Xiaoyao Technique.

258
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,741
I get it.

259
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,180
You just became the Young Master
and had no choice.

260
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,501
But now our two sects have allied.

261
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,701
Why do you still avoid me?

262
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:34,821
It's

263
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,821
also arranged by Fengyu Valley?

264
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:40,461
That's right.

265
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,101
I did it on purpose.

266
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:44,060
Just as you said,

267
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:45,701
you are no longer Lin Shu.

268
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,020
We were once like buddies,

269
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,501
but you know the buzz from the banquet.

270
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:52,501
People think we're poles apart now.

271
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,900
Hanging with me

272
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,900
won't help your rep.

273
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:57,461
Wait!

274
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,940
No.

275
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,540
You can kill me or whatever,

276
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,140
but don't take off my clothes.

277
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,381
Originally,

278
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,101
we're not on those terms.

279
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,060
I never saw you being reserved
in the past.

280
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:24,940
I can stop

281
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:26,741
if you answer my second question.

282
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,501
If your answer satisfies me,

283
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:30,341
I may consider sparing you.

284
00:13:33,741 --> 00:13:35,101
The day I left Fengyu Valley,

285
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,581
why weren't you there?

286
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:39,741
I...

287
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,140
I just wanted to make...

288
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:43,581
Make a name for myself.

289
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,501
Once I gain fame,

290
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
I can...

291
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:48,381
I can...

292
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
What?

293
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:55,900
Then I'll match you in status

294
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,381
and protect you.

295
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:02,300
Why do you want to protect me?

296
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,341
By taking my dagger

297
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,140
and going along
with my hometown's custom,

298
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,420
you're my husband now?

299
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,981
No, Miss Chu,

300
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:15,701
I-I think you've misunderstood.

301
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:17,381
I just...

302
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,461
Just...

303
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:19,461
Forget it!

304
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,381
If you want to gain fame in Jianghu,

305
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,540
I'll help you get there.

306
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:26,660
No need!

307
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,900
I've signed up
for the Houlang Conference.

308
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,300
Once I win,

309
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:32,660
I'll gain fame for sure.

310
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,780
The Houlang Conference?

311
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:35,741
I am also participating.

312
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,821
You think

313
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,180
you can win against me?

314
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,540
I'll compete, win or not.

315
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:44,660
If I lose,

316
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,221
I'm all yours.

317
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:46,940
Deal.

318
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,621
You said it.

319
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,701
You are all mine.

320
00:15:02,221 --> 00:15:03,221
Alright.

321
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:04,780
I'm tired.

322
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,381
Let's figure out the help tomorrow.

323
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,660
We are in public.

324
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,540
Cuddling is undignified.

325
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,821
We're already married.

326
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:16,260
I'm just hugging my wife.

327
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,420
What's the issue?

328
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,461
Who...

329
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:22,221
Who married you?

330
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:25,461
Nan Chuimeng and Chu Mengdie did it.

331
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,621
Not us.

332
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Moreover,

333
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:31,180
if you want to marry me,

334
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,981
you need to show real effort.

335
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:34,101
Dream on.

336
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:43,900
The predecessors said,

337
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:46,180
"The intricate dice holds red beans,

338
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,501
a symbol of love that pierces the bone."

339
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:53,821
Song'er,

340
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:55,861
from now on,

341
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780
let's

342
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,060
never speak of parting,

343
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:00,660
only of staying together.

344
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,461
How about that?

345
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:14,140
So, you agreed?

346
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,341
Agreed to what?

347
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
Agreed

348
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:22,300
to compete with me tomorrow.

349
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,221
You bad guy!

350
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:25,381
Dare to trick me!

351
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:26,501
I thought I agreed to...

352
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:27,540
To be my wife

353
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:29,381
and grow old together, right?

354
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,381
You're so bad.

355
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,180
In this perfect moment,

356
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:35,420
shouldn't you own up

357
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,300
to that debt you owe me?

358
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:38,381
You...

359
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:49,288
♪Long and short,
sighs are whispers sharp as blades♪

360
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:54,029
♪East and west, hustling and drifting
in the martial world♪

361
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:58,022
♪Destined or accidental,
no one falls for me♪

362
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:02,083
♪Solitary is my middle name♪

363
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:05,064
(Golden Goblet Restaurant)

364
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:35,900
Let me take you somewhere.

365
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,541
Where?

366
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,821
This is obviously a downtown area.

367
00:17:58,261 --> 00:18:00,781
How can an uninhabited shack
remain here?

368
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:04,541
Perhaps people think

369
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:06,140
the feng shui here is bad,

370
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,261
because it's home to the demon cult

371
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,061
and the villain.

372
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,781
What exactly happened to your family?

373
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,341
I heard a few words from Han Yan.

374
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,821
She said your parents were framed.

375
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:22,301
Xiaoyao Technique

376
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,660
was originally yours.

377
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,660
My parents were once

378
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,261
disciples of the Tianming Clan,
the most prestigious in Jianghu.

379
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,900
The Tianming Clan

380
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,140
is elusive

381
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,500
and never meddles
in the Jianghu quarrels.

382
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:41,341
When the old clan leader died,

383
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,140
my father

384
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:45,140
took over.

385
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
My mother,

386
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:48,460
unexpectedly, found

387
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,261
the powerful Xiaoyao Technique.

388
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
As a result...

389
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,140
They were targeted?

390
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:02,341
To protect the Tianming Clan, my parents

391
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,301
dismissed the disciples,

392
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,061
who then scattered everywhere.

393
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:09,140
We hid in the city

394
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,220
as ordinary people.

395
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,420
But the manual made us a target.

396
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:15,140
Wherever we went,

397
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,140
people from Jianghu,

398
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:18,700
to seize the manual,

399
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,381
would soon come after us.

400
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,541
Three of us

401
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,261
eventually took refuge
in the Riyue Palace.

402
00:19:27,581 --> 00:19:28,660
I've never heard

403
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,180
such nonsense.

404
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:33,180
They're the ones
who took your family's manual.

405
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,980
How can they turn around

406
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,660
and say you're a demon cult

407
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,581
and call you a villain?

408
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,700
Perhaps that's the only way

409
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,021
they can keep everyone in line

410
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,740
and feel better.

411
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
So,

412
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,061
I have to get back
what belongs to my family.

413
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,740
Don't worry.

414
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,940
I'll join you

415
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:58,660
in tomorrow's competition.

416
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,980
We'll get it back

417
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,341
and hide it somewhere safe.

418
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,220
We'll only pass it on to our kids.

419
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:08,101
I...

420
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,660
Our...

421
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,180
Kids?

422
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,821
I figured

423
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,220
we should just destroy the manual.

424
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:19,220
Although

425
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:21,220
it's our family's treasure,

426
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:23,861
it's also what caused our downfall.

427
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:26,261
But you just said

428
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,341
we should give it to our kids.

429
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,021
Look,

430
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,420
this tree is so green.

431
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:38,660
Today,

432
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,301
the sky is quite gloomy too.

433
00:20:50,101 --> 00:20:51,381
Welcome!

434
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:54,021
Nowadays,

435
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,581
the martial world is in turmoil,

436
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:57,140
and the villain is rampant.

437
00:20:58,261 --> 00:21:00,740
It has reached
a critical situation of survival.

438
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,861
This Houlang Conference

439
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,180
is all about picking

440
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,341
the real new talents
of the martial world

441
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:09,980
and future pillars.

442
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,821
(To make Mengdie
look at me in a new light,)

443
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:14,420
(I must take first place.)

444
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,740
Everyone's strategic mind
and martial prowess.

445
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,220
Participants

446
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,621
need to form teams of two.

447
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,621
This is to test the teamwork

448
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,301
and coordination

449
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,781
of the participants.

450
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:27,381
Ultimately,

451
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:29,180
the outstanding winner

452
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,460
will receive

453
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:32,500
the complete volumes
of the Xiaoyao Technique,

454
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,061
and have the authority to lead everyone

455
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,140
in an assault on the Riyue Palace

456
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,660
to eradicate the demon cult.

457
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:57,140
This is Baili Xingchen,
Young Master of Fengyu Valley.

458
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,061
He'll

459
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,660
represent our Fengyu Valley

460
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:02,980
at this Houlang Conference.

461
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:06,740
I believe in my decision,

462
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:07,821
and I expect you

463
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,861
to dazzle everyone

464
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,460
at the Houlang Conference.

465
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,861
(Baili indeed
has the protagonist's aura.)

466
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,940
(Even Nan Wentian,)

467
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,021
(this shrewd old man, is on his side.)

468
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,420
What are you laughing at?

469
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:26,261
Nothing.

470
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:28,861
I announce the theme of the first round.

471
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,740
Lanterns.

472
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
Master,

473
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,220
you called me here

474
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,420
for what?

475
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,021
I came to check

476
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,940
how you're doing.

477
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,581
Feeling confident

478
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,700
about winning?

479
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,781
Yes!

480
00:22:50,061 --> 00:22:51,061
I'm thinking,

481
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:52,821
this competition is about reputation.

482
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:54,660
I'll risk it all

483
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,740
to win.

484
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:56,821
Good.

485
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:00,621
That's the spirit of Fengyu Valley.

486
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:04,261
I've had my eye on you for a while.

487
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,781
Win this competition,

488
00:23:06,061 --> 00:23:08,061
and you'll be
the future leader of martial world.

489
00:23:08,581 --> 00:23:09,581
By then,

490
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,900
I

491
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:12,341
might even need

492
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,621
your protection, Leader Baili.

493
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:22,261
Master,

494
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,700
don't tell me you've got

495
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,621
incurable illness
and you won't make it long?

496
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
Master.

497
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,700
I just don't want
to deal with valley affairs.

498
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:35,940
I need someone to share the burden.

499
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,341
Keep this safe.

500
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,381
After the competition begins,

501
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:55,660
open it.

502
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,781
Master, it's...

503
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,420
The wheel

504
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,900
is repaired?

505
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:17,180
Drawing rules.

506
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:19,660
Same colored ball means same group.

507
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,220
It's random.

508
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,940
I want to exchange with you.

509
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,581
I need to avoid Miss Chu.

510
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:38,740
Be serious about exam rules.

511
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,581
Cheaters

512
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:42,220
will be expelled.

513
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,420
This ball is quite green.

514
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:48,341
The drawing time is up.

515
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:50,420
It's sealed

516
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:51,980
once the timer starts.

517
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:54,021
Use the clues in the room

518
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:56,220
to leave the secret room.

519
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,420
Each has three sticks of incense's time.

520
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,821
A drum will beat

521
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,180
after each stick burns out.

522
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,500
If you're still

523
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:05,500
in the room after all three,

524
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:06,621
you lose.

525
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,500
What is this?

526
00:25:18,581 --> 00:25:19,861
(With so many participants,)

527
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:23,341
(the chances of me and Song'er
being in the same group are slim.)

528
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,940
(Too coincidental.)

529
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:28,341
(Did someone do this on purpose?)

530
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,940
Turn a blind eye and a deaf ear?

531
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,900
What does it mean?

532
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,740
Hey,

533
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,700
didn't you say you wanted to win?

534
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:37,781
How can you drink tea...?

535
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,101
You are now the wife of Young Master.

536
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,660
Of course, you must protect him.

537
00:25:45,781 --> 00:25:46,180
It's

538
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:48,261
really unlucky
to be in the same group with you.

539
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,541
(No way.)

540
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:51,101
(A competition with eavesdroppers?)

541
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,861
Mr. Nan,

542
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,700
please get it straight.

543
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,581
The two of us are now a team.

544
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,700
Have you found the clue?

545
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:07,301
No.

546
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,621
Didn't you say you wanted to protect me?

547
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:12,700
I was drunk last night.

548
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:14,621
I was talking nonsense.

549
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:20,381
W-Why are you coming over?

550
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:21,861
You can just say it.

551
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:23,381
Baili Xingchen,

552
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:25,660
you're playing hard to get now, huh?

553
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:28,021
What a pity.

554
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,821
We are assigned to the same group.

555
00:26:30,261 --> 00:26:31,261
Otherwise,

556
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
you'll lose this round.

557
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:33,581
Impossible.

558
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,900
Even if I don't ask you,

559
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,261
I can find the clue myself.

560
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,980
Don't mess up and get kicked out

561
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,301
before you find the clue.

562
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:48,140
I'm not that foolish.

563
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,700
Alright.

564
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,861
Then let's start.

565
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:55,821
We might be in the same group,

566
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,021
but if I find the clue before you,

567
00:26:58,301 --> 00:26:59,301
I win.

568
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,581
And vice versa.

569
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,740
Deal!

570
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:09,581
(Exit)
Let go of me.

571
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:11,301
No way.

572
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,021
I won't let you solve the puzzle

573
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,940
and have a good time with Baili.

574
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,381
There is no love between us!

575
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,420
Meeting Baili

576
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,101
made me understand
what real affection is.

577
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,861
You're actually this cold.

578
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,420
Well, then,

579
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,301
let's just sign a divorce paper

580
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,500
and be done with each other.

581
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:35,140
Alright!

582
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,420
Just sign it.

583
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Okay.

584
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:39,261
I've prepared the divorce paper.

585
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:40,900
Mrs. Baili, please sign here.

586
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,581
From now on,
you and Baili can be free and happy,

587
00:27:44,261 --> 00:27:45,660
and we'll be strangers.

588
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:46,900
When did you prepare it?

589
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,272
(Marriage contract)

590
00:27:55,781 --> 00:27:56,541
What?

591
00:27:56,781 --> 00:27:58,781
We were just spooning yesterday,

592
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,541
and now you want to back out?

593
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,220
I forget.

594
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:07,500
Which part do you forget?

595
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,781
Need me to jog your memory?

596
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:12,296
(Li Song'er, Gu Yuan)

597
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,180
Alright.

598
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:21,581
The competition begins.

599
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,861
I've already known the answer.

600
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:31,541
What's wrong?

601
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,781
What's up with you two?

602
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:34,301
Nothing.

603
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:36,021
She is using me to annoy Master.

604
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:39,061
Don't come over.

605
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:43,500
If the timing were better,

606
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:46,101
I'd really want
to have a fight with you.

607
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:49,621
Having a fight isn't your style.

608
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,261
I...

609
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,460
Forget it.

610
00:29:04,061 --> 00:29:05,581
If a couple can argue,

611
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:08,581
that's actually kind of lucky.

612
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,900
Maybe.

613
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,660
Despite appearing

614
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:31,420
to be just a normal house,

615
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,220
the placement of these lanterns

616
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,460
corresponds to different spots
in Fengyu Valley.

617
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:36,861
Like right here,

618
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,781
where I'm sitting.

619
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:40,061
The spot above my head

620
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,500
(From top to bottom. Guess a word.)
is linked to a place in Fengyu Valley.

621
00:29:45,061 --> 00:29:46,061
The top half

622
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,420
of "From"

623
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,900
and the bottom half

624
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:50,740
of "To".

625
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,180
Sit!

626
00:29:52,621 --> 00:29:54,341
So, in Fengyu Valley,

627
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:55,861
who is sitting all the time?

628
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,821
Who is sitting all the time?

629
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,220
Wuwei Cave.

630
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
Nan Wentian...

631
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:05,541
Master Nan.

632
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:07,900
He has been sitting in meditation
at Wuwei Cave.

633
00:30:08,301 --> 00:30:08,940
So,

634
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,861
this represents Wuwei Cave.

635
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,821
And there's just this one chair,

636
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:17,101
fitting the character "Sit".

637
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,420
Alright, Mr. Nan.

638
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,700
You figured out the trick

639
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,861
and sat here on purpose.

640
00:30:25,381 --> 00:30:26,900
So, according to this thought,

641
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:28,381
this round is easy to solve.

642
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,061
This is Wuwei Cave.

643
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:32,621
The first volume

644
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:33,900
is kept in the cliff

645
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,180
at the back of Fengyu Valley,

646
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:38,180
which is right east of the arena.

647
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:40,061
While Wuwei Cave

648
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:42,101
is southwest of the arena.

649
00:30:42,261 --> 00:30:43,261
Then here

650
00:30:43,581 --> 00:30:44,821
is the arena.

651
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,781
A painting curtain in front.

652
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:50,621
Training!

653
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:51,980
Training arena.

654
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Here.

655
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,420
Mountain pomegranates, like Xi Shi,

656
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:59,740
holding two branches.

657
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:01,261
Guess a flower name.

658
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,460
Azalea.

659
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,940
Here!

660
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,180
Success!

661
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Just the first round.

662
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:17,061
No need to be so excited.

663
00:31:37,581 --> 00:31:39,180
Look at the question, don't...

664
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,301
Don't stare at me.

665
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,581
You say you don't want my dagger.

666
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,940
How come it's so precious to you?

667
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
I'm used to carrying it.

668
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Give it back to me.

669
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:57,140
No way.

670
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,460
What you gave me is mine now.

671
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,460
Alright.

672
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
You can keep it.

673
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,541
And you can look

674
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,660
for the clue yourself.

675
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:06,861
Okay.

676
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:08,980
Sugar and plums are a rare treat.

677
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:10,861
Guess food?

678
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:15,861
Sugar and plums are...

679
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,980
Won't you look anymore?

680
00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:19,381
No.

681
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:22,301
I give up.

682
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Wait.

683
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,980
Come on!

684
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,660
My path to glory in the martial world

685
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,381
is over at the first round?

686
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:49,381
Peacock flies southeast.

687
00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:51,341
Guess a word.

688
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,180
Peacock...

689
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,980
Go get the key from the flowerpot.

690
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:11,381
Here it is?

691
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,140
The riddles

692
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,261
are based on the geography
of Fengyu Valley.

693
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:17,061
I roughly deduced.

694
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,500
The key

695
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,861
is under the azalea pot.

696
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:29,381
How is it?

697
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:30,381
Have you figured it out?

698
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,061
Will we be eliminated
in the first round?

699
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:35,541
Impossible.

700
00:33:35,621 --> 00:33:37,261
How could I be wrong?

701
00:33:37,621 --> 00:33:38,301
Forget it.

702
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,581
You're just wrong.

703
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:42,500
I will have to do it myself.

704
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:46,940
Since there is a keyhole,
there must be another key.

705
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,660
Trust me. It's fine.

706
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,381
Failing occasionally is no big deal.

707
00:33:52,621 --> 00:33:54,460
We must bravely face reality.

708
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
I won't laugh at you.

709
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,900
I...

710
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980
Can't open it.

711
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:08,821
How could it be?

712
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:12,581
You need to put in effort.
You can't wing it.

713
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,741
I wing it?

714
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,500
You can't even help a bit,

715
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,900
and you dare to question me?

716
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:20,221
If you don't believe me,

717
00:34:20,821 --> 00:34:21,821
go find clues yourself.

718
00:34:28,741 --> 00:34:29,261
(Oh!)

719
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:30,661
(That letter.)

720
00:34:48,301 --> 00:34:49,420
(Only for Baili.)

721
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,181
(Since I emerged from seclusion,)

722
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:53,540
(chaos has erupted.
The demon cult is running rampant.)

723
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:55,060
(In my covert investigations,)

724
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:58,500
(I found that Nan Chuimeng
is also connected with the demon cult.)

725
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,741
(We can't let demon cult
get the Xiaoyao Technique.)

726
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:03,460
(You must win.)

727
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,141
(The key to the secret room)

728
00:35:05,261 --> 00:35:07,900
(is hidden in a compartment
next to the flower pot.)

729
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,900
(Just open it, and you'll find it.)
