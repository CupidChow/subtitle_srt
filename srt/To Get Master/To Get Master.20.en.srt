=Episode 20=

20
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:48,394
Miss,

21
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:50,154
what brings you here?

22
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,193
Someone sent me to deliver a letter.

23
00:01:55,353 --> 00:01:57,474
They said to give it to the shopkeeper.

24
00:01:57,954 --> 00:01:58,993
I am the shopkeeper here.

25
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:00,114
Just give it to me.

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,832
(To Li Gongye)

27
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:03,073
I...

28
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:03,573
What?

29
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:06,314
Miss, I'm afraid you delivered
the letter to the wrong place.

30
00:02:06,674 --> 00:02:07,473
The recipient

31
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:09,154
did indeed work here before.

32
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:11,273
But he has now left Chiqian City.

33
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:14,513
He's left Chiqian City?

34
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:15,953
When did that happen?

35
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:17,513
He left many years ago.

36
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,594
I'm afraid
you won't be able to find him now.

37
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:23,233
He's been gone for so many years.

38
00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:24,953
How could Gu Yuan make a mistake?

39
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:33,434
Sir.

40
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:34,673
Yes?

41
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:36,754
Where is it?

42
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:40,913
Where is it?

43
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,633
Miss, I don't quite understand.
Please be more explicit.

44
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:45,633
Where is the body?

45
00:02:45,714 --> 00:02:46,714
The body?

46
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:48,153
We don't do

47
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,353
that kind of shady business.

48
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:51,154
Miss, don't make false accusations.

49
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,593
Isn't it said that you sell bodies here?

50
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,673
Nonsense!

51
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:55,834
Don't be absurd, Miss.

52
00:02:56,073 --> 00:02:57,994
Can bodies be sold so casually?

53
00:02:58,113 --> 00:02:59,313
Alright, he's not here.

54
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:00,033
He's gone.

55
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,193
You should leave quickly.

56
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:01,774
I...

57
00:03:01,913 --> 00:03:03,393
You should go to someone else.

58
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:03,874
Sir.

59
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:04,594
Find someone else.

60
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:05,953
Hurry up and leave.

61
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,233
(Wang's Corpse Hospice)
No one is here.

62
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:11,474
Oh no.

63
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:13,193
No recipient for the letter.

64
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:15,274
And no body.

65
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:16,913
Someone obviously tried

66
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:17,993
to swindle Gu Yuan

67
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,314
by talking nonsense.

68
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:23,834
So he also has times
when he is deceived.

69
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:38,193
He got scared when seeing us

70
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:39,314
and ran away in advance.

71
00:03:42,594 --> 00:03:44,513
Gu Yuan has always been cunning.

72
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:46,314
We should stay still

73
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:48,513
in case we fall
into the demon cult's trap.

74
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:50,233
Master Zhou,

75
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,874
aren't you being too cautious?

76
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:52,754
I think you won't

77
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:54,034
dare take the challenge.

78
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:55,034
In that case,

79
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:57,673
the lands of the demon cult
will belong to my Cang Song sect.

80
00:03:58,034 --> 00:03:59,034
We have a share too.

81
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:00,834
I find this distribution improper.

82
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,034
Whoever has more people

83
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:03,353
should get more.

84
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:04,254
Right.

85
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:05,034
Master Qin,

86
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:06,673
your sect's territory is large.

87
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:07,834
Why fighting over this?

88
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:09,113
Master Qin,

89
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:10,834
if you insist on grabbing it,

90
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:12,633
it will be hard to convince the masses.

91
00:04:13,193 --> 00:04:14,193
Master Zhou,

92
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:15,073
what?

93
00:04:15,393 --> 00:04:16,393
The leader is not here.

94
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:18,673
So you want to have a showdown with me?

95
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:44,714
To what do I owe the pleasure

96
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:47,194
of your leisurely visit
to my Riyue Palace?

97
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:51,954
Truly worthy of being part
of the demon cult,

98
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:54,353
you're just full of nonsense.

99
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:55,673
Gu Yuan,

100
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:58,394
you did various misdeeds
and stole the Xiaoyao Technique.

101
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,673
Today,

102
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:01,433
you are doomed.

103
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:08,433
The Xiaoyao Technique

104
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:10,714
has always belonged to Riyue Palace.

105
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:12,474
It's not stealing.

106
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,793
If you want to kill me,

107
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:17,274
you don't need to make so many excuses.

108
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:20,154
Master Nan.

109
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:24,514
He appears to be
in a worse situation than before.

110
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:27,154
Perhaps he only learned
half of the technique.

111
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:28,594
Then he fought with you,

112
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:29,753
depleting his energy.

113
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:31,634
He may not have long to live.

114
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:34,353
If we kill him now,

115
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:37,634
it might be an undeserved victory.

116
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:40,954
Leader,

117
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,233
you are merciful,

118
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:44,753
not exploiting others' distress.

119
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:46,553
But he

120
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,993
loves to engage in petty thievery
and sneaky activities.

121
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,313
Now he disperses his followers.

122
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:53,673
I don't know what kind of bluff
he's playing.

123
00:05:54,274 --> 00:05:55,274
Earlier,

124
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:56,753
he exploited the situation

125
00:05:56,954 --> 00:05:58,273
to destroy your Jingyun Manor

126
00:05:58,353 --> 00:05:59,753
and slaughter the four great sects.

127
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,753
Against such a malicious person,

128
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:04,594
how can you show mercy?

129
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:09,074
Leader,

130
00:06:09,274 --> 00:06:10,353
to be honest,

131
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,993
before I came to see you,

132
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:14,634
I just learned

133
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:16,594
this devil

134
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:19,194
has known the whereabouts of Mr. Chu

135
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,753
and has harmed him.

136
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:24,154
Even Baili Xingchen

137
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,433
has already been brutally killed by him.

138
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:29,553
For such a thoroughly immoral scoundrel,

139
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:31,714
why show mercy to him?

140
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:48,954
Baili?

141
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,553
Baili,

142
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:12,634
you have grown up.

143
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:14,753
I am proud of you.

144
00:07:18,954 --> 00:07:20,714
Take her things

145
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:24,154
and leave in peace.

146
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:46,474
Nan Wentian, don't speak nonsense.

147
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,634
That day you framed Song'er
for Zhou Heng's murder.

148
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:51,433
But about how Zhou Heng died,

149
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:52,913
you and I both know very well.

150
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:55,154
Are you using the same trick again now?

151
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:58,673
What I said is the truth.

152
00:07:58,993 --> 00:07:59,954
If you don't believe me,

153
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:02,074
you can go and see for yourself.

154
00:08:02,553 --> 00:08:03,553
That's right.

155
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:05,553
I intend to kill Chu Wuya.

156
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:07,553
He severely injured me back then.

157
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,194
If it were not for that,

158
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:11,233
I wouldn't end up like this.

159
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:12,474
You're lying!

160
00:08:12,954 --> 00:08:14,753
You wouldn't harm Baili Xingchen.

161
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:15,913
That kid

162
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:19,753
was always in my way.

163
00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:22,074
I found him an eyesore.

164
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:23,753
So I eliminated him as well.

165
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:25,034
Gu Yuan,

166
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:25,774
you...

167
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:27,074
Chu Mengdie,

168
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:29,353
you speak of martial world codes

169
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:31,673
as if you represent all the righteous.

170
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:33,353
But your father, Chu Wuya,

171
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,993
killed my parents
and destroyed Riyue Palace back then.

172
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:37,674
Were what he did

173
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:40,233
the righteous deeds?

174
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:42,314
Listen to me.

175
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:44,873
Chu Wuya is the person
I want to kill the most.

176
00:08:45,113 --> 00:08:46,714
Even flaying him alive

177
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:49,353
wouldn't quench my hatred.

178
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:28,194
Leader,

179
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,674
why haven't you taken action yet?

180
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,033
(Steamed Buns)
Enjoy.

181
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,216
(To Li Gongye)

182
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,314
Li Gongye.

183
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:50,393
Such a strange name.

184
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:54,674
And it shares the same surname as me.

185
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:05,834
Li...

186
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:07,233
Song.

187
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:09,594
Isn't this my name?

188
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:16,834
(Song'er,)

189
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,393
(when you open this letter,)

190
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,194
(you should be on your way
back to Riyue Palace.)

191
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:24,434
(I'm sorry.)

192
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:26,594
(I lied to you.)

193
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:29,714
(And I'm also sorry
to say goodbye to you in this way.)

194
00:10:29,993 --> 00:10:31,233
(As wise as you are,)

195
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:33,434
(you must have guessed
my intention by now.)

196
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:35,033
(Your story with me)

197
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:38,074
(should end here.)

198
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:40,714
(Perhaps I didn't have time,)

199
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:43,474
(or perhaps I was reluctant.)

200
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,513
(I never told you)

201
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,074
(that I was already severely poisoned)

202
00:10:49,753 --> 00:10:51,033
(and my time is running out.)

203
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:53,193
(I thought I could be saved)

204
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:54,554
(by learning Xiaoyao Technique.)

205
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:56,513
(I never thought)

206
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:59,594
(that it'd have worsened beyond help)

207
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:01,113
(after I learned it.)

208
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,313
What does the page of the novel

209
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,674
you gave me last time mean?

210
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,753
It said that I first killed Nan Wentian

211
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,194
and then killed you.

212
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,393
You asked me to do as the letter said.

213
00:11:32,914 --> 00:11:34,353
Now that Nan Wentian is dead,

214
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:36,914
you should give me an explanation.

215
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:42,233
I thought you were a smart person,

216
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:44,194
but I didn't expect you

217
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:46,954
to have such a foolish moment too.

218
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,393
What do you mean?

219
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:51,193
I merely had

220
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:53,594
someone write a fake ending
and passed it on to you.

221
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,714
I didn't expect you to trust me so much.

222
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:57,393
But that's fine.

223
00:11:58,273 --> 00:12:00,873
I do have to thank you
for killing Nan Wentian for me.

224
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:02,873
Otherwise,

225
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:05,914
I would be against the two of you
alone right now,

226
00:12:07,113 --> 00:12:09,153
and I'd be feeling a bit overwhelmed.

227
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:11,393
You deceived me.

228
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,433
Then, what he just said...

229
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:17,513
It's all true.

230
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:20,513
Baili Xingchen
and your father, Chu Wuya,

231
00:12:21,353 --> 00:12:22,714
are both dead.

232
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:25,314
And they died tragically.

233
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:27,353
Only in this way

234
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:30,914
can I relieve the hatred in my heart.

235
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:34,033
And your father, Chu Wuya,

236
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:37,074
has now gone astray and lost his memory.

237
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:39,113
For a martial artist,

238
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:41,954
it's no different from being dead.

239
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:43,074
Gu Yuan,

240
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:45,273
why on earth is this happening?

241
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,033
What?

242
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:50,834
Are you scared?

243
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:52,633
If you're scared,

244
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:55,194
hand over the Xiaoyao Technique's
second volume,

245
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:56,474
kneel, and beg for mercy.

246
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:57,993
Maybe

247
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,993
I'll spare your life.

248
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:04,753
Shut up!

249
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:31,353
You...

250
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:33,834
You should

251
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,873
have thrust the sword long ago.

252
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:37,873
You did it on purpose.

253
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:40,674
You know I never intended to kill you.

254
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:42,753
You're now the leader
of the martial world.

255
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:46,353
What you do
no longer represents just yourself.

256
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:48,033
If you

257
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,273
kill me now

258
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:53,233
and carry my corpse out,

259
00:13:54,474 --> 00:13:56,033
you'll make a name for yourself.

260
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:00,153
I believe

261
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:03,393
you can be a good leader
of the martial world

262
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:05,794
and not let past disasters

263
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,210
happen again.

264
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,125
♪Wherever the wind blows♪

265
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:12,554
(Song'er,)

266
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:15,153
(if only I had met you earlier,)

267
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:17,513
(I'd have let go of my hatred)

268
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:19,314
(and be free now.)

269
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,633
(We will live a normal life)

270
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:24,233
(and be the happiest in this world.)

271
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:26,674
(We will have a son and a daughter.)

272
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,633
(I wonder if they)

273
00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:31,194
(will also be as quirky as you.)

274
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:34,314
(Unfortunately,)

275
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,113
(now I can only sigh,)

276
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:38,753
(for I have not been
so lucky in this life.)

277
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:40,794
(When you finish reading this,)

278
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:42,794
(I will have already left.)

279
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:45,554
(It's time to say goodbye.)

280
00:14:46,474 --> 00:14:47,753
(I can't send you far off.)

281
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:49,393
(You must take care.)

282
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:50,954
(Promise me)

283
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:52,714
(to continue to be)

284
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,554
(a happy little princess
in Zuimeng City.)

285
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:58,434
Stop!

286
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:09,914
Why did this happen?

287
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:11,633
Who can tell me

288
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:13,873
why this happened?

289
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:18,074
I thought

290
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:19,993
you'd come back tomorrow.

291
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:21,753
You liar!

292
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:23,273
Big liar!

293
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:24,594
You said...

294
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:27,794
You said you bought farmland
to take me to seclusion.

295
00:15:28,314 --> 00:15:30,513
You said you would take good care of me

296
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:32,633
and plant the backyard
full of peach blossoms,

297
00:15:32,873 --> 00:15:34,434
and we'd have children

298
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:36,113
and teach them...

299
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,434
teach them to read and write.

300
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,113
Don't die.

301
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:41,513
How dare you die?

302
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:42,353
Song'er.

303
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:43,314
Song'er.

304
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:44,474
Song'er, I...

305
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:45,714
Chu Mengdie,

306
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,434
you have been using me all along.

307
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:48,914
Leader Chu,

308
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:51,113
are you satisfied now?

309
00:15:51,794 --> 00:15:52,914
Don't blame her.

310
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:56,153
Just consider me, a great villain,

311
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,594
doing a good deed occasionally.

312
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,993
I hope it's not too late.

313
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:04,153
No, it's not true.

314
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:05,834
Let's go find a physician.

315
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:06,914
We can cure you.

316
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:08,393
We can cure you.

317
00:16:08,513 --> 00:16:10,113
We will surely cure you.

318
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:17,233
No, this is not true.

319
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,513
Let's go find a physician.

320
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:19,834
We will cure you.

321
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:20,914
Right?

322
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:25,353
Song'er, don't cry.

323
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:29,033
I didn't intend for you
to see this scene.

324
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:31,474
I remember all the mistakes you've made.

325
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:32,753
Once you're better,

326
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:35,194
let's go through them one by one.

327
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:36,433
Okay?

328
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:37,954
Wait for me.

329
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:40,873
It's too late.

330
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:45,194
Now that I can meet with you,

331
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,714
I am already content.

332
00:16:49,113 --> 00:16:50,434
No.

333
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,594
I broke my promise.

334
00:16:57,574 --> 00:16:58,074
No.

335
00:16:58,074 --> 00:16:59,513
You should go home.

336
00:17:00,873 --> 00:17:01,873
No.

337
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:03,914
No.

338
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:06,273
Let me

339
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:07,714
hug you.

340
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:18,194
Gu Yuan!

341
00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:19,914
Gu Yuan!

342
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:21,394
Gu Yuan.

343
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,033
Gu Yuan.

344
00:17:47,874 --> 00:17:48,874
No.

345
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:50,714
No.

346
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:53,073
No!

347
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:55,593
I don't want to go.

348
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:58,073
Gu Yuan.

349
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,593
Stop fighting.

350
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:46,874
Gu Yuan is dead.

351
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:48,073
Gu Yuan is dead.

352
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:10,993
Gu Yuan.

353
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,233
Gu Yuan!

354
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:17,993
Gu Yuan?

355
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:20,233
Gu Yuan?

356
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:33,714
Han Yan?

357
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:35,394
Liu Yingying?

358
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:37,634
Liu Yingying.

359
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:39,593
Han Yan.

360
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:40,674
Liu Yingying.

361
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:42,273
Where is your lord?

362
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:43,154
Where is he now?

363
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:44,313
How is he?

364
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:48,354
Your Highness,
are you looking for the Grand Princess?

365
00:19:49,593 --> 00:19:50,993
I'm talking about Gu Yuan.

366
00:19:51,513 --> 00:19:52,354
Gu Yuan.

367
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:53,993
The master of your Riyue Palace.

368
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:56,634
We were wrong.

369
00:19:56,714 --> 00:19:57,434
Your Highness.

370
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:58,714
Your Highness.

371
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,313
Your Highness, you are awake.

372
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:03,474
Did these

373
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:05,354
two new servants offend you?

374
00:20:05,513 --> 00:20:07,194
Shall I discipline them for you?

375
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:09,874
The new servants?

376
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:11,553
Yes.

377
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:13,833
This is Liu.

378
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:15,394
And this is Yan.

379
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,593
Qian.

380
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:29,993
Your Highness,

381
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:31,193
I am here.

382
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,273
You must be hungry.

383
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:33,314
I've prepared you

384
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:34,993
your favorite peach blossom cake.

385
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:46,714
So I am back?

386
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:52,553
I have returned to Zuimeng City?

387
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:53,634
Your Highness,

388
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,993
what are you talking about?

389
00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:56,793
You have always been at the mansion.

390
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:59,193
Last night, I was reading a novel

391
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:01,154
with you all night in the pavilion.

392
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,513
A novel?

393
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:06,634
Yes.

394
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:11,394
What about Gu Yuan?

395
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:13,713
Last night,

396
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:15,154
was there a man in black?

397
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,993
What man in black?

398
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:18,674
Gu Yuan is already dead.

399
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:20,354
The ending of this novel

400
00:21:20,434 --> 00:21:22,194
made me feel so sad.

401
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:24,394
The author is really excessive.

402
00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:27,114
Your Highness,

403
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:29,233
did you fall asleep later

404
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:30,354
and miss the ending?

405
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:33,313
I fell asleep?

406
00:21:38,474 --> 00:21:39,833
Was I dreaming?

407
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:49,674
Impossible.

408
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:52,354
Impossible.

409
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:54,993
Impossible.

410
00:21:57,394 --> 00:21:58,434
Impossible.

411
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:23,993
Baili!

412
00:22:24,273 --> 00:22:25,833
You came back, Baili.

413
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:27,154
You really came back.

414
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:28,634
How is Gu Yuan?

415
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:30,233
Your Highness.

416
00:22:31,914 --> 00:22:32,914
Please keep the distance.

417
00:22:33,793 --> 00:22:34,914
You called me here

418
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:35,753
for what reason?

419
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:36,993
Stop pretending.

420
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:38,154
Quickly tell me.

421
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:39,833
How is Gu Yuan?

422
00:22:40,073 --> 00:22:40,914
Before you came back,

423
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,273
did you get to see him again?

424
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:44,993
My father has already arranged

425
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,073
for me to meet Miss Lin.

426
00:22:46,154 --> 00:22:47,513
Today I am going to meet her.

427
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:50,033
Your Highness,

428
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:51,593
please forget me.

429
00:22:53,114 --> 00:22:54,114
Baili,

430
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:56,033
what are you saying?

431
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:57,833
Did you forget everything?

432
00:22:58,154 --> 00:22:59,154
Wait.

433
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:00,593
What?

434
00:23:01,954 --> 00:23:03,394
The novel Supreme Tyrant.

435
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:04,993
Nan Chuimeng.

436
00:23:05,354 --> 00:23:06,354
Your master.

437
00:23:07,714 --> 00:23:08,714
Chu Mengdie.

438
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,593
Chu Mengdie.

439
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:11,753
Your Highness,

440
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:14,394
I really don't know
about what you're saying.

441
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:15,553
How about

442
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:17,114
I leave today first?

443
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:19,914
Impossible.

444
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:21,634
Absolutely impossible.

445
00:23:22,273 --> 00:23:23,394
Quickly tell me.

446
00:23:23,914 --> 00:23:25,553
How did you come back in the end?

447
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,073
Where is Gu Yuan?

448
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:28,793
Gu Yuan was...

449
00:23:29,593 --> 00:23:31,033
He was fine in the end, wasn't he?

450
00:23:32,793 --> 00:23:33,874
Calm down.

451
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:35,753
If there is nothing else,

452
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:37,714
I'll take my leave first.

453
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:39,273
Baili Xingchen,

454
00:23:39,513 --> 00:23:41,114
how dare you go without my permission?

455
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:46,313
Your Highness,

456
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:47,954
since you just mentioned a novel,

457
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:48,833
you should

458
00:23:48,914 --> 00:23:49,954
check out the bookstalls.

459
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:53,634
Bookstalls.

460
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:57,753
You are right.

461
00:23:59,333 --> 00:23:59,833
What now?

462
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:00,673
Let's find the novel.

463
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:01,753
Wait.

464
00:24:02,394 --> 00:24:03,914
Your Highness, stop.

465
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:05,874

What do you like?

00:24:24,634 --> 00:24:25,433
Do you have

00:24:25,513 --> 00:24:26,793
a novel called Supreme Tyrant?

476
00:24:26,954 --> 00:24:27,954

and didn't realize
in the underground Riyue Palace,

495
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:20,634
a raging fire had already started.

496

to search for someone

568
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:04,593
who doesn't even exist.

569
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:08,394
And you still say
you are not overly discouraged?

570
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:11,434
No.

571
00:29:15,073 --> 00:29:16,073
Gu Yuan.

572
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:18,593
Gu Yuan.

573
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,904
(Li Mansion)

574
00:29:40,073 --> 00:29:41,513
What happened to the princess?

575
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:43,273
She went on blind dates
every day before.

576
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:44,874
Why is she suddenly getting married?

577
00:29:46,313 --> 00:29:47,434
I heard that

578
00:29:47,793 --> 00:29:49,394
it's the Grand Princess forcing her.

579
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:51,273
Who knows

580
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:52,833
what fuss might occur tonight?

581
00:29:54,154 --> 00:29:54,914
Let it happen.

582
00:29:55,033 --> 00:29:56,073
I love commotions.

583
00:29:57,434 --> 00:29:58,753
What are you two doing?

584
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:00,993
How dare you gossip about Her Highness?

585
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:02,033
Go.

586
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,233
Run ten laps, you two.

587
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:05,674
Hurry up and go.

588
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,233
Mother must think I've gone crazy.

589
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,914
She resorted to such a desperate move.

590
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,154
Wait.

591
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,313
Today is our wedding day.

592
00:30:25,513 --> 00:30:27,394
How can the bride be tied up?

593
00:30:27,954 --> 00:30:29,553
No matter what my mother told you,

594
00:30:30,114 --> 00:30:31,434
we are married now.

595
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:32,793
I've given in to my fate.

596
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:33,993
Untie me quickly.

597
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:12,033
Gu Yuan.

598
00:31:14,674 --> 00:31:17,993
I knew you would come to find me.

599
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:20,073
Your Highness,

600
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:21,394
I am Nan Muxiang.

601
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:22,753
You've been mistaken.

602
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:25,033
Impossible.

603
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:26,154
Gu Yuan,

604
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:28,714
I could never mistake you.

605
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:30,313
You are Gu Yuan.

606
00:31:30,753 --> 00:31:31,434
Your Highness,

607
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:33,033
we haven't consummated our marriage.

608
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:34,394
This is not proper.

609
00:31:40,394 --> 00:31:41,954
Have you lost your memory, Gu Yuan?

610
00:31:42,313 --> 00:31:43,954
I've always been your wife.

611
00:31:44,394 --> 00:31:45,354
Rumor has it that

612
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:46,674
you are flirtatious.

613
00:31:46,993 --> 00:31:47,993
But now it seems

614
00:31:48,154 --> 00:31:49,793
you're actually a devoted woman.

615
00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:52,194
Since you

616
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:54,313
have someone else in your heart,

617
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,513
I will not force you.

618
00:31:58,474 --> 00:32:00,474
I will go and explain
to the Grand Princess

619
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:02,273
to call off the wedding.

620
00:32:02,593 --> 00:32:03,793
No, Gu Yuan.

621
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:05,674
No.

622
00:32:06,753 --> 00:32:07,914
Mr. Nan,

623
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:10,674
I have more questions for you.

624
00:32:12,354 --> 00:32:13,354
Your Highness,

625
00:32:13,553 --> 00:32:15,233
if you want to speak with me,

626
00:32:15,954 --> 00:32:17,753
stop shedding tears for someone else.

627
00:32:18,874 --> 00:32:19,874
Okay.

628
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:22,114
I won't cry anymore.

629
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:23,874
I won't cry anymore.

630
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:26,154
Where are you from?

631
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:28,914
And why did you appear
in my bridal chamber?

632
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:30,674
Your Highness,

633
00:32:31,313 --> 00:32:31,993
I am

634
00:32:32,154 --> 00:32:33,154
from Linchuan Prefecture.

635
00:32:33,394 --> 00:32:34,553
I came here for business.

636
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:35,954
I was captured

637
00:32:36,073 --> 00:32:37,513
by the Grand Princess on the street.

638
00:32:37,993 --> 00:32:38,993
You were captured

639
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:42,354
and brought here by my mother?

640
00:32:44,914 --> 00:32:45,914
Not entirely.

641
00:32:46,874 --> 00:32:47,874
The Grand Princess

642
00:32:47,954 --> 00:32:49,114
brought me to the mansion.

643
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:51,194
She held a portrait drawn by you

644
00:32:51,674 --> 00:32:52,954
that looked exactly like me.

645
00:32:53,753 --> 00:32:54,753
The Grand Princess said

646
00:32:55,194 --> 00:32:56,194
you had hysteria,

647
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:58,753
and if I agree to marry you,

648
00:32:59,513 --> 00:33:01,313
I would be granted
lifelong riches and honor.

649
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:02,513
I am

650
00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:04,394
not someone who pursues fame and wealth.

651
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:05,193
I just thought

652
00:33:05,273 --> 00:33:06,634
it would be good

653
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:08,993
if I could save a life.

654
00:33:17,313 --> 00:33:18,593
I see.

655
00:33:20,394 --> 00:33:21,914
You are indeed not Gu Yuan.

656
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:26,154
He would never
have a temperament like yours,

657
00:33:28,793 --> 00:33:31,154
nor would he be easily taken
into my mansion.

658
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:35,954
It's still early now.

659
00:33:37,073 --> 00:33:39,194
If I were to
leave this bridal chamber now,

660
00:33:39,674 --> 00:33:41,073
I fear the whole mansion

661
00:33:41,194 --> 00:33:42,354
would be in turmoil.

662
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:45,154
If you are willing,

663
00:33:46,114 --> 00:33:46,833
I

664
00:33:46,914 --> 00:33:48,273
would very much like to hear

665
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:50,233
the story about you and Mr. Gu.

666
00:33:55,194 --> 00:33:56,273
Our story

667
00:33:57,874 --> 00:34:00,313
began when I fell from the sky

668
00:34:00,753 --> 00:34:02,114
and landed on him.

669
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:11,176
(Sequel to Supreme Tyrant)

670
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:14,073
It's so sad.

671
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:22,033
If

672
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,433
I could marry a heroine like Miss Chu,

673
00:34:25,513 --> 00:34:26,754
that would be great.

674
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,713
We could spar and practice martial arts.

675
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:32,434
It'd be truly happy.

676
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,113
Young master,

677
00:34:37,354 --> 00:34:38,633
Miss Lin is about

678
00:34:38,713 --> 00:34:39,713
to arrive soon.

679
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:48,593
So what?

680
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,754
She must be

681
00:34:51,113 --> 00:34:52,513
a vulgar woman

682
00:34:53,073 --> 00:34:55,633
and won't have
the slightest bravery of Miss Chu.

683
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:07,153
I'm afraid there won't be anyone

684
00:35:07,713 --> 00:35:09,914
who can understand
the loneliness in my heart.

685
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:13,073
Looking out at the vast evening river,

686
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:17,113
there is overwhelming parting sorrow.

687
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:18,993
Innkeeper,

688
00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:21,593
serve a pot of warm wine.

689
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:22,713
Give it

690
00:35:22,794 --> 00:35:24,434
to this gentleman for me.

691
00:35:27,314 --> 00:35:28,314
Good poem.

692
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:31,434
But you may not know

693
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:33,954
that even the warmest of wines

694
00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:35,874
cannot warm

695
00:35:37,914 --> 00:35:38,914
people's hearts.

696
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:40,834
As a man,

697
00:35:41,234 --> 00:35:42,713
one's ambitions should span horizons.

698
00:35:42,993 --> 00:35:45,193
Why trouble yourself needlessly

699
00:35:45,553 --> 00:35:47,073
over matters of love?

700
00:35:47,234 --> 00:35:49,314
I am not just troubled by love

701
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:52,673
but by the kind of loneliness

702
00:35:54,274 --> 00:35:55,274
that no one understands.

703
00:35:58,954 --> 00:36:00,673
May I ask your esteemed name?

704
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:02,713
I am

705
00:36:03,274 --> 00:36:04,274
surnamed Lin.

706
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:05,394
Mr. Lin,

707
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:07,633
nice to meet you.

708
00:36:07,713 --> 00:36:08,713
Nice to meet you.

709
00:36:16,954 --> 00:36:18,633
I'm venturing into the martial world.

710
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:19,913
Why not

711
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:20,993
join me?

712
00:36:23,874 --> 00:36:24,954
The world is perilous.

713
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:28,033
Why do you want to go?

714
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:29,794
To be honest,

715
00:36:31,593 --> 00:36:33,394
I have defeated all opponents

716
00:36:33,553 --> 00:36:36,033
and long for a greater martial world.

717
00:36:37,354 --> 00:36:38,513
My trip is for nothing else

718
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:40,234
but to seek out

719
00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:42,354
the path in my heart.

720
00:36:46,153 --> 00:36:47,153
Good.

721
00:36:49,713 --> 00:36:50,713
Mr. Lin.

722
00:36:51,193 --> 00:36:52,193
No.

723
00:36:52,434 --> 00:36:53,434
Miss Lin.

724
00:36:55,954 --> 00:36:56,954
Wait for me.

725
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,073
(Li Mansion)

726
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:06,033
The story between you and Mr. Gu

727
00:37:06,553 --> 00:37:08,314
is truly moving

728
00:37:08,553 --> 00:37:09,593
and enviable.

729
00:37:10,713 --> 00:37:12,033
I actually regret

730
00:37:12,593 --> 00:37:14,553
not having taken Gu Yuan's name.

731
00:37:15,673 --> 00:37:16,834
Otherwise, for this lifetime,

732
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:19,113
I could have won your favor.

733
00:37:26,073 --> 00:37:28,513
Thank you, Mr. Nan,
for listening to my story.

734
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:30,513
I am already married to Gu Yuan.

735
00:37:33,673 --> 00:37:34,834
I wear the wedding dress

736
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:36,633
only for him to see.

737
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:42,234
You look captivating

738
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:43,354
in this wedding dress.

739
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:44,633
Removing it

740
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,354
would be a pity.

741
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:48,474
Do you not know I am a princess?

742
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:52,234
If you act recklessly again,

743
00:37:52,713 --> 00:37:54,234
I'll dig a hole and bury you.

744
00:37:57,314 --> 00:37:58,954
Did you learn the trick

745
00:37:59,914 --> 00:38:01,553
of burying people from Gu Yuan too?

746
00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:09,234
Who exactly are you?

747
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:12,033
If you lie, don't expect to survive.

748
00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:15,274
I naturally want to live.

749
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:17,033
However,

750
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:20,633
how can I survive?

751
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:23,474
Should I be Gu Yuan or not?

752
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:25,673
Your Highness,

753
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:27,874
please enlighten me.

754
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:33,754
Since you

755
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,713
believe I am an imposter,

756
00:38:36,153 --> 00:38:37,153
then I

757
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:39,033
should not stay here.

758
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:40,354
