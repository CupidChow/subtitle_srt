=Episode 13=

20
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:40,523
Chuimeng,

21
00:01:40,922 --> 00:01:41,802
open the door.

22
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:42,922
I have something to say.

23
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,963
It's fine if you don't want to see me.

24
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:46,722
I just want to ask you

25
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:48,922
if everything you said
about liking me before

26
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:50,123
still counts.

27
00:01:53,642 --> 00:01:55,922
I am so upset.

28
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,403
How could I be Gu Yuan's insider?

29
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:01,243
I'm really the substitute

30
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,163
sent by Chu Mengdie.

31
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:05,123
I am fake,

32
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:07,603
but my love for you is real.

33
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:10,442
The door isn't closed?

34
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:14,323
Is Chuimeng alright?

35
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:16,922
Am I acting well?

36
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:22,443
Mr. Nan doesn't want to see you.

37
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:24,642
Since you chose to deceive him,

38
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:26,323
you deserve it.

39
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:29,883
Can I see him tomorrow?

40
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:33,202
Miss, please go back.

41
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:40,402
Nan Chuimeng is

42
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:42,163
really has nothing to do with her?

43
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:45,763
Or these two are just acting here?

44
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:47,962
She doesn't know what happened,

45
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:50,323
thinking you are acting.

46
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:53,202
My lord.

47
00:02:53,283 --> 00:02:54,483
Don't practice anymore,

48
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:57,003
or the poison will worsen
each time you do.

49
00:02:57,122 --> 00:02:58,522
Your life will be endangered.

50
00:02:58,883 --> 00:02:59,883
Alright.

51
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:01,723
Instead of persuading here,

52
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:03,642
you'd better keep a close eye

53
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:05,642
on Song'er.

54
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:33,723
Put it down.

55
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:35,682
No, Lin...

56
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,522
Miss Lin.

57
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:38,522
I'll do it.

58
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:39,048
No need.

59
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:41,043
I always do it myself.

60
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:47,723
I...

61
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:50,682
I...

62
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:55,483
Baili Xingchen.

63
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:08,362
Baili Xingchen.

64
00:04:09,003 --> 00:04:10,003
What exactly do you want?

65
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:11,483
And my name is Chu Mengdie.

66
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:14,883
Mengdie.

67
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,323
Look.

68
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,242
You have a heroic aura,

69
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,043
with a dagger at the waist.

70
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:24,442
So the woman in the painting

71
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:25,762
you showed me before

72
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:27,762
was you.

73
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:30,682
And you said it was a fish I saved.

74
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:34,440
I have been

75
00:04:34,882 --> 00:04:36,002
avoiding you these days,

76
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:37,523
which is truly not manly.

77
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:39,002
Returning your dagger

78
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:40,483
was the only option.

79
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:41,882
Anyway,

80
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,322
thank you for taking care
of me these days.

81
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:46,242
I heard

82
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,362
there is a rumor.

83
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:51,043
Lovers eventually...

84
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:54,762
Lovers eventually becomes...

85
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,083
What?

86
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:00,203
Siblings.

87
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:00,802
Yes,

88
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:02,322
siblings.

89
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:04,483
It must be referring to the two of us.

90
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:06,882
Since you have reassumed
your female identity,

91
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:09,362
from now on, I will be your brother.

92
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:10,843
My foot!

93
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:12,802
Greetings, Young Master.

94
00:05:16,802 --> 00:05:17,442
Young Master.

95
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:18,122
Master asks

96
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:19,523
you to the main hall.

97
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:34,283
Baili.

98
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:35,603
Come here.

99
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:43,723
A few days ago, I said,

100
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:46,122
whoever retrieves the Xiaoyao Technique

101
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:49,242
will be the future Master
of Fengyu Valley.

102
00:05:50,442 --> 00:05:51,442
Yesterday,

103
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:53,523
someone has already
handed in the manual.

104
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:55,283
He is

105
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,403
Baili Xingchen.

106
00:05:58,203 --> 00:05:59,643
I keep

107
00:06:00,002 --> 00:06:01,523
my promise.

108
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:02,723
From today,

109
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,603
he is the Young Master of Fengyu Valley.

110
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:07,523
Master, this...

111
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:15,403
Baili.

112
00:06:15,882 --> 00:06:18,083
You will be the Young Master
from now on.

113
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:19,882
I am getting old.

114
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:22,762
I'll entrust all the affairs
in the valley

115
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:24,283
to you.

116
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:24,840
I...

117
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:26,002
Of course,

118
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,322
Mr. Bai will also assist you.

119
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,083
I hope

120
00:06:32,203 --> 00:06:34,802
you will not disappoint me

121
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:38,322
in guarding the century-old foundation
of Fengyu Valley.

122
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:40,483
Master, I...

123
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,362
Do you still remember
the task I entrusted to you

124
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:45,603
yesterday?

125
00:06:58,442 --> 00:06:59,442
Chu Mengdie.

126
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:01,043
Fengyu Valley

127
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:02,403
promised Jingyun Manor

128
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:05,043
that once you marry Nan Chuimeng,

129
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,515
will teach you Xiaoyao Technique.

130
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:10,523
But you had someone impersonate you,

131
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:11,682
so,

132
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:14,562
the promise

133
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:16,362
is hereby nullified.

134
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:23,762
Are you breaking the promise?

135
00:07:26,242 --> 00:07:27,283
Miss Chu.

136
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:28,562
You heard it.

137
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:31,002
This is the decision
of our Young Master.

138
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:33,802
Just now, you said to keep your promise.

139
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:35,802
And now you are breaking it.

140
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:38,403
Are you men at all?

141
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:40,682
Chu Mengdie.

142
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:42,362
Forget Xiaoyao Technique.

143
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,083
Master

144
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:47,002
is absent due to illness,

145
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:49,163
and we will inform him.

146
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,203
Good,

147
00:07:51,882 --> 00:07:52,963
very good.

148
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,802
Congratulations to you all.

149
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:01,362
Take care.

150
00:08:35,603 --> 00:08:36,643
In such a hurry,

151
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:38,122
something happened to the manor?

152
00:08:38,843 --> 00:08:39,843
Young lady.

153
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:42,282
A few days ago,
when we were escorting a shipment,

154
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:43,762
Gu Yuan attacked us at night,

155
00:08:44,603 --> 00:08:45,843
and many disciples got injured.

156
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:47,483
Gu Yuan?

157
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:49,402
He came this time

158
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,803
for the second volume
of Xiaoyao Technique.

159
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,402
But he did not succeed,

160
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:55,042
is bound to plunder the manor again.

161
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:57,122
Now that Master is traveling,

162
00:08:57,683 --> 00:08:59,203
if you do not return,

163
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:00,328
all of us

164
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:01,843
really do not know what to do.

165
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:05,443
How dare he be so bold

166
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:08,042
to attack people of Jingyun Manor!

167
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:15,843
You three, go to the inn
and stay for the night.

168
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:18,882
We will set off at dawn tomorrow.

169
00:09:19,723 --> 00:09:20,723
Yes.

170
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,784
(Golden Goblet Restaurant)

171
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:33,203
So it is you.

172
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:36,483
Who are you looking for?

173
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,122
Your husband...

174
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:40,483
Don't mention him.

175
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:43,242
He's changed after we married.

176
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:46,522
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't have been kicked out.

177
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:48,882
Whenever I think of him now,

178
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,122
I just...

179
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,642
I just want to slap him.

180
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:53,803
I get it, calm down.

181
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:56,323
I'll give you a nice room
on the second floor.

182
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,402
Just take a rest.

183
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,162
By then,

184
00:09:58,323 --> 00:09:59,483
all your anger will be gone.

185
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,560
(No. 2 Room)

186
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:04,843
Please.

187
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:18,443
Hurry up.

188
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:20,642
Later,

189
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:23,042
my husband is about to come.

190
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:28,603
Why aren't you speaking?

191
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:36,282
It's me.

192
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:37,282
I am scared.

193
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,362
I thought it's a trap
from Fengyu Valley.

194
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,122
I know

195
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:42,282
you've really suffered

196
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:43,963
these past days.

197
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:46,963
How are you?

198
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:49,162
Song'er, did you miss me?

199
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:55,323
Not at all.

200
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:58,483
All your favorite foods.

201
00:10:58,963 --> 00:10:59,963
To satisfy your cravings.

202
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:04,843
Rice wine balls, Osmanthus cakes,
and Peach blossom cakes.

203
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:07,683
Do you know

204
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:09,443
how hard it is for me in Fengyu Valley?

205
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:11,083
I put on a show every day.

206
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:13,603
They even made me live in that hut.

207
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,083
It was in ruins.

208
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,162
I don't know how Mengdie tolerated it.

209
00:11:21,122 --> 00:11:22,122
Why lock the door?

210
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:22,683
Open the door.

211
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:23,683
What should I do?

212
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,402
Are you up to something in there?

213
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:26,402
It's nothing.

214
00:11:27,162 --> 00:11:28,162
Hurry up.

215
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:29,882
What are you up to?

216
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:36,522
Coming.

217
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:52,323
Why did you lock the door?

218
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,122
Are you feeling guilty?

219
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:56,443
None of your business.

220
00:11:57,362 --> 00:11:58,362
Xiong Jiujiu,

221
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:00,323
are you following me?

222
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:02,203
What?

223
00:12:02,443 --> 00:12:04,642
I came openly.

224
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:09,843
You live in such a nice room?

225
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:13,882
None of your business.

226
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,443
Xiong Jiujiu,

227
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:16,843
what are you doing here?

228
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:21,923
This is your stuff.

229
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,282
For the sake of Miss Chu, Master Nan

230
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:28,203
asked me to tidy it up
and bring it to you.

231
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:29,882
If I were you,

232
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:31,882
I'd find a place to bury it.

233
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,122
Are you done?

234
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,242
If you're done, get lost.

235
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:43,083
You drive me away in such a hurry.

236
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:45,723
Is there someone hiding in the room?

237
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:52,042
Xiong Jiujiu,

238
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:54,963
you broke into my room at night,

239
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,203
and even went to my bedside.

240
00:12:56,882 --> 00:12:58,443
Are you coveting my beauty?

241
00:12:58,443 --> 00:12:59,002
I...

242
00:12:59,002 --> 00:12:59,683
You...

243
00:13:00,002 --> 00:13:02,522
What are you talking about?

244
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:05,323
Someone broke in and tried to harass me!

245
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:05,896
You!

246
00:13:05,896 --> 00:13:06,762
What are you doing?

247
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:07,336
Don't...

248
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:08,443
Someone broke in...

249
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:10,882
I'll let you off today.

250
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:13,323
Don't talk nonsense.

251
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:21,803
What a coward.
How dare you to mess with me!

252
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:28,083
Be careful.

253
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:29,963
If

254
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:32,762
he comes back,

255
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:34,282
it won't be good.

256
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:00,563
Laifu.

257
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:03,563
You're becoming more and more reckless.

258
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:06,563
Sweet.

259
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:08,762
Rogue.

260
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:12,522
I just thought it over.

261
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:14,642
This is not a place to stay long.

262
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:16,242
We have to leave soon.

263
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:19,282
Okay.

264
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:20,843
You go first,

265
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:22,042
and I'll go back later.

266
00:14:22,882 --> 00:14:24,203
In case they get suspicious.

267
00:14:25,923 --> 00:14:26,923
Fine.

268
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:33,167
♪I travel afar♪

269
00:14:33,642 --> 00:14:34,642
Alright.

270
00:14:34,963 --> 00:14:35,963
Go.

271
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:38,642
I'm getting sick of it.

272
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:43,176
♪I can't get over you
and feel conflicted♪

273
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:49,192
♪I can't stop thinking about you♪

274
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:55,432
♪I have seen all the bustling world♪

275
00:14:57,843 --> 00:15:00,443
It's nice if I could take Gu Yuan
back to Zuimeng City.

276
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:03,563
Without these grudges...

277
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:11,803
That's what life should be like.

278
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:19,963
The most important thing now
is to find the protagonist first.

279
00:15:20,642 --> 00:15:22,843
I can't let the story
develop into a bad ending.

280
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,083
Han Yan,

281
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:37,522
by doing this,

282
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,083
am I being a bit selfish?

283
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:42,443
Why do you ask that?

284
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,443
What did Song'er say?

285
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:48,402
The situation is dangerous now,

286
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,122
yet I left her alone

287
00:15:52,923 --> 00:15:54,723
to deal with
the people of Fengyu Valley.

288
00:15:56,362 --> 00:15:57,362
My lord.

289
00:15:57,762 --> 00:16:00,162
I believe she will understand you.

290
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:01,443
Besides,

291
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:04,042
she is close to Chu Mengdie,

292
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,282
already an old hand.

293
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:07,963
The protagonists in the novels

294
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:10,443
all have to go through these.

295
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:11,882
Only then

296
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:13,843
can they achieve a perfect ending.

297
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:19,282
I hope so.

298
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:35,923
Mengdie,

299
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:38,362
don't blame me
for what happened yesterday.

300
00:16:39,002 --> 00:16:41,563
The rules cannot be broken.

301
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:45,002
If you don't want to teach me,
I won't force it.

302
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:47,522
I will report to my father.

303
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:50,323
He has come out of seclusion?

304
00:16:51,723 --> 00:16:53,323
What a great joyous event.

305
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:55,362
I am worried

306
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:56,923
the demon cult is on the rise,

307
00:16:57,443 --> 00:17:00,002
and the righteous sects are declining.

308
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:02,122
His return can

309
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:04,042
help eradicate

310
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:05,483
the demon cult.

311
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,042
(It seems he still fears my father.)

312
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:10,282
Mr. Nan, rest assured.

313
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,883
It's our duty
to eradicate the demon cult.

314
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:17,163
However, what I've been through
in Fengyu Valley

315
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:19,602
needs to be settled clearly.

316
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:21,963
I'll take my leave.

317
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:23,203
Don't you

318
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:24,522
wait for Chuimeng?

319
00:17:26,082 --> 00:17:27,082
No need.

320
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:28,963
I was never really his wife.

321
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:32,082
I have no option

322
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:33,963
but to break the engagement.

323
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:35,923
Farewell.

324
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:43,880
(Fengyu Valley)

325
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:00,403
Young lady.

326
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:01,602
What's wrong?

327
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:05,522
Nothing. I ate too much breakfast.

328
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:07,002
I'm going for a walk.

329
00:18:09,002 --> 00:18:10,002
Giddy up!

330
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:12,002
How similar our fates are!

331
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:14,002
We are busy and far from home.

332
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:16,443
What are you doing here?

333
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:18,483
We're a couple in name only.

334
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,923
But I should be here
to say goodbye to you, right?

335
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:27,163
Nan Chuimeng.

336
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:29,923
Don't let Song'er down.

337
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,683
You two are close,

338
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:36,042
so do not be affected because of me.

339
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:39,082
Mr. Nan,

340
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:42,483
stop dreaming.

341
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:44,883
Just say it.

342
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:46,683
What do you want?

343
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:49,363
To be honest,

344
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:52,282
Song'er asked me to come.

345
00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:55,963
Now, Song'er is having
many difficulties moving around,

346
00:18:56,522 --> 00:18:57,723
so she asked me

347
00:18:57,923 --> 00:19:00,163
to deliver a letter to you.

348
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,203
She asked you

349
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,562
to read it after you return

350
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:06,883
to Jingyun Manor.

351
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:11,443
I warn you.

352
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,242
While I am away,

353
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:15,602
take good care of her
and not let her down.

354
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:17,163
Otherwise...

355
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:19,522
Rest assured.

356
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:21,483
My love for her

357
00:19:22,002 --> 00:19:23,562
is sincere.

358
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:27,082
I hope so.

359
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:42,643
If I'm not to see Chu Mengdie off,

360
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:45,242
how could I let her steal
Nan Chuimeng's jade pendant?

361
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:46,762
But if Chu Mengdie has

362
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:48,522
the jade pendant and tricolor bracelet,

363
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:51,363
it means she can get the second volume.

364
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:53,963
The relationship between

365
00:19:54,082 --> 00:19:55,762
Jingyun Manor
and Fengyu Valley broke down.

366
00:19:56,002 --> 00:19:58,002
In order to protect the Jingyun Manor,

367
00:19:58,562 --> 00:20:00,522
if she knows
the whereabouts of second volume,

368
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,242
she'll go get it.

369
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:03,762
To lure her to do so?

370
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:05,562
What a brilliant plan.

371
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:08,242
I understand now.

372
00:20:08,522 --> 00:20:11,123
These righteous sects always
talk about benevolence and morality,

373
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:13,322
but hardly any truly adhere to them.

374
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:14,643
Prepare the horses.

375
00:20:15,002 --> 00:20:16,522
We must arrive before she takes it.

376
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:18,443
- Yes.
- Yes.

377
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:40,042
I still have

378
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:41,963
a long way to go.

379
00:20:42,723 --> 00:20:43,483
The only thing

380
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:45,203
that can accompany me is the loneliness.

381
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:47,282
Women

382
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,242
will only affect my attack speed.

383
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:03,403
Why do I feel a little sad?

384
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:06,602
Forget it.

385
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:07,683
Don't think about it.

386
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:09,082
Go practice.

387
00:21:31,602 --> 00:21:32,643
Why are you here again?

388
00:21:32,643 --> 00:21:33,923
You witch!

389
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:36,723
Last time, Nan Chuimeng protected you,

390
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:37,923
and you escaped.

391
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:39,483
Today,

392
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:42,163
I am here under the command
of Nan Feiyan

393
00:21:42,322 --> 00:21:43,403
to arrest you.

394
00:21:43,562 --> 00:21:44,163
Guards!

395
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:45,643
Tie her up.

396
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:47,842
Let's see who will save you.

397
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:48,963
Yes.

398
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:50,483
What are you doing?

399
00:21:56,242 --> 00:21:57,762
None of your business.

400
00:21:57,923 --> 00:21:58,522
I...

401
00:21:58,522 --> 00:22:00,282
Don't think you're the Young Master now,

402
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,322
and it offers you power.

403
00:22:02,842 --> 00:22:04,723
Look at you, living in this shabby hut.

404
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:06,522
Why do you

405
00:22:07,002 --> 00:22:08,562
hang around with her?

406
00:22:09,723 --> 00:22:11,683
You are really narrow-minded.

407
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:13,883
What's wrong with this hut?

408
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:15,242
Is it inferior?

409
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:17,602
In the past,

410
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:19,403
I also had

411
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,802
a luxurious life.

412
00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:23,483
At that time,

413
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:25,322
I thought that there was

414
00:22:25,443 --> 00:22:26,443
a hierarchy among people.

415
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:27,762
But now, I don't think so.

416
00:22:28,082 --> 00:22:30,123
What distinguishes people is not wealth,

417
00:22:30,762 --> 00:22:31,762
but inner qualities.

418
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:33,123
One has a good character,

419
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:35,643
so what with him
living in a humble house?

420
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:38,522
What's wrong with this hut?

421
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,923
Maybe Baili will become a great hero.

422
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:43,883
Don't underestimate him.

423
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:51,723
As the Young Master,

424
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:53,723
I ask you to leave now.

425
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:55,163
If you refuse,

426
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:56,802
then you violate the rules.

427
00:23:00,842 --> 00:23:01,842
Senior,

428
00:23:01,842 --> 00:23:03,322
I think it's going to rain.

429
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,602
So what?

430
00:23:06,363 --> 00:23:06,888
So...

431
00:23:07,322 --> 00:23:09,842
Let's go collect the clothes,
go, go, go!

432
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:15,042
Miss Li.

433
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:16,643
What you just said was good.

434
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:19,042
I'm flattered.

435
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,123
I'm just so talented.

436
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:25,123
Oh.

437
00:23:27,403 --> 00:23:28,403
You helped me.

438
00:23:29,082 --> 00:23:30,282
I'll treat you to a footbath.

439
00:23:38,522 --> 00:23:39,522
Miss Li.

440
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:42,403
I had a foot bath with Lin...

441
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:45,802
With Miss Chu.

442
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,762
Wait.

443
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:54,643
What's that on the sole of your foot?

444
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:57,002
This?

445
00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:59,042
It's my birthmark. I was born with it.

446
00:24:03,203 --> 00:24:04,443
Swallowtail mark?

447
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:10,163
I've finally found you.

448
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:18,282
(Purple Aura Rises)

449
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:19,602
What a surprise.

450
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,322
The silly boy has become
the Young Master.

451
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:26,602
You should understand

452
00:24:27,203 --> 00:24:29,403
why I let him become the Young Master.

453
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,683
Just pawns.

454
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,723
You and I

455
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:38,123
are also pawns.

456
00:24:41,123 --> 00:24:42,123
Forgive me.

457
00:24:43,002 --> 00:24:45,963
You exude the demeanor
of a chess master.

458
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:48,683
I am willing
to go through fire and water

459
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:50,562
for you.

460
00:24:52,963 --> 00:24:54,883
You understand me the best.

461
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:56,762
Remember,

462
00:24:57,282 --> 00:24:59,443
to accomplish great things,
do whatever you should.

463
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,363
The world is treacherous.

464
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,002
You and I

465
00:25:03,443 --> 00:25:04,923
have to yield.

466
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:14,443
I understand that.

467
00:25:17,602 --> 00:25:19,002
But as I'm getting old,

468
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:22,723
I would think of the past.

469
00:25:23,963 --> 00:25:24,963
These past few days,

470
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:28,123
I've often thought of Heng.

471
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,522
It's all destined.

472
00:25:33,002 --> 00:25:34,242
Just a sacrificial pawn.

473
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:36,282
Don't be too sentimental.

474
00:25:44,123 --> 00:25:45,123
Baili.

475
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:46,184
We have to leave.

476
00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:47,363
Leave?

477
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:48,744
Where?

478
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:50,728
Leave Fengyu Valley.

479
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:52,602
You saw it.

480
00:25:52,723 --> 00:25:54,282
You are the Young Master now.

481
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:56,403
But have they ever truly respected you?

482
00:25:58,403 --> 00:25:59,403
In fact,

483
00:25:59,762 --> 00:26:00,802
this is not surprising.

484
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:02,123
After all,

485
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,602
I am handsome,

486
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:04,802
talented,

487
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:05,736
and hardworking.

488
00:26:06,082 --> 00:26:06,923
They look down on me

489
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:08,002
because I have obtained

490
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:09,963
what they could never achieve.

491
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,242
That is

492
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:12,562
a noble soul.

493
00:26:13,602 --> 00:26:14,602
Fool.

494
00:26:15,203 --> 00:26:17,683
He is really not Baili Xingchen
from Zuimeng City.

495
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:20,602
Baili.

496
00:26:21,322 --> 00:26:23,123
Ask yourself,

497
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:25,963
do you believe what you said yourself?

498
00:26:27,802 --> 00:26:28,802
No.

499
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:32,483
It's normal for them to look down on me.

500
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:35,242
After all, I am just a nobody
and not standing out.

501
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,163
I'm lucky to get

502
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:37,683
the first volume of Xiaoyao Technique.

503
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:39,802
You're not just lucky,

504
00:26:40,403 --> 00:26:41,723
but someone set you up.

505
00:26:42,163 --> 00:26:42,762
What?

506
00:26:43,163 --> 00:26:44,923
The conflicts in the Fengyu Valley,

507
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,443
and the dangers of schemes,

508
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:48,683
far exceed mere martial combat.

509
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:50,643
So I have decided

510
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:53,042
to take you out
for experience in advance.

511
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:56,363
I will be the best supporter for you
to become the Master.

512
00:26:57,363 --> 00:26:59,163
But you don't know any martial arts.

513
00:26:59,883 --> 00:27:01,322
Why would I go with you?

514
00:27:01,522 --> 00:27:02,842
I don't know martial arts,

515
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:05,483
but I have spent time with your master,

516
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:07,282
and I'm a friend of Miss Chu,

517
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:08,963
so naturally, I understand it.

518
00:27:09,242 --> 00:27:11,483
Moreover, I am skilled
in undercover work.

519
00:27:12,842 --> 00:27:13,443
How about it?

520
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:14,802
We join forces,

521
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:16,963
and we'll surely achieve great things.

522
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:18,082
Makes sense.

523
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:21,762
Let's

524
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:22,883
seal the deal.

525
00:27:25,842 --> 00:27:26,472
However,

526
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:28,002
I have two conditions.

527
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:31,002
Please.

528
00:27:32,363 --> 00:27:34,163
After I help you become the Master,

529
00:27:34,723 --> 00:27:36,242
you must remember

530
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:39,802
your master's kindness to you.

531
00:27:40,683 --> 00:27:41,883
No matter what he does,

532
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:43,522
you must not become his enemy,

533
00:27:44,322 --> 00:27:46,282
nor do anything to harm him.

534
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:48,443
Swear it now.

535
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:50,923
(In this way,)

536
00:27:51,282 --> 00:27:53,042
(if he becomes
the leader of martial world,)

537
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:55,723
(the battle between
Gu Yuan and martial world)

538
00:27:56,483 --> 00:27:57,562
(can be avoided then.)

539
00:27:57,683 --> 00:27:58,923
I swear,

540
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:00,483
in this life,

541
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:02,443
I will never harm my master,

542
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:04,363
no matter what he does.

543
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:05,562
If I violate,

544
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:06,842
may I be dead.

545
00:28:08,762 --> 00:28:09,762
What about

546
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:11,082
the second one?

547
00:28:36,002 --> 00:28:37,002
Young Master.

548
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:41,562
Why are you here?

549
00:28:43,242 --> 00:28:45,163
It's too dangerous for you. Come in.

550
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:47,483
(Gathering of Scholars)

551
00:28:47,483 --> 00:28:48,483
Please leave.

552
00:28:48,842 --> 00:28:50,522
We have cut ties.

553
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:53,002
Stop acting.

554
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:54,723
It's not dangerous now,

555
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:58,242
because I am now the wife
of Young Master.

556
00:28:58,923 --> 00:28:59,923
Baili.

557
00:29:03,762 --> 00:29:04,762
Master.
