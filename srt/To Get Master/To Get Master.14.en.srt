=Episode 14=

20
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:39,304
A great man has great responsibilities.

21
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:42,280
Although you seem a bit weak now,

22
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:43,915
throughout history,

23
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,435
the protagonists in novels

24
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:46,876
always suffer first

25
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:47,956
and then have adventures.

26
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:48,876
They suffer again

27
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:49,956
and then have adventures.

28
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:50,995
They suffer again.

29
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:52,795
In short,

30
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:54,435
after it happens again and again,

31
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:55,676
you'll become stronger

32
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:57,275
and ultimately achieve great success,

33
00:01:57,355 --> 00:01:58,596
becoming the protagonist.

34
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:00,956
Why are you still so happy?

35
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,036
Yesterday, in front of my master,

36
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:04,516
when you said you were my wife,

37
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:06,995
he seemed like he wanted to kill me.

38
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:09,876
Think about the bigger picture.

39
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:11,795
You're acting so coy.

40
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:15,156
A great man never
cares about small things.

41
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:18,596
You have good looks,

42
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,395
but your style

43
00:02:22,596 --> 00:02:23,276
needs to change.

44
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:25,355
In the martial world,
it's all about fists.

45
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:26,515
Fists mean justice.

46
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:28,915
You make me dress so pretentiously.

47
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:31,476
People will see me as a handsome guy,
with no skills.

48
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:33,195
Well, you are indeed.

49
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:34,876
Are you insulting me?

50
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,075
Madam?

51
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,235
Why are you here?

52
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:50,996
Master.

53
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:54,195
Baili is

54
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:55,144
young and impetuous

55
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:56,395
and lacks experience.

56
00:02:57,195 --> 00:02:58,355
Considering you are

57
00:02:58,756 --> 00:02:59,955
on a dangerous journey,

58
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:01,915
I will go with the two of you

59
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:03,115
and protect you two.

60
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:06,556
I don't think
you want to protect him and me.

61
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:09,996
You only want to keep me safe, right?

62
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:13,795
You are Baili's wife.

63
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:14,955
Please watch your manners.

64
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:17,235
Protecting Baili

65
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:19,036
is my only purpose.

66
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:21,915
Of course, I want to protect you too.

67
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:28,436
I'll go back in the carriage.
If someone follows me in...

68
00:03:29,235 --> 00:03:29,864
Alright,

69
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,515
I am willing to follow you.

70
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:33,640
However,

71
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:35,795
may I ask

72
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:36,836
where your carriage is?

73
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:38,556
It's right over there.

74
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:43,596
Baili Xingchen is an ungrateful traitor.

75
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:46,556
My horse is also missing.

76
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:48,635
In that case,

77
00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:50,075
it seems there's no other choice.

78
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:53,195
Please.

79
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:10,276
(Golden Goblet Restaurant)

80
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:12,195
Why haven't they arrived yet?

81
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:13,395
What took them so long?

82
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,556
You still remember
he's your master, huh?

83
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:19,195
Of course.

84
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:20,235
Do you remember

85
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:22,156
that Li Song'er is your master's wife?

86
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:24,076
Of course.

87
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:25,315
So,

88
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:26,956
do you know what will happen to you

89
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:29,875
if you covet your master's wife?

90
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,076
If you don't want

91
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:35,476
to be reviled and disgusted
by the martial world,

92
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:37,555
you'd better behave yourself.

93
00:04:44,596 --> 00:04:45,596
Master.

94
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,636
Baili Xingchen, you ran away quite fast,

95
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:52,235
leaving me behind like this.

96
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:53,435
Don't forget your mission.

97
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:55,396
Remember, you and I are a team.

98
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:56,596
Follow me.

99
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:57,716
Baili Xingchen.

100
00:04:58,184 --> 00:04:59,716
You want to learn martial arts, right?

101
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:01,435
Come with me to the room.

102
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:02,875
Will you teach me?

103
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:03,944
Let's go.

104
00:05:04,232 --> 00:05:04,995
(In the novel,)

105
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:06,915
(Baili Xingchen will kill Gu Yuan.)

106
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:08,795
(I must brainwash him first.)

107
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:11,396
You can learn from him,
but I need to talk to you.

108
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:12,196
Come with me.

109
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:12,795
Master.

110
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:13,675
I'm sorry about this.

111
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:14,755
Get in.

112
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:15,995
Hurry up.

113
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:21,396
Alright.

114
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:23,596
There's no need to act anymore
outside the valley.

115
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:25,704
In front of those outsiders,

116
00:05:25,704 --> 00:05:26,760
I'm your wife.

117
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:28,115
But in private,

118
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:29,636
I am still your master's wife.

119
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:30,915
Come on.

120
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:32,555
Can you

121
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:34,396
stop damaging my relationship
with my master?

122
00:05:34,555 --> 00:05:36,596
My master finally agreed
to teach me martial arts.

123
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,755
Martial arts can be learned at any time,

124
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:40,755
but there's something very important.

125
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:43,336
During the training outside the valley,
your priority

126
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:45,196
is to spread your fame far and wide

127
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:47,036
and promote your identity.

128
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:48,956
Promote

129
00:05:49,036 --> 00:05:50,115
my identity?

130
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:50,984
I plan to use

131
00:05:51,156 --> 00:05:53,156
your identity
as the Young Master of Fengyu Valley

132
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:54,476
to establish a reputation.

133
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:55,156
However,

134
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:56,315
it's done not by force,

135
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:57,636
but by your talent.

136
00:05:58,836 --> 00:05:59,836
By my talent?

137
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:01,355
What does it mean?

138
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:02,836
It means

139
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:04,555
judging people by their appearance

140
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:05,675
and wining with virtue.

141
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:07,115
Wherever you go,

142
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:08,716
you show up in a stylish way

143
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,516
and do good deeds to earn a good name.

144
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:13,396
Very soon,
you'll make a name for yourself

145
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:14,675
and become famous

146
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:16,915
and formidable in the world.

147
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:19,156
But I think the true hero doesn't

148
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:20,396
need a bubble reputation.

149
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:21,875
With my strength,

150
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,115
after some practice,

151
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:25,755
I can convince

152
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:26,836
the entire martial world.

153
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:29,915
A true hero is not
about the level of martial arts,

154
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:31,875
but about virtue.

155
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:33,636
Surpassing others in martial arts

156
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,396
is only a momentary thrill.

157
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:36,995
In Zuimeng City,

158
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:39,596
there is a person called Hero Feng.

159
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:40,956
He did not know

160
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:42,196
martial arts,

161
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,755
but he was dedicated to doing good deeds

162
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,156
and

163
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,176
he never killed people.

164
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:48,995
Therefore,

165
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,476
after his death,

166
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:52,355
many people miss him

167
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,315
and call him a hero.

168
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:55,875
He's been praised for generations.

169
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:57,276
So, think about it.

170
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:58,716
Do you want to be a good person

171
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:00,196
with a clear conscience,

172
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:01,596
or do you want

173
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,476
to fight and kill every day?

174
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:04,875
Good point.

175
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:06,476
However,

176
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:09,036
I'm not good at martial arts.

177
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:10,315
Even if I see injustice,

178
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:11,875
I can't help.

179
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:12,675
So,

180
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:14,675
you have to learn from Nan Chuimeng.

181
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:16,235
However,

182
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:17,636
after you learn martial arts,

183
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:18,875
be sure not to kill people.

184
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:19,716
Remember,

185
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:20,915
killing your master

186
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:22,036
is a great sin.

187
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,555
If you do that, you'll die sonless,

188
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:26,596
and future generations
will despise you forever.

189
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,115
Don't worry.

190
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:29,555
After I learn martial arts,

191
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:31,560
let alone people,
I won't even kill a rabbit.

192
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:33,636
(Luckily, he is easy to manipulate.)

193
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,076
(If he does good deeds)

194
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:36,235
(and respects his master)

195
00:07:36,235 --> 00:07:37,235
(and I find a way)

196
00:07:37,315 --> 00:07:39,196
(to let him bolster the bond
with his master,)

197
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:40,584
(I guess the ending)

198
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:41,795
(in the novel won't happen.)

199
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:43,476
Open it.

200
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:45,755
Tianshui Town is located

201
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:46,755
at a strategic point

202
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:47,915
with good public transport

203
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:49,716
and rapid spread of information.

204
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:51,716
Throughout the Chiqian City,

205
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:53,448
Tianshui Town has

206
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:54,555
the largest population.

207
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:55,688
And our first step is

208
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:58,076
to use the people's admiration
for chivalrous deeds

209
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:00,036
and spread your good name here

210
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:01,235
to make you

211
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:03,476
into a rising star

212
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:04,355
in the world.

213
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:06,156
(Hero Yindie)
Hero Yindie.

214
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:08,555
It's to let everyone know about you.

215
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:09,875
Then our second step

216
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:11,115
will be done naturally.

217
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,848
By then,

218
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:13,396
all national weapon shops

219
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:14,836
will flock in.

220
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:15,795
Then,

221
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,516
in the shortest time possible, we will

222
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:18,555
make you famous

223
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,036
throughout Chiqian City.

224
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:21,675
The final step is

225
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:23,636
to join the martial arts game.

226
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:24,596
By then,

227
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:26,435
with your fame as Hero Yindie,

228
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:27,516
you'll show up

229
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:28,315
in a stylish way,

230
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:29,196
and shock the world.

231
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:30,555
You'll be a top martial arts

232
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:31,795
expert in Chiqian City.

233
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,196
This is called

234
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:34,315
the Fame Plan.

235
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:35,396
Good.

236
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:39,275
Madam.

237
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:40,676
You are amazing.

238
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,515
How should we proceed?

239
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,635
The step of obtaining the manual

240
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:46,956
is crucial.

241
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,716
Will you go to Jingyun Manor to get
the second volume of the manual

242
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:53,035
and leave

243
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,476
Li Song'er and Baili Xingchen

244
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:55,716
here?

245
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:57,916
According to the plan,

246
00:08:58,076 --> 00:08:59,115
we must act this way.

247
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:00,316
Yes.

248
00:09:01,196 --> 00:09:02,196
Oh no, my lord.

249
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:04,436
Li Song'er and Baili are
in the same room now.

250
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,056
(Premier Room No. 2)
Given my observations,

251
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:12,956
I realize
love comes first in Zuimeng City

252
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:15,155
and strong people get a say
in Chiqian City.

253
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,836
Yet, all women have one common trait,

254
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:20,476
that is, a passion for beauty.

255
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:23,155
Shouldn't I focus on training

256
00:09:23,436 --> 00:09:25,196
to perform martial arts perfectly

257
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:26,076
and precisely?

258
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:27,240
That's just one thing.

259
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:29,836
As long as you maintain your demeanor

260
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:31,115
while doing good deeds...

261
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:31,875
My lord.

262
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:33,436
Should we teach Baili a lesson?

263
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:34,755
No need.

264
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:36,796
Song'er is a simple girl.

265
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:38,316
But I don't know

266
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:39,916
what she's up to.

267
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:44,316
If she really likes that kind of man,

268
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:47,635
I have a way to try.

269
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:50,076
Miss.

270
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:52,355
Why are you killing yourself?

271
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:55,916
You need not to be shy.

272
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:57,076
I am here

273
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,196
to help you out.

274
00:09:58,635 --> 00:10:00,796
I'm the renowned Young Master
of Fengyu Valley.

275
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:02,956
If you're in trouble,

276
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,796
you can ask me for help.

277
00:10:05,316 --> 00:10:05,836
Go away!

278
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,556
I hate men who flirt with ladies.

279
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:08,115
I...

280
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:10,635
There are many other good men.

281
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:12,275
Why must you

282
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:13,836
be dead set on fancying a man?

283
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:14,755
Master.

284
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:15,635
Sir.

285
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:16,716
What is your name?

286
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:19,400
Hero Chuimeng.

287
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:21,115
Hero Chuimeng.

288
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:31,515
Don't be afraid.

289
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:32,875
Come with me

290
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:34,115
to the grove

291
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:36,155
for a while.

292
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:37,476
Stay away.

293
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,875
Help!

294
00:10:40,076 --> 00:10:41,076
Stop!

295
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:45,676
Let go of that...

296
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:49,796
Let go of the lady.

297
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:08,616
(Self-Defense Skills by Hero Chuimeng)

298
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,995
Hero Chuimeng.

299
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:14,716
(Hero Chuimeng, a rising star)
Hero Chuimeng

300
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,000
(in the martial world)
encountered a group of bandits.

301
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:21,235
And those bandits are physically strong

302
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,995
and extremely vicious.

303
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:24,755
But Hero Chuimeng

304
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:27,355
showed no fear.

305
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:29,836
He fiercely fought

306
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,316
with fists and kicks.

307
00:11:32,556 --> 00:11:33,995
With little effort,

308
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:37,956
he beat the bandits up

309
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:40,115
and defeated them.

310
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:41,796
- Good.
- Good.

311
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:44,275
Sir.

312
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:46,995
I hear there's a rising star

313
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:48,155
called Hero Yindie.

314
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:51,436
He is much better than Hero Chuimeng.

315
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,916
Why don't you tell us his story?

316
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:56,716
Hero Yindie?

317
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,076
Who is he?

318
00:11:58,235 --> 00:11:59,676
I've never heard of him.

319
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:01,676
Come and have a look.

320
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:03,635
Here is the portrait of Hero Chuimeng.

321
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:05,596
Ten coins per piece.
First come, first served.

322
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:07,515
First come, first served.

323
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:11,035
Alright.

324
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:13,355
Remember to pay.

325
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:17,275
What do you mean by this?

326
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:23,912
(Hero Chuimeng, Martial Arts Master,
Rising Star in the Martial World)

327
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:27,275
The results are good.

328
00:12:28,836 --> 00:12:30,436
I'm not here to discuss this with you.

329
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:32,755
We are a family after all.

330
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,515
Why do you always undermine me?

331
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:36,515
Family?

332
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:40,035
Do you really consider me family?

333
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:41,755
I used to.

334
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:42,956
Not sure about it now.

335
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,316
I think so too.

336
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:47,316
Watch your attitude.

337
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:48,875
If you don't explain it clearly,

338
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,875
I won't forgive you.

339
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:50,716
Well...

340
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:51,716
Start at the beginning.

341
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:52,836
First,

342
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:54,916
I saw you working together
with Baili Xingchen.

343
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:56,196
So, I had

344
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,995
to get the upper hand first.

345
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:00,755
And then?

346
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:01,836
Second,

347
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:03,235
I was practicing in advance

348
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:05,995
to see if your Fame Plan would work.

349
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:07,796
What's the third reason?

350
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,035
Can't you see it yet?

351
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:10,836
You defend Baili Xingchen

352
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:12,635
and hang out with him every day.

353
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:16,515
It makes me jealous.

354
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:22,956
I'm the one questioning you.

355
00:13:24,155 --> 00:13:25,956
Why are you talking about me?

356
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:33,035
To be honest with you,

357
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:34,676
I did it all

358
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,836
to make you understand my intentions.

359
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:38,676
No matter what you need,

360
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:40,436
I'll be there for you,

361
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:41,515
but he won't.

362
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:44,995
You misunderstood.

363
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:47,355
I did all this for you.

364
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:48,755
For me?

365
00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:51,115
So, you try

366
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:52,596
to make Baili Xingchen famous

367
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:53,836
for the sake of me?

368
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:58,755
Even though you may not believe it now,

369
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:00,995
I'm telling you the truth.

370
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:02,196
In any case,

371
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:04,875
don't ruin my plans again.

372
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:08,836
If I don't ruin your plans,

373
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,076
will you reward me?

374
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:13,196
Stop it.

375
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:16,035
What's wrong?

376
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:20,035
You villain.

377
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:21,956
You've even learned to feint.

378
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:23,355
Don't move.

379
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:25,355
Give me a hug.

380
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,616
(Golden Goblet Restaurant)

381
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:46,792
(Jingyun Manor)

382
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:56,755
Young lady.

383
00:14:58,515 --> 00:14:59,596
Young lady has returned.

384
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:00,875
Are you okay?

385
00:15:00,956 --> 00:15:02,916
Young lady, please help us.

386
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:04,916
Young lady.

387
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:05,995
Young lady.

388
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:08,676
What's wrong?

389
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,395
Young lady, you have to have our back.

390
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:12,916
Right.

391
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:31,515
Madam.

392
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:33,275
You make me dressed flamboyantly.

393
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,395
Where are we going?

394
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:36,716
If the plan had gone smoothly,

395
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,235
all the weapon shops in the city

396
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:39,476
would have come to us.

397
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:42,395
Sadly, Nan Chuimeng

398
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:43,956
messed up my plan.

399
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:46,235
Right now,

400
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,596
we're going to visit them.

401
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,316
But don't worry.

402
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,875
I'm quite good

403
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:54,235
at promotion too.

404
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:56,196
So, when will I be

405
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:57,836
able to learn martial arts
with my master?

406
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:01,196
As long as you obediently listen to me,

407
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:02,875
I can pull strings for you.

408
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:04,436
Don't worry.

409
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:13,956
What can I do for you?

410
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:17,556
Why are you here again?

411
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,196
You came with a new husband this time.

412
00:16:22,235 --> 00:16:23,716
He's not my husband.

413
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,716
He's the rising star in Chiqian City.

414
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:27,624
Look,

415
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:29,155
how about you

416
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:30,956
use his good looks to promote your shop?

417
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:51,515
Sir,

418
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:53,875
I promise you.

419
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:56,395
As long as you give us an opportunity,

420
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:02,196
your weapon shop

421
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:04,755
will definitely become popular
across the city.

422
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:10,728
(IOU from Baili Xingchen)

423
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:15,555
Get out of here!

424
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:26,235
Madam.

425
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:29,156
Why don't we just give up?

426
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:32,755
Don't be so discouraged.

427
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:35,476
Many people

428
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:36,636
seem ordinary,

429
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,275
but they are knowledgeable

430
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,795
and respected.

431
00:17:41,035 --> 00:17:42,315
I don't read much.

432
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:43,515
Even so,

433
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:44,916
if you are a good person

434
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:46,356
and do many good deeds,

435
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:48,356
you will still be respected.

436
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:50,116
Moreover,

437
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:52,995
whether your appearance
or inner qualities

438
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:54,636
are both excellent.

439
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:57,196
It's just

440
00:17:57,396 --> 00:17:59,235
that they haven't discovered it yet.

441
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:02,156
What should I do

442
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:03,995
so they can see my goodness?

443
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:17,035
Master, you have it.

444
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:19,356
Why have you come?

445
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:21,235
Are you here again to stop us?

446
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,240
I'm here

447
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:24,755
not to stop you,

448
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:27,116
but to join you.

449
00:18:29,156 --> 00:18:30,436
Gentlemen, don't move.

450
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:41,356
Try another one.

451
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:46,676
Gentlemen.

452
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:48,235
It's done. Take a look.

453
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:54,116
Song'er.

454
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,795
Is it okay?

455
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,636
How is it?

456
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:00,515
It's alright.

457
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:02,315
You'll make him popular.

458
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,476
With the popularity of Hero Chuimeng,

459
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:05,835
I believe that very soon,

460
00:19:05,956 --> 00:19:07,436
we will make Baili Xingchen popular.

461
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:09,035
Then I will

462
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:10,636
forgive you.

463
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:12,035
And we will be even.

464
00:19:13,676 --> 00:19:15,075
As long as you need me,

465
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:16,835
I'll always be here for you.

466
00:19:19,396 --> 00:19:20,476
Baili Xingchen.

467
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:21,876
Come with me.

468
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,035
I need to talk to you.

469
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:35,156
Here I am!

470
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:38,035
What kind of person

471
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:39,476
Li Song'er is?

472
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:42,515
She

473
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:44,835
is lazy and spoiled.

474
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,248
She has no martial arts skills.

475
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,396
Why do you say so?

476
00:19:49,992 --> 00:19:50,595
She gets up

477
00:19:50,676 --> 00:19:52,716
quite late every day.

478
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:53,716
After waking up,

479
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,956
she needs to have
freshly baked exquisite pastries

480
00:19:56,116 --> 00:19:57,275
and never practices.

481
00:19:57,676 --> 00:19:59,156
She takes a bath every day.

482
00:19:59,275 --> 00:19:59,995
When bathing,

483
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:01,956
she needs freshly bloomed flowers.

484
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:03,116
That is extravagant.

485
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:04,916
I am so good to you.

486
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:07,555
Yet you're bad-mouthing me
behind my back.

487
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:09,515
In that case,

488
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:12,035
why are you following her?

489
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,396
It's because she's a good person.

490
00:20:16,196 --> 00:20:17,916
I met her by chance,

491
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:19,835
but she wholeheartedly helped me.

492
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:21,956
Though she faces setbacks,
she never gives up.

493
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:23,636
She is responsible, smart,

494
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:24,876
and righteous.

495
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:26,676
If she's skilled in martial arts,

496
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:28,315
she will be a perfect match with you.

497
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:29,515
However...

498
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,595
Alright.

499
00:20:32,116 --> 00:20:33,196
Song'er has been raised

500
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:35,795
in a life of luxury since childhood.

501
00:20:36,075 --> 00:20:37,075
Frankly,

502
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:39,315
she is out of my league.

503
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:41,396
It's said a brief time

504
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:43,315
as a couple creates lasting bonds.

505
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:46,716
Song'er and I have been married
for over a month.

506
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:49,075
I'm very lucky

507
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:52,116
to marry such a good wife like her.

508
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:56,156
If she wants,

509
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,156
I'll spend my life protecting her.

510
00:20:58,995 --> 00:21:00,235
I will never let her down.

511
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:03,075
I admire you very much.

512
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,835
You're actually a perfect husband.

513
00:21:06,152 --> 00:21:06,755
Master.

514
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:08,196
To be honest,

515
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:09,476
since I saw your move

516
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,035
as agile as a swallow,

517
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:12,515
I've made up my mind

518
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:13,956
to become your apprentice.

519
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,835
Although you have always refused me,

520
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,876
I never give up.

521
00:21:18,196 --> 00:21:19,235
I believe

522
00:21:19,356 --> 00:21:20,995
that I can move you one day.

523
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:22,835
Alright,

524
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:24,995
I agree now.

525
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:27,636
What are you waiting for?

526
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:28,956
Listen up.

527
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:30,156
Starting today,

528
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:31,755
I take you as my disciple.

529
00:21:33,636 --> 00:21:34,636
Master.

530
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:36,356
I will kowtow to you.

531
00:21:37,515 --> 00:21:38,196
I was joking.

532
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:39,515
Master.

533
00:21:41,595 --> 00:21:42,676
Great!

534
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,396
He finally did it.

535
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:46,795
It seems

536
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:49,835
that the Fame Plan I made for you

537
00:21:50,595 --> 00:21:52,555
is almost done.

538
00:21:54,956 --> 00:21:55,956
It's been a while.

539
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:57,916
Stop it.

540
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,116
She told you to stop.

541
00:22:02,235 --> 00:22:03,876
Didn't you hear it?

542
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:07,636
Look at what you've done.

543
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,555
(Compensation)
Well... What is this?

544
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:10,676
Compensation.

545
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:12,755
Did you break the arm of innkeeper

546
00:22:12,835 --> 00:22:13,835
of Tianshui Inn?

547
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:15,555
He deserved it.

548
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:16,795
I saw with my own eyes

549
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:18,356
that he gave a beggar leftovers

550
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:19,515
without a piece of meat.

551
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:21,436
It's so outrageous.

552
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:23,156
The innkeeper of Tianshui Inn

553
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:24,916
is such a good person.

554
00:22:25,315 --> 00:22:26,315
You may not know.

555
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,995
The beggar outside his inn

556
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:29,515
goes vegan that day,

557
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:31,436
so the innkeeper prepared vegan tofu.

558
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:33,356
And what did you do?

559
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:35,116
You broke his arm.

560
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:37,116
How about this?

561
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:40,235
I will send you to Jingyun Manor

562
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:43,396
and let Miss Chu train you properly.

563
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:44,555
No.

564
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:45,795
Madam.

565
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:46,476
Please sit.

566
00:22:46,676 --> 00:22:47,676
Please sit.

567
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:53,035
I promise
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

568
00:22:53,315 --> 00:22:56,555
I accidentally did something foolish
with good intentions

569
00:22:56,995 --> 00:22:57,795
I thought

570
00:22:57,956 --> 00:22:59,275
everything could be done

571
00:22:59,356 --> 00:23:00,676
by force.

572
00:23:02,835 --> 00:23:04,196
You only think of using force.

573
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:06,716
Be proficient in intellect
and martial arts.

574
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:08,876
Try to be tough but tender.

575
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:10,795
I don't get it.

576
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:13,035
Being tough but tender means...

577
00:23:13,196 --> 00:23:14,196
Two guests.

578
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,075
May I ask if you will continue to stay?

579
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:17,156
I saw

580
00:23:17,156 --> 00:23:18,995
the three people who came with you

581
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:20,116
have already left.

582
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:22,235
