=Episode 15=

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,920
Please.

21
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:41,964
Miss.

22
00:01:42,123 --> 00:01:43,283
When that gentleman left,

23
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:44,324
he left you a letter.

24
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:51,404
(Song'er.)

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,120
(I've learned the first volume
of the Xiaoyao Technique,)

26
00:01:54,283 --> 00:01:55,524
(so, our deal is finalized.)

27
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:57,363
(My disciple, Baili,)

28
00:01:57,604 --> 00:01:59,604
(will send you home.)

29
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:02,244
(I have something to do,
so I have to leave.)

30
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:04,283
(It's time to say goodbye.)

31
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:06,003
(Take care.)

32
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,003
(Gu Yuan.)

33
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:15,563
Madam.

34
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:16,684
What did my master say?

35
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:21,684
Why is there not a single word?

36
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,043
No worries.

37
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:28,404
Where did my master go?

38
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,804
Didn't he mention when he would return?

39
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:35,364
He might not be back.

40
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:36,883
Impossible.

41
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:38,764
I don't believe he won't be back.

42
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,563
How do you know?

43
00:02:48,204 --> 00:02:49,204
How much

44
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:51,563
do we know about him?

45
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:56,404
Master.

46
00:02:56,603 --> 00:02:57,644
Master, please spare me.

47
00:02:58,043 --> 00:02:58,568
Did...

48
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:00,644
Did I do something wrong?

49
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:03,003
Please forgive me.

50
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:05,764
Since I have taken you as my disciple,

51
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:06,964
today,

52
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:09,163
I will teach you.

53
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:11,204
Thank you.

54
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,924
Actually, teaching you martial arts

55
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,484
is not just for you.

56
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:18,804
I understand.

57
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:21,283
People in the martial world
need opponents.

58
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:23,283
In case you don't have opponents
in the future,

59
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:25,163
you want to make me your opponent.

60
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:26,684
You are overthinking it.

61
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,484
I want you to promise me.

62
00:03:31,204 --> 00:03:32,563
No matter what happens,

63
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:34,404
you must protect Li Song'er.

64
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:36,443
You must stay by her side.

65
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:38,283
Do not leave her alone

66
00:03:38,723 --> 00:03:40,043
in a dangerous place.

67
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:41,484
Master, I promise.

68
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:42,843
Madam's life is my life.

69
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:47,323
I mean,

70
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,723
she is your wife

71
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:51,524
and Mengdie's best friend,

72
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:54,043
so I will definitely protect her.

73
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,603
He can go wherever he likes.

74
00:03:58,804 --> 00:03:59,804
It's none of my business.

75
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:03,484
Madam.

76
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:05,323
Don't overthink this.

77
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:09,003
My master must have his own reasons.

78
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:10,924
For some reason, he had to leave.

79
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,283
Don't be too sad.

80
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:19,723
Do I look sad?

81
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:21,444
No.

82
00:04:21,723 --> 00:04:22,723
Then that's it.

83
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:25,004
I'm never sad

84
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:26,444
for any man.

85
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,764
When I was six,

86
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:31,843
my father left home.

87
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:33,404
So far, he's been missing.

88
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:35,324
Have I ever seemed sad?

89
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:38,283
I don't know about that.

90
00:04:40,324 --> 00:04:41,324
Anyway,

91
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:43,324
I'm not sad.

92
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:46,444
Men are like centipede legs.

93
00:04:47,363 --> 00:04:48,363
Lose one, grow another.

94
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:50,444
Let him go if he wants.

95
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:53,124
I have my own plans to carry out.

96
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:55,644
No wonder my master likes you.

97
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,004
You're unconstrained.

98
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,764
Have you packed up the things as I said?

99
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:02,084
No.

100
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:04,043
Do you want to be the best?

101
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:04,803
Yes, I do.

102
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:05,884
As Nan Chuimeng has left,

103
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:07,163
will you give up your dream?

104
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:08,404
No.

105
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:11,004
You're packing up your bag
slower than peeling an egg.

106
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:12,923
You want to be the best?

107
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:14,884
You want to be the slowest!

108
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:16,043
Madam, don't be angry.

109
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:17,043
I'll go and pack up.

110
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:18,124
Hurry up.

111
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:19,564
After you're done,

112
00:05:19,964 --> 00:05:21,163
we need to make a new plan.

113
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:23,764
What plan?

114
00:05:23,764 --> 00:05:24,803
Black jade.

115
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,283
Black rice congee.

116
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:27,964
Ginseng and seaweed.

117
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:29,564
Black-boned chicken feet.

118
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:30,564
Finish these dishes,

119
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:31,923
and you will

120
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:33,324
become a cold hero

121
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:35,084
immediately.

122
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:37,243
A cold hero

123
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:38,683
should be extremely aloof,

124
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:39,923
barely talk,

125
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,243
and show no emotions.

126
00:05:42,363 --> 00:05:43,603
I see.

127
00:05:44,683 --> 00:05:45,483
The pistachios

128
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:46,843
shouldn't be here.

129
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:48,404
I remember my master likes them.

130
00:05:51,204 --> 00:05:52,204
Well,

131
00:05:52,324 --> 00:05:53,683
it's called a hint of sweetness.

132
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:55,363
It helps

133
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,163
develop your contrasting charm.

134
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:08,803
(I just ordered pistachios)

135
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:10,884
(sort of subconsciously.)

136
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:16,283
Madam.

137
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:18,204
Are you missing my master?

138
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,723
If you are, go find him.

139
00:06:22,803 --> 00:06:23,803
Go find him?

140
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:27,084
Which is harder to find,
three-legged frogs

141
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:28,324
or men?

142
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:30,923
Men!

143
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:32,644
Stop.

144
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:36,163
I have my own plans.

145
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:40,424
(Jingyun Manor)

146
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:49,843
Young lady.

147
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:51,603
There's trouble here.

148
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:52,764
After you returned,

149
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:54,043
all major sects suddenly

150
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:55,283
wrote letters to us

151
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:57,644
one after another,

152
00:06:58,124 --> 00:06:59,124
saying that they wanted

153
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:00,803
to send people to protect us

154
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:02,524
and resist the demon cult.

155
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:05,363
I'm afraid someone already knows

156
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,803
that my father is away

157
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:09,723
and wants to take advantage.

158
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:11,524
Jingshu.

159
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,764
You take some men

160
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:15,524
to create traces of my father's presence
near the manor

161
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:16,884
to buy time.

162
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:18,843
Yes.

163
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,324
(Blessings in store)

164
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:26,324
My lord.

165
00:07:28,644 --> 00:07:29,644
I have already inquired.

166
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:31,564
Chu Wuya is not in the manor.

167
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,243
Everyone in the manor

168
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:35,764
thinks

169
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,923
you wiped out Jingyun Manor.

170
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:40,444
Some of the men

171
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:42,024
are either dead

172
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:43,283
or injured.

173
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:44,524
It's a complete mess.

174
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:49,483
The evildoer threw dirt
at the Riyue Palace.

175
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:51,363
It seems

176
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:52,923
this person was the one

177
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:54,843
who impersonated me to seize the manual

178
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,363
in Fengyu Valley.

179
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:58,124
This person is shameless.

180
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,524
Many people will

181
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:02,524
blame it on us.

182
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:04,004
Now,

183
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:05,683
Jingyun Manor is leaderless.

184
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,524
I wonder what Chu Mengdie

185
00:08:07,764 --> 00:08:08,803
will do.

186
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:11,444
She has two keys in her hand.

187
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,324
And her manor is already damaged.

188
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:15,324
To ensure safety,

189
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:16,843
she will take back

190
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:19,363
the second volume
of the Xiaoyao Technique.

191
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:21,683
If so,

192
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,004
we may as well wait here.

193
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:26,004
Once Chu Mengdie

194
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:27,243
retrieves the manual,

195
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:28,444
we will snatch it back.

196
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:10,443
(All these years,)

197
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,484
(where did you go?)

198
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,004
Father.

199
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:21,283
Today, I have no choice

200
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:23,844
but to disobey your orders.

201
00:09:49,244 --> 00:09:50,244
(Die.)

202
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:52,163
(Letter)
(When you see this letter,)

203
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,484
(you must have grown up.)

204
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:56,803
(20 years ago,)

205
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:59,364
(the five major sects
and I split this book equally,)

206
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:02,644
(thinking the martial world
would be peaceful.)

207
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:03,683
(However,)

208
00:10:03,683 --> 00:10:05,923
(something went wrong.)

209
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:09,163
(Those around were implicated
because of this book.)

210
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:11,604
(I have taken this book away,)

211
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,683
(hoping to reduce some killings.)

212
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:15,484
(Die.)

213
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:16,443
(You must remember)

214
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,683
(there is no shortcut
in martial arts training.)

215
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,163
(Keep your original heart)

216
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:23,043
(and train diligently.
That's the real path.)

217
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:28,200
(Guyue Inn)

218
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:40,724
Sir.

219
00:10:42,004 --> 00:10:44,323
Are you Hero Yindie?

220
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:48,884
Sure.

221
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:52,283
Is Hero Yindie already so famous

222
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:54,283
in the martial world?

223
00:10:54,283 --> 00:10:55,563
Of course.

224
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,163
To my surprise,

225
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:59,083
Hero Yindie came to my inn.

226
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:02,364
Are you going to eat or stay here?

227
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:04,604
We'll stay here.

228
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:06,004
Alright.

229
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:09,404
May I ask you about someone?

230
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:12,283
Well,

231
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:14,604
it's a matter of privacy...

232
00:11:15,604 --> 00:11:16,884
I'll tell you everything I know.

233
00:11:19,163 --> 00:11:20,963
Is there a man with the family name Nan

234
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:22,484
who stayed here before?

235
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:24,244
Let me check for you.

236
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:27,764
Is Hero Yindie here?

237
00:11:28,323 --> 00:11:30,004
I'm barely out,

238
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,004
(Scent travels far)
but I've heard a lot about Hero Yindie.

239
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:36,244
May I invite you upstairs for a chat?

240
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:39,644
See?

241
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:41,724
My promotion of you has worked wonders.

242
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:43,963
Hurry up.

243
00:11:57,244 --> 00:11:58,364
Hero Yindie is here.

244
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,484
Please, have a seat.

245
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:07,724
Who's that?

246
00:12:08,203 --> 00:12:09,203
Heroine.

247
00:12:29,604 --> 00:12:30,604
Madam.

248
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:31,963
How did you think of this?

249
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,163
It's so creepy.

250
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:34,844
Is it creepy?

251
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,443
I think it's pretty good.

252
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:38,283
It's so warm to be buried in the soil.

253
00:12:39,688 --> 00:12:40,683
(I finally know)

254
00:12:40,764 --> 00:12:42,472
(how it feels to watch someone buried.)

255
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:44,404
(No wonder the villain likes it.)

256
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:47,443
Help!

257
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:50,644
(Come on, Li Song'er.)

258
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:52,203
(Stop thinking of him.)

259
00:12:55,203 --> 00:12:56,203
Stop it!

260
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,484
You fickle woman!

261
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:00,323
If you want to kill me, just do it.

262
00:13:00,644 --> 00:13:02,043
Please don't hurt Ge Yang.

263
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:03,484
Madam.

264
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:04,244
What can we do?

265
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:05,563
Question them first.

266
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:11,004
You two pretending
to be a couple is okay.

267
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:12,963
Why did you just insult me?

268
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:14,364
We have no enmity

269
00:13:14,484 --> 00:13:15,484
with you.

270
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:18,443
Why did you attack us just now?

271
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:20,283
Exactly.

272
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:21,884
Li Song'er.

273
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:23,764
Do you remember Hero Chuimeng,

274
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,803
the man who likes you in Fengyu Valley?

275
00:13:30,484 --> 00:13:31,043
Go on.

276
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:33,043
Do you know him?

277
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:34,963
During a pursuit,

278
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,404
Ge Yang and I almost met our end.

279
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:40,323
Without the help of Hero Chuimeng,

280
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,244
we would have long been dead.

281
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:45,032
That's why we can't see anyone

282
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:46,844
treat love like dirt.

283
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:50,124
Since you've married Hero Chuimeng,

284
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:52,484
leaving him like this is just wrong.

285
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:53,524
Today,

286
00:13:53,803 --> 00:13:54,803
though I am buried,

287
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:56,524
I must fight for him.

288
00:13:57,644 --> 00:13:59,203
When did I leave him?

289
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:02,283
He left without saying goodbye.

290
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,443
Considering you are a woman,

291
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:06,644
let me tell you the story

292
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:08,803
about me and Ge Yang.

293
00:14:10,604 --> 00:14:12,524
I was a disciple of the Feiyu Pavilion.

294
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:13,768
The Feiyu Pavilion

295
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:16,484
- is a renowned dual cultivation sect.
- The Feiyu Pavilion?

296
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,083
People also call it Matchmaker Pavilion.

297
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:21,524
Once the disciples reach adulthood,

298
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:22,923
they're united through marriage

299
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,203
to promote the techniques
of the Feiyu Pavilion.

300
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:27,923
When I reach adulthood,

301
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:30,124
my leader should appoint a partner
for me.

302
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:31,923
But one day,

303
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:34,443
I left the sect and met Ge Yang.

304
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:37,803
Although Ge Yang is a notorious robber,

305
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:39,484
he robs the rich to help the poor.

306
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:40,484
Thus,

307
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:42,043
I ran away with him.

308
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:45,963
You eloped with him
regardless of your life.

309
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:49,283
Aren't you afraid he might cheat on you?

310
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:50,923
But,

311
00:14:51,443 --> 00:14:54,004
who can guarantee that true feelings

312
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:55,844
will last forever?

313
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:57,683
Love itself is a difficult matter.

314
00:14:58,203 --> 00:14:59,404
To have and experience

315
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:00,884
a moment of true love

316
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,163
is enough.

317
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:09,524
- Are you okay?
- Ge Yang.

318
00:15:10,604 --> 00:15:12,203
Why are you crying?

319
00:15:13,724 --> 00:15:14,884
I'm touched.

320
00:15:15,563 --> 00:15:16,764
This is love.

321
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:18,484
It's the same with me and Chu...?

322
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:20,803
What are you trying to say?

323
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,163
I mean you and my master.

324
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:27,963
I don't believe Hero Chuimeng

325
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:29,884
will abandon his beloved woman.

326
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:32,203
He must have some reasons.

327
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:34,043
I trust him.

328
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:36,963
As his wife,
why don't you believe in him?

329
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:47,604
Ge Yang.

330
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:48,884
We are saved.

331
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:53,000
(Guyue Inn)

332
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:58,644
Can true love overcome everything?

333
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:02,203
If that's the case,

334
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:04,604
the villain shouldn't have left.

335
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,404
Could it be

336
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:14,043
that he is

337
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:16,244
also conflicted?

338
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:20,323
(I trust him.)

339
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:23,244
(As his wife,
why don't you believe in him?)

340
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:27,803
Yes.

341
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,683
If I don't try, I'll feel regret.

342
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,244
I indeed have never tried.

343
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:40,844
Maybe the villain left

344
00:16:41,443 --> 00:16:43,604
to protect me.

345
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:46,323
That's right.

346
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:48,004
How did I not think of this?

347
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:52,083
He wants to retrieve the second volume
of the Xiaoyao Technique.

348
00:16:52,163 --> 00:16:53,524
It is perilous.

349
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:55,244
He must be worried about me.

350
00:16:57,124 --> 00:16:59,083
He feared that I might be a hindrance.

351
00:17:01,443 --> 00:17:02,443
You fool.

352
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:04,724
How many times have my wits helped you?

353
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,484
Yet, you actually doubt my ability.

354
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:12,683
That's not right.

355
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:18,324
Everyone has witnessed my intelligence,

356
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:21,044
so, he shouldn't fear I'm trouble.

357
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:30,124
We pretended to be a couple
in the valley.

358
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:36,003
Baili Xingchen has appeared,

359
00:17:37,044 --> 00:17:38,723
so he keeps pretending
in front of Baili?

360
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:48,604
After pretending for a while,

361
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:52,324
it's hard to tell which part is real,

362
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:54,804
and which part is fake.

363
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:27,483
Father,

364
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:30,723
do you know that the Jingyun Manor is

365
00:18:31,604 --> 00:18:33,923
in a crisis right now?

366
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:37,763
If I can't
learn the manual's second volume,

367
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:42,044
how can I rely on my own strength

368
00:18:43,003 --> 00:18:44,804
to protect the manor?

369
00:18:58,523 --> 00:18:59,523
My lord.

370
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,324
What happened?

371
00:19:07,003 --> 00:19:08,243
Is Song'er in trouble?

372
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:10,723
I just got news from an inn

373
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:12,683
that she and a couple

374
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,364
argued and fought.

375
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:16,923
After the search in the mountains,

376
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:18,124
she's...

377
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:20,483
She's been severely injured.

378
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:21,644
And...

379
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:23,243
And she was buried alive.

380
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:24,963
Those people are too vicious.

381
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:34,312
(The grave of my wife, Zuo Xiao)

382
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,243
Mother.

383
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:43,284
(The grave of my wife, Zuo Xiao,
erected by Chu Wuya)

384
00:19:43,284 --> 00:19:44,884
When I was sad,

385
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:47,404
you always comforted me.

386
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:49,963
Now,

387
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:51,644
I want to tell you something

388
00:19:51,763 --> 00:19:53,003
from the heart.

389
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:57,084
Since my father left,

390
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:00,163
the manor has become more desolate.

391
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:03,284
I often think about

392
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:06,284
if I am too unfilial and incapable,

393
00:20:07,443 --> 00:20:09,683
so I failed to prosper the manor

394
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:12,963
and protect the home you fought

395
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:14,324
to build.

396
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:19,404
I stole the jade pendant
from the Nan family,

397
00:20:21,683 --> 00:20:22,804
but in the end,

398
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:27,364
I still could not find the manual.

399
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:32,963
Now the manor is about to be trampled.

400
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:36,003
I shall live and die with it.

401
00:20:40,243 --> 00:20:41,243
Mother.

402
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:44,644
I can't fulfill the agreement

403
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:47,723
my father made with the Nan family.

404
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:52,844
I already have someone I like.

405
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:55,443
It's a simple man.

406
00:20:57,844 --> 00:20:59,884
(Yet he is more earnest than anyone)

407
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:01,804
(I have ever met.)

408
00:21:04,324 --> 00:21:05,324
(I have to learn)

409
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:07,804
(the Xiaoyao Technique.)

410
00:21:12,723 --> 00:21:14,404
I won't ask for your forgiveness,

411
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:17,604
but I hope

412
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,364
that you will guide me.

413
00:21:32,764 --> 00:21:33,768
(Xiaoyao Technique)

414
00:21:49,404 --> 00:21:50,404
Mengdie.

415
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:52,044
What are you doing here?

416
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:55,284
Mengdie.

417
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,723
You might fool me,

418
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:01,963
but can you fool the whole world?

419
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:05,923
I am worried
that Jingyun Manor is in a crisis

420
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,163
and shorthanded,

421
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:09,564
so I brought my men to help.

422
00:22:10,443 --> 00:22:11,844
Unexpectedly,

423
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:12,884
you

424
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:14,884
ignore the rules of the martial world

425
00:22:15,163 --> 00:22:16,443
and learn Xiaoyao Technique.

426
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:18,644
You made a mistake.

427
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:19,884
A foolish mistake.

428
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,284
I just took out the Xiaoyao Technique.

429
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:30,564
Out of curiosity,
I turned several pages.

430
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:32,564
I never intend to learn it.

431
00:22:33,404 --> 00:22:34,644
Chuimeng gave me the key

432
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:36,564
to find out the person

433
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,440
who's been trying to seize the manual.

434
00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:41,763
Mr. Nan.

435
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:43,324
You're here so quickly.

436
00:22:44,203 --> 00:22:45,203
Did you already

437
00:22:45,723 --> 00:22:48,284
secretly read the first volume?

438
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:52,963
You are kidding.

439
00:22:53,243 --> 00:22:55,324
I'd never

440
00:22:55,404 --> 00:22:57,564
violate the principles
of the martial world.

441
00:22:58,523 --> 00:23:00,443
As the demon cult does evil,

442
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:03,163
you should see the bigger picture

443
00:23:03,523 --> 00:23:06,003
and work with me

444
00:23:06,203 --> 00:23:07,723
to wipe out the demon cult.

445
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:09,324
So, are you forcing me

446
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:11,683
to hand over the manual?

447
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:15,483
You got the wrong idea.

448
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:17,084
The Xiaoyao Technique

449
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:20,284
is co-guarded by both our sects.

450
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:22,044
It is not a private possession.

451
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:23,163
Now,

452
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:25,443
I've handed over the first volume.

453
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:27,604
You won't disregard the reputation

454
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:30,604
of Jingyun Manor for a manual, right?

455
00:23:30,884 --> 00:23:32,404
How can you guarantee

456
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,884
that you will not lose the manual again

457
00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:36,324
in your place?

458
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:38,884
In my opinion,

459
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,683
it's better to find the spy
within the righteous sects

460
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:43,763
before handing over the manual.

461
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:47,243
Indeed, I made a mistake last time.

462
00:23:47,923 --> 00:23:48,923
However,

463
00:23:49,124 --> 00:23:50,404
if I am present,

464
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:51,923
Gu Yuan

465
00:23:52,324 --> 00:23:54,163
might not succeed again.

466
00:23:56,044 --> 00:23:57,044
I came here

467
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:58,324
this time

468
00:23:58,404 --> 00:23:59,963
to select talents

469
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:01,483
from the Martial Arts Game.

470
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:03,284
The winner

471
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,723
will learn Xiaoyao Technique,

472
00:24:04,923 --> 00:24:06,203
be the leader of martial world,

473
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:07,844
and lead us to fight

474
00:24:08,203 --> 00:24:09,364
against the demon cult.

475
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,483
Is that true?

476
00:24:13,443 --> 00:24:15,763
I've been in the martial world
for decades.

477
00:24:16,844 --> 00:24:18,564
Fengyu Valley has prospered

478
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,124
to this day

479
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:21,763
because it's reliable.

480
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:49,523
Master, you finally...

481
00:24:49,963 --> 00:24:51,163
How did I tell you?

482
00:24:51,483 --> 00:24:53,284
No matter what happens,
you must protect her.

483
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:54,644
Why?

484
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:55,963
Why did it happen?

485
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:57,523
Wait, listen to my explanation.

486
00:24:57,723 --> 00:24:58,723
It is not as you think.

487
00:24:58,884 --> 00:25:00,084
Explain what?

488
00:25:00,604 --> 00:25:01,604
It already happened.

489
00:25:01,763 --> 00:25:02,884
What's the point?

490
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:04,763
No, Master.

491
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:14,923
Indeed,

492
00:25:18,003 --> 00:25:19,443
it's all my fault.

493
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:22,243
I failed to protect you.

494
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:27,163
I'm sorry.

495
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:40,084
Villain,

496
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:54,523
what's wrong?

497
00:25:54,604 --> 00:25:56,564
Did you think you're seeing a ghost

498
00:25:57,044 --> 00:25:58,044
and get scared?

499
00:26:37,644 --> 00:26:38,963
We didn't expect we would fall

500
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:40,564
into the trap we set up ourselves.

501
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:43,844
You're still joking around?

502
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,324
Baili Xingchen is a fool.

503
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,163
I asked him to set up a trap

504
00:26:49,364 --> 00:26:50,364
and mark it.

505
00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:52,104
(Trap mark)
But we trapped ourselves.

506
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:55,163
So,

507
00:26:55,443 --> 00:26:56,923
he was marking it just now?

508
00:26:56,923 --> 00:26:58,404
If not, I wouldn't have seen you cry.

509
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:03,963
What exactly happened to you?

510
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:06,884
Actually, nothing serious happened.

511
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:09,644
Gu Yuan,

512
00:27:10,644 --> 00:27:12,044
we are husband and wife, right?

513
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:15,644
If the wedding in Fengyu Valley counts.

514
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:20,923
Are you kidding?

515
00:27:21,763 --> 00:27:22,963
Of course, it counts.

516
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,683
So,

517
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:27,523
you shouldn't be mistaken
about me and Baili

518
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:30,163
or leave without telling me.

519
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:33,604
In love,

520
00:27:34,163 --> 00:27:35,163
besides trust,

521
00:27:35,564 --> 00:27:37,203
there is another very important thing.

522
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:40,443
It is honesty.

523
00:27:45,124 --> 00:27:46,364
I hope

524
00:27:47,523 --> 00:27:50,163
we'll be honest with each other.

525
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:52,044
You must not lie to me.

526
00:27:53,443 --> 00:27:54,923
I will not lie to you either.

527
00:28:04,124 --> 00:28:05,124
I promise you.
