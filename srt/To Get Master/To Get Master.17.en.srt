21
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:52,021
Don't worry.

22
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,780
Perhaps

23
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:56,661
I was really wrong.

24
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,060
I'll try again.

25
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,980
This...

26
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,220
Why stand there?

27
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:18,180
The key has been taken out.

28
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,021
That one might be a decoy.

29
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:24,421
The real key

30
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:27,261
is here.

31
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:30,981
How did you know?

32
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:35,180
You seem like a fool,

33
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,060
but you're wise in your own way.

34
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,021
The guy I've got my eye on
is absolutely fine.

35
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:50,421
Idiot, why don't you budge?

36
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:52,301
The third drum has sounded.

37
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:54,820
(Exit)

38
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,860
What to do?

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,421
Time is up.

40
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:58,981
I've always been the best

41
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,660
at everything I've done.

42
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,060
It's fine if I don't
get a place this time.

43
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,220
But what about your Xiaoyao Technique?

44
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,500
Don't rush.

45
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,741
Every lock has a key.

46
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,421
Since that one didn't work,

47
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,180
we'll find

48
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,701
the right one.

49
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Song'er, stop!

50
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,300
Song'er,

51
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,380
stop.

52
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,301
Let me think it over.

53
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,180
There must be another way.

54
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,821
See?

55
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,301
You guys can be
way too confident sometimes.

56
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:37,821
I...

57
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:39,620
Are we breaking the rules?

58
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,340
Breaking rules?

59
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,021
How so?

60
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,660
What rules?

61
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,541
If it's not mentioned in the rules,
then it's not breaking them.

62
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,100
It's...

63
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:50,900
(Exit)
Heroes, time's up.

64
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,940
Stay longer, you lose.

65
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:55,141
We unlocked it!

66
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,821
Let's go to the next round.

67
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,301
See?

68
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:05,261
I told you I'm your lucky charm.

69
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:07,021
Am I impressive?

70
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,180
Yes.

71
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,660
More than that.

72
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:12,821
You're amazing.

73
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,421
No offense,

74
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,981
but you martial artists
are too rigid in your thinking.

75
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:19,261
You lack flexibility.

76
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:22,181
However, the lock in Fengyu Valley

77
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,501
is pretty shoddy.

78
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,420
We could've just smashed it open

79
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,941
instead of overthinking.

80
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,300
What are you staring at?

81
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:48,461
Why so solemn?

82
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,061
Nothing.

83
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,701
Just tired from the questions.

84
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,261
Let's go.

85
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:57,261
The first round is over.

86
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,181
Nan Chuimeng and Li Song'er,

87
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,100
Young Master and Chu Mengdie,

88
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,340
Cang Hai and Cang Song sects
have triumphed.

89
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,980
The others are eliminated.

90
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,340
Congrats to everyone

91
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:09,381
who passed the first round.

92
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,021
Round two is about character.

93
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,780
It tests if you've got the integrity

94
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:18,740
to be

95
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,340
the leader of martial world.

96
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:25,261
Four questions in the box,

97
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,980
with eight papers.

98
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:30,141
Same question
means you're up against each other.

99
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:34,061
Right answer means you advance.

100
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,660
In the previous round,

101
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,220
the team of Baili Xingchen
and Chu Mengdie

102
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:41,420
took the least time.

103
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,340
So, Baili Xingchen

104
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,181
gets to draw first this time.

105
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:13,480
(To help or not)

106
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:16,616
(To help or not)

107
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:28,181
We'll start

108
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,141
when the incense is done burning.

109
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:33,461
Feel free to prepare yourselves.

110
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:35,740
The theme of this round is

111
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:38,540
secret recommendation.

112
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,860
Two heroes, listen up.

113
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:50,420
The question is, "Where's the door?"

114
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,941
(Where is the door?)
You've got half the incense's time

115
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,701
to locate the door in the question.

116
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,701
The first one to find it is the winner.

117
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,941
It's an easy one.

118
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,501
The question asks where the door is.

119
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,621
The answer is the question.

120
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:09,340
The door is right here.

121
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:17,941
Young Master,

122
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:19,821
it's your turn.

123
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,860
The door is over there.

124
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:34,381
- Good.
- Good.

125
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:36,780
As expected of the Young Master.

126
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,780
You're truly brilliant.

127
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:42,300
Mr. Baili, you are talented.

128
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:43,660
Master Nan

129
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,061
hasn't misjudged you.

130
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:45,780
I'm

131
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,660
(Pass)
passing you.

132
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
- So do we.
- So do we.

133
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,941
I yield. I'm outmatched.

134
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,660
Get up.

135
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:55,780
Wait.

136
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:56,860
The right answer

137
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,860
is the door in the question.

138
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:00,701
My answer is wrong.

139
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,860
Really?

140
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,941
With just this one door in the room,

141
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,660
your answer is correct.

142
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:10,461
Right.

143
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
Yes.

144
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,941
Has the valley

145
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:14,381
already picked me as the winner?

146
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:16,780
Your cheating is blatant.

147
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:20,261
Although

148
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:21,941
you are the Young Master,

149
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:24,021
we have to follow
the exam rules strictly.

150
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:25,941
Strictly.

151
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:27,021
Strictly.

152
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,020
(To help or not)
(Drawing teammates is one thing.)

153
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,140
(Drawing opponents together is another!)

154
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,461
(Gu Yuan and I
have such a bizarre connection.)

155
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:57,461
The question you've drawn
is "To help or not."

156
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:58,140
You each

157
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,980
have half the incense's time to answer.

158
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,980
Right answer means you advance.

159
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,260
Two heroes, listen up.

160
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,461
In desolate woods,

161
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:09,901
a bandit and a woman

162
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,220
come face to face.

163
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,461
The question is,

164
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,220
should you help the woman?

165
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:15,821
I'd help for sure.

166
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,421
A hero helps people in trouble.

167
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:20,701
And she's so cute.

168
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,461
If I were the leader of martial world,

169
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:25,581
I'd help everyone.

170
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,581
This question

171
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,461
is too straightforward.

172
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,620
Mr. Nan, it's your turn.

173
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:51,020
(What is he looking at?)

174
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,301
(Half the time's up.)

175
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,740
My answer is

176
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
not to help.

177
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,740
You should help

178
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:04,860
when you see injustice.

179
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,701
But this woman, she seems fragile.

180
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,701
Yet her three right fingers
have thick calluses.

181
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:15,100
She's a hidden weapon expert.

182
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,661
The bandit looks tough,

183
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,461
but his skin is fair and smooth.

184
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,140
He's too tender

185
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,100
to do any real rough work.

186
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:27,740
And the knife he's holding

187
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,421
is blunt.

188
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:31,661
How can a dull knife kill?

189
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,061
So, in conclusion,

190
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,581
it's not the woman who needs help.

191
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:39,260
It's the bandit.

192
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:41,576
(Pass)

193
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:59,020
You are so fair-minded.

194
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,541
You're letting the junior

195
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,061
fairly competes
for the Xiaoyao Technique.

196
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,461
I truly admire you.

197
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:07,901
In my opinion,

198
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:09,340
this Houlang Conference

199
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,941
is all a big time-waster.

200
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,821
Master Nan,

201
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,421
the Xiaoyao Technique
is meant for you to practice.

202
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,821
It's so powerful

203
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,941
that others might go astray if they try.

204
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,941
Besides, among these younger ones,
many are just arrogant.

205
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:27,260
They haven't mastered the skill yet,

206
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,020
but they're already getting cocky.

207
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,941
She's already getting cocky.

208
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,860
I respect Chu Wuya
as a true hero of the martial world.

209
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,701
But his daughter is so arrogant.

210
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:39,380
I went to invite her to the banquet.

211
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:40,781
Just forget her absence.

212
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,461
But she didn't even say anything.

213
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,901
No matter how good her skills are,

214
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:47,421
she won't gain people's favor
with this behavior.

215
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:48,701
Master Nan,

216
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,421
I think you should practice
the Xiaoyao Technique.

217
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:55,181
The conference has two purposes.

218
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:56,621
First,

219
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:59,701
to expose the remnants of the demon cult
and eliminate potential threats.

220
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,941
Second,

221
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,181
to consider the future
of the entire martial world.

222
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
The martial world

223
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:09,220
will ultimately be handed over
to the younger generation.

224
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,661
I'm getting old.

225
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:14,901
Please.

226
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:17,941
When it comes to choosing,

227
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,100
I still prefer Baili.

228
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:24,661
He might look a bit simple,

229
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,740
but he's dedicated to martial arts.

230
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,620
He just hasn't completed
his training yet.

231
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:32,781
Master Zhou,

232
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:34,781
in tomorrow's last martial competition,

233
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:39,181
it should be your disciple Lu Renjia

234
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,901
facing Xingchen.

235
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,421
And then...

236
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:45,740
Master Nan, rest assured.

237
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,140
My disciple

238
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,020
won't vie with Young Master
for the manual.

239
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Tomorrow,

240
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:53,020
I'll make sure
you won't be disappointed.

241
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,541
You truly understand the bigger picture.

242
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:02,980
I have no other choice.

243
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,461
Nowadays, the younger generation
is all about ambition.

244
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:10,020
Nobody cares
about the peace of the Jianghu.

245
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,220
They think that mastering martial arts
means ruling the world.

246
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,061
Baili Xingchen

247
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:19,701
is truly a rare soul with a pure heart.

248
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,020
You've been in this world for so long,

249
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,701
but you still keep it simple.

250
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,220
That's something I really admire.

251
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:29,980
Here, Master Nan,
I propose a toast to you.

252
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:31,661
- Come on.
- Come on.

253
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,100
Young Master!

254
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Come on.

255
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:41,701
Young Master.

256
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Put things down here.

257
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,781
Put them here.

258
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,420
Young Master,

259
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,181
I think that given your position now,

260
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:51,620
this...

261
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,220
This place is just not suitable.

262
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,501
You should be living

263
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:56,181
right next to Master.

264
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,421
I am used to living here.

265
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,260
What are you doing here?

266
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:08,260
This is the anti-demon manifesto
written by Master.

267
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,821
Tomorrow, once you win,

268
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:12,020
read it in public.

269
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:13,740
The task of leading sects

270
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,740
to take down the villain Gu Yuan

271
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:17,620
is yours.

272
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:21,701
Tomorrow,

273
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,140
I still need to cheat?

274
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,941
What's this talk of cheating?

275
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:29,061
How distasteful.

276
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:29,781
That manual

277
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,061
belongs to Fengyu Valley.

278
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,821
It naturally should be yours.

279
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:35,781
It's not all ours.

280
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:38,860
The second volume

281
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:40,461
was from Miss Chu.

282
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:44,340
The manual should belong to the winner,

283
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,581
same goes for the leader

284
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,620
of martial world.

285
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,661
You're not thinking

286
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,941
of depending on your abilities, huh?

287
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,740
Don't be silly.

288
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:58,500
Face the facts.

289
00:14:58,701 --> 00:14:59,860
Given your martial arts,

290
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,100
who in Fengyu Valley can you defeat?

291
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:05,421
Sure,

292
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,581
if your skills aren't up to par,
you can practice.

293
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,581
But I truly

294
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,941
admire your sense of justice.

295
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,941
Listen to me.

296
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:15,380
People who make it big

297
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,061
don't mind the details.

298
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
I...

299
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:30,020
If you dig in your heels and lose,

300
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:32,860
you will be the sinner of Fengyu Valley.

301
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,701
But if you win,

302
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,581
it'll be a whole different story.

303
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
Think about it.

304
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:41,781
Once you master the Xiaoyao Technique,

305
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,581
who will have the guts to bully you

306
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:45,061
or think less of you?

307
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,620
So, go along with Master Nan.

308
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,781
Things will go smoothly.

309
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:52,701
And then,

310
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,061
I'm counting on your help.

311
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Right?

312
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:33,781
Today marks the final round
of the Houlang Conference.

313
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,020
You are all the cream of the crop
in the martial world.

314
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,340
Those who have persevered
to this final stage

315
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:43,380
are truly the pillars
of the martial world.

316
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,421
Whoever wins,

317
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:47,941
I am confident

318
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:50,980
that they will lead the martial world

319
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,181
to defeat the villain Gu Yuan

320
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,661
and restore peace to the Jianghu.

321
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,541
Mengdie,

322
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,860
please.

323
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,901
The second volume of Xiaoyao Technique
will be put on the platform,

324
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,220
along with the first volume,

325
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:16,941
as a present for the new leader
of martial world.

326
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:19,661
The time is here. No more waiting.

327
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,141
Start the third round.

328
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:24,820
The third round will be determined
by drawing lots.

329
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,621
Those who draw lots of the same length
will be opponents.

330
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:29,901
There is no time limit for this round.

331
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,500
The first one off the platform

332
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:32,621
loses.

333
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,421
As we can see,

334
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:55,540
Nan Chuimeng and Chu Mengdie
both got the long lots.

335
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:58,341
They will be the first
to engage in combat.

336
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,661
The Young Master
and Lu Renjia are opponents.

337
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,020
Although Mengdie is my bestie,

338
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,220
honey,

339
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:06,820
I believe you can win.

340
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:10,341
Men over besties now?

341
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:44,901
The time has come.

342
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:47,661
Let the match begin.

343
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,220
(This brawl's heating up.)

344
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:02,580
(Will they be okay?)

345
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,661
Mr. Nan, are you okay?

346
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:22,901
I'm fine.

347
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:26,500
You were distracted just now.

348
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:27,980
It doesn't count. We go again.

349
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,101
No need.

350
00:19:29,421 --> 00:19:30,580
I lost.

351
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:32,621
However,

352
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,980
losing to my future wife
isn't the end of the world.

353
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:37,980
Future wife?

354
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,941
I'm feeling a bit off.

355
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,861
I need to step out for a bit.

356
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,260
The first round is over.

357
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,101
Chu Mengdie wins. Mr. Nan loses.

358
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,220
Second round.
Young Master takes on Lu Renjia.

359
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:03,421
Begin!

360
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,861
Young Master wins!

361
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:33,300
How did Baili get so strong?

362
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,020
You teach him martial arts?

363
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,540
No.

364
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:41,661
Maybe Master Nan showed him some tricks.

365
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:44,780
Young Master is impressive!

366
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,341
Young Master,

367
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:47,461
please feel free.

368
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,661
(Integrity and Honor)
Before every Qingming Festival,

369
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,941
the disciples from the valley come
up the mountain to pick tea leaves.

370
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:54,861
The fragrance

371
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:57,101
is so refreshing.

372
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,060
Smell it.

373
00:21:01,621 --> 00:21:05,621
With the pear blossoms in the wind,
another Qingming is on its way.

374
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:07,780
If you want to drink it,

375
00:21:08,181 --> 00:21:09,421
you'd better hurry.

376
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,820
Good tea.

377
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:20,421
You are truly a man of passion.

378
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:24,020
You drink tea with the same
carefree flair as when you drink wine.

379
00:21:25,861 --> 00:21:26,421
Impressive.

380
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,540
I like that.

381
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,260
I invited you here today for tea,

382
00:21:31,621 --> 00:21:34,060
but mainly to ease your mind.

383
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:36,421
The competition

384
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:38,580
is down to the final match

385
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,181
between you and Chu Mengdie.

386
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
Let me

387
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:45,900
congratulate you in advance.

388
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,661
You will surely achieve your desire.

389
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,500
But

390
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,060
my martial arts
are far inferior to Miss Chu's.

391
00:21:58,341 --> 00:21:59,661
How can I possibly

392
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,141
win the final match?

393
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:04,780
Don't worry about that.

394
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:06,661
Master and I

395
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,421
will take care of everything.

396
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:11,381
You just need to focus on the duel.

397
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:29,544
(Blessed with Elegance and Talent)

398
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,101
(Baili Xingchen is poisoned.)

399
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,780
(Lose the next match,)

400
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,220
(and he gets the antidote.)

401
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:01,580
Why are you packing?

402
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,540
Just because we lost the match

403
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,341
doesn't mean we're out of options.

404
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,540
Isn't the Xiaoyao Technique
important to you?

405
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,661
Why are you giving up so easily?

406
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,701
Don't clam up!

407
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:18,980
Mengdie told me

408
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,141
she wanted to vie with you again,

409
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,941
but you refused.

410
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,141
This time, I'll go to her.

411
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Let's have another match.

412
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:28,861
No need.

413
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:32,341
I can't defeat Chu Mengdie.

414
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,500
Are you just going to give up?

415
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:39,060
If I showed my true self as Gu Yuan

416
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,901
and used my family's martial arts,

417
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,341
she'd be no match for me.

418
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,060
But I'm Nan Chuimeng now.

419
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,780
Leaving just like that?

420
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:53,661
No,

421
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:55,181
you leave.

422
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:57,141
Han Yan!

423
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:03,381
See Madam off.

424
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:04,701
Yes.

425
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:06,181
What are you saying?

426
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Why don't you leave?

427
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,621
Han Yan, what does he mean?

428
00:24:54,181 --> 00:24:55,740
(Emotions speed up toxin diffusion.)

429
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,621
(I can't keep this up with him.)

430
00:24:58,861 --> 00:24:59,661
(Resist!)

431
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,820
(Why don't you resist?)

432
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:10,381
Come on!

433
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:15,540
Why won't you fight back?

434
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,260
Let's settle this fairly!

435
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:22,861
H-He is...

436
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:23,861
Nan Wentian!

437
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,580
You finally reveal your true face,

438
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,980
Master Nan.

439
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,421
This...

440
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:38,141
What exactly is going on?

441
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:39,701
Master Nan,

442
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,540
weren't you crippled in both legs?

443
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,341
How...

444
00:26:42,461 --> 00:26:43,941
How are you suddenly able to walk?

445
00:26:44,181 --> 00:26:45,181
Master Nan,

446
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,941
why did you pretend to be the villain

447
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,661
to take back the Xiaoyao Technique?

448
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,181
It was yours all along.

449
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:52,381
Did

450
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:54,020
someone in your valley

451
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:55,861
steal the manual

452
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,341
last time too?

453
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,740
No way!

454
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,820
We are the righteous sect!

455
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,500
Master.

456
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,621
Master.

457
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,540
Master Nan,

458
00:27:05,861 --> 00:27:07,141
you staged the whole charade

459
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,141
just to snatch

460
00:27:09,381 --> 00:27:10,540
the second volume, right?

461
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,020
Listen up,

462
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,941
don't let this demon cult scum
deceive you.

463
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:18,420
I...

464
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,621
I had to do this to stop the demon cult

465
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:23,220
from taking the book!

466
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:24,461
It's him!

467
00:27:25,181 --> 00:27:25,941
Gu Yuan!

468
00:27:26,181 --> 00:27:27,621
You've always been a coward,

469
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,740
hiding behind masks.

470
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:32,580
Now you use me as a pawn

471
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:34,861
and defy the entire martial world.

472
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,260
You won't get away with this.

473
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,500
Return the manual!

474
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,141
You've used me
as an excuse for your crimes.

475
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,780
Do you think another charge

476
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,861
will break me?

477
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:51,580
Do you think I dare not show my face

478
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:54,020
and stand up
to the entire martial world?

479
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,580
You're dead wrong.

480
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,020
Today,

481
00:27:57,661 --> 00:27:59,461
I'll crush you

482
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:01,980
in front of everyone.

483
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:16,181
Villain!

484
00:28:19,421 --> 00:28:20,421
You!

485
00:28:21,181 --> 00:28:22,421
Impossible!

486
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:23,941
You killed my nephew.

487
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:27,861
Fengyu Valley will take revenge!

488
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,820
Can't even recognize your own nephew.

489
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,780
What a joke.

490
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:35,740
All this fake kindness

491
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,341
and righteousness.

492
00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:43,101
Fine.

493
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,780
Today,

494
00:28:45,341 --> 00:28:46,901
I'll tear off

495
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:51,621
everyone's masks!

496
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,740
Mine!

497
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:25,621
Step aside!

498
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:27,901
Give it to me.

499
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,420
Give me.

500
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,060
I saw first!

501
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Mine.

502
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:55,141
Don't fall for Gu Yuan's scheme!

503
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,820
He's trying
to ruin the Houlang Conference!

504
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,300
Baili Xingchen,

505
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:03,181
you...

506
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,181
You are the Young Master
of Fengyu Valley.

507
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,621
You have to keep competing.

508
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,580
Fail to get the Xiaoyao Technique,

509
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,421
and I will show you no mercy!

510
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
I give up!

511
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,060
You all know the truth.

512
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:30,341
I'm not the smartest

513
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:32,661
or the best fighter.

514
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,820
I only got here

515
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:38,740
with Master Nan's help.

516
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:42,101
But my character is weak,

517
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,181
and I can't be the leader
of martial world.

518
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,861
But Miss Chu

519
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:48,701
is well-known

520
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,500
and super strong.

521
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,701
With her in charge,

522
00:30:53,421 --> 00:30:55,020
the martial world will be better.

523
00:30:58,421 --> 00:30:59,580
I, Baili Xingchen,

524
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,421
support Miss Chu as our leader.

525
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,500
I'm ready

526
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,661
to welcome our new leader.

527
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,780
Miss Chu is unmatched.

528
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:13,980
I support her
as the leader of martial world.

529
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:15,820
Me too!

530
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:16,500
Me too!

531
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:17,820
- Me too!
- Me too!

532
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,341
- Welcome the leader!
- Welcome the leader!

533
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:04,701
