20
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:38,659
Leave?

21
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:40,579
What?

22
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:42,379
I want to retire.

23
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:44,778
Let's live a peaceful life then.

24
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,299
Retire?

25
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:50,778
Are you saying

26
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:52,379
you won't be the villain

27
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,539
and keep fighting?

28
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:02,058
Great!

29
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:04,459
Although I also want to see you

30
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,258
punish those hypocrites,

31
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:08,418
as the saying goes,

32
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:10,579
there is never an end of taking revenge.

33
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:11,848
Moreover,

34
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:12,939
why would we

35
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,258
waste our time

36
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,584
to fight with those fools?

37
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:20,968
Before,

38
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:23,528
I only wanted to seek revenge,

39
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,539
making those who severely hurt me

40
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:27,560
and my kin to pay their price.

41
00:02:29,138 --> 00:02:30,219
But now,

42
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:33,320
I found that I have no hatred anymore.

43
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:35,978
What I think of and yearns for

44
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:38,018
is only you.

45
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:42,659
So, Song'er,

46
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,659
you have changed me.

47
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:47,578
You are important to me.

48
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:50,698
I really don't want you to

49
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:52,258
live in fear by my side.

50
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,258
However...

51
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:57,899
I still worry...

52
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:00,258
What?

53
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:02,138
If we retire,

54
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:04,899
we'll have
to live a normal life like others.

55
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:08,738
And I can only rely on
physical labor to make a living.

56
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:10,819
I won't be able

57
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:13,128
to give you a luxurious life soon.

58
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:14,568
If you are with me,

59
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:16,552
you might have to suffer.

60
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:22,984
I knew it.

61
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:25,320
You want me
to live a hard life with you.

62
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:28,360
No way.

63
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:29,992
Well...

64
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,504
Just kidding.

65
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:36,776
I can make fragrances.

66
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,280
If you are with me,

67
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:40,178
you will enjoy good days.

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,360
I will open a fragrance shop
and sell spices.

69
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:45,320
And you'll

70
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,258
use your martial skills

71
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,424
to guard for me.

72
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:53,059
Therefore, I'll have
to rely on you in the future.

73
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:55,688
But in a few days,

74
00:03:56,978 --> 00:03:58,978
I think Nan Wentian
will threaten Chu Mengdie

75
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:01,178
to lead people to the Riyue Palace

76
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:02,659
for my life.

77
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:04,619
At the coffin home of Nanshan,

78
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,698
I've prepared a male corpse

79
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:07,912
with a similar figure

80
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,448
but a blur face.

81
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:11,720
By then,

82
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,418
I will put him
in the underground palace.

83
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:17,219
In that case,

84
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,328
I can fake my death to escape.

85
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,584
You have prepared everything?

86
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:27,208
I've already checked.

87
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,384
To the south of Chiqian City,

88
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,400
a small town called Flower City

89
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,248
is isolated from the world,

90
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:35,880
but filled with nice folks.

91
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:38,184
All year round,

92
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:40,680
there blooms with flowers all over.

93
00:04:41,178 --> 00:04:41,896
By then,

94
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:43,858
we can settle down there

95
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:44,978
before we set up a plan.

96
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:46,738
Great.

97
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:48,776
Flower City.

98
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,288
It sounds very suitable
for me to live in.

99
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:57,058
By then,

100
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,339
you can start a fragrance shop there.

101
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:02,099
That will be a new beginning for us.

102
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:05,416
But my body hasn't recovered yet.

103
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:08,392
And this must not be known to others.

104
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:11,899
So, please go to the coffin home
to send a message

105
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:12,776
for me.

106
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:14,888
Okay.

107
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:30,920
This drumstick is mine.

108
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,032
Father.

109
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,019
Is the drumstick tasty?

110
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:35,720
Yes.

111
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,618
Really?

112
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:37,579
It's still warm.

113
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,779
Freshly roasted. Eat more.

114
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:42,178
By the way, Nan.

115
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:43,498
I took another job.

116
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:44,616
I'm in a hurry.

117
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:45,736
So,

118
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:47,058
I have to go

119
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,139
after finishing it.

120
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:49,699
Okay.

121
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:56,840
May I ask

122
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:59,539
who is "Nan" your father mentioned?

123
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:01,618
He is a friend

124
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:03,779
who used to practice martial arts
with him.

125
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:06,818
But they haven't met for long.

126
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:10,858
Sir.

127
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,818
What illness my father has?

128
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:16,219
Just now, I took your father's pulse

129
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:18,978
and found his pulse to be chaotic
with excessive yang energy.

130
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,139
Normally, this kind of pulse is a sign

131
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,600
of life-threatening danger.

132
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:24,498
But upon careful examination,

133
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,219
I felt that all his pulses
are all connected,

134
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:28,938
not endangering his life.

135
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:30,498
Weird.

136
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:32,552
Sir.

137
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:34,339
Any way to treat this?

138
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:35,144
Miss.

139
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,659
Forgive my limited medical skills.

140
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,858
I'll take my leave.

141
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:40,779
Thank you. Take care.

142
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:02,472
Mengdie, what did the physician say?

143
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:06,536
He said there is no medicine

144
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:08,552
for his illness.

145
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,899
When he fell ill,

146
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,818
I sought physicians for consultations,

147
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,576
and got the same answers.

148
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,808
I realized that he had gone astray.

149
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:23,019
I wanted to tell you

150
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,378
that there's no need to find physicians.

151
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,856
But in my opinion,

152
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:31,272
his condition has worsened recently.

153
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,099
You mean...

154
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:36,219
In the past,

155
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,498
he

156
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,699
didn't know his name

157
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:40,858
or where he came from,

158
00:07:41,498 --> 00:07:43,498
but he could still go out
and take on tasks.

159
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:48,459
Recently, he even struggles
to speak coherently.

160
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:50,938
Perhaps he's getting old.

161
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,339
Those unresolved concerns

162
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,539
have haunted him

163
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:58,899
and disturbed his mind.

164
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:06,339
Mengdie,

165
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:09,058
don't blame yourself.

166
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:10,219
If he knew

167
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:11,738
that you have replaced him

168
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,459
as the leader of martial world,

169
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:15,459
he will surely be happy for you.

170
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,938
Happy?

171
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,378
If so,

172
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,539
why did he become like this

173
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:29,459
after being the leader?

174
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,339
He must feel guilt and unwillingness

175
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,339
to the martial world.

176
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,339
I wonder if he could start all over,

177
00:08:38,098 --> 00:08:39,619
what choice would he make?

178
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:41,379
If he could start over,

179
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,904
he would surely choose this same path.

180
00:08:46,098 --> 00:08:47,539
The martial world is dangerous.

181
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:51,098
Right and wrong are often
decided in a moment's thought.

182
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,298
Sometimes, for the sake of people,

183
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,098
a choice must be made.

184
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:59,178
As long as the choice
is made with good intentions,

185
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:00,698
naturally,

186
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,938
it will lead to a good result.

187
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:05,619
With good intentions,

188
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:07,979
one will reap a good result.

189
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:12,779
Is it really so?

190
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:17,418
It's like this.

191
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:17,979
No.

192
00:09:18,298 --> 00:09:19,379
Why not?

193
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:28,739
Mr. Yu.

194
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:30,019
Mr. Chu.

195
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,178
I injured his meridians
in a moment's thought.

196
00:09:36,298 --> 00:09:37,619
His life is not in danger,

197
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:39,218
but he

198
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:41,899
might not be able
to practice martial arts anymore.

199
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,779
I am busy with mundane affairs.

200
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,098
I'll entrust him to you.

201
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:52,739
Leader.

202
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,139
Why?

203
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:56,578
If you are to destroy him, why save him?

204
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,899
If he survives,

205
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,058
don't you

206
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,019
fear that he will seek revenge on you?

207
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,458
I made this choice
for the peace of the martial world.

208
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:11,259
If I don't take action,
I can't convince the masses.

209
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:16,139
Now, I feel guilty.

210
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:18,979
Please help me save him.

211
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:21,019
If he grows up

212
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:23,259
and wants to seek revenge on me,

213
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:24,938
by then,

214
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:29,499
just tell him my name.

215
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,298
Chu Wuya deceived all of us,

216
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,418
saving that boy's life

217
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,899
and giving him the chance
to seek revenge on us.

218
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:50,472
It makes me to be
in such an awkward position now.

219
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:53,539
Master.

220
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:55,418
While I was tracking Chu Mengdie,

221
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:56,979
I found Chu Wuya.

222
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,800
What?

223
00:10:59,218 --> 00:10:59,859
Where is he?

224
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:01,578
The fishing village to the south.

225
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:03,698
I had talked to him before.

226
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:06,458
I found that he seems
to have forgotten who he is.

227
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:09,938
You may leave.

228
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,458
Yes.

229
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,344
I'm blessed by heaven.

230
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:26,280
I finally have my chance.

231
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:28,424
This tea is excellent.

232
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:30,938
I purchased it at a high price,

233
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,259
with an excellent taste.

234
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:33,818
Try it.

235
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:37,619
You still have the mood
to drink tea now?

236
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,019
If he and his daughter join forces,

237
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:42,499
I'm afraid there will be no day
for us to turn the tables.

238
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:44,338
Act

239
00:11:44,818 --> 00:11:45,859
in accordance

240
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:47,144
with nature.

241
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:51,368
The name of Wuwei Cave
is particularly well-chosen.

242
00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:52,744
Wuwei.

243
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:56,298
It means act in accordance with nature.

244
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:59,624
It seems that you have long
seen through the world.

245
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:01,320
I admire you.

246
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:04,008
What do you mean?

247
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,659
If I were like you,

248
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:10,539
facing a little setback
and ignoring everything,

249
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:12,779
you and I would have been destituted.

250
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,058
The sage always values difficulties,

251
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,379
thus, there is no end to difficulty.

252
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:24,298
Forgive my incompetence

253
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,499
for not helping you.

254
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:30,696
You loser!

255
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,218
I have thought it through.

256
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:43,818
Instead of seeking physicians
for my father,

257
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,499
he might feel better

258
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:46,899
if I let him stay here

259
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:48,379
and live an ordinary life.

260
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:51,298
I'm happy that you think like this.

261
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:54,499
I really

262
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:56,379
thank you.

263
00:12:57,178 --> 00:12:58,338
Instead of thanking me,

264
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,458
you should...

265
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:02,379
You should thank this naive kid.

266
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:04,938
Chu Wuya is your father,

267
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,859
and then becomes
the foster father of him.

268
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:10,499
It seems you two are destined

269
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:13,539
to meet.

270
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:16,659
You old man!

271
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:17,979
All you know is slacking off.

272
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,818
Come play with me.

273
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:20,904
Alright.

274
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:26,739
Come on.

275
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:32,200
Young lady.

276
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:34,218
I got news from the manor.

277
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:35,298
In half a day,

278
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:37,218
four major sects
will arrive at Jingyun Manor.

279
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,218
They intend to

280
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,058
force us to organize troops to attack

281
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:41,992
the Riyue Palace.

282
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:52,712
Mengdie.

283
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:55,218
Go ahead.

284
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:57,000
I will not let you down.

285
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:07,499
You're pretty when you smile.

286
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,058
I can tell

287
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:12,139
that you can win this battle.

288
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,098
You hope I win?

289
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:18,338
Of course, I hope you

290
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:19,979
can quell the disputes.

291
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:23,338
But in my mind,

292
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:26,344
Master is not wicked.

293
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:27,619
It's not

294
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:31,338
up to you and me.

295
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:33,659
Since I am the leader of martial world,

296
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,218
I bear the heavy responsibility
of eliminating the demon cult.

297
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:40,456
Forget it.

298
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:42,859
With good intentions,

299
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:45,259
one will reap a good result.

300
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:48,779
Jingshu,

301
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:49,859
prepare the carriage.

302
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,058
Set off tomorrow morning.

303
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:03,979
Here is food.

304
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:06,499
Here is fruit.

305
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,779
Here is snacks.

306
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:10,139
If you get hungry,

307
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:11,259
can have this.

308
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:17,739
By the way,

309
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,418
it is spring now,

310
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:22,938
but the wind is quite cold at night.

311
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:25,139
Put this on,

312
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:27,458
and you won't feel cold.

313
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:32,139
You prepared all these?

314
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:33,416
Of course.

315
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,779
Upon learning you were leaving,

316
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:37,779
I went to buy them.

317
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:42,664
It suits you.

318
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,098
Don't worry.

319
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:16,418
I'm here.

320
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:32,779
Mengdie,

321
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:35,619
I've taken your dagger.

322
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:41,899
Come back early.

323
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:58,259
These hairpins

324
00:16:58,698 --> 00:16:59,739
are all the ones you like.

325
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:01,698
I'll take them.

326
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:06,698
Once you finish this piece, no more.

327
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,019
You've eaten

328
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:09,858
11 pieces of osmanthus cake
and almond milk.

329
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:12,858
Eating too much can cause indigestion.

330
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:19,880
The voucher of the coffin home.

331
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,192
(Exchange Certificate of Corpse)

332
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,539
It requires me to collect it personally?

333
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:24,979
Of course.

334
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:26,312
Collect it,

335
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:27,816
and check it yourself.

336
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,832
Trade vouchers for goods,

337
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,459
especially this time.

338
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:33,384
You

339
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:35,208
are always careless.

340
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:36,968
No matter what happens,

341
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:38,536
you have to be more

342
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:40,898
careful and thoughtful.

343
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:41,539
I swear

344
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:43,578
I will definitely
complete the task well.

345
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:46,536
My lord.

346
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:48,904
Are you leaving us behind?

347
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:51,112
Right.

348
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:54,298
Do you think we're useless now?

349
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:55,818
What are you talking about?

350
00:17:56,378 --> 00:17:57,699
I am just retiring

351
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:01,259
to live an ordinary life
with Li Song'er.

352
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:04,338
In our two-person world,

353
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:06,618
is it proper for you to be here?

354
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,779
In the past, you have

355
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:11,058
never smiled at us like this,

356
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:13,019
so I assumed

357
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:15,338
that you no longer wanted us.

358
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:17,699
How fast time flies.

359
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:20,058
You've already grown up.

360
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:22,699
I still remember when you were six,

361
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:25,058
standing ragged at the street corner,

362
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:28,578
asking a household for some wonton soup.

363
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:31,019
You were so cautious when I asked you

364
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:33,138
where you came from,

365
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:34,939
and didn't say a word.

366
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:36,818
If you hadn't saved me,

367
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:39,658
I would have starved to death.

368
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:42,419
So do I.

369
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:45,179
You

370
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,858
were short and thin.

371
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,378
I was worried you wouldn't grow taller.

372
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:51,818
Now you are as tall as me.

373
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:55,112
My lord.

374
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:57,858
If you hadn't saved me,

375
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:00,259
I would have been killed

376
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,539
by those bandits.

377
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:03,138
I,

378
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:04,499
Liu Yingying,

379
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,378
have been an orphan.

380
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:09,739
You taught me to read and write,

381
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,338
and healing techniques.

382
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:12,979
I will never forget

383
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:15,058
your grace in this lifetime.

384
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:18,259
What are you doing?

385
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,459
We're not parting forever.

386
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:23,179
I don't want to leave you.

387
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:25,098
You two

388
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,499
must live well.

389
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:29,939
You have each other to rely on,

390
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,200
so I can be at ease.

391
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:36,328
I've packed up. Let's go.

392
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:55,723
(Jingyun Manor)

393
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:03,298
- Greetings, Leader.
- Greetings, Leader.

394
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:06,419
Everyone, please rise.

395
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:09,699
Today, all sects

396
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:12,419
have gathered at Jingyun Manor
for one matter.

397
00:20:12,818 --> 00:20:14,098
To eradicate the demon cult

398
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:15,979
and restore peace to the martial world.

399
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,138
Are you prepared to face the battle?

400
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:19,179
Leader,

401
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:20,818
my Fengyu Valley has people

402
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:22,179
to wait outside Riyue Palace.

403
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:24,699
Just waiting for your order
to eliminate the bandits.

404
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:27,378
For such a big matter,

405
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:28,939
the Fengyu Valley

406
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:31,019
only sent a lowly disciple like you

407
00:20:31,138 --> 00:20:32,138
here?

408
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:33,259
Where is Nan Wentian?

409
00:20:33,378 --> 00:20:34,419
He is unwell.

410
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:34,920
Got it.

411
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:36,898
What about others?

412
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:37,898
How's it?

413
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:40,699
Cang Song Sect
has dispatched top experts for this.

414
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:42,378
Once you issue the command,

415
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:43,779
we'd kill Gu Yuan.

416
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,138
Right?

417
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,058
- Kill Gu Yuan!
- Kill Gu Yuan!

418
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:50,888
We have suffered for long.

419
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:54,088
Today we can finally
defeat the demon cult.

420
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:55,419
We are really excited!

421
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:58,578
Yes, we are all very excited today.

422
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:03,259
The followers of the demon cult
naturally need to be punished.

423
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,219
But may I ask you, what is
the righteousness in the martial world?

424
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:10,219
The sky stained with blood,

425
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:12,699
or the wails heard across the land?

426
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,459
The demon cult is detestable,

427
00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:17,179
but if we stir up another turmoil

428
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:19,578
just to eliminate the demon cult,

429
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:21,459
then the righteousness we call

430
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:25,019
is no different from
the slaughter from the demon cult.

431
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:27,338
We can't kill

432
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:30,578
the innocent
in the name of righteousness.

433
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:33,179
Just capture Gu Yuan alive,

434
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,459
educate him,

435
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:37,019
and make him work for us.

436
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:40,459
But if he

437
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:42,499
shows no sign of repentance,

438
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,499
please rest assured,

439
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,098
I will certainly

440
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:50,979
eliminate future troubles.

441
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,640
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!

442
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,624
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!

443
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:57,640
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!

444
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,688
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!

445
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:01,832
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!

446
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:03,880
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!

447
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,768
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!
- Kill Gu Yuan! Destroy the demon cult!

448
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,658
Song'er, I...

449
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:27,138
I know you don't want to leave us,

450
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:29,739
but we all have our own way to go.

451
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:32,578
You can't be with us for a lifetime.

452
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:34,459
Go live your own life.

453
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,578
Take care.

454
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:03,419
After they left,

455
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:05,259
I felt kind of empty.

456
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:08,898
However,

457
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,058
when Villain and I retire

458
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:12,979
and have some children,

459
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:15,219
I wouldn't feel empty anymore.

460
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,058
Alright, done.

461
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:44,578
Father, come on!

462
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:46,219
How's the wedding room looking?

463
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:49,298
Let me take a look.

464
00:23:53,658 --> 00:23:54,858
Don't you think

465
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:56,858
something is off?

466
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:00,658
What is off?

467
00:24:01,658 --> 00:24:02,658
Candles.

468
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:04,539
Marriage sticker.

469
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:07,058
Mengdie's painting is also there.

470
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:08,378
Everything is quite nice.

471
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,699
You've decorated

472
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:13,298
the wedding room like a funeral parlor.

473
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:16,179
She will be mad at you if she sees this.

474
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,499
Take down the painting.

475
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:24,378
I'm going to the market to sell fish.

476
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:26,979
When I earn some money,

477
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:30,019
I will come back and give you two

478
00:24:30,818 --> 00:24:32,499
a wedding packet each.

479
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:33,499
Alright.

480
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:34,858
Make more money.

481
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,138
My wife is really beautiful.

482
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:54,739
At this moment,

483
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:57,219
looking at your painting,
it feels somewhat

484
00:24:58,618 --> 00:24:59,779
like a lifetime has passed.

485
00:25:01,618 --> 00:25:03,419
I'm really a fool.

486
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:05,138
How can I mistake you at first

487
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:06,618
for a man?

488
00:25:08,818 --> 00:25:10,179
Back then, when you ordered me,

489
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:11,699
I would talk back to you.

490
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:13,979
But thinking about it now,

491
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:16,098
I feel that it is

492
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:18,739
wonderful.

493
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:21,800
Rest assured.

494
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:23,499
From now on,

495
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:24,616
I'll

496
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:25,658
do

497
00:25:25,818 --> 00:25:26,818
all the house chores.

498
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:27,939
Except for

499
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:29,499
having the children,

500
00:25:30,098 --> 00:25:31,098
I will handle

501
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,658
everything else.

502
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,699
This time, I came with good news.

503
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:43,338
I found my father!

504
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:44,419
He...

505
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:51,019
He is doing very well.

506
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,699
He is living
a carefree and leisurely life

507
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:56,259
in a small fishing village.

508
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:01,898
I don't plan to bring him back
to the manor.

509
00:26:03,618 --> 00:26:04,979
Being far from the martial world

510
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:08,259
must be what you've hoped for.

511
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:10,179
He now has friends.

512
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:12,898
And the silly boy I mentioned,

513
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:14,699
Baili Xingchen.

514
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:17,138
I never thought

515
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:19,739
they were already acquainted.

516
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:21,818
Father even took him as a godson.

517
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,320
I think

518
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:28,499
this might be fate.

519
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:34,152
I want to cherish this fate.

520
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,219
These days,

521
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:42,536
I often think about

522
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:46,618
what kind of martial world
did Father envision

523
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,898
when he became
the leader of martial world.

524
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,058
To besiege the Riyue Palace

525
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:57,739
and eliminate the demon cult,

526
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:02,019
I still have worries.

527
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:10,760
Mother.

528
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:14,979
I have dealt with Gu Yuan a few times.

529
00:27:17,058 --> 00:27:19,578
He is not as ruthless as the rumors say.

530
00:27:21,346 --> 00:27:24,439
(The grave of my wife, Zuo Xiao,
erected by Chu Wuya)

531
00:28:01,338 --> 00:28:03,058
Godfather, it's time to eat.

532
00:28:04,098 --> 00:28:06,058
Hey, come practice with me.

533
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:28,219
Smells good.

534
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:29,338
Mr. Chu.

535
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,779
Long time no see.

536
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,658
You still have

537
00:28:44,818 --> 00:28:46,219
that extraordinary presence.

538
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:50,259
Well,

539
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:51,539
you and I

540
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:53,699
haven't met for over ten years, right?

541
00:28:58,578 --> 00:28:59,818
I'm not playing with you.

542
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:02,779
Mr. Chu.

543
00:29:03,378 --> 00:29:04,378
Don't you remember me?

544
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:06,779
I am Wentian.

545
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:10,818
Nan Wentian?

546
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:13,898
Nan?

547
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:15,058
Yes.

548
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:16,539
Nan.

549
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:17,979
Mr. Chu.

550
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:19,419
You remember me?

551
00:29:20,098 --> 00:29:21,098
Nan?

552
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:24,699
Ugh! Nan.

553
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:26,098
Ugh.

554
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:28,058
I'm not playing with you.

555
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:43,098
Chu Wuya.

556
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:45,179
Mr. Chu.

557
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:49,259
You have been restraining me
for half my lifetime.

558
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:52,019
But in the end, you've gone mad.

559
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:56,259
Tell me,

560
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:58,058
should I cry

561
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,618
or laugh?

562
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:11,298
Master Nan!

563
00:30:16,618 --> 00:30:18,298
Master Nan, why are you here?

564
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:20,858
Why are you everywhere, you fool?

565
00:30:21,658 --> 00:30:22,658
Step aside!

566
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:24,019
Master Nan.

567
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,939
You didn't tell me that you're coming.

568
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:28,138
I roasted something.

569
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:29,338
Come join us.

570
00:30:32,578 --> 00:30:33,578
Nan Wentian!

571
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:36,818
I respect you

572
00:30:37,578 --> 00:30:38,818
as you are a senior.

573
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:40,658
Please do not do anything

574
00:30:40,658 --> 00:30:41,699
that will let me down.

575
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:44,818
Who do you think you are?

576
00:30:45,378 --> 00:30:47,419
How dare you to tell me what to do?

577
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,179
I expelled you,

578
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:50,779
which is sparing your life.

579
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:52,539
You're standing in my way.

580
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:54,298
Get lost!

581
00:30:56,298 --> 00:30:57,298
Don't come closer.

582
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:02,858
You ask for it.

583
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,179
Let go.

584
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:15,338
No way.

585
00:31:20,058 --> 00:31:20,618
Let go!

586
00:31:20,618 --> 00:31:21,618
No way.

587
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:22,939
I promised Mengdie

588
00:31:23,378 --> 00:31:24,499
to protect her father.

589
00:31:25,298 --> 00:31:26,499
No way!

590
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:54,378
Senior,

591
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:55,858
stop!

592
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:58,699
Senior.

593
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:01,259
Senior.

594
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:03,858
Mr. Chu has already gone mad.

595
00:32:04,378 --> 00:32:06,138
Just let him go.

596
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:11,499
What are you saying?

597
00:32:12,378 --> 00:32:14,219
I had no intention of killing Mr. Chu.

598
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:17,259
I just came to visit him.

599
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:20,058
After all, the three of us

600
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,138
haven't seen each other for so long.

601
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:24,419
Right, Mr. Chu?

602
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:30,338
You're all here? Stay for the meal.

603
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:33,179
Hey!

604
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,419
Time to eat.

605
00:33:18,658 --> 00:33:20,338
(There's a tradition in my hometown)

606
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:21,818
that if a lady meets a man

607
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:23,618
she fancies after coming of age,

608
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:25,779
she makes him a dagger.

609
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:32,779
(Baili Xingchen.)

610
00:33:34,378 --> 00:33:35,459
(This dagger)

611
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:38,098
(is my gift to you.)

612
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:39,578
Right.

613
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:41,019
My harpoon is so noticeable.

614
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:42,219
You'll be discovered.

615
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:43,939
Take this one instead.

616
00:33:44,058 --> 00:33:44,739
Be careful

617
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:45,979
and you won't be noticed.

618
00:34:38,716 --> 00:34:41,178
(Riyue Palace)

619
00:34:41,178 --> 00:34:42,178
Report!

620
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:46,419
Leader.

621
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:47,499
There is no one here.

622
00:34:47,658 --> 00:34:48,939
The living supplies are gone.

623
00:34:49,258 --> 00:34:50,738
They might know we would attack

624
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:52,058
and have prepared to escape.

625
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:53,499
They escaped?

626
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:55,618
Such a large Riyue Palace,

627
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:57,019
yet without a single person?

628
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:59,578
Gu Yuan dared to snatch

629
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,178
the manual at the Houlang Conference.

630
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,698
He would never escape.

631
00:35:03,138 --> 00:35:04,138
Perhaps

632
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:05,459
it's a trick.

633
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:09,299
What can they accomplish?

634
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:11,098
They are all cowards.

635
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:13,098
No matter how brave they are,

636
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:15,539
they wouldn't dare to oppose
the entire martial world.

637
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:17,352
You

638
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:19,138
take some people to investigate again.

639
00:35:19,499 --> 00:35:21,339
If we don't find Gu Yuan today,

640
00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:24,138
then go back and plan.

641
00:35:24,618 --> 00:35:25,218
Yes.

642
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:26,578
You guys, come with me.

643
00:35:32,658 --> 00:35:34,178
Leader is indeed wise.

644
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,419
Those followers of demon cult

645
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:37,899
knew that today you

646
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,459
intend to fight against Gu Yuan.

647
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:42,939
I bet

648
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:44,939
they were all scared away.

649
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:47,819
Leader.

650
00:35:48,098 --> 00:35:51,258
I've already known where they are.

651
00:35:52,218 --> 00:35:53,618
We have too many people.

652
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:55,499
I am afraid it will alert them.

653
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:59,138
Maybe you and I go ahead first.

654
00:35:59,698 --> 00:36:01,019
You claim that.

655
00:36:01,738 --> 00:36:03,218
How do I know it's not a trap?

656
00:36:04,939 --> 00:36:06,299
Leader, don't worry.

657
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:09,058
I will lead the way myself.

658
00:36:09,979 --> 00:36:12,258
Although I made a mistake,

659
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:14,939
exterminating the demon cult

660
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:16,138
is

661
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:17,899
my responsibility.

662
00:36:20,218 --> 00:36:21,258
In that case,

663
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:24,058
please lead the way, Master Nan.

664
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:26,578
You and I will go together
to investigate.

665
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:29,459
Young lady.

666
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:31,178
I'm afraid he is deceiving us.

667
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:34,339
He can't defeat me.

668
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,539
Get ready
to provide support at any time.

669
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:23,299
(Song'er.)

670
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:27,138
(Back then, you didn't want me
to buy this fabric to make clothes.)

671
00:37:28,738 --> 00:37:30,258
(Did you already know)

672
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:33,499
(I would wear this to take a risk?)

673
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,618
(I'm sorry)

674
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:39,339
(for letting you down.)

675
00:37:45,258 --> 00:37:46,899
(If we could have met earlier)

676
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:49,672
(or I didn't know the ending,)

677
00:37:52,058 --> 00:37:53,256
