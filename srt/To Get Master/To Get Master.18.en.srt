(Based on The Fierce Princess by Jun Su)

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,992
=Episode 18=

20
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,339
Han Yan,

21
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,339
where are we going in such a hurry?

22
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:45,819
To Riyue Palace.

23
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,220
Riyue Palace?

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,860
Gu Yuan won't go with us?

25
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,940
The six major sects

26
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,419
are gathering to fight
for the leader of martial world.

27
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,100
My lord can't appear

28
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,619
as Nan Chuimeng this time.

29
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,059
A deadly battle is coming.

30
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,140
So, he sent me to bring you back
to Riyue Palace.

31
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:05,259
Once you're secure,

32
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:07,539
he can focus on reclaiming
the Xiaoyao Technique.

33
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,740
So, the villain

34
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,100
will reclaim the Xiaoyao Technique

35
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:15,339
as Gu Yuan?

36
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,860
That's perfect.

37
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,260
Hanging out with you guys,

38
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:22,339
I've seen through

39
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:23,619
those so-called righteous sects.

40
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:25,619
They preach about honor and justice,

41
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,300
but they're all full of hidden agendas.

42
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,300
- Greetings, Leader.
- Greetings, Leader.

43
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
Please rise.

44
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:42,219
Nan Wentian,

45
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:44,059
why are you here?

46
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,659
I came to congratulate
your enthronement.

47
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,540
If you don't want to see me,

48
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,980
I'll just go.

49
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,059
Just stay.

50
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:57,020
If you go,

51
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,219
I'll suspect you of colluding
with the demon cult.

52
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,379
How could that be possible?

53
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:06,860
I wouldn't dare.

54
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,140
Leader, you're a hero in the making.

55
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,300
Your presence outshines even Mr. Wuya.

56
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:15,099
You're truly your father's daughter.

57
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:25,659
Master Nan

58
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,420
is the paragon for us all.

59
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,140
For the manual,

60
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,260
you feigned paralysis
of both legs for years

61
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,260
and posed as the villain,
wreaking havoc everywhere.

62
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,860
That level of dedication

63
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,099
is truly admirable.

64
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,820
Indeed.

65
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,379
Leader, my painstaking efforts

66
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,339
have now been fulfilled.

67
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,339
You're old,
but not exactly thin-skinned.

68
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:57,700
I've let you stay
in the Martial Alliance

69
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,020
just because you've managed
Fengyu Valley for so long

70
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,219
and contributed to the martial world.

71
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:05,580
If you keep spouting nonsense,

72
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,740
don't expect any mercy from me.

73
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,860
He can really keep his composure.

74
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:17,980
Leader, please don't be angry.

75
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:19,179
I'm apologizing

76
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,580
for him.

77
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,899
The thing is,

78
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,739
the villain Gu Yuan

79
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,260
has already turned up.

80
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,260
He's been hiding among us

81
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,060
using the name Nan Chuimeng,

82
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,620
Master Nan's nephew.

83
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,020
It's clear

84
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,020
the demon cult
has been carefully planning

85
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,979
to get the manual
and dominate the martial world.

86
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,820
If we don't act fast, things could...

87
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,539
So, please master the manual quickly

88
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,940
and lead us to crush demon cult,

89
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,620
to restore peace to the martial world!

90
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,020
Of course!

91
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:01,820
Rest easy.

92
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,580
As long as I'm around,

93
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,380
Gu Yuan won't get away.

94
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,099
- Great!
- Great!

95
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,768
Good point!

96
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:14,940
- Sounds good!
- You're right!

97
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,940
You're right!

98
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,899
- Great!
- Great!

99
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
Great!

100
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,480
(Guyue Inn)

101
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,419
Hello, sirs...

102
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:39,180
Gu Yuan!

103
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,460
Villain Gu Yuan!

104
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,580
Serve the wine.

105
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Please come in.

106
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:10,774
(Scent Travels Far)

107
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,219
We meet again.

108
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,779
I am in a competition with someone.

109
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:57,219
Do not disturb me.

110
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,979
Here comes another brat.

111
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:07,779
Fisherman,

112
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,219
is this your backup?

113
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:16,339
Fisherman,

114
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:20,140
afraid of losing and call a lad?

115
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,899
(The technique is all random,)

116
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,500
(but why is it so powerful?)

117
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,219
You are pretty good.

118
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,260
(Jingyun Manor?)

119
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,380
Senior,

120
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,099
I apologize for my rudeness just now.

121
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,419
May I ask your name?

122
00:07:58,539 --> 00:07:59,539
Phew, the cup's fine.

123
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,140
My precious cup.

124
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,380
You fisherman!

125
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,739
You cheated!

126
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:12,380
I fell for this lad's trick!

127
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
I lost!

128
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,380
We had a bet,

129
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,099
whoever stood up first loses,

130
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:18,820
and I stood up! He didn't.

131
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,140
So I lost!

132
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:21,979
Alright.

133
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:26,739
Take the book.

134
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,219
Old fart,

135
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,020
don't bother me again!

136
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,020
Senior,

137
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,659
you're probably confused.

138
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,099
This seat was vacant just now.

139
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,660
(He is a hidden master.)

140
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:52,099
(What kind of book did he leave?)

141
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:01,384
(Eternal Grace)

142
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,820
Two families join,
a single bond of marriage.

143
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,259
We become one in each other.

144
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,780
Hearts intertwined.
Together for eternity.

145
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:27,460
Bride,

146
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
Li Song'er.

147
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:31,219
Groom,

148
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:33,180
Gu Yuan.

149
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:38,139
(Marriage contract)

150
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:40,700
This is truly our marriage contract.

151
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,099
Not Mengdie

152
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,379
and Nan Chuimeng.

153
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,499
It's Li Song'er

154
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:51,859
and Gu Yuan!

155
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Li Song'er.

156
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:27,144
(Integrity and Honor)

157
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:35,979
Senior,

158
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:38,099
you've been standing for an hour.

159
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:40,940
Thinking too much is harmful.
Better to sit down.

160
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:44,780
I've sat for decades.

161
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,060
Standing up now is no big deal.

162
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:48,700
Those wimps

163
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:51,420
only dare to gossip behind my back.

164
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,219
But in my face,

165
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,460
who dares?

166
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:56,420
Exactly!

167
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,499
Baili Xingchen
is also a good-for-nothing.

168
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:01,379
Find someone to drive him out.

169
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:03,259
I get mad just looking at him.

170
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:07,739
Jingyun Manor
has the complete manual now.

171
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:10,660
Our plans for decades are wasted.

172
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,820
If we'd just made Chu Mengdie

173
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,540
take the blame for killing Zhou Heng,

174
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,660
none of this would've happened!

175
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:23,259
We need to think of a way now.

176
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:25,099
Senior,

177
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:28,580
I have something unclear.

178
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:30,979
Why did you

179
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,180
arrange for Heng

180
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,979
to marry into Fengyu Valley?

181
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:42,019
That...

182
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,060
That was because he was useful.

183
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,420
Heng was loyal to Fengyu Valley.

184
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:52,660
Even if he knew

185
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:56,300
it was you, disguised as Gu Yuan,
stealing the manual,

186
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,460
he'd keep quiet.

187
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,580
Why did you have to go that far

188
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,420
and kill him?

189
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,300
How naive!

190
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:13,540
A dead person
is far more useful than a living one.

191
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,619
If I were as indecisive as you,

192
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,339
would we be where we are today?

193
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:21,219
Now that the valley's reputation
is at stake,

194
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,339
we need to figure out a way

195
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,739
to save the situation.
That's our main concern.

196
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Senior,

197
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,619
should I have played...

198
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:42,728
Was it

199
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,219
black

200
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,992
or white just now?

201
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,619
Getting older

202
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,780
really dulls the mind.

203
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,540
Sometimes I can't tell

204
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,460
if white is better

205
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:59,099
or black is better.

206
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,660
Senior.

207
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:13,979
My lord,

208
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:16,540
you really give up
the Xiaoyao Technique?

209
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,859
Sit down.

210
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,760
My lord,

211
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,979
yesterday, you exposed

212
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,900
Nan Wentian's hypocrisy publicly.

213
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,139
But you shouldn't throw away

214
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,339
the Xiaoyao Technique.

215
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,540
You've been planning for ten years,
enduring so much pain,

216
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:55,700
all to reclaim it

217
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,859
one day.

218
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,060
I just can't understand

219
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:01,019
why you'd do this now.

220
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:03,259
I think

221
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,900
letting Nan Wentian live

222
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,619
is the worst punishment for him.

223
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,300
Back then,

224
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,259
he stirred up the entire martial world,

225
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,139
using those vicious methods

226
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,580
to destroy Riyue Palace.

227
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,019
Now

228
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:17,420
he's ended up
being despised by everyone.

229
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,540
It's like what goes around,
comes around.

230
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:27,780
Now that you've revealed your face

231
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,820
and everyone knows who you are,

232
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,180
I'm guessing

233
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:34,180
you're in for a rough ride ahead.

234
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:36,940
Back then, those people,

235
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,619
to get the Xiaoyao Technique,

236
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,580
lied that my parents
were using the manual

237
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,859
to massacre the martial world.

238
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,900
They framed Riyue Palace

239
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:48,859
as the demon cult.

240
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,780
After my parents were murdered,

241
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,499
I went

242
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,499
into hiding,

243
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,139
living under this mask

244
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:04,420
for more than 20 years.

245
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,259
During these years,

246
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,259
all I had was hate.

247
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,580
All I wanted was to get the manual back

248
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,420
and avenge my parents.

249
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,619
Yesterday,

250
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,700
seeing those so-called righteous sects

251
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,900
and martial heroes

252
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,060
acting like fools

253
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,900
over the manual,

254
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,859
I found it all so laughable.

255
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:41,219
Suddenly, I realized

256
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,219
that no matter what I did,

257
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:46,540
I couldn't get back

258
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,460
what I'd lost.

259
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:52,219
And my obsessions

260
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,460
were not crucial anymore.

261
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,019
My towering anger

262
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,060
all turned to falling flowers.

263
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,619
After wearing this mask for so long,

264
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,660
I'm just worn out.

265
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,580
My lord!

266
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:29,859
My lord!

267
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,979
You silly oaf,
still playing with the lousy fork?

268
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:55,180
Don't you think
you're still the Young Master

269
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,820
of Fengyu Valley after losing
at the Houlang Conference?

270
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,739
Jinx.

271
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:03,460
Why do you

272
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,900
mock me like this?

273
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:07,219
Why?

274
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,219
You're a complete waste.

275
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,380
You had a clear path to the top.

276
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,860
The leadership within reach,
and you just gave it away.

277
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,299
What were you thinking?

278
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:18,579
I can't fake it.

279
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,019
What's the point

280
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:22,819
if it's not earned by myself?

281
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,420
I don't care about

282
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:25,700
your point now.

283
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,860
Here's the deal.

284
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:29,460
Master has cut you loose.

285
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:32,019
So, pack your bags and get out now!

286
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,700
Don't go too far.

287
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:39,460
So what if I bully you?

288
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:41,140
So what?

289
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,579
I'll even hit you!

290
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,019
I wonder

291
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,819
who dares to mess with my man.

292
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
Leader.

293
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,140
Get out.

294
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
I mean

295
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:56,860
get out by rolling.

296
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,940
I...

297
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,380
Yes.

298
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:04,019
I roll.

299
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:05,499
I roll.

300
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,299
Roll.

301
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:07,940
I-I'm rolling out.

302
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,940
(Not poisoned.)

303
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,819
(It seems that letter)

304
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,499
(was the underhanded scheme)

305
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,180
(by Fengyu Valley to get the manual.)

306
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:21,460
W-What's wrong?

307
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Follow me.

308
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,819
Leader,

309
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,620
you are leaving?

310
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:35,499
Yes.

311
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,259
Do you feel any regret now?

312
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,460
If you hadn't given up

313
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,660
at the last minute,

314
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,860
you'd be

315
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,180
the leader.

316
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:52,059
A proud man won't take handouts.

317
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:54,940
If the leader's spot
was grabbed unfairly,

318
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,340
I'd rather let it go.

319
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:00,900
I indeed didn't misjudge.

320
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,700
What did you say?

321
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,460
Aren't you even a little bit upset?

322
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,779
Losing the leader's spot is one thing.

323
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,579
You've also missed the chance

324
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,979
to learn the Xiaoyao Technique.

325
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,979
Didn't you always want to be a master?

326
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:19,499
People need the right timing,

327
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,900
and learning martial arts
needs the right fate.

328
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:25,059
If the fate isn't there,

329
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,579
then I'll just skip it.

330
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,739
No need to be too sad.

331
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,539
If you can't be the leader,

332
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,539
being my partner is still amazing.

333
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:50,299
Baili Xingchen,

334
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,620
I don't think

335
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,499
you've had no feelings
for me all this time.

336
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:00,539
I...

337
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,579
I knew it.

338
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,660
Since Fengyu Valley has cut you loose,

339
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,380
you're joining my Jingyun Manor
from now on.

340
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:09,100
Leader,

341
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,539
the transport's ready.

342
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
We can set off now.

343
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,299
Let's go.

344
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:15,579
Where are we going?

345
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,560
Am I going too?

346
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:22,460
You will definitely follow me.

347
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:23,940
As my partner,

348
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:26,579
how can you stay in another sect?

349
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,140
Let's go!

350
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,460
Wait.

351
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,700
Why are you so domineering?

352
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,340
I haven't agreed

353
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,660
to return with you.

354
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,539
Didn't you kneel

355
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,499
in front of everyone

356
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,940
and say you'd follow me?

357
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,059
Do you want to stay
in Fengyu Valley now?

358
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,180
Besides,

359
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,100
did they ask you if you wanted

360
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:56,539
to be kicked out?

361
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,460
I guess I'm meant

362
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,299
to be a wanderer for life.

363
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
Wander?

364
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,019
After you return
to Jingyun Manor with me,

365
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,180
I'll manage the outside,

366
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,100
and you'll run the show inside.

367
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,019
This sounds like I'm marrying

368
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:16,499
into your family.

369
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,620
Aren't you?

370
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:19,579
Of course not.

371
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,739
If I go,

372
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,299
it's to learn martial arts.

373
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:24,579
I'd go as a disciple.

374
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,460
Baili,

375
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,259
we've been living together,

376
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,259
sharing a bed for so long,

377
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,299
and you've never
thought about taking responsibility?

378
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:41,259
I didn't know you were a girl back then.

379
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,819
So now that you know,

380
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,779
you still won't be responsible?

381
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:46,739
I will.

382
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,499
I...

383
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:53,539
Forget it.

384
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,100
I'm not rushing you for an answer.

385
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:58,499
I've got more pressing matters
to deal with.

386
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,100
Just follow me for now.

387
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,499
So,

388
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:05,059
where are we heading?

389
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,420
Go find Gu Yuan.

390
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:09,180
Master?

391
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,299
As agreed,

392
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,979
with me as the leader,

393
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,860
I should rally the heroes
to crush the demon cult.

394
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:18,180
I feel like my master...

395
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
He's not a bad guy.

396
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:24,940
Everyone calls him a villain
who kills without mercy,

397
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:27,620
but he's never touched us.

398
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,660
He also gave up Xiaoyao Technique.

399
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:31,779
Had he not unmasked

400
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,539
Nan Wentian's pretense,

401
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,140
we'd probably

402
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:36,420
still be clueless.

403
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,499
Moreover,

404
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:45,100
what about Madam?

405
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,380
Baili,

406
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,539
as the leader of martial world,

407
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,660
I need to

408
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,460
put some things aside

409
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,900
for the greater good.

410
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:07,976
(Riyue Palace)

411
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:13,460
(Mix the leaves of Chinese arborvitae,
angelica dahurica, galangal,)

412
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,700
(and some mugwort.)

413
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,059
(It can warm the channels)

414
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,032
(and boost energy.)

(to the pillow.)

419
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,180

Where are we?

431
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,100
Leader, here is Baili River.

432
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Baili River?

433
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,779
No wonder this place seemed so familiar.

434
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,860
So, it's Baili River!

435
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:39,499
Han!

436
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:40,819
You're back.

437
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:41,979
Yes!

438
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,460
Leader,

439
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:46,632
you're in my hometown.

440
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,140
I'll introduce you.

441
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,160
To whom?

442
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,019
Another fish you saved?

443
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,128
No.

444
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,376
He is

445
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:55,739
my adoptive father.

446
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:57,640
Since we will leave,

447
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,900
we should tell the elders.

448
00:24:59,299 --> 00:24:59,819
Besides,

449
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,840
you can also...

450
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
You can also

451
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,299
say hello

452
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,380
to your future

453
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,539
father-in-law.

454
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:29,979
Father!

455
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,299
Silly boy!

456
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
Father!

457
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:38,340
- My silly boy, you're back!
- Father!

458
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,979
Put me down.

459
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:43,739
Silly boy,

460
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:45,620
you've changed now.

461
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,420
Changed a lot.

462
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,739
Changed a lot!

463
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:50,140
Changed a lot.

464
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,380
Changed...

465
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:52,539
Changed...

466
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,299
Mengdie,

467
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,420
let me introduce you.

468
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,940
He is my adoptive father.

469
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:05,460
He's the best fisherman here.

470
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:07,380
They call him the Fishing King.

471
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,499
Right?

472
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,779
Father, she is my...

473
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,700
Greetings, sir. I'm Chu Mengdie.

474
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:18,340
Baili Xingchen is my fiancé.

475
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,620
Great!

476
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:23,579
- I'm back!
- You're back.

477
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,059
Mengdie,

478
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,140
that's my adoptive father's buddy.

479
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:30,499
He's also my godfather.

480
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:36,259
He looks pretty lively, huh?

481
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,380
Father.

482
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,340
Father.

483
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,460
Father.

484
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,940
Already calling him that?

485
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,979
Father, where have you been?

486
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,019
You must have had it tough out there.

487
00:26:57,739 --> 00:26:59,940
I've missed you so much.

488
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,180
Daughter?

489
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:06,660
Mengdie?

490
00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:13,896
You are

491
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:15,340
not Mengdie.

492
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:18,380
Not Mengdie.

493
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,208
Father.

494
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,900
Don't cry, Miss.

495
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:32,900
Don't cry.

496
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,779
I'll get you nectar from flowers.

497
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:36,259
It's very sweet.

498
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,059
Just wait.

499
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:48,059
Father.

500
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,083
(Eternal Grace)

501
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:51,979
Li Song'er.

502
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:54,940
(Age 16.)

503
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,539
(Princess of Zuimeng City,)

504
00:28:58,499 --> 00:29:00,660
(the apple of everyone's eye.)

505
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,019
(She was wild and carefree.)

506
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,900
(Unbound by worldly constraints.)

507
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,660
(But she was unruly as a child.)

508
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:09,019
(Unrestrained.)

509
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:12,219
(Quite a troublemaker.)

510
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:22,259
Song'er has always been this naughty.

511
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,539
It seems Zuimeng City
is more than just a story.

512
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,140
(Chu Mengdie)

513
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:42,420
(led the martial sects to Riyue Palace,)

514
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,700
(and alongside Nan Wentian,)

515
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:49,059
(they found Gu Yuan.)

516
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,940
(Meanwhile, Li Song'er,)

517
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,140
(after the death of the villain,)

518
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,819
(returned to Zuimeng City.)

519
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,019
(It all seemed like a dream.)

520
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:16,420
(Why does everything in the book)

521
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:19,180
(Eternal Grace)
(feel so real?)

522
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,620
(I refuse to accept)

523
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,299
(an ending like this.)

524
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,860
Gu Yuan.

525
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:46,539
Gu Yuan.

526
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,420
Gu Yuan!

527
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,819
You finally woke up!

528
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:01,180
Great!

529
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,579
Wait a moment.

530
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,700
You have just recovered.

531
00:31:10,739 --> 00:31:12,380
You need to get some rest.

532
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:21,100
The medicine is ready.
I'll get it for you.

533
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:34,019
Godfather.

534
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:34,739
Alright.

535
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:36,059
It's been a decade.

536
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,779
Father

537
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,259
has forgotten about me.

538
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,579
No, he hasn't.

539
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:46,499
He always said he has a daughter.

540
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:49,620
He talked about me?

541
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:52,100
That eccentric old man

542
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,539
always says his daughter
is a martial arts prodigy,

543
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,979
with a heart of gold,

544
00:31:56,259 --> 00:32:00,460
and is bound to be
the next leader of martial world.

545
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:04,340
Then why hasn't he written back?

546
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,900
He's just getting old and forgetful.

547
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,059
I've asked him a few times.

548
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:13,860
He said he left home
to find his daughter.

549
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:16,539
He's been constantly anxious,

550
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:19,819
scared that you might run into trouble.

551
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:20,940
One time,

552
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,420
he took on a super dangerous hit.

553
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,979
I told him not to go.

554
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,219
We're not in our fighting prime.
How could we stand a chance?

555
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,900
But he said it was the villain.

556
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,299
If he didn't get rid of it,

557
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:34,819
how could he protect his daughter?

558
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,499
Fish! Pull!

559
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,700
It's a good size.

560
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:51,499
Mengdie,

561
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,539
why are you crying?

562
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,700
Don't tug at it.

563
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,299
Take it slow.

564
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:11,819
Let me see.

565
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:14,019
Come on! So tiny!

566
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,819
Every time I saw you before,

567
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:22,100
you were always spirited and resolute,

568
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,700
never letting anything get to you

569
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,100
or touch your heart.

570
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
Never thought

571
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,460
I'd see you

572
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,900
cry three times in just one day.

573
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,140
I had given up hope

574
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,180
of ever seeing Father again.

575
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,979
Ten years ago,

576
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:48,380
he left under the pretext of traveling.

577
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,420
Initially, I got letters from him,

578
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,779
but eventually, they just dried up.

579
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,700
Over the years,

580
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
I've sent disciples

581
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:00,620
to search for him,

582
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,299
but there was never any news.

583
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,579
I thought...

584
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,059
I've blamed him in the past.

585
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:12,219
Why did he leave me behind?

586
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:14,619
Why did he abandon the manor,

587
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:17,059
making me shoulder the burden so early?

588
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,099
I've resented him

589
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,780
and hated him.

590
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,059
But even so,

591
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,900
if he doesn't recognize me now,

592
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:30,220
as his child,

593
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,179
I should also ensure his safety.

594
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:40,780
As the leader of martial world,

595
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,619
I truly see.

596
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,659
In the Jianghu,
we are but leaves in the wind,

597
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,579
carried where we can't choose.

598
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:50,499
You mean

599
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:52,460
wiping out Riyue Palace?

600
00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:55,019
It's just the beginning.

601
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,260
In the years ahead,

602
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,220
who knows how many more things
I'll be forced to do?

603
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,780
I'm afraid

604
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,460
I won't be able
to judge right from wrong.

605
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,900
Don't be troubled.

606
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:13,139
I trust you.

607
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,099
You won't let any villain
escape justice,

608
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:16,659
and you won't harm

609
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:18,420
any innocent.

610
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,979
Instead of worrying,

611
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,539
just work on your skills.

612
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,780
In the Jianghu, only the strong

613
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,860
can truly judge right from wrong.

614
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,220
Father,

615
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,139
have you remembered everything?

616
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
This is fun!

617
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,139
T-This is so fun!

618
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,220
So amazing!

619
00:35:55,179 --> 00:35:55,780
Come on!

620
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,380
I can't leave him

621
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:01,340
like this, no matter what.

622
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,260
Baili,

623
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:06,499
can you...?

624
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:07,619
Don't worry.

625
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:08,840
I was planning

626
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:10,900
to stick around for a while.

627
00:36:11,499 --> 00:36:12,699
I'll look after them.

628
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,300
When my matter is settled,

629
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:18,579
I'll return to you.

630
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:45,059
Song'er,

631
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
Master's in the pavilion.

632
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,900
It's something important.

633
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,380
I'll handle the medicine.

634
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,380
In an hour,

635
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,460
add some water.

636
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:55,019
Cold water.

637
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:56,139
I'll go.

638
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,820
Gu Yuan,

639
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,900
I know you can't wait to see me,

640
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:13,380
but you need to get better first.

641
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,860
It's so cold outside.

642
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:20,059
What if you catch a cold

643
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,499
and be even sicker?

644
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,099
Song'er,

645
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,380
it's time to leave.

646
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,659
