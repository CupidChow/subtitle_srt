1
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,040
Tan, are you okay?

2
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,120
I put the things you asked me
to buy right next to your bag.

3
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,640
Thanks a lot. Are you really okay?

4
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,160
It's just a little headache.

5
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,080
It might be a migraine.

6
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
Have you taken any medicine?

7
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,520
I'm okay. Don't worry.

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,440
I think you should go rest.

9
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,840
We'll finish late today. Still a lot
of shots left. Tomorrow's a big day too.

10
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,240
I can handle things here.

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,240
Go on.

12
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,960
Go now.

13
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,080
I'll just leave my stuff here then.

14
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Okay.

15
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,240
Finished earlier than expected.

16
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,080
BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED.

17
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,440
I WANT TO BE LIKE YOU, ALIN.

18
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,760
I LIKE YOUR WORK.

19
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,920
YOU ARE SO TALENTED.

20
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,840
It would be nice if we could
live together like this forever.

21
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,360
I don't think

22
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,360
I could love anyone more than I love you.

23
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,960
Would you mind…

24
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,320
if I asked you to be with me forever?

25
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,600
To love only me?

26
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,440
Will you marry me?

27
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,960
Yes.

28
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,120
Get out.

29
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,480
-Lin!
-Lin!

30
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,200
I said get out.

31
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,040
How many times have you slept together?

32
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,400
Huh?

33
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,760
How many times?

34
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,480
Lin, I'm sorry.

35
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,000
Why agree to marry me if you like men?

36
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
Huh?

37
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
-Why did you lie to me, Kate?
-Lin…

38
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,200
-Why did you deceive me, Kate?
-Lin.

39
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,520
Lin, please listen to me.

40
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,880
I'm sorry.

41
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,040
I'm really sorry. I truly am.

42
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,920
Get out. Get out of my life.

43
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,320
Kate.

44
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,560
Lin.

45
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,160
Please listen to me.

46
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,680
Please…

47
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,240
‎Lin.

48
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,680
Get out.

49
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,400
-Lin.
-I said get out. Get out.

50
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,320
Kate, that's enough.

51
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,440
Jane,

52
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,040
bring the green curry
to Aunt Aom for me, okay?

53
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,920
Okay.

54
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
It's on the table.

55
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,720
Aunt Aom?

56
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,040
Aunt Aom?

57
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,680
Aunt Aom?

58
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,280
Eh?

59
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,240
Aunt Aom?

60
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,720
Aunt Aom?

61
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,240
Jane, I have something to tell you.

62
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,560
What is it?

63
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,160
-This.
-What is it?

64
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,440
She wrote a song for me.

65
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,000
Let me see.

66
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,760
Ugh, it's so lame.

67
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,560
She doesn't deserve you, Lin.

68
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,400
This song is ancient.

69
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,200
Oh, come on, Jane.
You totally ruined my vibe.

70
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,640
Meh.

71
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,080
I think it's cute.

72
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,760
This spot…

73
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,000
is saved for you.

74
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,560
I'll bring it to your house
once I finish writing.

75
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,280
Okay.

76
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,400
Jane, hurry up.

77
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,240
You've been upstairs forever.
Haven't you changed yet?

78
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,160
Aunt Aom, where's Lin?

79
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,840
I brought back the shirt
she asked me to write on.

80
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,280
I'll go up.

81
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,320
Jane.

82
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,760
I just took Lin to the airport.

83
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,880
Where is she going?

84
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,560
Um…

85
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,280
She's going to study abroad.

86
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,360
She probably won't be back for years.

87
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,800
She didn't tell you?

88
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,760
CAN I LOVE YOU?

89
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,120
CAN I LOVE YOU?

90
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,160
Jane.

91
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,440
Aren't you happy to see me back?

92
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,360
Why should I be?

93
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,600
Move. I'm walking.

94
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,360
But I missed you.

95
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Missed me?

96
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,160
If you missed me, why didn't you
reach out? Why didn't you call? Text?

97
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,720
If you're going to lie,
make it believable.

98
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,840
Are you really going to treat me
like I'm a stranger?

99
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,240
Yes.

100
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,880
But we're friends.

101
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,240
We used to be. Not anymore.

102
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,360
Jane, please listen to me.

103
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,960
It's been eight years, Lin.

104
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,200
Eight years since you left my life.

105
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,920
You think just coming back
makes everything the same?

106
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,640
We're not friends anymore.

107
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,400
Get out of my house.

108
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,480
By now, they're probably chatting away.

109
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,520
I just want them to make up.
So, how long is Lin staying?

110
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,560
Probably not long.

111
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,880
She's always so busy.

112
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,240
I don't know how she found time
to come home this time.

113
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,520
And what about her girlfriend?

114
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,520
The one she was going to marry?

115
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,480
You mean Kate?

116
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,480
I'd love to meet her.

117
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,840
I want you to meet her.

118
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,200
Kate's amazing.

119
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,360
Lin's really lucky.

120
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,440
She has a stable career abroad,

121
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,040
and her girlfriend

122
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,360
is the daughter of a major
fashion manufacturer in New York.

123
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,400
I can die in peace now, honestly.

124
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,880
I heard you're in Thailand.

125
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,400
Wanna meet tonight?

126
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,600
How's your mom?

127
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,440
She works every day. She's at the office
more than her employees are.

128
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,920
The owner is working so hard.

129
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,160
That's why "W"
is one of the top fashion magazines.

130
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,640
So, are you here on business?

131
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,720
I'm on vacation.

132
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,160
Thank you.

133
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,560
You miss home, don't you?

134
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,920
Yeah…

135
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,920
Actually, I'm thinking

136
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,440
of moving back for work too.

137
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,359
Are you serious?

138
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,480
I'm serious.

139
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,840
My mom's here. She won't move to New York.

140
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,320
So I want to be here for her.

141
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,760
But if a good opportunity comes up,

142
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,880
I might go back.

143
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,520
Why are you walking around? Come here.

144
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,640
Did you talk to Lin at all today?

145
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,160
No.

146
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,960
You haven't seen each other in so long,
and you didn't even catch up?

147
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
I didn't want to know anyway.

148
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,520
I've been wanting to try
this chef's table place

149
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,520
but I can never get a reservation.

150
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,280
It's that hard to book?

151
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,080
Yeah. It's fully booked until next year.

152
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,760
There are only two or three tables,
and it's always packed.

153
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,880
They won't even add more tables.

154
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,040
Look. It's called Jane's Table.
People tag it nonstop.

155
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,560
It looks simple but kind of appetizing.

156
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Right?

157
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,160
I just wanna see
if it's really worth the hype.

158
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,040
I see.

159
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,480
This is the owner.

160
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,600
If I can get a reservation,
will you go with me?

161
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,120
Of course.

162
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,800
Where is she? Why isn't she back yet?

163
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,120
Not that I care.

164
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,000
Jane!

165
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,800
Are you hurt? Did I bump into you?

166
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,120
Can you get up?

167
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,240
Come home late and drive carelessly.

168
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,800
Jane, can I just say I'm sorry?

169
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,280
Jane.

170
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,800
Go back to your life in New York.

171
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,680
Your job, your fiancée,

172
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,960
your whole life is there.

173
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,640
I'm just part of your past.

174
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,800
You didn't read the documents I gave you,

175
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,000
Lin?

176
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,800
There's nothing left for me in New York.

177
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,840
Yes, Lin?

178
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,280
Hello, Aunt Tuk.

179
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,840
I was calling to see if I could
reserve a table at Jane's restaurant.

180
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Oh my, I'm afraid
I can't help with that, dear.

181
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,800
You'll have to talk to Jane yourself.

182
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,920
I'll pass the phone to her.

183
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,880
Auntie. Aunt Tuk, wait.

184
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,200
There are hundreds of restaurants,
why does it have to be this one?

185
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,080
‎You've got a call.

186
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,200
ALIN

187
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,440
Lin wants to talk to you.

188
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,080
I'm busy.

189
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,920
Jane, Lin can hear you.

190
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,440
Good.
Then she'll know I don't want to talk.

191
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
Jane.

192
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,840
Don't call me.

193
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,600
The tables are full. If she wants to eat,
she can book it herself.

194
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,560
It's available online. No need to call.

195
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,840
HANG UP

196
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,000
Oops.

197
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,120
Lin…

198
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,680
I heard everything, Aunt Tuk.

199
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,160
Thank you.

200
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,000
You!

201
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,520
When she left, you were heartbroken.

202
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,400
Now she's back,
and you won't even talk to her nicely.

203
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,040
Your friend doesn't come back often.
Won't you talk to her?

204
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,520
Better off without a friend like that.

205
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,000
Why?

206
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,560
Why are you so mad at me?

207
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,040
Please go, Auntie. I'm not bumping her
to the front of the line anyway.

208
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,880
It's good she left.

209
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,960
And stop trying to fix things between us.

210
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,840
It'll never be the same.

211
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,240
What do you mean?

212
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,160
Ouch!

213
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,200
I'm sorry.

214
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,760
I'm sorry.

215
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,240
Are you okay?

216
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,800
I'm so sorry, Lin.

217
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,080
I'm sorry.

218
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,400
Let's go outside.

219
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,840
Sit here.

220
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,720
Are you hurt?

221
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,480
Wait a sec.

222
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
-Ah.
-I'm sorry.

223
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,560
I'm sorry.

224
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,080
Is that gentle enough?

225
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,600
Does it still hurt?

226
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,920
I'm not hurting anymore.

227
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Are you done…

228
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,680
being mad at me yet?

229
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Not yet.

230
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,400
You shoved your face so close.
My ears are all red.

231
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,880
Why are you following me?

232
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,680
It's just one table.
If you don't have one,

233
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,680
I can carry one over from my house.

234
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,520
What, you really want
to eat here that badly?

235
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,840
Someone really wants to eat here
but couldn't book it.

236
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,760
And she's very important to me.

237
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,120
Is it Kate?

238
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,720
No.

239
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,920
Don't be shy about it. You posted
about the engagement all over Facebook.

240
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,520
Even if you didn't invite me,
it's not like I wouldn't find out.

241
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,680
If Kate wants to come,
I'll reserve a special table just for her,

242
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,200
as a wedding gift.

243
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,080
Lin.

244
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,040
-Lin.
-I don't want the reservation anymore.

245
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,400
Let go!

246
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,640
Jane, are you hurt? I'm sorry.

247
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,960
What's wrong?

248
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,640
Did you have a problem with Kate?

249
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,320
I broke up with Kate.

250
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,000
So you came back
because you broke up with Kate?

251
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,120
There won't be a wedding anymore.

252
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,360
Are you smiling?

253
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,640
No.

254
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,160
Are you feeling smug?

255
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,800
Don't be silly.
No one feels happy about a breakup.

256
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,440
Did you tell your mom yet?

257
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,320
No.

258
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,680
You're the first one I told.

259
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,600
When are you going to tell her?

260
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,080
I don't want to.

261
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,640
Are you feeling better?

262
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,320
If so, then go home.

263
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,680
Can I stay a little longer?

264
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,160
I don't want to be alone in my room.

265
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,920
I always wondered

266
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
how someone who hates the cold like you,
could survive in New York.

267
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,320
You'd freeze to death.

268
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,560
I almost did.
Good thing I bought a heater in time.

269
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,360
Are you faking being sad?

270
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,600
Can I make a reservation?

271
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,080
No.

272
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,200
Just two seats.

273
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,760
No girlfriend, so who are you eating with?

274
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,560
A model.

275
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,560
You just broke up
and already have someone new?

276
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,640
No.

277
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,400
Then who is she?

278
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,040
Just a friend.

279
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,840
She said she really wanted to try
your food, so I said I'd get her a table.

280
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,120
I'm close with the owner.

281
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,760
Used to be.

282
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Now go home.

283
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,480
It's just one table, Jane.
Why are you being so possessive?

284
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,199
It's my restaurant. If I want
to be possessive, that's my business.

285
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,480
Do good to get good back, huh?

286
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,400
You left your hair wet too long.
You'll catch a cold.

287
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,640
Wait.

288
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,800
Me drying your hair just now

289
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,000
didn't make you
even a little less mad at me?

290
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,440
Thanks for drying my hair.

291
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,120
That's it?

292
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,240
Mhm. Yeah. Thanks.

293
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,640
And the table?

294
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,280
You just did it for the payoff.

295
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,720
Once she's off work, I'll get her drunk.
Maybe she'll give me a table more easily.

296
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,800
All set.

297
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,680
Jane, the customer at table one
wants to speak with you.

298
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,080
How good is the food here?

299
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,760
There are so many customers.

300
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,800
Your food is really delicious.

301
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,880
I wasn't planning to wait,

302
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,920
but now that I did , it's totally
worth it, even after all these months.

303
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,760
It's just simple home-cooked food.

304
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,000
Then the food at your home
must be amazing.

305
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,320
Closed already?

306
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,200
Are you not even
gonna care about me at all?

307
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,080
Why are you drinking?

308
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,080
How did I end up like this, Jane?

309
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,280
Like what?

310
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,160
I studied hard,

311
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,120
top of the class,

312
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,480
got a scholarship,

313
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,960
graduated with honors…

314
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,920
Why is my life falling apart like this?

315
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,200
You're drunk.

316
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,840
Go home.

317
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,840
I'm not going.

318
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,880
So what?

319
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,720
You're just gonna sit here
and drink alone?

320
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,520
Then sit and drink with me.

321
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,080
Alright, that's the last one.

322
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,720
These chairs are so comfy.

323
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,520
I'm gonna take a photo.

324
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,040
Why?

325
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,720
To show her

326
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,840
that without her,

327
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,640
I can still be happy.

328
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,440
Alright. I'll take it for you.

329
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,960
Take one with me.

330
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,760
Why did you break up with her?

331
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,000
Lin…

332
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,760
Do you miss her?

333
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,720
Why would I miss her, Jane?

334
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,920
Then why are you crying?

335
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,880
Why the hell would I miss her?

336
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,480
Why would I?

337
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,840
I saw her with a guy in bed.

338
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,560
You don't believe me?

339
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,800
Huh?

340
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,560
You don't believe me?

341
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,480
It's not that I don't believe you.

342
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,440
Like this.

343
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,400
Look, Jane.

344
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,600
I saw them like this.

345
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,920
Kate doesn't like women.

346
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,800
She likes men.

347
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,040
It hurts, Jane.

348
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,600
It hurts so much, right here.

349
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,840
Does it still hurt?

350
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,880
This bakery went viral
for being super good.

351
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,480
I was nearby, so I brought you some.

352
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,920
Thank you.

353
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,120
Is she a model or a thief?

354
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,240
This is for you.

355
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,360
What do I have to do

356
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,760
for you to forgive me?

357
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,800
