1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,440
But Kate still won over Aunt Aom.

2
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,920
But if it means being blind and stupid,

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,960
I'd rather earn my own and keep my pride.

4
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,600
Even if I pay any amount,
you still won't do it?

5
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,880
-Correct.
-They say sharp tongue, delicious food.

6
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,120
I guess that's true.

7
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,960
When I shoot for the magazine,

8
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,720
come with me.

9
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,040
Ms. Lin is here.

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,520
Did she come alone?

11
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,000
She's with another woman.

12
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,040
Lin.

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,960
DUTCHMILL

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,800
Good job.

15
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,160
Yeah!

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,640
-It hurts.
-Jane.

17
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,040
Jane.

18
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,440
Let me put this here.

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
So you'll know I care.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,880
Thanks.

21
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,680
Get well soon.

22
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,400
‎PARTNER

23
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,000
HEART PARTNER

24
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,200
Jane!

25
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
Jane!

26
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,440
Lin.

27
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,600
I'm so sorry!

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,240
It's okay.

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,880
Are you alright?

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,640
It hurts.

31
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,200
-Thank you.
-Sure!

32
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,360
Thank you.

33
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,920
I'm hungry.

34
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,840
Do I look good?

35
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,400
Why won't you look at me?

36
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,920
Am I not pretty enough?

37
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,920
You're pretty.

38
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,520
I'm just afraid

39
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,760
I won't be able to hold back.

40
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,400
You said you couldn't hold back.

41
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,880
We're here to work today.

42
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,640
Tawan.

43
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,519
You can't do it.

44
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,600
The staff might come in.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,240
I was just inviting you to lunch.

46
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,920
If my bodyguard doesn't eat,

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,200
what if something happens to me
while I'm eating alone?

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,040
I'll do CPR, I guess.

49
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,200
Tawan!

50
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,240
Come on.

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,960
Let's eat and get ready.

52
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,800
Ms. Ayla.

53
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,720
If you're done with lunch,
please let the costume team know.

54
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Sure.

55
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,680
Fah, Lin got clipped by a car.

56
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,040
She must be hurt.

57
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,280
-Let's check on her.
-Let's go.

58
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,440
Tawan,

59
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,240
let's go check on Ms. Lin.

60
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,360
Maybe someone staged this?

61
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,320
If they did, I know what I have to do.

62
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,040
Does it hurt?

63
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,360
Ms. Lin, are you okay?

64
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,400
I dodged the car

65
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,840
but fell and hit the ground.

66
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm sorry for causing such a big deal.

67
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,800
Don't worry about it.
But is your hand okay?

68
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,400
Tawan, can you take a look?

69
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,920
Sure. May I?

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,920
Yes.

71
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,760
You need to go to the hospital.

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,040
-That bad?
-Is it serious?

73
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,600
I don't think it's a full break,

74
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,040
probably just a fracture.

75
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,200
But you should get an X-ray to confirm.

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
But I don't want to mess up today's shoot.

77
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,680
No worries.
If we need to cancel today's shoot,

78
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,800
I'll reschedule.

79
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,920
But you can't work like this anyway.

80
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,560
Go to the hospital first.
We'll decide after.

81
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,160
I'm really sorry.

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,400
Ms. Lin, I really want to work with you.

83
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,400
No matter what,
I'll definitely do this shoot with you.

84
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,320
But today,
please go to the hospital first.

85
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,920
It's fractured. You'll need a cast.

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,960
Will it be long?

87
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,840
It's just a fracture.
It shouldn't take long.

88
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,960
But you probably can't go back
to work today.

89
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,200
Your right hand won't be able to move yet.

90
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,560
I'll be back with the order slip.

91
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,880
Alright.

92
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,280
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,640
I didn't walk carefully.

94
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,000
It's alright. I'll be fine in no time.

95
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,960
-But your work--
-I already talked to Ayla.

96
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,120
She'll reschedule.

97
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,560
Lin.

98
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
For today's shoot,

99
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,720
I'll have to find
someone else to replace you.

100
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,720
The client wants it
for the next issue launch.

101
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,200
It ties into their product debut.

102
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,080
That's okay. I understand.

103
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,480
Please let me
take the patient to get the cast.

104
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,640
Sure.

105
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,800
If it weren't for you,

106
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,160
everything would've gone smoothly.

107
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,840
I would've finished the job
the way I wanted.

108
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,520
And Lin could've done the job she wanted.

109
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,680
She must be disappointed,

110
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,200
doing all that prep just to have
someone else take the credit

111
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,280
because of you.

112
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,680
Think about it.

113
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,600
You're a good chef.
Maybe stick to the kitchen

114
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,440
instead of ruining things for others.

115
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,320
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,560
You got hurt because of me.

117
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,560
And you didn't get to do what you planned.

118
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,440
It's really okay. I'll be
able to work again once I'm healed.

119
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,880
But I don't know
if they'll give you the job again.

120
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,080
It's fine if they do.
If not, that's okay too.

121
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,960
I'd rather get hurt

122
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
than see something happen to you.

123
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,360
Poof! Get well soon.

124
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,480
Poof! Fall in love with me forever.

125
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,920
I already love you like crazy.

126
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,240
Ms. Pie.

127
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Don't do it, Lin.

128
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,840
Until you're healed,
I'll take care of everything.

129
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,040
Really?

130
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,120
What?

131
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,240
I'm waiting.

132
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,120
For what?

133
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
You said you'd do everything.

134
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,040
You're silly. I'll wash these glasses.

135
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,080
Let me wash the glasses first.

136
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,400
Fine, I'll stop teasing.

137
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Lin!

138
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,600
By the way,

139
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,720
if Pie still wants to eat
at the restaurant, just tell me.

140
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,080
I'll make room for her.

141
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,160
Are you serious?

142
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Yes.

143
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,360
I feel like I wronged her too.

144
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,960
She probably already
committed to her clients,

145
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,120
but after what happened,

146
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,160
she's probably speechless too.

147
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,480
You're seriously the sweetest.

148
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,720
Are you done washing?

149
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,560
Can I ask for one thing?

150
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,480
Could you help me with the soap?

151
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,360
I can't scrub properly with the cast.

152
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,040
Isn't your arm tired?

153
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,920
Of course it is.

154
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,640
It won't get wet. Put it down already.

155
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,400
It's wrapped tighter than a sausage.
It's waterproof.

156
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,160
I just don't want it to get wet.
It might itch later.

157
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,280
Rest it here, then.

158
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,840
That way it stays dry.

159
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,120
Thank you.

160
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,320
You're welcome.

161
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,640
That's how you know I care.

162
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,600
You still remember?

163
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,920
Of course.

164
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,720
I remember everything about you.

165
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Now go to sleep.

166
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,240
Good night.

167
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,200
Wait,

168
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,200
why are you sleeping on the floor?

169
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,520
Afraid you'll hurt my hand?

170
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,920
Sleep next to me.

171
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,400
Here.

172
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,120
I'll rest my arm like this.

173
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,360
Even if you move, it won't hurt.

174
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,040
See? It doesn't hurt.

175
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,760
DUTCHMILL

176
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,040
What are you doing?

177
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,240
Sit down.

178
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,320
I just wanted to drink it.

179
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,040
I just put it in the fridge.
Let it chill for a bit longer.

180
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,200
Fine.

181
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,600
Just watch. No need to help.

182
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,600
The doctor took the cast off already.
I can help now.

183
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,280
They just removed it yesterday,
and you're already acting tough?

184
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,880
Pie's coming to the restaurant today.

185
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,319
I remember.

186
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,319
I love you
more than anything in this world.

187
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,480
What? Where did that come from?

188
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,840
I just don't want you to worry about Pie.

189
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,720
I'm not worried anymore.

190
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,000
I know you love me.

191
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,880
I thought you might be upset.

192
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,200
I love you, Lin.

193
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,120
So, so much.

194
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,000
I waited for you for eight years,

195
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,720
not even knowing when you'd come back.

196
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,320
When you left for the US,

197
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,080
I waited every day for you to call,

198
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,520
for a whole year.

199
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,960
And I never gave up.

200
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,880
Happy birthday, Jane.

201
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,640
I hope you're really happy.

202
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,120
How are you this year?
This year's been crazy.

203
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,600
I've been adjusting, in and out of class…

204
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,920
I miss you.

205
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,480
Yes, I understand.

206
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,520
I won't contact her again.

207
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,800
Honestly, I feel guilty.

208
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,480
I told Lin not to call Jane.

209
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,360
You felt bad for Jane, didn't you?

210
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,400
You know,

211
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,480
Jane completely fell apart.
She couldn't eat, couldn't sleep.

212
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,160
All she did was cry.

213
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,600
Does Jane know

214
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,040
that Lin tried to contact her?

215
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,600
No. I never told her.

216
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,440
If they reconcile,
you're gonna be exposed for sure.

217
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,480
Ugh. I know…

218
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,760
If there hadn't been that accident
and you hadn't hurt her hand,

219
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
I never would've gotten
to eat at Jane's restaurant

220
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,440
Her place is always packed.
It's hard to squeeze into the schedule.

221
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,800
Excuse me, your food has arrived.

222
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,760
Thank you.

223
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,720
Let me see your hand.

224
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,600
Is that the one?

225
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,120
Of course, that's definitely her.

226
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,320
The cast's removed, but it still hurts
a little when I move it.

227
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,760
Once it's fully healed, you have to
shoot the cover for me again, okay?

228
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,040
The doctor said no touching,
it might cause inflammation.

229
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,920
But Lin said it doesn't hurt anymore.

230
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Even if it doesn't, still no touching.

231
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,280
The food will be out shortly.

232
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,160
Oh, hell no.

233
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,840
That girl is a certified script body.

234
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,800
What the hell is a "script body"?

235
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,880
Trash, basically.

236
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,360
Are you insulting me?

237
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Not you! But you need to tell Jane.

238
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,320
What's going on?

239
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,520
Jane, you need to hear
what Bam has to say.

240
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,280
Tell me later. Let's finish serving first.

241
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,120
No. This can't wait.

242
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,280
Exactly.

243
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,600
Why can't it wait?

244
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,360
Because it's about
that woman sitting outside with Lin.

245
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,480
Exactly.

246
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,120
She's everywhere.

247
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,520
She has a lot of friends?

248
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,080
She's a scammer.

249
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,920
She brings a different guy
to dinner every day.

250
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,600
My server friend said

251
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,360
this woman is a total flirt.

252
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,880
The guys she brings are all high rollers.

253
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,440
They said she always
pitches some kind of project.

254
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,200
At first it seems professional,

255
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,840
but then it turns into
touching and flirting.

256
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,360
She must be trying to catch rich men.

257
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,880
All men?

258
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,640
Women too, but mostly men.

259
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,680
So she's into anyone?

260
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,880
As long as they've got money.

261
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,120
That's spicy.

262
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,120
If you're free--

263
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,240
She's not.

264
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,760
Lin has to help me with work.

265
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
What do you have to help Jane with?

266
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,520
Photoshoots.

267
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,160
Photos? Of Jane?

268
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,240
Of the food menu.

269
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,800
But you're not a food photographer.

270
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,520
Wouldn't it be better
to find someone experienced?

271
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,080
If you don't know anyone,
I can find someone.

272
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,320
No one else would do.

273
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,600
Lin's exactly who I want.

274
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,760
What's going on?!

275
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,080
What's happening?!

276
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,720
Jane.

277
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,320
Jane.

278
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,760
Jane!

279
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,320
Someone call an ambulance!

280
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,480
-Jane!
-Jane!

281
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,880
Jane!

282
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,320
Jane!

283
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,160
Jane!

284
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,000
Jane!

285
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,080
Jane!

286
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,680
Are you okay, Lin?

287
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,720
I'm fine.

288
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm more worried about you.

289
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,480
You were bleeding so much.

290
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,840
Lie down and stay with me.

291
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,920
I'll be alright.

292
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,160
I'll be here to hold you till we're old.

293
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,560
Will the person who did this
come back again?

294
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,760
I don't know.

295
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,320
Then you need to be careful
until we know who it was.

296
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,920
Probably just some hooligans.

297
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,440
You need to report it.

298
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,320
Jane!

299
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,640
How are you?

300
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,880
I think I was sleeping too deeply.

301
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,680
Don't sleep so deeply.

302
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,000
Where does it hurt?

303
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,080
Here.

304
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,120
But you're okay now, right?

305
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,000
Hello, Auntie Aom.

306
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,280
How are you, dear?

307
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,520
I'm okay now.

308
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,440
Alright.

309
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,320
Who told you and--

310
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,360
Pete called me.

311
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,200
Tim?

312
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,680
What are these flowers? They're cute.

313
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,440
Lilies have tiny flowers like these?

314
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,600
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
TIM

315
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,920
You're not going to tell
your business partner

316
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,440
someone threw a rock at the restaurant?

317
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,480
We'll have to close for a couple of days.

318
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,440
Hey,

319
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm not worried about the restaurant.

320
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm worried about you.

321
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Well,

322
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,160
I'll go to the bathroom.

323
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,480
Come, I'll--

324
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,040
I'll help her.

325
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,480
Aren't you going to talk to your daughter?

326
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,200
I'll talk later, at home.

327
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,240
Alright.

328
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,800
Okay.

329
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,040
You want to ask about Tim, don't you?

330
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,720
Oh.

331
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,600
Aren't you going to the bathroom?

332
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,480
Nope.

333
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,520
I'd rather answer your questions.

334
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,680
Who is Tim?

335
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,520
My business partner.

336
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,280
I already knew that.

337
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,880
Oh? So what do you want to know?

338
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,480
What's your relationship with him?

339
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,080
Friends.

340
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,560
But from the flowers at the restaurant,
it seems like more.

341
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,920
An anniversary bouquet.

342
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,560
Anniversary of the restaurant.

343
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,400
It opened on the 15th.

344
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,880
He sends flowers
on the 15th of every month.

345
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,560
But if he doesn't like you,

346
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,240
why would he send them every month?

347
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,520
I don't know about his side.

348
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,920
But for me, my girlfriend is right here.

349
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,960
Why would I care about anyone else?

350
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,120
Be careful.

351
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,000
Alright.

352
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,080
Jane, Auntie Aom and I
are heading out now.

353
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,240
Lin, come with us.

354
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,240
I need to talk to you.

355
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,120
Lin.

356
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,160
Have you spoken with Kate
since this happened?

357
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,920
No.

358
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,120
She didn't call?

359
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,600
No.

360
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,760
She didn't call, or you didn't pick up?

361
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,080
Why should I pick up?

362
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,200
There's nothing left to talk about.
From what I've seen,

363
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,200
there's nothing left to explain.

364
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,560
I know

365
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,440
it's hard at first,

366
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,000
but over time, anger can fade.

367
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,120
When it does,
you might be ready to listen.

368
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Mom,

369
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,040
maybe one day I'll forgive Kate.

370
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,760
But I'll never understand
how she could do that to me.

371
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,400
I'm sorry I disappointed you
and upset you with my decision, Mom.

372
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,200
But I will never get back with Kate.

373
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,280
I'm sorry

374
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,160
I can't be the daughter you're proud of.

375
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,920
Why are you still here? Go home.

376
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,160
I'll help run the restaurant for now.

377
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,160
No need.

378
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,840
It's just a head wound,
not a brain injury.

379
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,360
I can still work.

380
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,320
How are you supposed to work?

381
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,360
The doctor told you to rest for a week.

382
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,040
Don't worry. I'll get the glass fixed

383
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,680
and reschedule the customers.

384
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,480
Then I'll leave it to you.

385
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,000
You can leave anything to me.

386
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,440
Then go do what you need to do.

387
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,360
I've waited for you for years.

388
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,160
And I've told you
so many times not to wait.

389
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,320
But you don't have anyone.

390
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,880
Even so,

391
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,920
I still don't like you.

392
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,000
We're just friends.

393
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,320
You can't change that.

394
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,960
And I want to tell you,

395
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,080
no matter what you say,
you can't change how I feel either.

396
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,120
I'll go.

397
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,040
Lin.

398
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,199
Jane.

399
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
I know

400
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,280
living to make Mom proud is one thing.

401
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,000
But I want to live
in a way I'm proud of too.

402
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,440
You said you don't want to go home.
Where will you stay?

403
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,280
I don't know yet.

404
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,400
How long can you keep running away?

405
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,400
Problems are meant to be solved. Will you
run from your mom your whole life?

406
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,120
You can't stop being her daughter.

407
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,600
You're her daughter.
You have to go back and face it.

408
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,480
Even if you run away,

409
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,600
the problem's still there
until it's fixed.

410
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,840
I thought you were going to tell her
"It's okay to break up with Kate."

411
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,600
"Being single doesn't kill anyone.
You have a job, you earn money."

412
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,760
But you.

413
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,920
Ugh, we already talked about this.

414
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,880
You're being a terrible mother, you know?

415
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,920
Your child's life is her own.

416
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,520
Our only job is to raise them with love

417
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,680
and make sure they're not
a burden to society.

418
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,560
That's it.

419
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,720
That's it, Aom.

420
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,280
Do you want to know

421
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,120
why I asked Lin to think again about Kate?

422
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,920
Then tell me.

423
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,920
Read this.

424
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,840
I have one more favor to ask.

425
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,200
What is it?

426
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,840
Can you stop seeing Pie?

427
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,720
Are you jealous?

428
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,200
A little.

429
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,080
Mostly concerned.

430
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,840
About what?

431
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,680
I heard she often goes out to eat

432
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,680
with both women and men.

433
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,840
Maybe she's just networking.

434
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,120
I think it's more than that.

435
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,040
Please stay away from her.

436
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,280
I can't.

437
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,920
I don't have a choice.

438
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,240
I got fired from my job in New York, Jane.

439
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,840
Why didn't you say anything?

440
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,880
I was embarrassed.

441
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,880
Why?

442
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,760
I used to be successful,

443
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,800
but now I've lost everything.

444
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,320
I just want a way out

445
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,920
where people won't look down on me.

446
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,280
I don't want Mom to think

447
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,560
I can't support her.

448
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,120
Pie is the best option I have right now.

449
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,320
If I come back
and get into a big-name magazine,

450
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,200
it'll be a good reason to return.

451
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,160
Who are you doing this for?

452
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,880
For strangers on social media?

453
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,360
Or for Aunt Aom?

454
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,520
What's done is done.
You have to accept it.

455
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,960
And start again with what makes you happy.

456
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,520
If you're still happy taking pictures,

457
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,880
keep doing it.

458
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,800
Do it without comparing yourself.

459
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,040
Life goes up and down.

460
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,040
But find a way to be happy
even when it's down,

461
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,480
not like this.

462
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,760
No matter what you decide,
I'll be here with you.

463
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,400
Oh, hello, Mr. Tim.

464
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,560
Hello.

465
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,840
Have the police left?

466
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,360
Yes, they're gone.

467
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,320
I think we need to install
more cameras inside.

468
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,360
Outside is not enough.

469
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,200
I'll talk to Jane about it.

470
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,120
Okay.

471
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,680
Did you call the glass shop yet?

472
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,680
They said they'd come measure

473
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,800
and get back to us.

474
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,800
They're super busy. It should take

475
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,040
about a week.

476
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,920
A week.

477
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,160
Hello, Mr. Tim.

478
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,720
I've already called the customers

479
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,880
and rearranged next week's reservations

480
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,840
like you asked.

481
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,000
Thanks.

482
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,320
Actually, I wanted
to ask you both something.

483
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,240
Yes?

484
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,640
I want to know who Lin is.

485
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,760
Lin.

486
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,080
Are you alright?

487
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,760
Come sit here.

488
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,000
What's wrong?

489
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,680
Smile.

490
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,360
A real smile.

491
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,000
Give your girlfriend a smile.

492
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,440
Here too.

493
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,440
And here.

494
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,440
Where else?

495
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,000
Here.

496
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,240
Anywhere else?

497
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,160
That's enough,

498
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,520
it'll turn into something
more than a kiss.

499
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,960
It took you a long time to laugh.

500
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,520
I just

501
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,120
want to see you smile.

502
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,680
Thank you.

503
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,000
You're my little bundle of joy.

504
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,600
Are you okay?

505
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,000
Go wait at home first. I'll catch up.

506
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,800
Stay away from Lin,

507
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,200
no matter if it's about
work or investments.

508
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,920
Or I'll testify
where all of this really came from.

509
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,360
That's defamation, unless you have proof.

510
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,040
You've always inspired me.

511
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,920
I wanted to cook for someone I love.

512
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,800
I wanted to open a restaurant
with food so good,

513
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,640
that one day, if you ever wanted
to eat at my restaurant,

514
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,280
I would see you again.

515
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,840
