1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,240
Such nice weather.

2
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,240
I only took a short drive from Bangkok.

3
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,920
Don't do that, Jane.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
-Do what?
-What you're doing.

5
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,400
You should go put on an apron.

6
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,280
CAN I LOVE YOU?

7
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,200
It's here.

8
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
Come, I'll help you put it on.

9
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,520
You loved me, Jane?

10
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
Let's do homework.

11
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,479
If I'm not here one day, who'll tutor you?

12
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,720
No one.

13
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,600
Oh?

14
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,320
Because you'll never leave me.

15
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,680
How do you know?

16
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,200
Because I won't let you leave.

17
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,760
And I promise,

18
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,600
no matter what happens,

19
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,520
I won't leave you either.

20
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,760
Promise.

21
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,200
What's wrong? Hesitating?

22
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,360
Your grades are so low.

23
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,840
What if
we get into different universities?

24
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,280
Are you bullying me about my grades?

25
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,240
-Are you a bully?
-No!

26
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,640
-Lin!
-You wanna fight?

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,440
Take this!

28
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,000
Promise me that you won't leave me.

29
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,040
Promise me you won't leave me.

30
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,880
Or will you?

31
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,680
Promise me.

32
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,320
Promise me.

33
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,400
Please.

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,240
Fine.

35
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,360
Here.

36
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,960
QUESTION

37
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,120
ANSWER

38
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,040
When I came to get the apron,

39
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,160
I found this shirt.

40
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,480
That's your shirt, the one
you gave me to sign after graduation.

41
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,760
Did you ever read what I wrote on it?

42
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,600
No. I didn't have time.

43
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,200
That day I rushed to sign yours

44
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,600
and return it,

45
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,440
but by the time I got to your house,
you were gone…

46
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,880
without a word.

47
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,920
I'm sorry, Jane.

48
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,320
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

49
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,200
I had so many chances, but…

50
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,560
I didn't dare.

51
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,320
And you chose to leave
without saying anything.

52
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,240
Jane,

53
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,920
It's my fault.

54
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,920
I was afraid if you told me not to go,

55
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,320
I'd change my mind.

56
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,720
You're that important to me, Jane.

57
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,320
No one can replace you.

58
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,760
You're the best friend I've ever had.

59
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,920
What if I don't want
to be your best friend?

60
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,960
Jane…

61
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,120
You asked

62
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,520
if I still loved you.

63
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,840
If I do…

64
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,160
can you love me?

65
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,520
I haven't wanted to be just your friend…

66
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,480
for a long time.

67
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,200
Lin,

68
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,440
Kate sent so many gifts.

69
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,160
Come look.

70
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,720
At first, I didn't know who would send

71
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,120
such a huge box.

72
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,440
See?

73
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,640
Even when you're apart,
she still sends these things.

74
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,800
Such a lovely girl.

75
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,920
It makes me so happy

76
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,400
seeing Kate look after you.

77
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,120
What's wrong?

78
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,240
Why are you crying?

79
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,200
I broke up with Kate, Mom.

80
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,760
Why?

81
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,760
She was with someone else.

82
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,760
How do you know?

83
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,320
I saw it with my own eyes.

84
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,560
She was in bed with a man.

85
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,680
You know

86
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,200
how it feels to be betrayed, don't you?

87
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,400
I know.

88
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,720
And I know I made mistakes too.

89
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,120
I don't want you
to make the same mistakes I did.

90
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,520
You didn't make mistakes, Mom.

91
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,680
Yes, I did.

92
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,720
I walked out, and the mistress swooped in.

93
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,240
I slaved away, barely surviving,

94
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,080
just to take care of myself and raise you

95
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,280
while they lived comfortably.

96
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,560
The one in trouble was me.

97
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,000
I wanted to take the best care of you.

98
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,280
And who lived comfortably? That mistress.

99
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,480
The mistress became the legal wife,

100
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,680
admired and respected.

101
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,680
Who even remembers
she was once a mistress?

102
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,440
Lin,

103
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,720
why couldn't you just close one eye?

104
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,200
I don't want you to be stupid
and walk away like I did.

105
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,680
If you walk away now, you get nothing.

106
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,560
But if you stay,

107
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,680
even if those two love each other,

108
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
everything will still be yours.

109
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't want you to struggle like me.

110
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,200
Better to endure than to suffer.

111
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,040
How long
can a photographer's career really last?

112
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,440
Someday you won't earn
as much as you do now.

113
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,280
What then?

114
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,240
Think carefully.

115
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,440
Oh my, with that much green,
I'll have to invest more.

116
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,200
Wow.

117
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,120
AOM

118
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,000
Whoa, Aom, you're interrupting me.

119
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,160
Yes, Aom?

120
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,320
Calm down. Do you want to go out and talk?

121
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,320
Alright.

122
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,680
What's wrong with Aunt Aom?

123
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,800
She had a fight with Lin. A big one.

124
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,840
You go check on Lin.

125
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,920
Hurry up.

126
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Lin.

127
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,720
I know you can hear me.

128
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,320
If what I said earlier made you upset,

129
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,680
I'm sorry.

130
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,120
If you can only see me as a friend,

131
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,080
then I'll just be a friend.

132
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,960
I just want you to know

133
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,400
I'll always be by your side.

134
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,920
Remember our promise?

135
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,960
That I'd never leave you?

136
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
I really meant it.

137
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,040
I already sent your shirt to the cleaners.

138
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,320
CAN I LOVE YOU?

139
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,680
If you have time,

140
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,320
read what Lin wrote.

141
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,560
Nothing.

142
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,079
Lin.

143
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,319
Jane.

144
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,160
I didn't mean it like that.

145
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,200
Mean what?

146
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,640
I wasn't angry

147
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,280
when you asked if I could love you.

148
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,760
I wasn't angry

149
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,160
when you kissed me.

150
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,800
I feel good when I'm with you.

151
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,280
You make me feel

152
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,320
excited when you come close,

153
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,840
shy when you look at me.

154
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,000
Since I came back,

155
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,880
it's not the same anymore.

156
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,400
It's more than friendship.

157
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,280
What are these flowers? So cute.

158
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,400
Lily of the valley.

159
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,960
They're this tiny?

160
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,240
Jane.

161
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,360
Jane, there are flowers
delivered at the front.

162
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,920
Same sender, same flowers. Every 15th,

163
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,760
like lottery day.

164
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,560
If I finish the food photos today,

165
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,960
can I take one of you too?

166
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,520
Up to you.

167
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,840
Jane,

168
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,680
I'll put the flowers in a vase.

169
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,080
I'll get the vase.

170
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,480
Let's go.

171
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,720
Go.

172
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,760
Don't you think so too?

173
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,800
I'm sure of it.

174
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,280
Sure of what?

175
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,000
They're together.

176
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,440
-Yeah.
-Oh?

177
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,640
Aren't they just close friends?

178
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,080
Come on.

179
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,440
Please.

180
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,240
The couple vibes are stronger

181
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,440
than the garlic I fried earlier.

182
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,560
If I'm wrong,

183
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,160
you can rub garlic in both my eyes.

184
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,240
You're insane.

185
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,080
What about the flower sender?

186
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,400
You do all this alone every day?

187
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,880
Don't you get bored?

188
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,520
Not really. There's one day off each week.

189
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,640
And I get to do what I love.

190
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,080
Lin.

191
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,400
Come on.

192
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,080
Jane.

193
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,480
Can I sleep over tonight?

194
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,160
I don't want to face my mom.

195
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,560
Then text Aunt Aom so she won't worry.

196
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,760
Aunt Tuk's probably over there.

197
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,360
Mom needs to vent.

198
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,120
It's good she gets to talk.
She'll be in a better mood tomorrow.

199
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,360
Right. Let her vent as much as she wants.

200
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,280
You shower first. I'll wait.

201
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,480
Why didn't you write anything
for me back then?

202
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,600
I did.

203
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,760
You never read it?

204
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,480
When you left, I was so mad.
I never looked at it.

205
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,640
I only just pulled it out today.

206
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,840
Here.

207
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,840
I'M SORRY… I COULDN'T KEEP MY PROMISE,
LIN

208
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,840
I'M SORRY… I COULDN'T KEEP MY PROMISE,
LIN

209
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,640
That time I wanted to say sorry.
But I couldn't admit…

210
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,240
I broke our promise.

211
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,120
So I wrote it on the shirt.

212
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,360
I thought if you read it,

213
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,720
you'd know…

214
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,200
I failed our promise.

215
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,520
But today…

216
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,680
can we make a new one?

217
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,560
What promise?

218
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,680
That if this doesn't work,

219
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,600
we'll go back to how we were.

220
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,320
Don't disappear from my life again.

221
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,280
Why are you staring?

222
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,680
You're making me shy.

223
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,880
Actually, I do remember that night.

224
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,200
The night you were drunk?

225
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,040
You remember everything?

226
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,840
But here,

227
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,920
I'm not hurting anymore.

228
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,280
You said you couldn't remember.

229
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,080
It just feels strange…

230
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,640
From friends, and then suddenly…

231
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,160
Does it still feel strange?

232
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,680
Does it?

233
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,120
Not anymore.

234
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,360
When you go back to New York,

235
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,920
I'll miss you so much.

236
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,720
I might not go back.

237
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,600
What about work?

238
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,040
I don't know yet.

239
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,920
But if things work out,

240
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,760
you'll be the first to know.

241
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,840
I don't want you to go anywhere.

242
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,440
I don't want to either.

243
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,240
Can't you just not answer?

244
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,840
It might be important.

245
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,200
One sec.

246
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,280
Good news?

247
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,000
Yes!

248
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,800
And I need a favor from you.

249
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,800
What could you possibly need from me?

250
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,240
A lot.

251
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,600
Will you shoot a fashion set for me?

252
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,960
How could I say no to you?

253
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,640
See you soon.

254
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,520
Pie? Why is she calling?

255
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,720
Jane.

256
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,400
What did she want, calling this early?

257
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,040
Work stuff.

258
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,920
Aunt Tuk and Aunt Aom went out of town.

259
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,680
I'M GOING TO THE BEACH WITH AUNT AOM
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. TAKE CARE. AUNT TUK

260
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,240
For over a week?

261
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
Mom must be so mad

262
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,520
she doesn't even want to see me.

263
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,400
Don't overthink it.

264
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,880
She might just need time.

265
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,000
Thanks.

266
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,720
Tasty.

267
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,720
The restaurant's closed today.
Want to go to the beach?

268
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,239
Can we go next week?

269
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,880
Are you busy?

270
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,000
Well,

271
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,719
I just made plans with Pie.

272
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,040
Well,

273
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,040
she wants to go over details.

274
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,360
Then at least eat before you go.

275
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,679
Can I eat later?

276
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,560
I need to shower
and get ready or I'll be late.

277
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,400
She's in such a rush?

278
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,920
I still need to prepare
references for her.

279
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
That's fine.

280
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,280
Thanks for understanding.

281
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,520
We can raise our kids,

282
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,520
guide them about right and wrong,

283
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,040
but in the end, it's their choice, Aom.

284
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,040
I just want her to live comfortably.

285
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,000
I don't want her to suffer like I did.

286
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,960
But it's her life, isn't it?

287
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,920
Look at Jane.

288
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,720
She was a five-star hotel chef
with a steady paycheck.

289
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,280
One day, she wanted to quit

290
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,640
to open a small restaurant at home.

291
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,240
Of course, I worried.

292
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,920
I didn't know if she'd succeed.

293
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,480
But my role is to cheer her on

294
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,560
and support her choice.

295
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,680
It's not the same, Tuk.

296
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,320
I know she has the right

297
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,480
to choose her own path.

298
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,360
Marriage is hard.

299
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,000
You've never married, you don't know.

300
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,080
Sometimes you have to close one eye.

301
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,640
Look at me.
Pride doesn't put food on the table.

302
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,040
I walked away and had to suffer alone.

303
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,560
If I had stayed and pretended not to know,

304
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,360
maybe Lin and I
wouldn't have struggled so much.

305
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,360
I just want Lin
to think of it from that side too.

306
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,440
I know she's hurt that Kate betrayed her.

307
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
But can't she forgive her?

308
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,920
Give her one more chance?

309
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,080
Maybe she just made a mistake.

310
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,800
Who else will look after her for life

311
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,560
like Kate would?

312
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,960
Your references look
exactly like what she wanted.

313
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,120
Now I believe what they say,

314
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,760
working with talented people is easy.

315
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,600
You must have some faith in me

316
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,160
to trust me with this project.

317
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,160
I like working with you…

318
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,960
specially.

319
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,520
You haven't told me

320
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,400
who the model is yet.

321
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,760
You're gonna be so happy.

322
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,280
Yeah?

323
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,920
I personally contacted her
to work with you,

324
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,600
and she accepted.

325
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,840
Who is she?

326
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,920
Ayla, the hottest singer right now.

327
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,720
She'll be thrilled

328
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,120
that the protographer

329
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,360
is you.

330
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,400
And maybe if you and I work well together,

331
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,280
we can keep doing it long-term.

332
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,320
Let's see how this one goes first.

333
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,200
Let's talk about location references

334
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,360
so we know where to shoot.

335
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,120
Planning to stay forever,
like an ancestor shrine?

336
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,800
If you're here this long,
you might as well be a spirit shrine.

337
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,600
Ancestor shrine doesn't suit you.

338
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,200
I really like you when you're working.

339
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,200
Do I look happy?

340
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,960
Yes. You look so happy.

341
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,120
It makes me enjoy the work too.

342
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,920
Before the actual shoot,

343
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,160
we'll need a location check.

344
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,720
Thank you for accepting my project.

345
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,960
Did Jane do all this by herself?

346
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,800
Done talking already?

347
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,440
Yeah. And I've got good news.

348
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
That took forever.

349
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,120
Jane, what's wrong? Are you mad?

350
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Yes.

351
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,880
Wouldn't you be
if you saw me with someone else like that?

352
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,240
You know how betrayal feels.

353
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,280
Betrayal? With Pie?

354
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,520
Jane, there's nothing like that.

355
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,560
How can you say that?
I saw it with my own eyes.

356
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,840
If you're hanging around
like a spirit shrine,

357
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,640
Shaman Jane's gonna smash it down.

358
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,240
What were you two talking about so long?

359
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,000
Jane.

360
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,960
I'm glad I ran into you.

361
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,160
Lin is so sweet, and talented too.

362
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,880
Since we'll be working together,

363
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,200
I'll see her often.

364
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,120
I think it's because

365
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,560
we're in the same field,

366
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,400
it's easy to talk, easy to click.

367
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,880
I didn't ask.

368
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,960
I just wanted to say

369
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,080
when people share interests,

370
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,120
it's easy to connect.

371
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,120
If we date,

372
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,640
I'll be seeing you a lot.

373
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,320
And if I take some of Lin's time,

374
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,120
don't be mad, okay?

375
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,800
Are you sure you weren't
talking about every single detail?

376
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,600
Jane.

377
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,840
Jane, there's nothing more than that.

378
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,600
You lied.

379
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,360
How can you lie to me so easily?

380
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,680
Just go. I want to be alone.

381
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,120
If you want to be mad, fine.

382
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,240
But won't you at least hear me out?

383
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,800
If you always assume on your own,
how can we ever work?

384
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,480
That way, your relationships
won't last with anyone, Jane.

385
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,160
Are you really not going to talk to me?

386
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,400
Jane,

387
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,480
Lin's still waiting outside.

388
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,960
How much do you trust her?

389
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,240
If you do…

390
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,560
-Then don't question it.
-Exactly.

391
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,080
You want me to be a fool?

392
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,400
Are you asking me
to be your business partner?

393
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,800
-Yes.
-I can give you time.

394
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,240
But I won't let you turn your back on me
for something I never did.

395
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,560
