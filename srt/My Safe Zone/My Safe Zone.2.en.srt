1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,880
Go back to your life in New York.

2
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,640
Your job, your fiancée.

3
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,320
There's nothing left for me in New York.

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,480
I'm thinking of moving back for work too.

5
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,720
Are you serious?

6
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,120
-Can I make a reservation?
-No.

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,720
Why is my life falling apart like this?

8
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,720
So you came back

9
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,720
because you broke up with Kate?

10
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,280
Jane, I saw them in this position.

11
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,920
Does it still hurt?

12
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,280
That's what heartbreak feels like.

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,760
Better to hurt now…

14
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,160
Than be lied to for longer.

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,200
You've never been in a relationship,
but you give great advice.

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,480
Just like you, you're good
at everything, except this.

17
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,320
-Except what?
-Love.

18
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,800
If someone doesn't love you anymore,
why keep loving them?

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,560
If they love someone else,
then breaking up is the right thing.

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,840
You may not have her anymore,
but you still have me.

21
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,640
You're up?

22
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,480
-Where's Aunt Tuk?
-She's out exercising.

23
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,520
Good. So we can talk now.

24
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Talk about what?

25
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,720
Jane, you know I woke up thinking
I had to go see a physical therapist.

26
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,200
Why?

27
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,200
My back hurts.
I thought it was a pinched nerve

28
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,080
or a slipped disc or something.

29
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,720
Your back hurts?

30
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,880
Why'd you make me sleep on the floor?

31
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,960
The bed's not even small.

32
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,279
We used to share it when we were kids.

33
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,839
Why wouldn't you let me sleep on the bed?

34
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,520
Did you do it on purpose?

35
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,080
Were you getting back at me
for leaving eight years ago?

36
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,480
No. You're the one who insisted
on sleeping on the floor.

37
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,200
No way.
I'd never ask to sleep on the floor.

38
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Lin, what's wrong?

39
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,960
You started it,
and then you just passed out?

40
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,880
Good night.

41
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,720
Let me sleep with you.

42
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,480
Do you remember anything?

43
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,080
I remember telling you
I saw those two in bed.

44
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,560
And I said who knows
how many times they've slept together.

45
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,480
That's all you remember?

46
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Nothing else?

47
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,320
What else should I remember?

48
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,640
You expect drunk people
to remember everything?

49
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,760
I bet last night you thought I was Kate.

50
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,280
No. I've moved on.
I'm not thinking about her at all.

51
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,800
Why?

52
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,240
Don't ask. Eat your soup with rice

53
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,200
so your hangover goes away.

54
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,600
And go home to shower.

55
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,040
You smell bad.

56
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,600
I don't smell.

57
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
I already changed clothes.

58
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,640
You seriously don't remember?

59
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,040
-Jane, did you wipe me down last night?
-You're still here?

60
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,280
Did you?

61
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,600
Did you? Or not?

62
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,920
I did.

63
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,760
How?

64
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,600
I took everything off.

65
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,320
Like everything, everything?

66
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,520
You were puking.
What else was I supposed to do?

67
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,200
You took off… the inside too?

68
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,200
No. I didn't change your underwear.

69
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,960
But you must've seen.

70
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,800
Seen what?

71
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,480
Well…

72
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,560
My tiny boobs.

73
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,800
Just the right size.

74
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,240
Jane!

75
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,240
Ugh, don't be shy.

76
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,680
We've changed clothes together
since we were kids.

77
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,520
Now go home.
I need to get changed for work.

78
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,800
No.

79
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,560
You saw it. You owe me a table.

80
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,720
Do I?

81
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,920
Or…

82
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,520
did you give me one last night?

83
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,120
Not yet. Now go home
so I can change for work.

84
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,520
Why are you being so stingy?
I'll only sit there for a few hours.

85
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,600
-You know what?
-Lin!

86
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,240
I'll do anything.

87
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,520
Why are you shy?

88
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,560
We've seen each other naked since forever.

89
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,480
You really won't let this go?

90
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,960
That's right.

91
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,800
I'll do anything for that table for two.

92
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,120
Anything?

93
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,680
Fine.

94
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,600
You promise?

95
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,440
But you have to help me
come up with a new menu.

96
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,480
If it's not done,
you're not getting a table.

97
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,000
Fine.

98
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,600
But can I eat first?

99
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
No.

100
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,240
You're still here?

101
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,040
The gate won't open.

102
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,680
Oops, forgot. My bad.

103
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,120
I'm so happy
I get to talk to you like this again.

104
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,520
I mean, I want the table, yeah,

105
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,800
but talking to you is even better.

106
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,120
I'm leaving.

107
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,560
Ugh! Making someone this tiny like me
lift heavy stuff? I'm gonna get ripped.

108
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,960
You can even lift it with one hand.

109
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,360
You pop birth control like candy.

110
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,080
You're not getting muscles,

111
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,320
just boobs.

112
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,480
Jane, she's bullying me. Call the cops.

113
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,120
-It's true. Look at your boobs.
-Enough.

114
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,320
Is everything delivered?

115
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,400
Yes.

116
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,880
Once you're done, wash and start chopping.

117
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,040
-Got it.
-Roger that.

118
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,680
-I'll do this.
-Jane.

119
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Can we talk now?

120
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,640
-Who's that?
-How am I supposed to know?

121
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,720
Is your restaurant really that famous?

122
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,320
It's not that famous.

123
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,760
Well,

124
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,640
she's just being humble.

125
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,280
This place is super popular.

126
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,000
People line up all the time.
A lot of celebrities

127
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,920
come to the restaurant.

128
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,120
Magazines want to interview her,

129
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,120
but she refuses.

130
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,680
Is that true, Jane?

131
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,760
-Chop, chop, chop.
-Chop, chop, chop.

132
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,080
Did you wear the gloves?

133
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,800
These gloves are so hard to put on.

134
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,040
You're back already? Did you even shower?

135
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,280
No.

136
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,960
You just changed clothes
and came right over?

137
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm in a rush.

138
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
So when are you going back?

139
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,920
When are you going back?

140
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,720
Whenever I feel like it.

141
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,120
Then you can eat here
whenever it's available.

142
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,240
Hey.

143
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,920
So, when?

144
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,880
Two to three months.

145
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,880
Um, Jane? Is this size

146
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,520
okay? This size?

147
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,840
You've been doing it every day.

148
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,000
-About this size.
-This size?

149
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,360
Not this, right?

150
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,560
This long is good.

151
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,200
Okay.

152
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,600
Yeah, about this. I told you.

153
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,000
-It's this size.
-Yeah.

154
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,480
-It's this size.
-This size.

155
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,440
Go.

156
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,640
Why do you want the reservation so badly?

157
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,120
Because Pie is important.

158
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,040
How important?

159
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,640
Important to my future.

160
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,040
And about that new menu,
what do I have to do?

161
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,760
This is the current menu list.

162
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,280
Why are you laughing?

163
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,640
The food looks tasty,

164
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,800
but the photos?
Even cheap diners take better pictures.

165
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,440
You're good at photography, right?

166
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,040
I mean, I don't want to brag,
but yeah, I'm number one.

167
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,360
Then take new ones for me.

168
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
I'm a fashion photographer, Jane.

169
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
So what? You can't shoot food?

170
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,720
I can't. It's a totally different style.

171
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,320
Then learn.

172
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,480
You want to get your table's worth, huh?

173
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,120
Yes.

174
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,400
Come up with ideas. Cook. Shoot.

175
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,240
Even if it's not my expertise,
it'll still look better than your shots.

176
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,800
You used your phone, right?

177
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,640
I used a camera.

178
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,280
Liar.

179
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,120
Fine, it was my phone.

180
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,440
I knew it.

181
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
Why? Or…

182
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,880
No more "or."
I'll do it. I'll start today.

183
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,760
Are you changing your mind?

184
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,680
I'm not.

185
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,200
But when I work on new menus,
I use my home kitchen.

186
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,680
Is this the new dish for next month?

187
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,120
It's lunch.

188
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,320
You should be hungry.
You didn't eat breakfast.

189
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,640
I could've had the leftover porridge.

190
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,640
I already made this for you.
Eat it while it's still warm.

191
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,600
It looks delicious. Can I eat now?

192
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,800
Jane, wait.

193
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,560
Eat with me.

194
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,319
Eating alone is sad.

195
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,400
You didn't eat breakfast either, right?

196
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,680
It's so good.

197
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,920
One sec.

198
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,760
Yes, Pie?

199
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,040
I'll be back.

200
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,360
I'm at a friend's house.

201
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Lin.

202
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,840
Your mom told me to come find you here.

203
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,440
The gate wasn't locked,
so I just walked in.

204
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,080
You didn't have to bring anything for me.

205
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,560
This bakery went viral for being so good.

206
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,160
I was in the area, so I brought you some.

207
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,640
In the area?
This house isn't even on a main road.

208
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,120
Let me guess.
The bakery's next to the flower shop?

209
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,480
And the flower shop
happens to be next to the bakery.

210
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,880
So I just grabbed it.

211
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,000
Grabbed it? Are you a model or a thief?

212
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,120
What a coincidence.

213
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,720
Take a seat.

214
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,080
No wonder you said you could get a table.

215
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,200
You live next door

216
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,120
and you're close friends.

217
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,240
We've been close since we were kids.
I'm trying to get you a table.

218
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,120
If I get one, I promise

219
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,960
I'll treat you to ten meals.

220
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,480
Lin.

221
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,040
Sorry I forgot to bring you water.

222
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,680
This is for you.

223
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,120
It's been packed lately,

224
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,320
but I've been trying to find you a table.

225
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,280
I already told Lin how hard it is,

226
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,360
but she keeps begging
for a table every day.

227
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,200
Oh.

228
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,160
You're really trying to get me a table?

229
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,440
Thank you

230
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,440
for thinking of me this much.

231
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,320
Last time we met,

232
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,040
I told Lin
I wanted to try your restaurant,

233
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,920
but I didn't expect she'd try this hard.

234
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,960
You're so sweet to me.

235
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,360
So this is Pie, the model you mentioned?

236
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,480
Yeah.

237
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,080
You don't know her?

238
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,640
No. She must not be that famous.

239
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,080
Is this the one you said was important?

240
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,440
Yes.

241
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,480
Her mom owns W Magazine,

242
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,360
a major fashion magazine in Thailand.

243
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
I still think she came to flirt,
not just to drop by.

244
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,960
Isn't it good?

245
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,040
At least I'll have someone new
and stop bothering you.

246
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,920
You'll have time to work.

247
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's good, but isn't it too fast?
You just broke up with Kate.

248
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,600
And don't you still have work
waiting in New York?

249
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,880
If I end up dating Pie,

250
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,920
I might just come back and work for her.

251
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,240
So you know she's hitting on you?

252
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,480
Oh?

253
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,280
Okay, what else do you need me to do?

254
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,480
Nothing. You can go home.

255
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,480
Oh?

256
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,920
There's still a ton to do.

257
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,840
What are you cooking now?

258
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,920
Pork stew with eggs.

259
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,560
It doesn't taste like the first time.

260
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
I followed a YouTube recipe. Is it good?

261
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,600
So good!

262
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,280
My girlfriend makes the best pork stew
with eggs in the world.

263
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,920
I'm filming.

264
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,040
Stop filming.

265
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,680
Come with me tomorrow
to get stuff for five-spice eggs.

266
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,720
Didn't you just cook them?

267
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,280
The flavor's right,
but the story's not there yet.

268
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,240
People just care if it tastes good.

269
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,640
A story makes food taste better.

270
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,120
And stories

271
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,360
make people stronger too.

272
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,440
Don't forget your camera tomorrow.

273
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,800
She's single.

274
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,880
She said they're childhood friends.

275
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,080
But no photos together?

276
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,040
Weird.

277
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
Auntie! You're finally back.

278
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,880
I was waiting for you
to try my five-spice eggs.

279
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,480
Llin's been helping you all day.
Did you two make up already?

280
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,920
Not yet.

281
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,400
You're playing hard to get?

282
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,080
Huh?

283
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,840
A little.

284
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,440
You want her to realize your worth, right?

285
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,720
Have you told her?

286
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,040
Told her what?

287
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,160
Come on.

288
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,160
I don't have the guts.

289
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,000
Because she's about to get married, right?

290
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,440
No. They broke up.

291
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,640
What? Does Aom know?

292
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,080
Wait!

293
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,920
Lin hasn't told Aunt Aom yet.

294
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,840
Okay… Yeah, I understand.

295
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,320
Aom liked Kate a lot.

296
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,400
And what about you?

297
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,360
I don't think I'll wait around this time.

298
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,520
What are you doing here at night?
Can't sleep?

299
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,560
I forgot to ask, besides the camera,
do I need to bring anything else?

300
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,040
Just bring yourself.

301
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,160
That's all you came to ask?

302
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,280
I've never done a shoot. How would I know?

303
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,080
I'm a chef,
not a world-class photographer like you.

304
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,520
Was that sarcasm?

305
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,360
No. Just facts.

306
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,800
I can't sleep.

307
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,000
Are you still thinking about Kate?

308
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,680
If you don't sleep,
will you be okay tomorrow?

309
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,440
Then you go rest. I'll head home.

310
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,960
Let's go.

311
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,960
It's so close. I can walk alone.

312
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,920
I won't get lost.

313
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,760
I'll walk with you.

314
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,320
I thought we were just getting eggs
at the market.

315
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,400
If you're going to cook for people,

316
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,840
they should know
the food comes from good places.

317
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,760
Such nice weather.

318
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,000
I only took a short drive from Bangkok.

319
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,360
Then let's come again sometime.

320
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,280
Let's come together again.

321
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,000
Be careful.

322
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Ms. Jane.

323
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
This way, please.

324
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,160
A bug flew into your hair earlier.

325
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,040
Let's go.

326
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,760
We raise the ducks free-range,

327
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,600
and bring them in at night.

328
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,960
Today I'll let you
collect the eggs yourself.

329
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,200
Here's your basket.

330
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,640
Have fun.

331
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,040
Thank you.

332
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,040
Come on. Hurry and put on your boots.
Let's collect eggs.

333
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,160
-I'll help you.
-No, I can do it.

334
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,320
Why are you being so sweet today?

335
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,040
I've done bad things to you.

336
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,280
Now I'm trying to make it up,
so you'll forgive me.

337
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,240
Are you done?

338
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,800
We'll break for lunch and continue later.

339
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,880
Did that hurt?

340
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
I'm sorry.

341
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,560
DUTCH MILL WHITE MALT

342
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,159
It's delicious.

343
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,280
Why don't you hold your own can?

344
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,680
What do I have to do…

345
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,160
for you to forgive me?

346
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,080
I will soon.

347
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,480
Your "soon" is taking forever…

348
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,880
Jane.

349
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,120
-Jane.
-Hmm?

350
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,760
You don't need to come so close.

351
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,960
I thought you didn't hear me.

352
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
I've forgiven you…

353
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,600
But I'm still hurt.

354
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,840
Eat up.

355
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,560
Once we're done, we'll collect more eggs.

356
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,600
I'm sorry.

357
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,360
Why don't you make something more exciting
than simple food like five-spice eggs?

358
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,600
Do you know why my restaurant does well?

359
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,680
These days people are so busy.
They don't have time.

360
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,880
Moms don't have time to cook.
Kids don't have time to go home and eat.

361
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,520
Everyone's busy with work and school,
eating out every day.

362
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,720
And they forget the taste
of simple food their mom used to make.

363
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,280
So I make those dishes

364
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,320
in a more interesting way.
But they still taste familiar.

365
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,600
When people eat them,
they remember childhood,

366
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,120
and dinners with the whole family.

367
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,200
It fills their stomach, warms their heart,

368
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,280
and makes them want to come back again.

369
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,640
What's wrong?

370
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,400
Are you hungry?

371
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,720
No.

372
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,840
Don't do that, Jane.

373
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,680
Do what?

374
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,120
What you're doing.

375
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,160
You mean wiping the mud?

376
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,840
What do you think I'm doing?

377
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,680
I thought

378
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,480
you were shooing away a bug.

379
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,760
My heart is beating so hard.

380
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,040
She'll notice.

381
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,040
Oh, Jane, you're done already?

382
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,360
I've prepared something for you.

383
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,000
The mangoes just came in,
so I picked some for you too.

384
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,920
-Thank you.
-Sure!

385
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,080
Do you come here often?

386
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,000
She gave you a lot.
Is she into you or something?

387
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,640
No.

388
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,080
But I am.

389
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,760
You're into her?

390
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,680
Into you.

391
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Jane?

392
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,600
Jane?

393
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,760
Jane?

394
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,200
I asked if you come here often.

395
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,680
Oh.

396
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,600
Sometimes.

397
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,640
Not that often.

398
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,040
Here you go.

399
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,080
-That's a lot.
-Be careful, it's heavy.

400
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,360
-Thank you.
-Sure.

401
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
Are we cooking now?

402
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,240
Let's shower first.

403
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,600
Come on. I'll take this inside.

404
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,640
See you in a bit.

405
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,160
I've been in the sun all day.

406
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,480
Can you get me the pork belly?

407
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,960
-Anything else?
-Palm sugar. It's in this cabinet.

408
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,920
-Do you want the braising spices too?
-Yeah.

409
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,400
Alright, I'll get them myself.

410
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,880
Are you okay?

411
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,240
Are you okay?

412
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,480
You should go put on an apron.

413
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,480
CAN I LOVE YOU?

414
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,760
CAN I LOVE YOU?

415
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,200
Lin.

416
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,480
Can you find it?

417
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,720
Are you slacking off?

418
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,040
Your closet's full.
How am I supposed to know where it is?

419
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,000
It takes time to look.

420
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,560
And did you find it?

421
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,240
Not yet.

422
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,640
It's here.

423
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,240
Come, I'll help you put it on.

424
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,640
You loved me, Jane?

425
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,440
Can you love me?

426
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,440
I broke up with Kate, Mom.

427
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,440
If you walk away now, you get nothing.

428
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,720
But if you stay,

429
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,440
even if those two love each other,

430
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,160
everything will still be yours.

431
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,480
If what I said earlier made you upset,

432
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,360
I'm sorry.

433
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,520
If you can only see me as a friend,

434
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,240
then I'll just be a friend.

435
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,160
