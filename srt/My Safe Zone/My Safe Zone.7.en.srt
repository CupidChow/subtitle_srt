1
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,440
I don't think she'll ever forgive me.

2
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,920
You should at least let her talk.

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,400
Listen first, then decide.

4
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,560
Maybe just call her and get it over with.

5
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,920
-Not jealous?
-Not jealous,

6
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,080
because you're mine.

7
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,880
Lin.

8
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,360
I'll do anything,
just give us another chance.

9
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,200
I still love you, darling.

10
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,320
I'm almost done.

11
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,320
That was fast. Did you even try?

12
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
Of course I did. You have to use it too.

13
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,000
I will.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,120
Done.

15
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,440
Now let me see yours.

16
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,160
Wait.

17
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,600
Wait till I'm finished.

18
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,320
Will that day ever come?

19
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,960
Done.

20
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,440
Thanks.

21
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,040
Where's mine?

22
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm not giving it to you anymore.

23
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,440
-Why?
-Yours is cuter.

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,240
See? You finished early

25
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,400
because you didn't take it seriously.

26
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,000
-Let me see.
-No!

27
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,920
Fine, I don't want it then.

28
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,720
Don't be mad.

29
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,960
I knew you'd laugh.

30
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,160
It's cute.

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,800
Thanks. Let's use them.

32
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,800
TOKEN OF LOVE

33
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,920
RING OF LOVE

34
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,800
Why are they talking for so long?

35
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,920
I should've just said I was jealous,

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,440
super jealous,
then it would've ended faster.

37
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,840
-What did she say?
-Get home safe.

38
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,840
Hello.

39
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,040
Do you know Lin?

40
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,400
-What did she say?
-She apologized.

41
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,560
That's it?

42
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,480
And asked to get back together.

43
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,840
I almost fell for it.

44
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,320
-Fell for what?
-Thinking she was a good person.

45
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,040
So what did you say?

46
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,320
I said I forgive her,

47
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,960
but I can't be more than friends,

48
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,080
because you're my only girlfriend.

49
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,680
You're crazy.

50
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,240
It's good.

51
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,960
Lin's grown up.
She can take care of you now.

52
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,760
She won't make bad decisions.

53
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,680
Yeah, I know I'm lucky to have her.

54
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,320
Of course.

55
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,760
You're more than lucky,
like winning the lottery.

56
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,600
Lin's strong like you,

57
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,840
but smarter, braver,

58
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,240
and a natural leader.

59
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,600
She's the head of the household.

60
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,320
Thank you so much. Without you,

61
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,360
Lin might not have grown up so happy.

62
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,440
You've done a wonderful job as a mother.

63
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,280
She turned out kind and independent.

64
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,120
Isn't that what we all want?

65
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,080
Be kind to yourself, Aom.

66
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,600
-Lin, dear?
-Yes?

67
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,720
What did Kate say?

68
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,760
She apologized.

69
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,200
And did you forgive her?

70
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,080
I can forgive you.

71
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,800
But I can't be with you again.

72
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,160
It's always just been the two of us.

73
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,240
I don't want to fight with you
over someone else.

74
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,280
I want to make you proud.

75
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
I want you to be happy.

76
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,280
If I ever said anything that hurt you,

77
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,240
I'm sorry.

78
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,800
I should be the one saying sorry

79
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,760
for making you feel like I cared more
about something else than your happiness.

80
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
I'd forgotten

81
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,720
how betrayal feels.

82
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,799
I'm not mad at you.

83
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,679
I know what hardship is.

84
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,320
I've lived through it.

85
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,240
That's why I don't want you
to struggle like I did.

86
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,800
I know, Mom.

87
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,160
I used to wait up for you every night.

88
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,320
I knew how hard you worked.

89
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,680
Don't worry.

90
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,760
I'll choose what's best for myself.

91
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,640
I won't make you sad.

92
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,200
I love you, Mom.

93
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,800
I love you more than anything, Lin.

94
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,760
Aunt Tukta told me about Pie.

95
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,040
I think you two should leave town for now.

96
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,600
Take a vacation.

97
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,520
We don't know if Pie will stop.

98
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,000
It's not safe here. Go stay at the resort.

99
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,440
-What about the restaurant?
-I'll take care of it.

100
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,640
You can't even cook. What would you do?

101
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,520
Pete and Bam can handle it.

102
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Just don't change the menu next month.
Keep it as it is for now.

103
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,040
Come on,

104
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,280
think of it as a break.

105
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,960
Just take yourself to the resort.

106
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,920
Tim knows you don't feel anything for him.

107
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,880
Then why is he still so nice to you?

108
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,080
That's just how he is.

109
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,640
And him being that nice…

110
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,920
doesn't it make you feel anything?

111
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,960
No.

112
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,160
What about this kind of hug?

113
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,080
-Do you feel anything?
-I do.

114
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,240
A lot.

115
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,120
‎I'm yours now.

116
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,040
You're mine only.

117
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,840
If I'm not partners with Pie anymore,

118
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,480
how do I stop people
from finding out I got fired?

119
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,560
I don't want people to think
I was incompetent and got fired.

120
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,280
If they do,

121
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,600
I might never get another good job.

122
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,840
Your mom already understands.

123
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,520
You don't need an excuse
to come back here.

124
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,480
Let people talk.

125
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,160
The world isn't just social media.

126
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,720
Happiness doesn't come
from chasing success, Lin.

127
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,960
But how can I be happy

128
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,720
when my life feels like a failure?

129
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,000
Who said you're a failure?

130
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,800
You love photography, don't you?

131
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,560
You can still take pictures.

132
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,960
No one can stop you from being happy.

133
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,120
Take one of me.

134
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,080
Sure.

135
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,280
They're so in love.

136
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
See?

137
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,760
I see.

138
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,920
I've seen it for a long time.

139
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,400
I've loved Jane

140
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,120
and waited for her for years.

141
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,760
But she never saw me.

142
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,080
Until Lin came back,

143
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,920
then I understood why.

144
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,760
Then why keep trying?

145
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,760
I don't want to regret…

146
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,920
not doing everything I could.

147
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,320
I thought
we were having dinner at the resort.

148
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,720
We are, right here at the resort.

149
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,640
I picked an outfit for you.

150
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,160
Do you want to change now?

151
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,560
I'll help.

152
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,640
Or should we not go at all?

153
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,840
If you don't stop,
we really won't make it to dinner.

154
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,320
Can we skip dinner then?

155
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,360
No.

156
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,400
Daisies symbolize childhood memories.

157
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,120
They represent pure love,

158
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,600
like the love you've always had for me.

159
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,080
You know,

160
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
every time I've been in love,

161
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,160
deep down I was scared.

162
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,040
Scared it would end badly again.

163
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,120
But this time,

164
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,520
I'm not scared at all.

165
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,280
Thank you, Jane,

166
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
for always being by my side.

167
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,280
And I'm sorry I realized it so late.

168
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,680
I made you wait
for who knows how many years.

169
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,080
Are you sure now, Lin?

170
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,720
I've never been this sure.

171
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,200
When I came back,

172
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,040
I didn't even think I could love again.

173
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,720
But somehow, my heart healed.

174
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,920
All I know is that…

175
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
you make me so happy.

176
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
You made me realize

177
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,120
love doesn't have to be scary.

178
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,000
Jane, will you stay with me forever?

179
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,760
Yes.

180
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,400
Ask me a hundred times,
and the answer will never change.

181
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,440
I've waited for this moment for years.

182
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,000
Since we were kids,
I just wanted to see you smile.

183
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,080
I was always happy
just to see you every day.

184
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,520
Then one day, when you got a girlfriend,

185
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,200
that's when I realized

186
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,360
I was secretly in love with my friend,

187
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,160
the kind of love
that no one else could replace.

188
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,720
So let this daisy

189
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,840
be the symbol of our love.

190
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,400
Like when couples exchange rings,

191
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,960
there has to be one each, right?

192
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,600
Ugh, why are you calling?

193
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,640
Go look by the river.

194
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,320
They're so in love it's sickening.

195
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,920
What do I have to do to compete with that?

196
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,760
-Hey.
-Hey!

197
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,800
Are you okay? You weren't answering.

198
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,120
Hey.
There's no privacy at your resort at all?

199
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,600
You think just because you own the place,
you can barge into anyone's room?

200
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,800
I thought you'd offed yourself,
so I came in.

201
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,680
You checked already?

202
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,960
Great.

203
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,040
Now you know what dying
while still breathing looks like.

204
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,440
Is the resort going to keep
knocking on my door all day or what?

205
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,240
Thank you.

206
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,000
I ordered it for you, too.

207
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,520
Being proposed to
is kind of nerve-wracking, right?

208
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,240
Why are you smiling?

209
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,240
It just feels good.

210
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,800
Just turning and seeing you here

211
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,800
makes me happy.

212
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,440
I'll always be right here

213
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,240
and be your happiness every day.

214
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,400
No matter if it's the best day
or the worst,

215
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,320
I'm not going anywhere.

216
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,680
You should be with me, not Jane!

217
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,080
Kate?

218
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,000
Lin,

219
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,560
I haven't canceled anything yet.

220
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
I'm still waiting for you.

221
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,280
I still have our wedding invitations,
the venue's still booked.

222
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,760
I've just been waiting
for you to come back.

223
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,920
Lin, I messed up.

224
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,160
People make mistakes, right?

225
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,280
You know I never screw up.

226
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,240
I made a mistake, Lin.

227
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,840
Please forgive me.

228
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,920
I know now that you're the one

229
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,520
who truly loved me.

230
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,440
Lin.

231
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,680
Kate!

232
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,080
Kate!

233
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,880
Kate.

234
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
Kate.

235
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,080
Get up.

236
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,280
Kate.

237
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,080
I'm sorry.

238
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,520
Let's go.

239
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,600
Drink lots of water.

240
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,760
You know you get drunk easily.
Why drink so much?

241
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,360
So I don't have to feel…

242
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,120
that you left me.

243
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,400
Kate,

244
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,400
do you even remember
what happened that day?

245
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,560
Do you remember what you did?

246
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,680
Now you think saying sorry is enough
to make things go back to how they were?

247
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,000
I couldn't stay in New York.

248
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,240
I couldn't stand seeing,

249
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,120
staying, and breathing
in the same place that used to have you.

250
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,680
Today you say you feel bad.

251
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,600
Didn't I feel bad back then too?

252
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,600
Enough. Stop doing this

253
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,400
if you want to stay friends.

254
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,840
Lin…

255
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

256
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,520
I'm sorry.

257
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,160
I'm sorry.

258
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,000
Jane.

259
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,560
Why are you here?
What about the restaurant?

260
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,000
I'll drive back to check on it tomorrow.

261
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,560
So why did you come?

262
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,480
My staff told me

263
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,720
Kate checked in here.

264
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,800
So I rushed over to see you.

265
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,120
You're too late.
She's with Lin in the room.

266
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,000
If they're together,

267
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,720
then why are you out here?

268
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,840
That means Kate still loves Lin,
doesn't she?

269
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,920
She chased her all the way here.

270
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,160
And Lin? What do you think Lin feels?

271
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,040
She said she's moved on.

272
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,480
And do you think she really has?

273
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,360
Good question.

274
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,000
Jane.

275
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,960
Lin's here. I'll go.

276
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,840
Thank you.

277
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,200
If you need anything,

278
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,320
call me.

279
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,800
Tim.

280
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,640
I'd like to book another room.
I'll handle the cost myself.

281
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,400
Why?

282
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,760
Kate's drunk.
I thought I'd give her the room.

283
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,440
Jane and I will stay in another one.

284
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,360
Got it. I'll take care of it.

285
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,800
Finally, some rest.

286
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,880
You're up?

287
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,600
Why did you come back?

288
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,120
So you were drunk on purpose last night?

289
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,680
Lin is my girlfriend, not yours.

290
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,240
So what? People can break up.

291
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,960
Lin used to love me,

292
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,240
so much we almost got married.

293
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,960
The ring you're wearing,

294
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,520
I have one too.

295
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,840
How do you know
she loves you more than she loved me?

296
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,760
Lin.

297
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,040
You make me not want to get up.

298
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,400
Do you love me?

299
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,200
Of course.

300
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,080
How much?

301
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,480
So much.

302
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,280
Between me and Kate,

303
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,720
who do you love more?

304
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,400
Obviously you.

305
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,960
Breakfast must be here.

306
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,280
I came to invite you to breakfast.

307
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,560
I don't want to eat alone.

308
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,320
Yes?

309
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,440
Jane.

310
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,280
Jane.

311
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,640
Jane, where are you?

312
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,520
What do you mean you already left?

313
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,640
Jane,

314
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,520
I thought you were staying longer.
Why are you back so soon?

315
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,440
Hello, Auntie.

316
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,080
Hello.

317
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,400
-Here's Jane's bag.
-Just leave it there.

318
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,120
Why did you come back with Jane?

319
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,400
-Where's Lin?
-Lin's with Kate.

320
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,800
The police wanted to talk to Jane
about the restaurant,

321
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,640
so I brought her back first.

322
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,240
Wait, the police want to talk to Jane?

323
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,720
-How is she involved?
-The man who threw the rock

324
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,560
claimed Jane hired him.

325
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,480
-Are you okay?
-I didn't do anything.

326
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,400
I'm giving a statement.
That should be enough.

327
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,920
I know that.
I'm not worried about the case.

328
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm worried about you.

329
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,640
Tim said Kate followed you to the resort.

330
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,440
Maybe they missed each other.

331
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,040
It's been a month.

332
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,840
Jane.

333
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,480
I know Lin loves me.

334
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
But I can't help how I feel

335
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,440
when I see Kate close to her.

336
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,920
When Lin looks at Kate,

337
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,360
it still seems like she cares.

338
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
They've known each other for a long time.

339
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,960
Long enough
that they were about to get married.

340
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,640
If Kate hadn't slept with a man,

341
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,920
they probably would've married soon.

342
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,480
Aom, do you still want Kate
and Lin to be together?

343
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,560
Right now, I'll just leave it to Lin.

344
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,480
You're the one who told Kate
to go to the beach, didn't you?

345
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,480
I didn't.

346
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,640
What's wrong, Tuk?

347
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,040
Our kids are in love.

348
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,480
You and Jane are like family.

349
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,560
If something happens,
can we still face each other?

350
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,560
That's why we're talking now.

351
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,440
We've been through so much together.
We're not going to fight.

352
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,400
Maybe it's a good thing after all,

353
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,360
that we're finally
becoming one real family.

354
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,600
That's it.

355
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,200
But for now, let's give them space
to talk things through first.

356
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,640
Thank you for your cooperation.

357
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,920
Thank you.

358
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,640
-I'll take my leave then.
-Alright.

359
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,920
Thank you.

360
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,640
I think they'll be able to confirm

361
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,040
you had no ties to the attacker.

362
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,960
Threre's no financial link.

363
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,880
That's why I'm confident
there won't be a problem.

364
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,640
Then why do you still look so worried?

365
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,240
It's nothing.

366
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,960
Hey, we've known each other
a long time, Jane.

367
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,280
I know you well enough.

368
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,920
When something's bothering you,
do you think I can't see it?

369
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,880
Jane,

370
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,440
I'd be okay

371
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,960
if you chose to be with her
and she makes you happier than I do.

372
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,160
But if that's how it is,

373
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,040
why don't you give me a chance instead?

374
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,920
I really think

375
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,680
I could take better care of you
than she can.

376
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Jane.

377
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,600
-Did you just get back?
-Yes.

378
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,200
You're upset about Kate, aren't you?

379
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,080
Yes.

380
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,680
Why did you come back early?

381
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,240
The police called me in.

382
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,160
What happened, Jane?

383
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,600
The guy who threw the rock
told them I hired him.

384
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,200
Did you tell the police it was Pie?

385
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,000
You know she was behind it.

386
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,400
I did. And I think they believe me now.

387
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,920
Why didn't you ask me
to come back with you?

388
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,400
You were talking to Kate.
I didn't want to interrupt.

389
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,360
Kate was drunk.

390
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,360
Even if it'd been someone else,
I would've helped.

391
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,520
I understand.

392
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,160
No, you don't.

393
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,760
If you really understood me,
you wouldn't have left like that.

394
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,600
You're mad at me.

395
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,520
Yes, I am.

396
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm mad that you cared so much
about Kate you forgot about me.

397
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,760
I'm mad you went outside this morning
to talk to her alone.

398
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,600
But I have the right to be mad, don't I?

399
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,200
And don't I have the right to explain?

400
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,320
We're over, Kate.

401
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,400
I helped you because
I couldn't let someone drunk drown.

402
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,480
But there won't be a wedding.
You have no place in my life anymore.

403
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,200
You really can't forgive me, Lin?

404
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,160
We can just postpone the wedding.

405
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,760
Please don't leave me.
Please stay with me.

406
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,120
I can only offer you friendship now,
because I don't love you anymore.

407
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,680
But if you keep acting like this,

408
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,440
we won't even be able to be friends.

409
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,840
Lin.

410
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,360
If you can't let go,
then let's stop seeing each other.

411
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,080
It just makes things harder.

412
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,200
I just wanted to make it clear to her,

413
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,760
so she wouldn't do this again.

414
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,440
So she'd know

415
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,320
she can only ever be a friend.

416
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,440
I told her already.

417
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,880
Someone's already claimed me.

418
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
I can't love anyone else now.

419
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,800
I'm going to marry Lin.

420
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,520
Your dream finally came true.

421
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,360
But I still want to see Lin.

422
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,840
If you know where she is,

423
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,760
could you take me to her?

424
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,480
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

425
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,880
We're really going to be a family soon.

426
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,160
Jane, what do you think--

427
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,160
Jane!

428
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,600
