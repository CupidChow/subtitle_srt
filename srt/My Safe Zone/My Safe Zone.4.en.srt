1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,960
The restaurant is closed today.
Want to go to the beach?

2
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,760
I just made plans with Pie.

3
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,200
Who is the model?

4
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,800
You're gonna be so happy.

5
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,240
What were you talking about so long?

6
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,000
Did Jane do all this by herself?

7
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,960
Jane, what's wrong?

8
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,280
Wouldn't you be mad if you saw me

9
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,760
with someone else like that?

10
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
But won't you at least hear me out?

11
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,280
If you always assume on your own,
how can we ever work?

12
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,400
I'M GRADUATING SOON
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER LESS

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,000
IT'S BETTER WE KEEP SOME DISTANCE
SORRY, WHAN

14
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,440
Why sit in the rain and get sick?

15
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,720
Whan broke up with me.

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,800
Don't cry.

17
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,280
You still have me.

18
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,320
MY DEAR FRIEND

19
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,160
MY DEAR

20
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,000
Jane…

21
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,920
I don't have feelings for Pie.

22
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,840
It's nothing more than work, I swear.

23
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,680
If we shoot outdoors,
we should check the weather.

24
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,920
Lin.

25
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm sorry, I spilled water.

26
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,680
It's fine, it's fine.

27
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
Here.

28
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,600
My hands are wet…

29
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
Could you wipe it for me?

30
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,960
Lower down too.

31
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,320
It's wet down there as well.

32
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,040
Argue until you break up for good.

33
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,680
Are you Pie?

34
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,720
We had that investment meeting, remember?

35
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,040
Oh,

36
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,320
Au, of course I remember.

37
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,280
One whiskey on the rocks, please.

38
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,880
Let's talk business first,

39
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,800
personal later.

40
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,680
SORRY, I'M NOT LOOKING TO INVEST
BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL ME FOR A DRINK

41
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
Hello, what can I get for you?

42
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,200
Two hot Americanos, no sugar.

43
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,240
-Sure. And your name?
-Lin.

44
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,160
Okay, Ms. Lin.

45
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,440
That'll be 155 baht. You can scan here.

46
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,520
-Done.
-Thank you.

47
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,440
-Lin?
-Whan?

48
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,960
I thought you were in New York.

49
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,680
How are you?

50
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm good.

51
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,840
Ms. Lin, your coffee is ready.

52
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,320
Thank you.

53
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,560
Are you here with Jane?

54
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,720
No, I'm alone.

55
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,440
You ordered two cups.
I thought you came together.

56
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm on my way to see Jane now.

57
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,680
I never apologized to you in person.

58
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,600
For what?

59
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,040
For breaking up with you.

60
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,560
Jane never told you

61
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,080
why I broke up with you?

62
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,360
Never.

63
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,160
But I figured

64
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,560
you just got bored and wanted someone new.

65
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,320
That's not it.

66
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,640
Even though
I did have someone else back then,

67
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,600
I never wanted to break up with you.

68
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,800
Jane asked me to break up with you.

69
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,240
Jane?

70
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,600
She saw me with someone else

71
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,000
before you even knew.

72
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,760
Lin loves you so much.
How could you do this to her?

73
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,080
It's nothing serious with this one.

74
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,640
But Lin's too good to be just an option.

75
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,480
If you can't commit to her alone,
then break up.

76
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,240
Breaking up because you don't love her
is better than letting her stay blind.

77
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,760
If you don't,

78
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,560
I'll tell the teachers
you've been selling test answers.

79
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,440
Jane! Jane!

80
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,480
Jane, can we talk?

81
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,160
Are you really not going to talk to me?

82
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,440
Here.

83
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,680
-Alright.
-Are these all?

84
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,080
One, two, three, four, five, six.

85
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,880
She's been sitting there forever.

86
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,240
Yeah,

87
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,840
why doesn't Jane
just come out and see her?

88
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Right?

89
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,760
-How would I know?
-I thought you'd know.

90
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,520
Hello.

91
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
Hello.

92
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,120
Isn't it hot out here?

93
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,720
How can she sit there, it's boiling.

94
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,760
Yeah.

95
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,160
-Training for hell, maybe.
-You're crazy!

96
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,840
-We're heading inside.
-Yeah.

97
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,520
It's just as hot in here as it is outside.

98
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,160
Keep it down.

99
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,600
Look at her face.

100
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,120
Jane…

101
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,160
Lin's still waiting outside.

102
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,880
You're not going out to her?

103
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,440
When she's quiet,
I feel like I'm butting in.

104
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,720
At least you know.

105
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,160
If you two were me, what would you do?

106
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,160
Maybe tell us the whole story first?

107
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,040
Oh, Jane!

108
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,640
Jane!

109
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,400
You can stay mad,

110
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,240
but at least let me bandage you first.

111
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,440
Does it hurt much?

112
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,320
How did you cut yourself?

113
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,480
Because of me, right?

114
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,160
I'm sorry.

115
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,880
Don't you love me anymore?
Why won't you believe me?

116
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,760
What do you expect me to think?

117
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,960
You say it's nothing,
but what I saw wasn't nothing.

118
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,200
I saw it with my own eyes.

119
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,160
She spilled water.
I just helped wipe it off.

120
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,800
On her shirt?

121
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,920
Yes.

122
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,520
So you had to unbutton it to wipe?

123
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,200
Why couldn't she do it herself?

124
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,320
She asked me. Her hands were wet.

125
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,240
I swear, Jane, it's not what you think.

126
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,000
I need time.

127
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,960
I can give you time.

128
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,360
But I won't let you turn your back on me
for something I never did.

129
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,200
How's the bandaging going?

130
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,040
Relationships are complicated.
You wouldn't get it.

131
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,280
Hey.

132
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,200
It's not complicated at all.

133
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,440
No money, no love. Done.

134
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,960
They love each other.
Love wounds take time to heal.

135
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,520
Love wounds take time to heal!

136
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,920
Geez, why'd you sneak up on me like that?

137
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Why'd you get spooked so easily?

138
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,920
Look.

139
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,320
Are you two finished prepping?

140
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,680
Yes.

141
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,240
See?

142
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,440
Love wounds take time.

143
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,240
Can we drink now?

144
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,040
It's work hours.

145
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,840
Yeah!

146
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,400
It feels great!

147
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,320
Great!

148
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,240
Tell me honestly.

149
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,200
Can I really trust her?

150
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,640
Well,

151
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,240
from what you said,

152
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,520
if I were you, I would believe her.

153
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,960
I'm lovesick.
If she asked me to, I'd do anything.

154
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,760
True.

155
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,640
That's why you blew all your money
and work like crazy now.

156
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,640
Got scammed by a guy
just so he could spoil his girl.

157
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,640
I loved him, so what?

158
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,240
If love means paying like you did,

159
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,800
I'd rather hire a gigolo.

160
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,600
That's right.

161
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,360
Hey, Bam! You little…

162
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,120
Did you just curse me in front of Jane?

163
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,080
Hey!

164
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,600
Yeah, I did.

165
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
Ah, alright.

166
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,920
Let's focus. We got sidetracked.

167
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,680
Let's talk.

168
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,520
The real question is

169
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
how much do you trust her?

170
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,320
If you do, don't question it.

171
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,200
Exactly.

172
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,240
You want me to be a fool?

173
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,120
You aren't blind.

174
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,120
You know Lin better than us.

175
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,040
After all this time,

176
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,720
has she been faithful

177
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,320
or slutty?

178
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,920
-Who's like that?
-You.

179
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,280
Hey!

180
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,640
Lin only loves one person at a time.

181
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,960
Wanna grab food after this?

182
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,720
Sure. What should we eat?

183
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,360
-I feel like…
-I'm hungry.

184
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,920
Lin's coming.

185
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,120
Oh, let's go.

186
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,520
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Lin.

187
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Lin.

188
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,520
I'm sorry

189
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,520
for making you feel bad.

190
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,680
I'm the one who should apologize
for not trusting you.

191
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,040
I should've asked you instead of assuming.

192
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,960
If you don't want me working with Pie,

193
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,840
then I won't.

194
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,200
If it comes down to choosing
between work and you,

195
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,840
I'll always choose you.

196
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,960
You're happy when you're shooting.

197
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,280
It's the job you love
and you're good at it.

198
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,440
But I acted stupid,

199
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,480
starting a fight over nothing.

200
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,520
I'm sorry.

201
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,760
Sorry for making you feel this way.

202
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm awful,

203
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,040
making you choose
between me and your work.

204
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,680
I'm sorry for not trusting you,

205
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,360
when you're the one I should trust most.

206
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,280
I'm sorry.

207
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,080
Listen, Jane.

208
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,200
I know how much it hurts to be betrayed.

209
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,640
I would never, ever hurt you like that.

210
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,080
From now on, no matter what,

211
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,600
I'll always choose you.

212
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,760
You're the most
important thing in my life.

213
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Guess what?

214
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,480
I ran into Whan this morning.

215
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,040
Our senior from school?

216
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,360
Yeah.

217
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,560
She told me about you.

218
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,760
I just found out

219
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,640
it was your doing.

220
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,400
When she dumped you,

221
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,960
I was secretly thrilled.

222
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,600
But I pretended to be sad.

223
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,080
Then why didn't you just tell me
you liked me back then?

224
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,160
I didn't dare.

225
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,240
Funny, isn't it? I could threaten her,

226
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,360
but I couldn't confess to you.

227
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,160
From now on, you have to say it.

228
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,360
If you don't like something, tell me.

229
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,480
If you're jealous, tell me.

230
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,240
If you love me, tell me.

231
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,200
Don't keep it bottled up.

232
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,480
I don't want to fight with you anymore.

233
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,480
You're mine now, Jane.

234
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,040
Jane.

235
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,560
I'm not available.

236
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,600
Was my offer too low?

237
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,320
So,

238
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,520
what price works for you?

239
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,640
If it's possible, I'll pay it.

240
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,720
It's not about money.
I just don't take catering jobs.

241
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,640
But this could be your debut
in our magazine.

242
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,480
I could even write
a feature column on you.

243
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,960
I need to prep food
for the evening service.

244
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,600
If I go off-site,

245
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,200
I won't have enough staff
to prepare for my customers.

246
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,360
So you mean

247
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,400
even if I pay any amount, you still won't?

248
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,160
Correct. I won't.

249
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,320
To be blunt, Pie.

250
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,120
I don't want to work with you.

251
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,160
We're in different fields.

252
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,480
Food and fashion? We won't get along.

253
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,040
So, I don't want to do it.

254
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,120
They say sharp tongue, delicious food.

255
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,520
I guess that's true.

256
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,200
My sharp tongue is
reserved for certain people.

257
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,280
Wait.

258
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,120
And doing something like spilling water
on yourself to cause misunderstandings,

259
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,360
just stop it.

260
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,040
Lin.

261
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,160
Pie?

262
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,520
Can you talk to Jane for me?

263
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,640
I wanted to impress Ayla

264
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,520
so I asked Jane to cook
and send to the set,

265
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,880
but she refused.

266
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,600
Maybe she's really not available.

267
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,200
Why not try another vendor?

268
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,240
But her restaurant is famous.

269
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,960
Having her food on set
would be such a statement.

270
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,720
Can you talk to her?

271
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,320
I'll try,

272
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,880
but I doubt she'll agree.

273
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,000
Thanks, Lin.

274
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,200
I really want Jane's food there.

275
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,280
Whatever she can manage, I'll take it.

276
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,560
I'm happy with any dish.

277
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,920
Just having her name is enough.

278
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,320
I'll see what I can do.

279
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,560
Thank you.

280
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,160
You ran into her outside?

281
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,120
She asked you to talk to me, right?

282
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,120
Yeah.

283
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,600
I'm not going.

284
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,800
I know.

285
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,360
Then why even try to speak for her?

286
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,480
Are you mad, little Jane?

287
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,800
I'm only two hours younger.

288
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,800
I'm your girlfriend,

289
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
and a jealous one, too.

290
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,040
I knew you wouldn't want to go.

291
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,120
I'll just tell her I asked
but you really can't.

292
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,040
Okay?

293
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,240
Next time,

294
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,760
don't bother trying to spare her feelings.

295
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,520
But Pie and I still have to work together.

296
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,880
I need to keep things civil.

297
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,400
Fine.

298
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,800
So, what can I help you with?

299
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,960
That restaurant is not even that famous.

300
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,680
Why is she so stuck-up?

301
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,520
MY BALANCE

302
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,360
If I can't get funding soon,

303
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,600
the company will have to close.

304
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,480
What is it?

305
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,320
I found the photographer
you've been looking for.

306
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,120
Lin.

307
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,000
Why does Aunt Aom like Kate so much?

308
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,040
Money, maybe.

309
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,920
Just money?

310
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,200
Not really.

311
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,840
At first, Mom didn't even like Kate.

312
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,360
But she still won her over.

313
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,680
Yeah.

314
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,720
At first, Mom wasn't okay
with me dating a woman.

315
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,960
Older folks don't always understand.

316
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,240
But Kate showed her

317
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,280
it wasn't wrong,

318
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,040
and she treated Mom so well.

319
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,880
In the end, Mom loved Kate more than me.

320
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,880
She even told me

321
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
it was better I dated women.

322
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,080
At least I wouldn't face
what she went through.

323
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,600
That's what I don't get, Jane.

324
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,720
Why would she want me
to turn a blind eye and stay with Kate?

325
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,280
You know,

326
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,080
I still remember
chasing after my dad's car

327
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,040
the day he left.

328
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,920
How can Mom forget that?

329
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,360
Maybe Aunt Aom
just wants you to live comfortably.

330
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,200
She's worked so hard her whole life.

331
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,880
She doesn't want you to struggle the same.

332
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,280
Money buys a lot,

333
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,040
maybe everything.

334
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,160
But if it means being blind and stupid,

335
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,560
I'd rather earn my own and keep my pride.

336
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,800
Why are you smiling to yourself?

337
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,360
Lin, no, I haven't even showered yet.

338
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,080
You smell so good.

339
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Lin.

340
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,040
I'm going to shower.

341
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
Jane.

342
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,240
When I shoot for the magazine,

343
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,400
come with me.

344
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,480
Did Pie put you up to this?

345
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,160
No.

346
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,560
I just want you there.

347
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,880
So you'll feel at ease.

348
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,720
You'll see for yourself.

349
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,680
It's only work with Pie.

350
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,960
At first,

351
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,800
I thought you wanted me
to shower with you.

352
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,120
I already showered.

353
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,480
I know.

354
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,720
I was teasing.

355
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,520
I'll go shower now.

356
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,640
I'll go now.

357
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,360
But now,

358
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,360
I think I want another shower.

359
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,920
MAIL BOX

360
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,640
INBOX

361
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,840
NO EMAIL

362
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,800
Ms. Lin is here.

363
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,680
Did she come alone?

364
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,360
She's with another woman.

365
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,960
Really?

366
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,960
I'll go take care of her myself.

367
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,560
Sure.

368
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,040
Lin.

369
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,280
Want something to eat?

370
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,800
I don't want to keep Ayla waiting.

371
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,560
It's almost done, right?

372
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,920
Yes.

373
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,520
Then can we talk a bit?

374
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,800
About work.

375
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,960
What is it?

376
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,120
Can we go somewhere private?

377
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,480
Okay, wait a sec.

378
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,840
Jane…

379
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,880
I'll go talk to Pie for a bit.

380
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,760
Then…

381
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,720
I'll wait here.

382
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,040
Okay.

383
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,960
I'll be right back.

384
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,560
Let's go.

385
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,000
I know you've got
a stable career in New York,

386
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,960
and your magazine credits

387
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,560
are way better than mine.

388
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,440
But I want you to consider this.

389
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,080
What if we start
an online magazine together?

390
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,440
Would you be interested?

391
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,680
Are you asking me
to be your business partner?

392
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,800
Yes.

393
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,920
To keep you, I have to make you
an offer you can't refuse.

394
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,840
Just signing you as a photographer

395
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,320
wouldn't be enough.

396
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,360
It's tempting.

397
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,880
But can I think about it first?

398
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,480
I understand.

399
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,640
Walking away from a great job
takes thought.

400
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,840
But let me know soon.

401
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,880
Jane, let's go over there.

402
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,360
Where?

403
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,640
I want to talk with you alone.

404
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,440
Come on.

405
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,200
We can't.

406
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,000
It's a set. There are too many people.

407
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,920
We can't do it here.

408
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,320
I just need to talk.

409
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,600
I mean it. It's a secret, okay?

410
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,040
Let's go.

411
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,240
What secret?

412
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,760
Pie asked me to be her partner.

413
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,360
Partner?

414
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,880
She's starting an online project
and wants me in.

415
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,240
She could just hire you.
You already have work in New York.

416
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,440
She wants me to leave New York
and work here with her.

417
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,840
If it were anyone else, I wouldn't mind.

418
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,160
But Pie?

419
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,520
She's not trustworthy.

420
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,560
But wouldn't it be nice?
I could stay with you,

421
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,880
no more flights back and forth.

422
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,240
That would be good.

423
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,800
So?

424
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,360
Let me think.

425
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,800
Oh?

426
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,880
I'm going.

427
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:24,880
Jane!

428
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,640
Lin got clipped by a car.
She must be hurt.

429
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,800
Let's check on her.

430
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,920
Let's check on Lin.

431
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,240
I know

432
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,840
it's hard at first, but over time,

433
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,480
anger can fade.

434
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,600
When it does,
you might be ready to listen.

435
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,880
I'm sorry I disappointed you, Mom.

436
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,800
But I will never get back with Kate.

437
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,080
Jane! Jane!

438
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,840
Jane!

439
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,320
