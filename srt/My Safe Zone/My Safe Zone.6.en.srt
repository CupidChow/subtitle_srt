1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,080
Have you spoken with Kate
since this happened?

2
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,920
There's nothing left to talk about. From
what I saw, there's nothing to explain.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,320
I'm sorry
I can't be the daughter you're proud of.

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,040
Do you want to know

5
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,960
why I asked Lin to think again about Kate?

6
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,880
You can't stop being her daughter.
You're her daughter.

7
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,480
You have to go back and face it.

8
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,080
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

9
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,000
Dad,

10
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
did you buy me any snacks?

11
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,760
Here you go, they're all yours.

12
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,040
Thank you.

13
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,440
Dear…

14
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,960
where are you going?

15
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,200
Let go.

16
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,479
Hey.

17
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,520
Your daughter's sitting right here.
Don't you feel bad for her at all?

18
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,880
I said let go.

19
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,600
Hey.

20
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,520
You're leaving with that shameless woman?

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,520
Why don't you find someone
who's not married?

22
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,560
-Enough.
-He already has a wife and a kid.

23
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
I said enough.

24
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,960
That's his kid!

25
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,320
You shameless bitch!

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,720
You shameless bitch.

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,240
That's enough!

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,080
Mom!

29
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,880
Mom, are you hurt? Why did you hurt Mom?

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Don't drag the kid into this. I gave you
the house, what more do you want?

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,080
And you're not going to help
raise your daughter?

32
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,760
Do you want Lin to come live with me?
Do you?

33
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,000
If it's not here, you'll never have her.

34
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
Dad…

35
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,320
SOMETHING IN THE HEART

36
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,600
SOMEONE IN THE HEART

37
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,800
Jane, go wait at home first.
I'll come after.

38
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,720
Aren't you going to talk to me?

39
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,519
I only have one parent, and that's my mom.
I never had a father.

40
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,240
You left me when I was a kid.

41
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,080
I can barely even remember your face.

42
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,720
I just wanted to talk to you

43
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,920
about W Magazine.

44
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,760
You don't have to worry about me.

45
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,200
I've been fine almost
my entire life with just Mom and me.

46
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,680
I've already thought carefully
about what I do.

47
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,840
I'd never do anything
to cause her or myself trouble.

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
Mom may be too polite to say this,

49
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,440
but I'm not.

50
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,520
You should go, and don't ever come back.

51
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,840
Everyone here is fine.

52
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,440
We're happy,
and we can live just fine without you.

53
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,720
Don't make Mom
have to push you out herself.

54
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,320
Mom, why did you let him in?

55
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't cry, Mom.

56
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't let him in again.

57
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,760
LEK PATCHARANUN - PHOTOGRAPHER

58
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,120
Mom, do you remember

59
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,760
when you said you didn't want me
to work in the same field as him,

60
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,680
that you didn't want
our paths to cross again?

61
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,080
But you know…

62
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,640
deep down, I wanted to see him.

63
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,480
I wanted him to see
that I could be the best.

64
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,400
I wanted him to know

65
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,400
that you could raise me well
all on your own,

66
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
without a father.

67
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,960
I'm proud of you, Lin.

68
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,040
I know you're strong,

69
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,280
but I'll always worry about you.

70
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,440
Before I die,

71
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,320
I just want to see you have a good career

72
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,040
and someone who truly loves you.

73
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,160
Even though things
with Kate didn't work out,

74
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,760
at least you still have a good job.

75
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,840
Yes, Mom.

76
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
He never came back once after he left.

77
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,040
But as soon as he heard about the W deal,
he showed up.

78
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
I don't even know what he wants.

79
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
How's your mom?

80
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,240
Crying.

81
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,160
There must be a lot to process.

82
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,040
When things calm down,
I'll tell her about my job.

83
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,440
Hello?

84
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,280
Yes.

85
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,560
That's me.

86
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,920
Yes.

87
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,600
Sure.

88
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,960
Yes, of course.

89
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,960
Someone called
to offer me a photoshoot, Jane.

90
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,840
See? It doesn't have to be Pie's magazine.

91
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,520
Plenty of people want to work with you.

92
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,760
They asked me to shoot an interview set,

93
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,040
but when I asked who the model is,
they wouldn't tell me.

94
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,880
Whoever it is,
I'm sure it'll turn out great.

95
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,720
Come on. Things will work out.

96
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
Then,

97
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,880
let's go out for something nice
to eat tonight.

98
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,560
Celebrate your new gig, okay?

99
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,160
Are you getting dressed?

100
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,120
You smell amazing.

101
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,200
Then come smell me again.

102
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,320
You're hungry?

103
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Just a sec.

104
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,480
Wow,

105
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,200
so this is the "something nice"
you mentioned?

106
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,320
Because the food here
is the most delicious.

107
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,080
Especially the owner,

108
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,920
very delicious.

109
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,400
These are the four dishes
I'm planning to sell next month.

110
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,600
You already finalized all four?

111
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,080
I haven't even finished shooting them all.

112
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,720
Just one left.

113
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,520
Starting with the five-spice eggs.

114
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,840
Remember when Aunt Aom
went looking for a job?

115
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,400
She dropped you off at Aunt Tuk's

116
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,000
so you'd have someone to play with,

117
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,760
but you wouldn't eat anything.

118
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,360
Five-spice eggs
were the only thing you'd eat.

119
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,200
And the mashed mackerel rice?

120
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,920
When we went
on that school field trip to Amphawa,

121
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,400
we shared one

122
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
because our pocket money
was only enough for that.

123
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,840
If you hadn't said it,

124
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,120
I wouldn't even remember all that.

125
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,920
And do you remember
where the crab-roe salad came from?

126
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,320
When Auntie bought crabs,

127
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,080
I'd eat only the roe
and give you all the meat, right?

128
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,000
Exactly.

129
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,680
After we eat, I'll have you
guess what the last dish is.

130
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,520
Okay.

131
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,360
I'll take the crab roe.
Don't you dare steal it.

132
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,560
Then I'm taking the meat.

133
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,640
-You want the five-spice eggs first.
-Five-spice eggs.

134
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,640
Yes.

135
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
It's delicious, Jane.

136
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,960
It fills my heart.

137
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,240
Are you ready for dessert?

138
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,200
-Hmm?
-I'll cover your eyes first.

139
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,360
What dessert?
Why do I have to cover my eyes?

140
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,360
Take my hand. I'll lead you there.

141
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,480
Sit here.

142
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
Alright.

143
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,480
I'll be right back.

144
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,400
What is it?

145
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,080
Don't cry, okay?

146
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,800
Why did you choose
coconut ice cream that day?

147
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,720
Now that I think about it,

148
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,640
that's not a flavor most kids would pick.

149
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
We both loved chocolate back then,

150
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,000
but Aunt Tuk kept
the chocolate flavor on the top shelf.

151
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,160
She didn't want us to take it.

152
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,600
I couldn't reach it.
I could only grab coconut.

153
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,960
Back then, I just thought

154
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,560
maybe ice cream
could make you feel better.

155
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,599
Thank you.

156
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,560
I'm the one who has to thank you

157
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,000
for coming back to me.

158
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,319
Every dish you made for me today…

159
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,600
they're all about me.

160
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,680
You've always inspired me.

161
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
I wanted to cook for someone I love,

162
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,800
to see her happy when she eats.

163
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,560
I wanted to open a restaurant
with food so good,

164
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,440
that one day, if you ever wanted
to eat at my restaurant,

165
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,640
I would see you again.

166
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,280
So the resort doesn't need a manager now?

167
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,280
I want to try managing a restaurant.

168
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,640
After all these years,
now you feel like working here?

169
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,000
I was talking to the police
about the restaurant.

170
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,880
Is something wrong?

171
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,840
Jane, take a look at this.
I saved the clip for you.

172
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,920
The police want to
talk to us about it too.

173
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,280
I've got an interview.
I'll come back and check it out afterward.

174
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,960
You? Going to an interview?

175
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,920
Yeah, don't ask too much. Just go home.

176
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,400
Well, Jane.

177
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,480
Do you have any enemies?

178
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,640
If I do, it's you.

179
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,840
Hey, I'm serious.

180
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,040
No, I don't.

181
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,800
If it's not you,

182
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,240
how about Lin?

183
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,200
I'm asking because I'm worried.

184
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,920
I know.

185
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,680
Now go, I'm in a hurry.

186
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,640
You should be happy
your kid turned out this good.

187
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,840
Hardworking like this,
she'll never starve.

188
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,000
Exactly, because she's good,
I want her to have a good life.

189
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Hey, I saw Lek the other day, right?

190
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,640
Yeah.

191
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,280
So what did he come back for?

192
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,960
He was worried about us.

193
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,120
What? After disappearing for 20 years,

194
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,520
now he's worried?

195
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,800
He said there's a rumor

196
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,160
that Lin got fired
from her job in New York,

197
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,200
and that she got an offer from W Magazine.

198
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,600
He tried calling me,

199
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,360
but I didn't pick up, so he came here.

200
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,680
What's the truth then?

201
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,920
Lin hasn't said anything.

202
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,120
If she really got fired,
she would've told me, right?

203
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,480
Of course. You're her mom.

204
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,600
I think

205
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,800
he's trying to worm his way
back into our lives.

206
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,440
Lin's famous now.

207
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,320
Everyone wants to work with her.

208
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,720
He probably wants to show off
that she's his daughter.

209
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,840
She's only your daughter.

210
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,920
Now eat.

211
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,760
The model wouldn't accept the job
unless it was you, Ms. Lin.

212
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,400
Really?

213
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,640
Yes. She's never given interviews before.

214
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,640
The editor was thrilled
she agreed to this.

215
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,480
They said they'd pay
whatever your rate is.

216
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,560
Really?

217
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,080
So I got the job because of the model?

218
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,520
The model's heading to the set now.

219
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,160
Alright, turn the lights on.

220
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,280
Frank, lights on.

221
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,120
Why are you doing this?

222
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,480
We'll talk at home after this.

223
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,960
Do you think I've fallen so low
that you had to do this?

224
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,640
I don't like feeling that to you
I'm just an add-on.

225
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,760
I want them to hire me for my skills,

226
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,800
not because you wouldn't accept
the interview if it wasn't me.

227
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,280
I'm sorry if I made you feel bad.

228
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,920
Aren't you going to explain yourself?

229
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,280
You were right. I was wrong

230
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,720
to make you feel like an add-on.

231
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,760
Then why did you do it?

232
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,880
Because I wanted you
to feel confident in yourself.

233
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,440
You don't need Pie.

234
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,720
There are so many others
who want to work with you.

235
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,680
Others who only want me because if
it's not me, you won't do the interview.

236
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,200
Lin,

237
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,040
do you know
why I never gave interviews before?

238
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,520
Because you're arrogant?

239
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,720
Because I'm shy.

240
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,720
I'm not confident.
I never know how to act.

241
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,960
I'm used to being in the kitchen.

242
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,160
Suddenly standing there,
posing for pictures, it's not me.

243
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,040
But you did great today.
No problem at all.

244
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,680
That's because you were behind the camera.

245
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,080
With you,

246
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,760
I have something to focus on.

247
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,920
I don't feel stiff.
I have a reason to smile at the camera

248
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,320
because it feels like I'm smiling at you.

249
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,200
I'm sorry…

250
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,560
for the way I spoke to you.

251
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,560
I should've been happy

252
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,520
knowing that I mean that much to you.

253
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,600
I'm sorry.

254
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,880
It's okay.

255
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Alright.

256
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,760
Come on.

257
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,240
Auntie.

258
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,640
Oh, Jane.

259
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,760
Lin's dad came yesterday

260
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,600
and told Aunt Aom there's a rumor
Lin lost her job,

261
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,360
and now she's investing
in W Magazine. Is that true?

262
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,560
It's true.

263
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,160
Alright.

264
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,320
Did she believe Dad?

265
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,800
No, she didn't.

266
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,280
I just didn't have the courage
to tell Mom. I didn't want to upset her.

267
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,960
But I think you should tell her yourself.

268
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,920
Better she hears it from you
than someone else.

269
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,680
Yes, Mom.

270
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,840
Yes.

271
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,680
Mom said she's making hot pot tonight.
She asked me to invite you over.

272
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,160
I'm so ready to eat.

273
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,400
What's wrong?

274
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,040
Lin,

275
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,840
Kate dropped by.
She wants to have dinner with us.

276
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,200
Lin, are you okay?

277
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,720
I'm her daughter, Jane.

278
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,280
Why isn't she on my side?

279
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,920
She knows what Kate did to me.

280
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,960
It's no big deal.

281
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,240
She came. That's her business, not ours.

282
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,360
Lin.

283
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,320
Can I talk to you?

284
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,600
Just the two of us.

285
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,200
Why'd you invite her?

286
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,040
You're afraid
we can't finish the food ourselves?

287
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,080
I'm going home.

288
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,560
What did Lin say?

289
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,200
I don't think she'll ever forgive me.

290
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,000
I don't want to talk.
I don't want to see her.

291
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,760
I don't want to see Kate ever again.

292
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,000
Do you still love her?

293
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,280
No.

294
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,640
Go get Lin for me.

295
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,840
No.

296
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Aom.

297
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,560
Let the kids handle it.

298
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,120
Let me go.

299
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,440
I'll let go if you don't go upstairs.

300
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,600
Lin is my daughter. Why can't I go up?

301
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,040
Because I said let the kids
solve it themselves.

302
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,400
This is my family.

303
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,560
But this is my house.

304
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,840
I have every right to stop you
from going upstairs.

305
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,240
Mom's definitely going to come up.

306
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,040
Where's Mom?

307
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,640
She already left.

308
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,640
But I'm sure
she still wants to talk to you.

309
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,360
She's not listening.

310
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,440
Mom,

311
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,280
come play with me.

312
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,600
Mom, that hurts!

313
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,920
Lin.

314
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,440
Are you okay?

315
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,200
Mom, I got first place on the exam.
Are you happy?

316
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,880
Lin,

317
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,800
why are you lying here?

318
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,720
I was waiting for you.

319
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Why wait?

320
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,080
You know I work late. You'll have to
wake up early for school tomorrow.

321
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,720
I got a scholarship, Mom.

322
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,760
I wanted to tell you first.

323
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,920
A scholarship to New York?

324
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,640
If I get a job,

325
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,560
you won't have to work so hard anymore.

326
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,320
I'll take care of you.

327
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,520
Where's Lin?

328
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
She's asleep.

329
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,360
She was upset

330
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,560
that Aunt Aom didn't take her side.

331
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,840
And how about you?

332
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,160
It's good to guard your heart sometimes.

333
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,760
Jane…

334
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,920
I'm going home to talk to my mom.

335
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,960
Are you sure?

336
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,199
I'm telling her about the job.

337
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,440
Do you want me to come with you?

338
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,480
It's okay.

339
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,440
Talk to her gently, dear.

340
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,960
-I will. Goodbye.
-Alright.

341
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,760
Lin.

342
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,480
I know you're angry at me.

343
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,960
But when I heard the news, I got worried.

344
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,040
I love you.

345
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,440
About the job…

346
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,960
If you loved her,
you wouldn't have left when she was five.

347
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,160
Go back.

348
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,600
Lin's more than capable
of taking care of herself,

349
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,240
and me, her only real family.

350
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,760
You're an outsider.

351
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,680
You have no right to meddle
in this family, and no right

352
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,360
to give advice
to someone you didn't raise.

353
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,160
Lin is my child, not yours.

354
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,840
Go home, and don't ever come back.

355
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,320
Or I'll call the police.

356
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,120
Lin, go inside.

357
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,360
Eat with me, please.

358
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,440
Mom…

359
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,920
I got fired.

360
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,720
Mom, please listen.

361
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,080
Why didn't you tell me from the start?

362
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,720
I didn't believe your dad when he said it.

363
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,960
But then I heard it from Kate yesterday.

364
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,600
I was afraid you'd be disappointed

365
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,680
that I failed

366
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,920
to live up to your hopes.

367
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,880
I've never been disappointed in you.

368
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,120
No matter what happens,

369
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,680
you're the greatest pride of my life.

370
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,120
Send it to the client first.

371
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,760
Yes, ma'am.

372
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,160
You can't come in. Please wait outside.

373
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,440
You're the one who should be
waiting outside. I need to speak with Pie.

374
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,680
-You're not allowed.
-It's fine.

375
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,120
Go back to work.

376
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,560
If it's urgent, you could've just called.

377
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,800
I just wanted to see the face
of someone respected in society

378
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,720
who acts like a criminal.

379
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,480
That's defamation, unless you have proof.

380
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,480
I'm sorry.

381
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,600
Your staff who hit me with a car

382
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,400
threw rocks at my restaurant.

383
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,880
How is that related to me?

384
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,560
Besides,

385
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,160
I fired him the same day
he grazed you on set.

386
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,160
He caused trouble,
he had to take responsibility.

387
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,040
You really think I ordered him to do it?

388
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,120
I was sitting there too.

389
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,640
I could've been hit by glass or rocks.

390
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
And what about Uncle Lek?

391
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,560
How do you explain that?

392
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,440
I know, but she wouldn't listen.

393
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,480
Ms. Pie, you still have to pay me.

394
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,800
I delivered the message.

395
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,160
But I never said how she'd react.

396
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,200
Stay away from Lin,

397
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,600
no matter
if it's about work or investments.

398
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,840
Or I'll testify
where all of this really came from.

399
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,480
If your staff or Uncle Lek
claims you hired them,

400
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,440
you won't get away with it.

401
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,960
I was wondering how you managed

402
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,680
to stay home for so long.

403
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,200
And about Kate, what do you think?

404
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,560
Mom…

405
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,880
I know she hurt you.

406
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,440
If I were you, I'd be angry too.

407
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,720
But if she wants to apologize,

408
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
you should at least let her talk.

409
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,600
Listen first,

410
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,360
then decide.

411
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,240
Here, call her.

412
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,120
She's probably waiting.

413
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,080
Don't go out alone like that again.

414
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,040
If she can hire someone to throw rocks,
what if something worse happens?

415
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,960
I know, but I couldn't hold it in.

416
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,880
Now I get why Dad came back.

417
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,840
He still wants money from Mom and me.

418
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,160
Let them go, both your dad and Pie.

419
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,520
I might be unemployed for a while.

420
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,120
You're so talented.
You won't be jobless for long.

421
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,400
It's already been a while.

422
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,280
Just think of it as a break.
Spend time with me.

423
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,440
As for Kate,

424
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,600
maybe just call her and get it over with.

425
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,560
Are you okay with that?

426
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,160
Of course. Why not?

427
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,080
Not jealous?

428
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,360
Not jealous, because you're mine.

429
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,080
Thank you.

430
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,040
Lin.

431
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,200
-Want a drink?
-No.

432
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,840
Let's just talk so I can go home.

433
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,520
So you came just to get this over with?

434
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,280
Yes.

435
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,680
I'm sorry.

436
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,760
I've never had the chance
to say it since that day.

437
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,960
You don't have to.

438
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,240
We don't even have to see
each other again. I don't mind.

439
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,240
Lin.

440
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,240
Tan tricked me.

441
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,200
So that's all you came to say?

442
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,880
Lin.

443
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,520
Please, just hear me out.

444
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,280
The guys at your office were betting

445
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,120
on whether someone could come between us.

446
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,360
I'm so sorry.

447
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,440
If I could turn back time,
I'd never do it.

448
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,280
I'll do anything,

449
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,960
just give us another chance.

450
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,200
I promise it'll never happen again.

451
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,480
I still love you, darling.

452
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,720
Hello.

453
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,760
Do you know Lin?

454
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,080
You should be with me, not Jane.

455
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,360
Lin is my girlfriend, not yours.

456
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,640
The ring you're wearing,

457
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,200
I have one too.

458
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,520
How do you know
she loves you more than me?

459
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,760
Jane.

460
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,720
Jane.

461
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,520
If that's how it is,
why not give me a chance instead?

462
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,000
