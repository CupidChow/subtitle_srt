1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,519
Being proposed to
is kind of nerve-wracking, right?

2
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,200
If you can't let go,
then let's stop seeing each other.

3
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,920
It just makes things harder.

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,560
Why keep trying?

5
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,560
I don't want to regret
not doing everything I could.

6
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,080
I told her already.

7
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,760
Someone's already claimed me.

8
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,800
I can't love anyone else now.

9
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,320
I'll bring it to your house
when I'm done writing it.

10
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,320
I packed everything for you.

11
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Go take a shower and get ready,
or you'll miss your flight.

12
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,800
I don't want to go, Mom.

13
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,840
I know your life is here.

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,800
But if you go, it could be even better.

15
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,440
There'll be more opportunities.

16
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,440
You should go.

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,520
You earned that scholarship.
It wasn't easy.

18
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,720
And have you told Jane yet?

19
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
If you've thought it through,

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,320
I'll respect your decision.

21
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,800
THE WAIT

22
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,160
Wow. Done. It smells nice.

23
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,720
Have you seen Lin?

24
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,280
She walked home early this morning.

25
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,000
She didn't wake me up.

26
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,880
-What's that?
-What?

27
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,680
On your finger, what is that?

28
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,480
What is it?

29
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
Lin gave it to me.

30
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,360
Congratulations, dear.

31
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,560
You finally got your wish.

32
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,519
I'm going to marry Lin.

33
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,280
Whatever makes you happy, dear.

34
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,600
I've seen you wait for her for so long.

35
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,240
You never even looked at anyone else.

36
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,080
Lin was my first love,

37
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,920
and she'll be my last.

38
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,200
Give me a hug, I'm so happy.

39
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,960
I miss you.

40
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,760
Let's go pick out rings today.

41
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,600
This daisy will wilt soon.

42
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,760
But before we go,

43
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,320
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

44
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Aom,

45
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,400
I brought your favorite snacks.

46
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,440
Thank you.

47
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,400
Has your daughter told you anything yet?

48
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,560
Not yet.

49
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,560
We're really going to be a family soon.

50
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,960
If it's Jane, I'd be happy.

51
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,360
That's great!

52
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,600
But I do worry a bit.

53
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,200
My family's not rich.
We still have to work to get by.

54
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,520
Money isn't the issue.

55
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,040
Hey,

56
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,520
I liked Kate
because I thought she loved Lin,

57
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,280
and if things got tough,

58
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,120
they would take care of each other.

59
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
But if it's Jane,

60
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,840
she's better than anyone in this world.

61
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,480
In the end,
it's about whether they love each other.

62
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,880
One day, we won't be around anymore.

63
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,120
And when that day comes,
they'll have to take care of each other.

64
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,960
You're so sweet.

65
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,560
They reached out. If I say yes,
they want me to start right away.

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,360
When would you go?

67
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
I haven't decided yet.

68
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,080
I wanted to talk to you first.

69
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,600
I'm going home.

70
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,920
Jane…

71
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,840
They're really getting married?

72
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,080
Are you serious?

73
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,040
Yes. My girl told me herself.

74
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,840
Jane, what do you think--

75
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,640
Hey? Wait.

76
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,840
Jane! I'll be back. Jane!

77
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,720
What happened?

78
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,760
What's wrong, Jane?

79
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,600
Jane, wait for me.

80
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,960
Jane.

81
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,880
Why are you crying?

82
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,680
A fashion magazine in New York
reached out to Lin.

83
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,560
Is she going?

84
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,720
She asked me.

85
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,880
And what did you say?

86
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,760
I don't want her to go.

87
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,400
But it's the job she loves.

88
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,800
It's a big opportunity for her.

89
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,120
What if I let her go,

90
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,160
and she disappears again?

91
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,680
Did Jane change her number?

92
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,600
Yes.

93
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,000
Then may I have her new number?

94
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,920
Jane's not doing well right now.

95
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,800
She cries all the time.

96
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,960
She won't eat, won't sleep.
She's lost so much weight.

97
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,240
She won't leave the house
or talk to anyone.

98
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,080
I feel so bad for her.

99
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,680
If you're not coming back to Thailand,

100
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,680
I think it's better
you don't contact her anymore.

101
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,000
I understand.

102
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,000
I won't contact her again.

103
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,200
I told Lin to stop contacting you

104
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,120
if she wasn't ever coming back.

105
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,720
You kept crying,

106
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,560
couldn't eat, couldn't sleep.

107
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,880
Every time you woke up,
you cried yourself back to sleep.

108
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,280
I couldn't bear to see someone I love

109
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,640
in that much pain.

110
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,920
I couldn't.

111
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,000
I felt bad for you.

112
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,680
So I decided

113
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,960
it was better if you two stopped talking.

114
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
I'm sorry.

115
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,880
Jane already left, didn't she?

116
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,120
Yes.

117
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,440
I got a job offer from New York.

118
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,680
So what are you going to do?

119
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,840
Ever since I came back,
I had been waiting for that email.

120
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,760
I checked my phone morning, noon,
and night, waiting for it.

121
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,400
But one day, I forgot about it.

122
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,040
Because I was happy to be here with you,

123
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,000
to be at home,

124
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
and to be with Jane.

125
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,080
So you've already
made your decision, haven't you?

126
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,080
I'VE GOT A JOB AS A PHOTOGRAPHER ASSISTANT

127
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,480
THIS IS THE FIRST MAGAZINE I'VE SHOT.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M A PHOTOGRAPHER NOW.

128
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,120
DEAR JANE, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
BE HAPPY…

129
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,000
Every year on your birthday,
Lin sent a card.

130
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,480
I had to put them away each time.

131
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,760
Actually, the one who stopped talking
these past eight years

132
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,960
was me, not Lin.

133
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,960
I think she's always been consistent.

134
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,120
It was me. I was scared
she wouldn't come back.

135
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,880
Scared she'd hurt you again.

136
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,480
But now, I think
even if she goes to New York,

137
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,240
or anywhere in the world,

138
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,360
I believe she'll still be true to you.

139
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,840
No need.

140
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,560
Thank you.

141
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,880
Jane's waiting inside.

142
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,840
Lin.

143
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,640
Yes?

144
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,000
I just found out you never told Jane
that I asked you

145
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,680
to stop contacting her.

146
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,360
Thank you for that.

147
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,000
Go. She's waiting.

148
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,960
Let's not disturb them.

149
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,600
Thank you for never forgetting me.

150
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,440
How could I?

151
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,400
You've always meant the world to me.

152
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,360
When we were friends,

153
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,320
you were the closest person in my life.

154
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,320
I could spend the whole day with you

155
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,360
without saying a word.

156
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,400
Just having you beside me

157
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,760
made me happy.

158
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,320
I didn't know if I liked being around you

159
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
because of comfort,

160
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,080
closeness,

161
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,680
or because…

162
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,640
I'd already been
in love with you all along.

163
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,680
I've never loved anyone but you.

164
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,600
And I keep falling in love with you
over and over again.

165
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,160
These are my letters.

166
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
‎DEAR JANE, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
‎I HOPE YOU'RE REALLY HAPPY THIS YEAR…

167
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,400
Aunt Tuk kept them all.

168
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,800
Every single one?

169
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,320
About the New York job,

170
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,160
I'm okay if you take it.

171
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,800
I know you wouldn't leave me.

172
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,520
How could I stay away from you?

173
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,720
My little ball of joy.

174
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,520
Is she still on leave today?

175
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,520
If she doesn't show up, I guess she's off.

176
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,440
Yeah.

177
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,320
Weird, right?

178
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,720
She used to be
at the restaurant every day.

179
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,160
Now she's like,

180
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,520
I am

181
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,720
the CEO

182
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,920
The CEO…

183
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,920
‎Sorry, Tim…

184
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,040
-Tim…
-Where's Jane?

185
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,520
She hasn't come in yet.

186
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,800
Do you have any business with her?

187
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,040
No. I just arranged to meet someone here.

188
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
-You should get back to work.
-Sure.

189
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Let's go then. Time to prep the fish.

190
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,680
The fish…

191
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,280
-Come here.
-Let's go.

192
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,680
Who's he meeting with?

193
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,440
I don't know. But not me.

194
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,280
Of course not. If it were,

195
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,040
it would be to fire you.

196
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,120
Don't you wanna know?

197
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,800
Nope.

198
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,520
Boss's business.

199
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,400
Who's that?

200
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,120
Oh, now you're curious?

201
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,120
I'm just looking out for Jane, okay?

202
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,800
Sure.

203
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,280
I think this is the end.

204
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
But I want to see Lin.

205
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,000
Why would you?

206
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,120
I thought we got our answer at the resort.

207
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,120
Lin's not picking up my calls.

208
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,040
So, she's Lin's ex?

209
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,080
This isn't good.

210
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,280
If you know where she is,

211
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,040
could you take me to her?

212
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,360
Thank you, Lin, for once loving me.

213
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,720
That was the best time of my life.

214
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,160
At first, I came back
hoping to win you back.

215
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,360
I really wanted to do everything I could

216
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,520
to get you back.

217
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,520
But when I saw the way you looked at Jane…

218
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,280
I understood everything.

219
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,920
There's no way you'll ever look
at anyone else again.

220
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,200
Well, I'm gonna head to the restaurant.

221
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,120
Can we still be friends?

222
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,080
Why isn't she here yet?

223
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,560
I don't know.

224
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,280
Oh, there she is. Jane!

225
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,200
Jane!

226
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,280
What's up?

227
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,280
Well, Tim brought
a girl here to talk today.

228
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,280
Yeah, they were talking
about going to a resort with her.

229
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,160
It looks like

230
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,760
the girl was--

231
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,280
What?

232
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,240
Whoa.

233
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Well, it looks like the girl--

234
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,480
What's wrong?

235
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,080
Are you sick?

236
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,120
If you've caught a cold, go rest.

237
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,680
It looks like the girl was Lin's ex.

238
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,120
What?

239
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,280
We're so getting fired.

240
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,080
But the kitchen's so busy, right?

241
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,120
Yeah, seriously.

242
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,600
So busy that without us,
Jane would be overwhelmed.

243
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,760
Yeah, she'd be overworked.

244
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,760
We can't get fired. We need to work hard.

245
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,200
Show max effort.

246
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,720
This restaurant
can't survive without us, Tim.

247
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,520
Whoa, so scary…

248
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,680
You brought Kate here, didn't you?

249
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,720
And you're the one
who took her to the resort.

250
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,760
It's been a long time, Tim.

251
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,280
I've always been clear that whatever
this is between us isn't possible,

252
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,600
not because you're not good enough,
but because I already love someone,

253
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,320
and I've loved her for a long time.

254
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
So you're telling me to give up?

255
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,640
You don't have to give up

256
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,520
because you were never Lin's competition.

257
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,920
I've always loved Lin.

258
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,160
No one could ever replace her.

259
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,280
And I could never love anyone else
the way I love her.

260
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,000
-Jane.
-Hmm?

261
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,160
I wanted to talk about Pie.

262
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,640
The police found a money trail from her
to the person who threw the rock.

263
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,320
This morning, she confessed
because of the evidence.

264
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,400
She also admitted that

265
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,600
the car that grazed Lin
during the photoshoot

266
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,360
was meant to hit you.

267
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,160
What did the police say?

268
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,080
They're going to issue
a warrant for her arrest.

269
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,360
Why would she do that?

270
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,520
Maybe she wanted Lin to invest.

271
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,840
And when I got in the way,

272
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,040
she wanted me out of the picture.

273
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,000
No wonder. The police said
she's got several fraud cases.

274
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,600
Then please take care of this matter.

275
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,440
I'll go prepare for tonight.

276
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,920
Are you here to see Jane?

277
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,480
She's picking up her girlfriend.

278
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,360
We're just the extras.

279
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,960
Can't we sneak a peak?

280
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,680
-Let's go.
-Where to?

281
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,440
If you're hungry, go buy something.

282
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,600
Ew.

283
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,800
-Disgusting.
-Let's go home.

284
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,440
Goodbye.

285
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,400
-Get home safe.
-Bye. See you.

286
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,960
Of course she'll get home safe.

287
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,760
I missed you.

288
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,880
Missed me? We were just home together.

289
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
I miss my girlfriend.

290
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,080
I miss you the moment you turn your back.

291
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,040
Someone's crazy in love.

292
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,400
Me?

293
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,400
Me.

294
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,600
I still remember the first day

295
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,600
I waited here for you
to close the restaurant.

296
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,240
Back then, I had nothing left.

297
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,600
Everything was falling apart.

298
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,920
It felt like I was drowning.

299
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,600
But today is a completely different story.

300
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,160
I'm still unemployed,

301
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,840
but I'm genuinely happy.

302
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,080
Right now,

303
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,680
I've stopped chasing success…

304
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,600
because I finally realized
it's not what I'm truly after.

305
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,160
Happiness that doesn't require effort

306
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,760
or a race to find.

307
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,840
That's real happiness.

308
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,000
So you're really not going back
to work in New York?

309
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,440
I'm happy here.

310
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,480
I don't overthink things anymore.

311
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,360
As for work, once they find out I'm here,

312
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,000
the offers will come eventually.

313
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,760
In the meantime,

314
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,000
I'll just keep helping you
shoot your food pics.

315
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,480
Yes.

316
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,320
It's been ages since you came back,
and we haven't finished the menu.

317
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,720
You know

318
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,880
why the New York office contacted me?

319
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
They said
they canceled my contract back then

320
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,200
because at that time,

321
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,240
my photos all looked the same.

322
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,680
Nothing new.

323
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,600
The photos came out boring,
nothing exciting.

324
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,840
They reached out again
because these photos felt fun,

325
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,760
lively, like I wasn't afraid
to try something new.

326
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,640
They said
I'd stepped out of my comfort zone.

327
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,440
And that's all because of you.

328
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,840
Me?

329
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,640
I didn't do anything.

330
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,080
I just made you take pictures of my food.

331
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,280
You taught me to see
the world differently.

332
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,320
You showed me that fashion
isn't just in magazines.

333
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,440
It's in lifestyle.

334
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,640
And that a beautiful photo
doesn't need a beautiful model.

335
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,840
It depends on
the person behind the camera.

336
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,520
You figured all that out on your own.
It's not because of me.

337
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,480
You have no idea

338
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,200
how lucky I feel to have you.

339
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,680
Lin.

340
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,320
What is it, Jane?

341
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,520
Open your eyes.

342
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,760
Come sit here.

343
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,400
So? What is it?

344
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,240
The daisies wilted days ago.

345
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,840
I got scared you might forget
you were mine.

346
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,680
Even without a ring, I could never forget.

347
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,400
I'm wearing your ring.

348
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,640
You should wear mine too.

349
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,760
So where do you want to hold our wedding?

350
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,200
I don't want to.

351
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,560
Why not?

352
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,720
I'd rather hold on to the happiness
our families already have.

353
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,800
So, no wedding at all?

354
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,520
Auntie. Do you know
where Lin and Aunt Aom went?

355
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,200
No idea. Why would I?

356
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,800
Ms. Natasha Romanoff always knows
everyone's moves in that house.

357
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,200
How come you're clueless today?

358
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,960
They didn't say anything.

359
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,800
I'm heading out.

360
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,760
-Where to?
-Out.

361
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,280
What's with the black bag?

362
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,560
Trash bag.

363
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,680
What's wrong?

364
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,040
No need to call. I'm about to leave.

365
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,800
Jane, you don't have to rush.

366
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,120
The restaurant's fine.
We can handle it. Same old stuff.

367
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,679
Just take your time.

368
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,520
That's right.

369
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,840
Normally, you always rush me to come in.
What's going on?

370
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,679
Because it's not normal today--

371
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,960
Hey!

372
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,360
There's nothing to worry about.

373
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,400
Yes.

374
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,360
Take your time, okay?

375
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,760
Lin's probably coming to see you.

376
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,679
-Lin's at the restaurant?
-Yes.

377
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,159
What's she doing there?

378
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,600
-Well…
-It's--

379
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,960
Well,

380
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,880
just dress up and wait for her. Bye.

381
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,840
You almost ruined it!

382
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,720
Did I hang up yet? Oh, I did.

383
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,000
You scared me.

384
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,240
LET'S GO TAKE A PHOTO - ALIN

385
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,200
Let's go get dressed.

386
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
I told you, no wedding.

387
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,080
It's not a wedding.

388
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,680
Let me do something for you, okay?

389
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,800
They say people change with time.

390
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,920
But I'm lucky. You never did.

391
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,160
You still love me. You still waited

392
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,520
until the day we found each other again.

393
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,920
I'm lucky you never left my side,

394
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,400
and that we still have each other.

395
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,480
We've been through so much,

396
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,400
and we'll go through even more.

397
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,000
But none of that
will ever change how we feel.

398
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,560
You'll have me until my very last breath.

399
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,360
I love you, Jane.

400
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,600
I love you too, Lin.

401
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,800
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

402
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,480
From now on, we'll wake up
to each other every morning,

403
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,680
fall asleep
in each other's arms every night,

404
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,280
and make every minute together
full of happiness.

405
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,640
We'll be everything to each other,

406
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,120
with every breath we take.

407
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,760
Busy day at the studio?

408
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,400
A little.

409
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,360
Aren't you going to the restaurant today?

410
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,520
No.

411
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,600
Why that face?

412
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,560
Stop joking.

413
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,600
I'm not joking.

414
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,320
Happy birthday.

415
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,120
How could I forget?
We were born on the same day.

416
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,080
I thought you forgot.

417
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,720
You've been so busy.

418
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,720
Let me see.

419
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,360
Thank you.

420
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,880
Happy birthday to you too.

421
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,480
I also have something for you.

422
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,680
Wait a moment.

423
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,040
Now make a wish.

424
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,640
What did you wish for?

425
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,600
That you'll be my safe zone forever.

426
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,160
I think it's time we expand our safe zone.

427
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,480
They responded?

428
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,840
Our family is about to grow.

429
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,160
Do Mom and Aunt Tuk know yet?

430
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,120
I wanted to tell you first.

431
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,960
They're going to be so happy
to have a grandkid.

432
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,600
Jin, come help Grandma put away
the books and toys.

433
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,480
Grandma, look!

434
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,160
All done. Come here.

435
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,880
-All filled up!
-I finished assembling this. Let's play!

436
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,520
Grandma, I'm hungry.

437
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,160
Oh? You're hungry now?

438
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,800
What do you want to eat today, sweetie?

439
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,800
I want Mommy's five-spice eggs!

440
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,920
-Ooh, five-spice eggs.
-Should we eat at home

441
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,880
or go to the restaurant?

442
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,040
Can I go see Mommy at the restaurant?

443
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,440
Who's here?

444
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,200
Careful!

445
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,440
Walk slowly.

446
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,840
Be careful.

447
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,200
Be careful, Jin.

448
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,360
Can we go see Mommy Jane?

449
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,280
Of course.

450
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,360
I can't keep up with her.

451
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,760
Take her to the restaurant.
Let her play there.

452
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,320
Your mom and I could use a break.

453
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,000
Let's go.

454
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,960
It looks just like
the photo of you in your wedding dress.

455
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,840
That's because we really got married here.

456
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,480
I want to wear a white dress like you too!

457
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,920
What are you two doing?

458
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,920
Jin said

459
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,880
she wants to wear
a wedding dress like ours.

460
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,640
Someday, when you grow up

461
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,080
and find someone
who means the world to you,

462
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,240
I'll give you the dress.

463
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,440
Really?

464
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,800
By then,

465
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,600
You can wear Mommy Lin's
or Mommy Jane's, whichever you like.

466
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,080
Promise?

467
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,360
Promise.

468
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,080
Promise.

469
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,960
I'm going to play with Bam and Pete.

470
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,240
Okay.

471
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,280
Be careful not to fall.

472
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,240
After all this time,

473
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,640
I always knew waiting for you
would be worth it.

474
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,240
And it really is,

475
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,120
because we're finally together.

476
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,600
Turns out happiness is really simple.

477
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,840
I don't have to
chase after happiness anymore,

478
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,360
because it's right here with me, always.

479
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,160
