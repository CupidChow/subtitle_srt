But how do I speed it up?

At this point,

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,940
we might as well go all in.

13

Overclock the CPU.

14

ZP high compression

167
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,100
You're no longer the director general!

168

walks free today!

192
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,500
and land on the north side
of the island.

193
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,380
Cross the swamp

194
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,420
and head straight for the main building!

195
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,020
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

196
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,660
Team C,

197
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,060
you'll airdrop from helicopters
onto the main building.

198
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,180
Destroy their elevators

199
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,740
and trap them on every floor.

200
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,460
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

201
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,140
Finally,

202
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,300
we must thank

203
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,100
the Chinese police officers
who came from afar.

204
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,660
Without your fearless efforts,

205
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,260
we couldn't have rooted out

206
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,020
the corruption in the police force

207
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,940
and dismantled
the scam compound so swiftly.

208
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,980
Mr. Emmett,

209
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,060
we appreciate your full support
for this operation.

210
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,460
I believe justice will prevail.

211
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,580
Well said.

212
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,300
Justice will prevail!

213
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,300
Move out!

214
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,220
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

215
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,500
Shisan,

216
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,660
your cop friends are here.

217
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,780
You won.

218
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,860
But

219
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,500
you're going to die too!
