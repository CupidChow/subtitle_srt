Alright, alright.

192
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,300
Shisan,

193
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,220
look at him showing off.

194
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,700
I'm dead serious.

195
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,300
Let me tell you, I was a top student.

196
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
At that... That...

197
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,540
Yeah, yeah. I know.

198
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,500
The Daniel Wu of Dongbang.

199
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,420
You got that right.

200
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,700
Now let's eat.

201
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,140
Shisan,

202
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,340
maybe we should actually
talk to Ne Zha about this?

203
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,100
I'm gonna grab some napkins.

204
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,300
Shisan,

205
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,220
I heard Black Dong

206
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,180
has been digging
into your real identity back home.

207
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,020
Be careful.

208
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,740
Got it.

209
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,700
Thanks.

210
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,260
Actually,

211
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,220
I've got a question for you.

212
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,420
Go ahead.

213
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,340
About that 20 million
the cops intercepted,

214
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,180
was it really bad luck,

215
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,940
or did you sabotage it?

216
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,700
Never mind.

217
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,620
Forget I asked.

218
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,260
I never asked.

219
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,980
Rui.

220
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,340
You're sharp.

221
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,340
Shisan,

222
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,860
I still don't understand

223
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,340
what you're really after.

224
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,580
But I think you're different from them.

225
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,620
If you need anything,

226
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,620
just

227
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,460
say the word.

228
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,100
Let's eat.

229
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,860
Yeah.

230
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,940
Xiaoxiao.

231
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,220
Time for your medicine.

232
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,180
Your foot infection is really severe.

233
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,740
You have to take the medicine.

234
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,100
Stop pretending to care, okay?

235
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,580
The doctor says

236
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,660
if my foot isn't treated,

237
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,220
I'll have to have it amputated.

238
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,100
I'll be crippled.

239
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,940
You're the one who ruined me.

240
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,780
So what are you doing now?

241
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,380
Playing the good person?

242
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,700
No.

243
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,780
No, Xiaoxiao.

244
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,620
I'm sorry.

245
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,700
I... I didn't mean to.

246
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,820
They forced me and abused me.

247
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,620
If I hadn't followed what they...

248
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,740
You deserved it.

249
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,900
I deserved it?

250
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,500
Yes.

251
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,860
You absolutely deserved it.

252
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:33,740
Yeah.

253
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,780
I deserved all of it.

254
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,260
Deserved to end up here.

255
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,020
Deserved the beatings.

256
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,820
Deserved to be treated like an animal!

257
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,820
You think I've had it easy?

258
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,900
Not a single day here

259
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,500
without getting beaten.

260
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,060
These injuries?

261
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,660
From those animals who made money
and came looking to satisfy their urges

262
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,980
when I was forced into prostitution
on the sixth floor.

263
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,220
They hit me, whipped me, and tortured me.

264
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,740
They never treated me
like a human being.

265
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,740
Me?

266
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,660
I'm just a tool for them
to satisfy their needs!

267
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,180
You think I want this?

268
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,060
I just want to live.

269
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,140
I don't have some heroic brother

270
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,100
coming to save me.

271
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,660
I just want to live.

272
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,220
Tell me, is that wrong?

273
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,380
Tell me,

274
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,420
is it wrong to want to live?

275
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,900
Sorry.

276
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,660
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,540
I shouldn't have said that.

278
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:38,980
I...

00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:41,860

I regret coming here.

I regret bringing you into this hell.

284
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,060
Xiaoxiao, hit me.

I've asked Li Bailing

Ask of me?
