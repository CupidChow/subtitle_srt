[Episode 14]

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:14,940
Fo!

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:15,940
Fo!

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,180
I've been working under you
all these years.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,940
There's no way I'm the mole!

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,420
I'm being framed!

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,740
Fo!

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,540
Fo,

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,580
Black Dong pulled the scam.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,500
He lost the gold.

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,460
The laundering hubs
were gone because of you!

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,020
I never even

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,860
spoke to Wang Jincheng.

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,900
How could I possibly be the mole?

16
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,780
Fo,

17
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,900
Shisan has always been meticulous.

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,700
He knew I was onto him
and wanted to take him down!

19
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,220
Yet he casually left

20
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,860
that important file

21
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,900
on his desk.

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,820
He was setting a trap!

23
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,980
He was baiting me!

24
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,860
Bullshit!

25
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,540
Fo,

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,620
I begged Zha for that playbook.

27
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,380
I was trying to save my sister.

28
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,700
But you stole it.

29
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,940
You first tried to frame me,

30
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,580
and now you're pinning this on me!

31
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,740
Listen,

32
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,780
if anything happens to my sister,

33
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,420
I'll kill you!

34
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,660
Fo,

35
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,540
Shisan did come to me because he wanted

36
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,500
to save his sister.

37
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,260
I saw how much he cared for his sister,

38
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,780
so I agreed to let him try.

39
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,300
But then Dong...

40
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,780
Fo!

41
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,460
Let me explain.

42
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,460
I have proof!

43
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,940
I have proof!

44
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,820
Xiong,

45
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,860
release him.

46
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,340
Fo,

47
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,220
I have proof.

48
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,860
You told me to investigate Shisan.

49
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,660
My guy tracked him to his home.

50
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,740
Fo, just let me make one call.

51
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,540
Please, just one call.

52
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,780
You'll see immediately who he really is!

53
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,020
Give him the phone.

54
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,980
Thank you, Fo.

55
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,860
Thank you, Zha.

56
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:04,980
Hello,

57
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,460
this is Black Dong.

58
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,820
Dong.

59
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,340
Any progress on Shisan?

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,820
Got everything.

61
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,740
Shisan's real name

62
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,860
is Han Chuan.

63
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,060
He's a cop.

64
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,540
Fo, you heard it yourself.

65
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,660
You're a cop?

66
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,380
He's a cop, Fo!

67
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,900
You're out of your mind!

68
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,300
It's just a phone call.

69
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,220
How do we know who's on the other end?

70
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,460
I could just

71
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,460
as easily claim you're a cop!

72
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,500
Dong,

73
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,660
there're also photos.

74
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,660
I'm sending them to you.

75
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,700
Send them now!

76
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,060
Send them.

77
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,420
Han Chuan,

78
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,300
this is your father!

79
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,740
And this is you, isn't it?

80
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,020
Look at that police uniform.

81
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,380
Still denying it?
Still trying to frame me?

82
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,820
Fo, look.

83
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,700
Zha, look.

84
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,700
Take a good look.

85
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,980
All of you, look.

86
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,100
He's a cop.

87
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,500
Officer,

88
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,540
you've really kept yourself well hidden.

89
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,380
Lock him up!

90
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,100
Fo!

91
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,380
Fo, he's framing me!

92
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,060
Fo,

93
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,220
the photos are doctored!

94
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,900
Black Dong, I won't let you off!

95
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,700
You won't let me off?

96
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,940
Kid, you'll need to stay alive first.

97
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,460
Dong,

98
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,860
can you talk now?

99
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,980
Yes, talk!

100
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,860
Mr. Dong,

101
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,500
Shisan's just a small fish.

102
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,780
Those fake photos

103
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,180
are only a temporary solution.

104
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,180
The bureau's ordered

105
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,780
a full takedown
of the entire scam compound.

106
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,580
Don't let your guard down.

107
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,380
Sun Cheng,

108
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,660
what nonsense are you spouting?

109
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,700
He's lying through his teeth.

110
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,420
Sir,

111
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,700
your son's on a business trip.

112
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,740
When's he coming back?

113
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,900
What?

114
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,700
My hearing's not what it used to be.

115
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,340
Your son's on a business trip.

116
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,940
When's he returning?

117
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:03,900
Ah, yes, yes.

118
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,180
These old ears don't work.

119
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,140
Young man, have a seat.

120
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,860
Let me get you some water.

121
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,420
So Shisan is a cop?

122
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,260
Here, have some water.

123
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:49,660
Sir,

124
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,140
when was this photo taken?

125
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,740
He looks so young there.

126
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,460
Yes, yes.

127
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,460
My hearing.

128
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,540
I've been having ear troubles for ages.

129
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,580
They come and go these days.

130
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,300
Sir,

131
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,340
you know, his job

132
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,820
is too demanding.

133
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,500
I keep telling him to quit being a cop

134
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,940
and go into business with me
to make some money.

135
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,020
How nice that would be.

136
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,020
But he just won't listen.

137
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,060
He has ideals.

138
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,820
What?

139
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,420
You want a pear?

140
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,380
No.

141
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,180
I don't want a pear.

142
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,820
You... You have it.

143
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,260
I'm leaving.

144
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,420
This is ridiculous.

145
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,020
No, no.

146
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,900
I can't have it alone.

147
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,980
Young man, you're the guest.

148
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,180
Sit tight.

149
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,260
I'll wash some pears for you.

150
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,140
Wait, sir,

151
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,580
so you can hear me?

152
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,660
What?

153
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,340
My ears are bad!

154
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,980
You have to be louder!

155
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:41,980
I...

156
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,100
In a minute.

157
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,180
Young man, wait here.

158
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:45,860
I'll go get the door.

159
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,900
Wait, sir,

160
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,300
so you can hear?

161
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,220
What?

162
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,660
Just sit tight, young man.

163
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,700
Don't be impatient.

164
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,300
He's still here.

165
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,100
He's been asking nonstop
about Han Chuan.

166
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,380
So I kept him on the hook.

167
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,020
Though we succeeded
in the interception this time,

168
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,060
the scam group

169
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,340
may suspect Han Chuan.

170
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,060
Master,

171
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,740
you're saying...?

172
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,620
They'll investigate
his background domestically.

173
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,540
Keep a close watch

174
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,300
on Han Chuan's family recently.

175
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,500
Mr. Dong,

176
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,660
the coordinated takedown

177
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,140
of the money laundering hubs
was flawless.

178
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:25,820
Zha.

179
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,940
- The interrogators
- He's talking nonsense.

180
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,940
have already extracted valuable intel.

181
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,300
The provincial department
issued new orders.

182
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,500
On the premise of ensuring your safety,

183
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,900
collect evidence against Tie Fo,
the leader of the compound.

184
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,740
Have him extradited back to the country

185
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,020
for trial.

186
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,220
Mr. Dong,

187
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,980
stay sharp in the organization.

188
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,220
We'll fully cooperate with you.

189
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,380
We'll be waiting for your return.

190
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,540
Well, officer,

191
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
I'm voluntarily reporting
and cooperating fully.

192
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,180
That's gotta count for something, right?

193
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,020
Yes.

194
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,500
Fo,

195
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,900
- I'm innocent.
- Move!

196
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,260
Fo!

197
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,620
I've been framed!

198
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,620
Fo!

199
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,340
Han Chuan,

200
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,220
you ruthless bastard!

201
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,340
Ruthless bastard!

202
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,660
Fo!

203
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,580
You have to believe me!

204
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,820
Shisan set me up!

205
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,900
I've been loyal to you!

206
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,020
Trust me!

207
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,660
I can still make you money!

208
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,500
Fo!

209
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,380
Fo!

210
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,180
Tie Fo, you son of a gun!

211
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,220
You'll end up like me!

212
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
No one in this business

213
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,220
gets a happy ending!

214
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,540
Fo,

215
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,260
think about it,

216
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,140
Shisan isn't driven by money or lust.

217
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,540
With Black Dong's position now vacant,

218
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,820
well...

219
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,700
Shisan,

220
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,700
do you think it's better for one
to be greedy or not?

221
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,140
Depends on how it's leveraged.

222
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,460
People got scammed
because they were greedy for money.

223
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,500
Black Dong made a slip-up
because he wanted power.

224
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,940
Ba Sihai has been unable to get promoted

225
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,900
because of his lust.

226
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,300
You're different from them.

227
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,900
After you came here,

228
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,660
I've been observing you.

229
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,780
You're not greedy for anything.

230
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,380
What's the point of greed?

231
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,140
Money, power, women?

232
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,820
I've enjoyed them all back home.

233
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,940
And in the end, the cops

234
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,020
left me with nothing.

235
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,020
I admire your skills.

236
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,980
You can start over here.

237
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,860
Take back everything you've lost.

238
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,460
Fo,

239
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,060
I came here

240
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,180
to find my sister

241
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,580
and to hide from the police.

242
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,620
So, I don't covet
a high-ranking position

243
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,820
under you.

244
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,020
All I ask is...

245
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,340
Your sister

246
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,100
will be well taken care of.

247
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,420
Just focus on your work here.

248
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,500
You don't have to worry

249
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,540
about anything else.

250
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,700
Have your soup.

251
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,940
Shisan.

252
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,340
You should thank Fo now.

253
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,260
Thank you, Fo.

254
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,380
You've got loyalty.

255
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,900
Good.

256
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,980
Fo,

257
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,300
so you can trust Shisan

258
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,660
to take Black Dong's position
now, right?

259
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,220
Fo, Zha, thanks for your appreciation.

260
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,700
But I'm

261
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,540
still new here.

262
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,260
Wouldn't promoting me so soon cause...?

263
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,100
Don't decide yet.

264
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,900
Take your time

265
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,740
to think it over.

266
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,060
Exactly.

267
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,380
Think carefully.

268
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,700
Thank you, Fo.

269
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,540
Thank you, Zha.

270
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,780
With Black Dong gone,

271
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,900
who do you think

272
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,420
will take over his position?

273
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,340
Isn't it obvious?

274
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,500
Has to be Hai.

275
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,740
But I heard

276
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,860
Fo invited Shisan

277
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,260
to the rooftop for a meal yesterday.

278
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,500
Do you think...?

279
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,740
He's just a newcomer.

280
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,500
If he took the position,

281
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,660
not to mention Hai,

282
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,860
even we would be humiliated.

283
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,460
Let's eat.

284
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,300
Shisan,

285
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,060
did Tie Fo really offer you
Black Dong's position?

286
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,260
Did you accept?

287
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,940
No.

288
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,060
Good that you didn't.

289
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,300
You don't know,

290
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,980
but Ba Sihai is fixated
on that position.

291
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,980
Accepting it

292
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,220
would make you his mortal enemy.

293
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,020
Then

294
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,300
we'd never be able to touch
the dock business again.

295
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,860
And we wouldn't be able
to send Xiaoxiao away.

296
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,340
Right.

297
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,820
I'll think about it.

298
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,540
Shisan,

299
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,460
have some mung bean soup to cool down.

300
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,540
Fo.

301
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,420
Fo.

302
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,260
I'm Sang Tuo.

303
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,020
Shisan's buddy.

304
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,860
Spit it out.

305
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,500
Fo,

306
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,580
you can't let Shisan

307
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,300
take over Black Dong's position.

308
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,380
Why not?

309
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,980
This compound has around 500 people,

310
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,540
with factions everywhere.

311
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,740
Balance is everything.

312
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,340
Shisan is Ba Sihai's man.

313
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,340
If he takes Black Dong's position,

314
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,620
it means Ba Sihai will control
the entire second floor.

315
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,180
Once his power grows,

316
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,820
restoring balance

317
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,580
will be impossible.

318
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,620
Go on.

319
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,300
This compound is all about performance.

320
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,860
I only care about money.

321
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,060
More and more of it.

322
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,980
You pay me the most.

323
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,860
I answer to you alone.

324
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,540
I,

325
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,100
Sang Tuo,

326
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,860
beg you

327
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,140
for this chance.

328
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,900
Three months.

329
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,780
Within three months,

330
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,340
I'll make the nude chat group thrive.

331
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,660
If I fail,

332
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,780
I'll deliver my head to you myself.

333
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,260
Brave of you.

334
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,620
Your personality and appearance

335
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,700
remind me of an old friend.
