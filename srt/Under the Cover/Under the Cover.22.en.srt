00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,380
[Episode 22]

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,460
Hard to believe

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,020
a small compound could outgun

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,980
the entire police force.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,380
Of course.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,820
Here, money can buy lives

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,900
and even make people sell their own.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,060
So

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,860
we need to scrutinize this plan

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,540
more carefully

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,700
and work out a detailed deployment.

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,420
Don't worry. With me here,

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,260
none of them will escape.

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,100
Han Chuan,

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,060
you've been on the island.

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,660
Is it really as Mr. Sang described?

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,540
Mr. Sang

19
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,460
grew up in Dongbang.

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,500
He knows the local situation
better than I do.

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,500
An Fei,

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,940
don't worry about that.

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,620
Mr. Sang and I

24
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,620
will develop

25
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,620
a new island assault plan in detail.

26
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,820
You seem quite close
to my colleague, Mr. Sang.

27
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,740
Of course.

28
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,300
We hit it off from the moment we met.

29
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,100
I even wanted to keep him here
as a police officer.

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,260
That probably isn't an option.

31
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,820
Once this operation wraps up,

32
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,260
if there's a chance,

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,620
Mr. Sang, you're welcome
to come back to China with us.

34
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,100
Sounds good. It's been a long time
since I visited China.

35
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,260
I'd love to when the chance arises.

36
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,780
Well, let's call it a day for now.

37
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,660
I have another meeting later.

38
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,260
Sure.

39
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,540
By the way,

40
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,380
where are you staying now?

41
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,900
I heard you didn't

42
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,340
take the hotel we arranged for you.

43
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,860
We've already settled in.

44
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,860
No need to trouble yourself.

45
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,380
Alright.

46
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,900
Let's call it a day then.

47
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,380
Wishing our plan success.

48
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,220
Mr. Sang, with your help, I believe

49
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,020
we can definitely
eradicate the scam compound.

50
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,340
This way.

51
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,380
Oh, Han Chuan,

52
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,020
don't you like jade?

53
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,260
I bought a piece on the way here.

54
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,860
See if you like it.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,080
[Hope Chuan stays safe on every mission]

56
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,820
Where did you get it?

57
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,900
Near the police station.

58
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,300
From a girl.

59
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,740
She said this jade brings safety.

60
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,900
Xiaoxiao's note mentioned
the jade she wanted to buy me.

61
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,020
Now An Fei has it.

62
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,340
So she's safe.

63
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,740
How do I look?

64
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:52,980
Thanks.

65
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,380
Don't mention it.

66
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,460
Mr. Sang, we'll leave now.

67
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,060
Shisan,

68
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,620
we've got a show.

69
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:25,940
Sang Tuo,

70
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,900
happy now?

71
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,220
I'm not leaving with An Fei.

72
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,340
Shisan,

73
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,940
not bad acting.

74
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,460
But it's not enough to make me

75
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,020
fully trust you.

76
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,780
What else do you want?

77
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,140
See An Fei's car?

78
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,540
I prepared a little surprise for him.

79
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,180
Just press this button and...

80
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,980
That's the real pledge of loyalty
I need from you.

81
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,820
Sang Tuo!

82
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,340
You've gone too far!

83
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,100
How so?

84
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,700
It's just a choice.

85
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,540
Either my trust

86
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,300
or your buddy's life.

87
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,100
Your call.

88
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,220
You've got
a little over ten seconds to decide.

89
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,220
An Fei!

90
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,700
Bye.

91
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,060
Now, press it!

92
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,380
Do it!

93
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,940
That's my buddy.

94
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,020
Shisan,

95
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,900
Subhuti said

96
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,940
my fortune this year will soar

97
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,740
unstoppably.

98
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,780
But, Shisan,

99
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,020
just say the word,

100
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,580
and I'll

101
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,900
do anything for you.

102
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,460
That's my truth today.

103
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,300
You know what?

104
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,900
My father was a wealth devourer.

105
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,020
He only knew how to make money

106
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,940
but couldn't keep it.

107
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,340
In the end, he lost both
his wealth and his life.

108
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,460
But I'm different.

109
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,140
I'm a fortune hoarder.

110
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,900
Power in my palm,

111
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,220
and wealth at the back of my hand.

112
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,620
I use my wealth

113
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,740
to safeguard my power.

114
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,500
And then use my power

115
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,140
to grow my wealth.

116
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,340
Shisan, listen to me,

117
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,140
together we'll be kings of Dongbang.

118
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,940
The entire Dongbang will be ours.

119
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,740
I get it now.

120
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,860
I've seen through it all!

121
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,260
Back when my dad funded the orphanage,

122
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,300
I had money,

123
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,700
but no one knew who I was.

124
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,620
So they all bullied me.

125
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,860
Shisan,

126
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,620
let me introduce you.

127
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,900
Him.

128
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,020
He was the one who led the bullying.

129
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,180
Later,

130
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,540
I learned to possess wealth

131
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,860
and safeguard my own power.

132
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,140
With money,

133
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,820
you won't be bullied.

134
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,620
With money,

135
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,300
you can protect those you care about.

136
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:07,980
Shisan,

137
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,140
with our brains, our skills,

138
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,220
and our destiny,

139
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,540
why don't we conquer a broader world

140
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,460
together?

141
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,740
Dongbang, Southeast Asia,

142
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,060
China, Asia,

143
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,380
even the whole world!

144
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,660
I'm not interested in any of that.

145
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,340
What nonsense are you spouting?

146
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,100
This is every man's lifelong dream.

147
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,140
Sang Tuo, let me tell you,

148
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,580
all I want now is to see Xiaoxiao.

149
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:47,980
Fine.

150
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,660
Simple.

151
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,060
Dahn,

152
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,780
he wants to see his sister.

153
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,260
Are you deaf?

154
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,140
Or did you get your tongue cut off

155
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,180
like Biao?

156
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,020
Go get Han Xiaoxiao.

157
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,420
Uh, last night, there was an incident.

158
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,740
Li Bailing died.

159
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,580
And Han Xiaoxiao...

160
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,380
She escaped.

161
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,260
I see.

162
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,420
Get back to work.

163
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,020
What did he say?

164
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,340
What happened to Xiaoxiao?

165
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,340
Shisan,

166
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,620
she's in the safe house now.

167
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,140
She's not in any danger.

168
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,140
Where is she? I need to see her!

169
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,580
You'll see her.

170
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,180
But not now.

171
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,060
Why?

172
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,300
Think about it.

173
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,060
Tie Fo's faction
hasn't been completely wiped out yet.

174
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,620
There are too many eyes
watching us out there.

175
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,180
Seeing her now

176
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
would only put her in danger.

177
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,100
Shisan,

178
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,780
see her or not,

179
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,380
you decide.

180
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,020
Sang Tuo,

181
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,820
I'll trust you one last time.

182
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,260
I'm tired.

183
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,100
Han Xiaoxiao escaped!

184
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,420
What am I supposed to use
to control Han Chuan now?

185
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,860
You?

186
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,620
Find her! Now!

187
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,420
Understood.

188
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,060
You go too!

189
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,700
Shisan,

190
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,180
you've been fiddling

191
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,740
with that rock since you got back.

192
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,060
You've examined it enough.

193
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,740
Scanned it in every possible way.

194
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,460
An Fei wouldn't have

195
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,220
given me this stone for nothing.

196
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,020
There must be a clue inside.

197
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,020
Okay.

198
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,980
Just wait.

199
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,540
Where's Mr. An? I need to see him.

200
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,620
Xiaoxiao, not now.

201
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,460
He's working.

202
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,620
Stop lying.

203
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,420
I know something happened to him!

204
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,580
Let me see him...

205
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,860
Mr. Emmett has been arrested.

206
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,900
Charged with corruption.

207
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,740
His wife went to the mayor
several times.

208
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,220
But she hasn't left the house

209
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,620
since two days ago.

210
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,940
I suspect

211
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,260
she's in danger.

212
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,460
Yes, Master.

213
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,460
I'll go see her this afternoon.

214
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,580
She's our only hope now.

215
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,780
I understand, Master.

216
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,140
Don't worry.

217
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,020
I'll bring Han Chuan
and Xiaoxiao back safely.

218
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,500
Yes.

219
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,780
Mr. An,

220
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,220
weren't you caught in a car bombing...?

221
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,060
Critically injured?

222
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,380
And at death's door?

223
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,740
An Fei!

224
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,660
An Fei,

225
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,580
you need to see the detonator
in my hand.

226
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,100
I'll honk three times.

227
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,020
Detonate it

228
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,340
after the third honk.

229
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,020
Come here.

230
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,540
There's a bomb planted under our car.

231
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,460
Don't panic.

232
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,100
This concerns Han Chuan's life.

233
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,740
Don't let Sang Tuo suspect anything.

234
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,620
Don't get in the car. Walk ahead.

235
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,060
But...

236
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,580
Go.

237
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,500
Don't look back.
Wait for me at the entrance.

238
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,060
I'm grabbing some drinks from that shop.

239
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,780
What would you like?

240
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,780
Just water.

241
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,260
