[Ten days ago]

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,660
Zha.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,460
Zha, please stop hitting me.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,700
Please stop, Zha.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,580
I'm begging you, Zha.

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,260
Please stop hitting me.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:25,940
I swear next time I'll...

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,060
Just stop hitting me!

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,900
Damn you!

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:29,940
Damn!

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,500
To hell with you!

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,700
Screw you!

15
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,500
I...

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,340
I...

17
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,820
Damn you to hell!

18
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,380
Four-eyes.

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,540
You took the money

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,660
and wasted my time.

21
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,020
Didn't you brag about winning

22
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,060
some gold medal during the interview?

23
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,860
And this is all you've got?

24
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,940
Zha.

25
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,460
I... I didn't know

26
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,700
what you wanted was this difficult.

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,420
Just give me some time.

28
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,060
I'll work harder.

29
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,380
I'll make it happen.

30
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,820
Zha, I've got an idea!

31
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,820
Han Xiaoxiao!

32
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,780
She can do it.

33
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,700
Zha,

34
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,620
Han Xiaoxiao.

35
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,300
I... won that award all thanks to her.

36
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,980
She's the best developer in our school.

37
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,180
Trust me, she'll...

38
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,220
She'll definitely

39
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,580
build the AI software you want.

40
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,580
Zha, please stop hitting me.

41
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,500
I... I'll find a way

42
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,820
to bring her to you.

43
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,820
I'll help you.

44
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,020
Chuan,

45
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,020
you can't be late

46
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,300
for my graduation ceremony.

47
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,860
I've got

48
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,140
a big surprise for you.

49
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,540
Bailing?

50
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,620
Where have you been these days?

51
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,980
You weren't answering my calls.

52
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,580
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

53
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,900
I just lost my phone

54
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,820
while working a part-time job.

55
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,900
I just found it.

56
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,500
Wait.

57
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,660
How did you get these injuries?

58
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,580
Did someone bully you?

59
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,940
No one could possibly bully me.

60
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,900
I just fell off my e-bike

61
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,620
the other day.

62
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,260
It's nothing.

63
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,740
I should call the teacher
and let them know you're okay.

64
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,300
No!

65
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,700
I'll talk to the teacher
myself tomorrow.

66
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,140
Don't worry.

67
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,420
I brought you a first-aid kit.

68
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,900
Do you need help cleaning the wounds?

69
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,780
It's fine.

70
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,460
Just scratches.

71
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,220
I'll take care of them.

72
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,660
Thanks, Xiaoxiao.

73
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,380

Eighty.

79
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,900
One hundred plus 60.

[Hope Chuan stays safe on every mission]

81
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,740
This jade pendant is so expensive.

82
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,500
Still so much left to save.

83
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,380
Han Xiaoxiao! She can do it!

84
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,420
You can't escape.

85
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,260
I'll have someone watch you

86
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,420
and your family.

87
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,740
You're awake.

88
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,220
Come eat something.

89
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,260
Okay.

[Hai]

91
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,460
So, genius, have you
made up your mind yet?

92
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,740
Speak up!

93
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,620
You useless piece of shit!

94
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,900
Zha,

95
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,500
if we don't make progress
on the AI program soon,

96
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,180
Fo won't be happy.

97
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,820
So this great job you promised

98
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,220
was scamming people?

99
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,540
I trusted you so much.

100
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,660
Girl,

101
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,020
how many times do I have to tell you?

102
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,660
We invited you here

103
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,380
to develop AI software.

104
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,300
Not to run scams.

105
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,860
In your dreams.

106
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,300
You've had two days.

107
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,900
Still this stubborn?

108
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,780
Take her to the graveyard
and bury her alive.

109
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,500
As for this one,

110
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,500
she's back on the electric chair.

111
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,580
Zha, Zha!

112
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,500
She's new.

113
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
She doesn't know the rules.

114
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,860
Let me talk to her.

115
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,060
Besides, Zha,

116
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,860
you promised me.

117
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,340
You can't go back on your word.

118
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,220
You don't get to speak here!

119
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,500
Bastard. Trying to run?

120
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,180
Bury her.

121
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,820
Let me go! Let go!

122
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,020
Take him away.

123
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,700
One Bamboo.

124
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,940
This compound's got too many chicks.

125
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,140
I heard two years ago,

126
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,540
Fo killed the boss's whole family

127
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,860
and took over.

128
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,380
Let me tell you,

129
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,660
actually,

130
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,140
not everyone was wiped out.

131
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,060
The boss had an illegitimate son
who got away.

132
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,300
Can't play well,

133
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,740
but love to flap your mouths, huh?

134
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,460
Gossiping about Fo?

135
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,500
What,

136
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,220
you two wanna end up
like that college girl,

137
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,420
buried in the back hills?

138
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,660
I'll dig your graves myself.

139
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,620
Rui, my bad.

140
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
Let's just play.

141
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,140
Xiong,

142
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,300
that college girl really got buried?

143
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,340
Yeah.

144
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,780
But she's not dead.

145
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,740
Where is she?

146
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,300
Always sticking your nose in, huh?

147
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,940
Nobody move!

148
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,220
What are you doing?

149
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,740
Listen up,

150
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,580
you were assigned here,

151
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,060
so you'd better learn who's in charge.

152
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,340
Starting tomorrow, you're working
in the cafeteria.

153
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,420
Step out of line, and I'll chop you up.

154
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:47,940
Understood?

155
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,260
What's your name?

156
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,700
Do you even need to think?

157
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,900
Shisan.

158
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,900
The boys in the underworld
show me respect

159
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,420
and call me Mr. Shisan.

160
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,180
You're more like a scumbag.

161
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,020
Scumbag.

162
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,460
Shisan.

163
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,220
Peel the potatoes.

164
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,740
Hurry up.

165
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,380
Beat him!

166
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,140
Stop hitting me!

167
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,700
Go check outside.

168
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,620
You're disobeying me?

169
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,860
Stop!

170
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,620
- Wait.
- Beat him!

171
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,860
Hold on. Wait.

172
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,980
Beat him harder!

173
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,620
Move!

174
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,220
Beat him!

175
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,580
- Stop!
- Beat him!

176
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,140
Disobedient, huh?

177
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,340
I'll beat you up!

178
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,220
Beat him!

179
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,740
Make it hurt!

180
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,060
Harder!

181
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,820
Beat him!

182
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,020
I'll beat you up!

183
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,500
Beat him harder!

184
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,260
Harder!

185
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,980
Beat him harder!

186
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,580
Hey, it's you.

187
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,500
What are you doing here?

188
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,140
The day after we parted ways,

189
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,100
I tried buying a boat ticket home.

190
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,340
But they grabbed me

191
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,060
at the dock and sold me here.

192
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,780
How did you end up here too?

193
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,500
I lost my passport

194
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,220
and my money.

195
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,420
I wanted to take a side gig.

196
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,620
Then I got trafficked in.

197
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,380
I'm so sorry.

198
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,740
This is my fault.

199
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,340
Sir. Mr. Shisan.

200
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,740
You win.

201
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,020
Shisan,

202
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,100
I owe you twice now.

203
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,660
My name's Sang Tuo.

204
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,420
Just say the word.

205
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,180
What word?

206
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,260
Nonsense.

207
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,300
Shisan.

208
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,060
Are you...

209
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,140
Are you all blind?

210
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,820
How dare you make Shisan peel potatoes?

211
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,900
Come on.

212
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,900
- Shisan.
- Shisan.

213
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,500
Get up.

214
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,940
Come on, Shisan.

215
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,140
These boys don't know respect.

216
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,380
If you need anything,

217
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,100
just let me know. I can help.

218
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,140
Come on.

219
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,900
Let me handle this.

220
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,700
Please have a seat.

221
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,300
Are the only girls around here

222
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,260
just these ones eating in the cafeteria?

223
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,860
Shisan,

224
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,140
I didn't see that coming.

225
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,420
You look all serious,

226
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,460
but you've got fire inside.

227
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,220
Rui, you know how men are.

228
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,260
Tell me.

229
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,580
This whole compound's covered
in cameras.

230
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,300
The girls are all on the sixth floor.

231
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,700
You wanna go up there?

232
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,980
Not easy.

233
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:52,900
Sixth floor?

234
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,940
Why is it hard?

235
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,340
To go up there, you gotta hit quotas.

236
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,820
Hit five million...

237
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,220
No, thanks.

238
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,220
and you get the A card.

239
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,260
Then you have access to the sixth floor.

240
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,540
Massages, karaoke,

241
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,620
and girls on demand.

242
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,060
Hit twenty million,

243
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,420
and you get the S card.

244
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,780
Not just the sixth floor,

245
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,620
you'll unlock the elevator
to the penthouse parties.

246
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,420
Next-level fun.

247
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,540
Too bad

248
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,820
the work here

249
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,340
is all grunt labor.

250
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,860
No quotas here.

251
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,140
So the only way up

252
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,460
is by hitting quotas?

253
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,980
Yeah. This isn't a charity.

254
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,700
What about the elevator?

255
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,740
Can't you get up there by elevator?

256
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,940
There are security guards
on duty in the elevator.

257
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,820
They carry guns 24/7.

258
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,380
Step off on the wrong floor,

259
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
and they'll shoot you on the spot.

260
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,580
Yeah.

261
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,340
You can always take care of urges

262
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,780
and get girls.

263
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,140
But you can't risk your life for it.

264
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,020
Exactly.

265
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,140
Then why are there so few girls

266
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,260
coming down to eat?

267
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,500
Different situations.

268
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,100
Some are locked up.

269
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,940
Some are being tortured.

270
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,620
Bottoms up.

271
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,660
Xiaoxiao must be on the sixth floor.

272
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,340
I'm getting up there tonight.

273
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,340
Five of Characters.

274
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,500
Hurry up.

275
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,340
Just two rounds.

276
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,220
I've got guard duty.

277
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,180
What's the rush?

278
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,340
Eight of Dots.

279
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,380
Two of Dots.

280
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:24,940
North Wind.

281
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,020
Draw a tile.

282
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,220
Two of Bamboos.

283
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,540
Play your tile.

284
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,460
Rui, just wait.

285
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,740
I'm gonna win it off you.

286
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,540
I win.

287
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,620
Waiting on Two or Five of Characters.

288
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,180
What a game.

289
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,820
Unbelievable.

290
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,660
Xiong, sorry.

291
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,060
Lost again.

292
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,020
Another round. Luck's gotta turn.

293
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,940
Come on, pay up.

294
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,460
- Xiong.
- Xiong, you're not having a good day.

295
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,100
Again.

296
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,740
This hand's mine.

297
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,540
Let's do it!

298
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,940
Arrange the tiles.

299
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,060
Xiong's luck's rotten today.

300
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,620
The worst.

301
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,460
