[Episode 4]

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,380
Rui.

4
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:35,980
Shisan,

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,620
I've been avoiding.

6
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,500
But you...

7
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,660
I know what you're gonna say.

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,420
Let me make one thing clear.

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,100
Around here, you've gotta
watch your back every second.

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,740
I was drunk last night.

11
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,780
I didn't hear

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,740
or see a thing.

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,020
Tell you what.

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,820
Come help me serve.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,420
I'll show you some
of the compound's higher-ups.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,340
So you won't step on the wrong toes.

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,020
What is he doing here?

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:14,980
Shisan,

19
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,340
see that guy?

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,740
That's Zha's lapdog.

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,860
Acts all meek around her,

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,380
but struts like a king here.

23
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,060
Luckily, we don't cross paths.

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,100
Just stay away from him.

25
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,940
Fresh out of the wok. Try some.

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,380
Enjoy, everyone.

27
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:37,980
Shisan,

28
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,500
check out the guy with the mustache.

29
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,940
That's Black Dong,
the leader of the nude chat group.

30
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,260
A total snake.

31
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,700
He has no respect for people.

32
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,020
They had the worst performance
this month.

33
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,820
He's always fighting with Ba Sihai.

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,860
He has a terrible temper.

35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,060
Stay away from him.

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,500
Dong,

37
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,260
your favorite,
Duck Blood in Chili Sauce.

38
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,340
Right here for you.

39
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,100
Here.

40
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,900
Who's that guy?

41
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,380
He's new. Assigned to me.

42
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,700
Show him the ropes.

43
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,460
Enjoy.

44
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,380
Let's eat.

45
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,420
What about Ba Sihai?

46
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,580
Not much of a threat.

47
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,300
He may be ruthless,

48
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,420
but he's dumb as a brick.

49
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,940
Honestly,

50
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,740
the cafeteria's not bad.

51
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,340
Sure, the work is heavy

52
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,060
and the pay is low.

53
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,700
But once you go up to the second floor

54
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,500
to run scams,

55
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,380
it's all over.

56
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,900
If you don't meet the quotas,

57
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,580
you'll be sold or retailed.

58
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,940
Retailed?

59
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,500
These tables are full of them.

60
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,900
People who had their corneas taken,

61
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,860
their kidneys, their bone marrow.

62
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,420
And those missing limbs.

63
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,540
How pitiful.

64
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,500
There you go.

65
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,540
Over here. Here.

66
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,560
[Where there's a will, there's a way]

67
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,780
Hai. Have you eaten?

68
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,500
Busy today?

69
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,740
Let me cook you something.

70
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,540
Not hungry.

71
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,860
Hai, just getting dinner now?

72
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,500
Get Hai some food.

73
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,100
Don't bother.

74
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,100
What are you doing?

75
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,100
Back off!

76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,220
None of your business.

77
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,300
Hai.

78
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:29,820
Hai.

79
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,860
He's the cop I mentioned.

80
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,740
Must be a misunderstanding, Hai.

81
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,060
You heard my call.

82
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,460
I was just a security guard.

83
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,500
No way I'm a cop.

84
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,660
Misunderstanding?

85
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,900
Think I'm stupid?

86
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,260
You called yourself a cop before.

87
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,380
No, Hai, that was just a joke.

88
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,180
Take him to see Fo.

89
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,420
Who dares to touch him?

90
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,300
- Hai.
- Hai!

91
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:56,900
Hai!

92
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,820
I was a security guard.

93
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,780
But we're in the same line of work.

94
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,980
Same line of work?

95
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,860
Tell me.

96
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,060
Let's hear it.

97
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,220
Fine, I'll lay it out.

98
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,460
I worked under Hawk back in the day.

99
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,780
My name's Shisan.

100
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,340
The boys in the underworld
show me respect

101
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,820
and call me Mr. Shisan.

102
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,620
Hawk, originally named Xie Yingwang,

103
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,260
goes by the alias "Hawk".

104
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,300
Ten years ago, I started under him.

105
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,260
Go on.

106
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,420
What have you done?

107
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,340
In 2017,

108
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,700
the CEO of Caiwang Group
was scammed out of 40 million.

109
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,620
- In 2020...
- In 2020,

110
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,580
a pharmaceutical fraud scheme
totaling 100 million.

111
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,860
In 2022,

112
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,780
a celebrity couple
was scammed out of seven million.

113
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,220
You've heard of these cases, right?

114
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,620
They were all my work.

115
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,820
They must be case studies
for all of you.

116
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,500
Hai, I think his stories check out.

117
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:05,820
Back off.

118
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,460
Worked under Hawk, huh?

119
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,620
Then you must know Sui Jian?

120
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,540
Ah, Sui Jian.

121
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,460
We all called him Er.

122
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,420
He handled stock investments.

123
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,220
And I specialized in posing as officials
from public security organs.

124
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,460
Young lady,

125
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,700
did I ever scam you
by pretending to be a cop?

126
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,340
You've got me all wrong.

127
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,140
I...

128
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,180
Hai.

129
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:46,940
No.

130
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,660
Then what's with the security guard act?

131
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,220
Hai,

132
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,820
it was to avoid the cops.

133
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,220
Back in April two years ago,

134
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,180
Hawk went to Fujian

135
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,900
to discuss money laundering operations
with Ren Qinghua.

136
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,260
But he didn't expect

137
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,900
Ren Qinghua had already been
on the cops' radar.

138
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,340
I got tipped off early.

139
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,140
Faked a new identity and ran.

140
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,220
Thought I'd lay low in Dongbang.

141
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,860
Then you brought me here.

142
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,260
Hai,

143
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,340
the details check out.

144
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,660
Hawk only kept ruthless ones
around him.

145
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,460
If he really is Shisan,

146
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,340
then we're...

147
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,340
Back off.

148
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,060
So you're Shisan, huh?

149
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,140
I heard the name in the circles.

150
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,980
But that guy's cunning.

151
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,300
Few have actually seen him.

152
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,180
Clever.

153
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,900
Using someone like that for cover.

154
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,420
True. Not many have met me.

155
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,500
But everything I said is true.

156
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,060
Verify it yourself.

157
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,660
Hai,

158
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,580
I heard Four-eyes was working

159
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,340
under Hawk and Shisan back home.

160
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,660
Get Four-eyes here.

161
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,300
Let him identify the guy.

162
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,740
Yes.

163
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,020
What's so important

164
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,540
that you have to drag me down here?

165
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,620
Make it quick.

166
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,780
I'm busy.

167
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,140
What's the matter, Four-eyes?

168
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,420
Now that you're working under Zha,

169
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,060
I can't even call you over anymore, huh?

170
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,260
That's not what I meant, Hai.

171
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,940
I'm just worried Zha might find out,

172
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,340
and I'd have a hard time explaining.

173
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,540
Cut the crap.

174
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,180
Let me ask you,

175
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,220
when you were back home,

176
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,900
did you work under Hawk?

177
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,300
Of course.

178
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,340
I was a core member,
the backbone of the operation.

179
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,500
Otherwise, Zha

180
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,340
wouldn't have paid top dollar
to bring me here.

181
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,540
So you're saying

182
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,300
you've met

183
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,580
Hawk, Sui Jian,

184
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,140
and Shisan, right?

185
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,740
We were close. Like brothers.

186
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,500
The four of us used to drink together
all the time.

187
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,700
Then take a look.

188
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,300
Do you

189
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,260
recognize this guy?

190
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,900
Suddenly asking me about Hawk

191
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,700
and making me identify someone?

192
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,420
Heard Hawk and Sui Jian got arrested.

193
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,700
So this guy is...

194
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,860
Shisan?

195
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,220
Long time no see, Shisan.

196
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,340
Shisan's confession

197
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,380
never mentioned this Four-eyes guy.

198
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,100
But when he saw me,

199
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,380
he froze for a second,

200
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,900
then pretended to be all friendly

201
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,980
and straight-up called me Shisan.

202
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,900
So this kid was bluffing earlier.

203
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,700
He definitely doesn't know Shisan.

204
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,660
Who are you?

205
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,660
Shisan, it's me.

206
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,900
I'm Four-eyes.

207
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,780
My boss was Fat Cat.

208
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,420
And Fat Cat answered to Ergou.

209
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Do you know Ergou?

210
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,260
He's been working under me.

211
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,180
He had a guy named Fat Cat under him.

212
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,380
As for those below them, I don't know.

213
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,620
So you're one of Ergou's guys?

214
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,780
I don't know the lower ranks.

215
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,740
Sorry.

216
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,180
No problem, Shisan.

217
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,220
Just honored
to finally meet you in person.

218
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,140
I'm new here.

219
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,060
Hope you'll look out for me.

220
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,700
Wouldn't dare.

221
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,780
Just say the word if you need anything.

222
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,660
Weren't you

223
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,300
some core member?

224
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,820
Weren't you supposed to know Shisan?

225
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,060
Why didn't he recognize you?

226
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,020
I was a core member

227
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,260
under Fat Cat.

228
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
Besides,

229
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,460
Shisan's a big shot.

230
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,700
It's totally normal for me to know him

231
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,500
but not the other way around.

232
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,940
And

233
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,500
Fat Cat talked about Shisan
all the time.

234
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,380
And it was like we were already close.

235
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,340
Hai.

236
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,340
Please.

237
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,220
Don't let Zha find out about this.

238
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,500
Enough.

239
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,220
Get lost.

240
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,140
Uh, Shisan,

241
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,220
I'll head back upstairs now.

242
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,580
Just say the word if you need anything.

243
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,060
Hai.

244
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,180
Take good care of Shisan for me.

245
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,460
Hai,

246
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,420
I swear I saw him in a police uniform...

247
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:25,900
Shut up!

248
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,020
Shisan, huh?

249
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,500
I'd like to talk to you alone.

250
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,460
Let's go.

251
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,940
Mr. Han, please get me out of here.

252
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,060
Do you have a way?

253
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Please.

254
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,860
I can't take it anymore.

255
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,700
I really can't take it anymore.

256
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,380
From what I've seen,

257
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,740
the fastest way out is

258
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,340
through Ba Sihai's
human trafficking boats.

259
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,100
But I need you to help me find Xiaoxiao.

260
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,380
Will you?

261
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,740
Yes.

262
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,900
No problem.

263
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,980
Do you... Do you have a plan?

264
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,300
I need to join Ba Sihai's team

265
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,100
and earn his trust.

266
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,300
Only then can I get you out.

267
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,020
Who's your current team leader?

268
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,020
Rui from the cafeteria.

269
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,460
Rui?

270
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:36,780
So...

271
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,660
You're stuck in the cafeteria.

272
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,260
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to move up to the second floor?

273
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,780
That's why I need your help.

274
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,620
How can I help?

275
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,020
Calm down.

276
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,740
Stay calm.

277
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,020
Tell Ba Sihai I'm a cop.

278
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,980
Shisan.

279
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,220
The first time I saw you,

280
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,660
I knew you were different.

281
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,220
You've got guts, man.

282
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:28,980
Not bad.

283
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,260
Seriously.

284
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,900
I mean,

285
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,140
it is the first time I've heard someone

286
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,980
dare to claim they're a cop.

287
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,420
Shisan,

288
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,100
with your courage and track record,

289
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,620
staying in the kitchen

290
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,340
is a waste of talent.

291
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,300
Hai,

292
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,140
I'm fine here.

293
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,100
Washing dishes and cooking every day

294
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,060
is pretty comfortable. No quotas to hit.

295
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,260
But you won't make money.

296
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,780
I don't care about money.

297
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,460
As long as I can hide from the cops,

298
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,540
anywhere's the same.

299
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,140
If that's the case,

300
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,660
then join me.

301
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,380
I'll double

302
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,780
your cut and quotas.

303
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,420
Thirty percent.

304
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,580
Deal?

305
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,820
Hai, I appreciate the offer.

306
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,020
Shisan.

307
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,700
Think about your glorious days.

308
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,580
You really want

309
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,340
to serve people here?

310
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,780
Don't you want a comeback?

311
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,460
I am

312
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,100
putting the meat
right in front of your mouth.

313
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,300
Whether you bite is up to you.

314
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,100
Let me warn you about one more thing.

315
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,340
If you're with me,

316
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,060
you're my friend.

317
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,620
Anyone else

318
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,180
is my enemy.

319
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,220
Think it over.

320
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,860
I have a condition.

321
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:24,820
Speak.

322
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
I want access to the sixth floor.

323
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,500
We're both men.

324
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,940
I get it.

325
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,780
You want women, right?

326
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,780
But if you want perks,

327
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,420
you gotta deliver results.

328
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,220
Company rules.

329
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,460
Report to me

330
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,340
on the second floor tomorrow.
