Stubborn as a mule.

191
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,700
Sihai,

192
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,020
I'm bringing the boys here

193
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,300
to learn from Shisan.

194
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,980
Do you mind?

195
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,020
I might miss the show

196
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,460
if I come any time later.

197
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,020
Why are you so mean?

198
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,580
Can't you say something nice?

199
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,940
Take notes.

200
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,020
Watch and learn.

201
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,260
Learn well.

202
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,260
Mr. Wang,

203
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,140
let's have a video chat.

204
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,540
You'll know I'm not
a scammer when you see me.

205
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,140
Oh, it's real.

206
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,700
I'm so sorry.

207
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,500
My apologies.

208
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,380
I swear I didn't mean it.

209
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,820
I've got too many scam calls lately.

210
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,300
My apologies.

211
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,260
Let me confirm your info again.

212
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,860
Wang Jincheng,

213
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,660
legal rep and chairman

214
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,820
of Jianghai Jincheng New Energy Group,
right?

215
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,700
Yes.

216
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,220
According to the tax system,

217
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,820
your company's involved
in tax evasion or avoidance.

218
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,940
You need to pledge assets

219
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,340
and let the Tax Bureau
audit your bank flows.

220
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,740
Alright.

221
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,020
[Hesitate]

222
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,220
It feels like…

223
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,180
No.

224
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,300
That can't be right.

225
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,180
I always pay tax strictly by the book.

226
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,180
Every time.

227
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,740
Have you ever tried to reduce tax?

228
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,860
[Yes.]

229
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,060
Well...

230
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,820
That was legal at the time.

231
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,100
What used to be legal
isn't necessarily legal now.

232
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,700
Wang Jincheng,

233
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,420
you've got a sister, right?

234
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,740
S-sister?

235
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,420
It doesn't say anything
about a sister here.

236
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,460
Which sister are you talking about?

237
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,220
You know exactly which one.

238
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,060
You used her company as cover

239
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,420
[Xiaoxiao]
to evade taxes.

240
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,220
Do you think we can't trace it?

241
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,440
[Admits it.]

242
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,740
Officer, I was wrong.

243
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,580
I got greedy.

244
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,580
Wang Jincheng,

245
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,660
listen up.

246
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,820
What I say next is critical.

247
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,300
The state is cracking
down hard on tax evasion.

248
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,500
Penalties are severe.

249
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,700
Han Chuan's in danger in that place.

250
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,060
[He's at risk.]
You must pay all dues by 6 p.m.

251
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,540
Otherwise,

252
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,860
not just you,

253
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,020
we'll go after your sister, too.

254
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,060
If the money isn't in by six,

255
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,260
both he and Xiaoxiao are in danger.

256
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,420
[Six o'clock. Xiaoxiao.]

257
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,140
But

258
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,260
as long as you stop doing it again,

259
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,260
the government
won't make it hard for you.

260
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,780
[After this challenge...]
Getting past this,

261
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,340
Han Chuan and Xiaoxiao
will be safe for now.

262
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,260
My superiors have made it clear

263
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,340
that once the penalties are received,

264
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,500
you don't need to worry
about anything else.

265
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,540
We'll take care

266
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,140
of the rest of the procedure for you.

267
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,740
You'll be fine.

268
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,260
[Intercept laundering]
Han needs the funds in,

269
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,940
so we can intercept
during money laundering.

270
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,260
Got it?

271
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,180
Got it. I got it.

272
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,860
Officer,

273
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,260
how much do I need to pay?

274
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,060
Twenty million.

275
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,700
[Billionaire Wang Jincheng.
Work with me. Target amount ?]

276
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,060
Twenty million!

277
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,980
[Agreed]

278
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,860
Twenty million.

279
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,640
[Calling…]

280
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,160
[Call declined]

281
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,460
That's it?

282
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,020
You scared him off.

283
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,180
Trying to get twenty million
out of one guy.

284
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,660
How dare you!

285
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,900
No one here could pull this off

286
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,460
but you, huh?

287
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,580
Now look at you.

288
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,460
Look at you!

289
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,980
Keep your mouth shut, will you?

290
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,500
Your failure isn't his.

291
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,700
My failure?

292
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,700
That's fine.

293
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,860
Shisan,

294
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,420
if you can't do it,

295
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,380
people will die.

296
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,860
Two people.

297
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,500
Two.

298
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,460
Let's go.

299
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,420
You lot.

300
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,740
Nothing good ever comes
out of his mouth.

301
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,620
Shisan,

302
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,780
don't let him get to you.

303
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,620
We've got time.

304
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,540
Wait it out.

305
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,020
Mr. Wang, listen.

306
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,220
I really can't do this.

307
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,020
Pack up. Please leave now.

308
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,580
I'm telling you,

309
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,820
Officer,

310
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,380
sorry, I can't help you.

311
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,540
Find someone else.

312
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,780
Mr. Wang, please.

313
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,700
We'll do everything we can

314
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,740
to keep your funds safe.

315
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,140
This is about my colleague's life.

316
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,460
But you didn't say twenty million!

317
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,580
Mr. An, it's not that I won't help.

318
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,020
If Mr. Han said

319
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,780
two or three hundred thousand,

320
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,220
even two million,

321
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,300
I'd say yes,
not without hesitation though.

322
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
It's a rescue, right?

323
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,180
But he said twenty million!

324
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,140
I'm rich,

325
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,100
but money doesn't grow on trees.

326
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,780
Do you know my annual profit?

327
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,740
Mr. Wang.

328
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,660
Mr. An,

329
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,460
sorry for being honest.

330
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,300
Mr. Han is your buddy.

331
00:14:59,460 --> 00:14:59,900
But

332
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,820
I don't know him.

333
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,260
We're not relatives or friends.

334
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,180
Why should I risk it?

335
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,340
Honestly, why should I?

336
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,100
You guys,

337
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,980
find someone else.

338
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,340
Please leave now.

339
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,540
Sorry, Officers.

340
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,660
Pack your things.

341
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,700
Go, go, go.

342
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,500
Please leave.

343
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,500
Sorry about that.

344
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,100
Please leave.
