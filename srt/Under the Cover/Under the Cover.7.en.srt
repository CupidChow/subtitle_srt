What are you doing?

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,060
It's just the trick
of verification codes.

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,540
I thought it was something impressive.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,980

Xiaoxiao, I'm sorry.

168
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,980
I didn't mean it. They made me do it.

169
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,700
If I didn't obey,

170
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,780

00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,540
If so, I'll keep them for myself.

195
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,180
Get out, all of you.

196
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,460
Hey.

197
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,540
Come on, Shisan,

198
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,460
what kind of girls do you like?

199
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,540
Anything particular?

200
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,180
I got it.

201
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,260
You'll be satisfied with the next batch.

202
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,060
Bao.

203
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,380
Hai.

204
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,100
Ask the technical team to come.

205
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,540
Alright.

206
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,500
According to Xiaoxiao's classmate,

207
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,460
Xiaoxiao should be
in the technical group.

208
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,620
Bro, you did hide it well.

209
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,460
Hai.

210
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,980
What does the technical group do?

211
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,300
Well, the technical team

212
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,940
is in charge of technology.

213
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,340
You'll know when they come.

214
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,060
Alright.

215
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,980
Hai, take me with you
for the work at the dock.

216
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,220
I have much strength.

217
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,700
Come on!

218
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,660
Let them in.

219
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,260
Hello, Hai.

220
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,780
Greet Shisan.

221
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,340
- Hello, Shisan.
- Hello, Shisan.

222
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:32,900
Wait, Hai.

223
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,900
So this is the technical team?

224
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,500
They have good techniques.

225
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,700
Well, I heard.

226
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,660
I've never tried this.

227
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,660
Wait, Hai, that's not it.

228
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,660
I didn't mean that.

229
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,780
Shisan, well...

230
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,460
Listen to me.

231
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,620
Normally,

232
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,020
when you make a contribution,

233
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,340
I should celebrate it with you.

234
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,180
But this...

235
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,100
I can't stand this.

236
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,020
Hai, that's not what I mean.

237
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,820
It's okay, Shisan.

238
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,020
Listen to me...

239
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,700
Well, it's on me today.

240
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,060
Just play as you like!

241
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,340
Well, come near!

242
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:57,940
Serve him.

243
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,900
- Serve him well.
- I don't mean this, Hai!

244
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,540
- Hai.
- Hai.

245
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,940
- Shisan.
- Hai.

246
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,140
Come on, Shisan.

247
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,700
Come on.

248
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,820
Wait, man...

249
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,180
I wonder how Shisan is enjoying himself

250
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,660
upstairs now.

251
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,620
I didn't expect

252
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,340
that Shisan could be so impressive.

253
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,260
He defeated Black Dong as soon as
he ascended to the second floor.

254
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,060
And he made a good reputation
in front of Fo.

255
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,220
This is really...

256
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,900
Do you think this is a good thing?

257
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,700
He's only a newcomer
and he's got into the limelight,

258
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,460
and he offended Black Dong this time.

259
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,500
So what?

260
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,500
Black Dong is not the only one
on the second floor.

261
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,500
There's no need to be afraid.

262
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,420
Trio with a pair.

263
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,020
Kong.

264
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,220
You know nothing.

265
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,740
You haven't been here for long.

266
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:37,820
I'm telling you.

267
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,420
Ba Sihai may seem domineering,

268
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,540
but he's no rival to Black Dong.

269
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,060
Black Dong is scheming.

270
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,220
Once he's annoyed,

271
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,540
he'll resort to

272
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,420
any dirty and evil tricks.

273
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,100
So we have to help Shisan even more.

274
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,300
You didn't go up last time I called you.

275
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,620
Did it make a difference with you there?

276
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,660
Ba Sihai still used Shisan as a pawn.

277
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,580
Could you stop it?

278
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,260
Take my warning.

279
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,420
The two group leaders
on the second floor,

280
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,420
one is ruthless
and the other is scheming.

281
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,420
Offend any of them?

282
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,860
They will make you suffer.

283
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,660
We must keep an eye on them for Shisan.

284
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,260
And I think

285
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,620
Black Dong

286
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,340
won't let this go easily.

287
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,220
I'm sorry.

288
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,860
Sorry, guys.

289
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,140
No...

290
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,420
Don't move. Bouncers.

291
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,780
I have something to tell you.

292
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,020
Long story short.

293
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,860
I found Xiaoxiao.

294
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,260
Chuan,

295
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,020
when you go on a mission,

296
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,180
you should be careful.

297
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,340
Don't be so impulsive.

298
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,060
Safety first.

299
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,380
And

300
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,180
please change your bad temper.

301
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,860
You've got so many complaints.

302
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,780
Got it.

303
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,300
You become naggier as you grow up.

304
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,340
What?

305
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,140
Do you like it?

306
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,220
It's okay.

307
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,420
Listen.

308
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,540
When you arrive in Dongbang,

309
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,780
you must mind your safety.

310
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,620
It's not a peaceful place as here.

311
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,020
Don't go out at night.

312
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,020
Got it?

313
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,740
Yes, sir!

314
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,220
Got it.

315
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,100
Where is she?

316
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,340
How is she?

317
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,300
Calm down.

318
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,220
She is developing the AI software

319
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,260
in the technical department

320
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,900
under close watch.

321
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,900
It took me a long time

322
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,620
to find her.

323
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,340
But don't worry.

324
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,780
She is currently safe.

325
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,180
Technical department...

326
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,540
She is not on the sixth floor?

327
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,260
No.

328
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,300
Tie Fo attaches great importance
to the this department.

329
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,900
He arranged them
all on the seventh floor.

330
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,660
Their offices, canteen, and dorms

331
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,940
are all over there.

332
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,180
How's it going on your side?

333
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,700
I heard you defeated Black Dong.

334
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,860
I've basically earned Ba Sihai's trust.

335
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,220
But it still takes time for me

336
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,420
to go to the dock with him.

337
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,740
You should pace up.

338
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,740
I don't know

339
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,220
how much longer Xiaoxiao and I can last.

340
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,700
I have to go,

341
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,780
in case they catch me
staying out for too long.

342
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,460
If there are any updates,

343
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,780
I'll go to you.

344
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,660
Are you on the sixth floor now?

345
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,420
Don't go any further.

346
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,060
Up ahead are the dorms of the hostesses.

347
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,300
There are bouncers guarding.

348
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,740
What's your name?

349
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,740
