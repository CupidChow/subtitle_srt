[Episode 3]

3
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:12,940
What are you doing?

4
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,500
Falling asleep again?

5
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,740
No, I'm not.

6
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,900
Stay sharp.

7
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:17,860
Got it.

8
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,500
Let me go!

9
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,260
Please, let me go.

10
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,820
Stop hitting me.

11
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,260
I was wrong.

12
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,060
Don't... Don't hurt me.

13
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,100
I won't do it again.

14
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,780
Please, just let me go.

15
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,140
You're Xiaoxiao's roommate, right?

16
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,580
Where is she?

17
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,340
You're her brother?

18
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,500
I've seen your photos. You're a cop.

19
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,940
The police are here already?

20
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,780
Hang in there.

21
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,620
I'll get you out of here.

22
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,980
But... Wait.

23
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,700
Even if...

24
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,460
Even if you untie me now, it's useless

25
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,780
if we can't get off the island.

26
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,660
If they find out,

27
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,980
they'll kill me.

28
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,020
Where's Xiaoxiao?

29
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,060
Take her to the graveyard
and bury her alive.

30
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,460
I don't know where she is.

31
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,540
We were separated

32
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,100
after we got caught.

33
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,180
What have they made you do

34
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,580
since you got here?

35
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,300
They forced us to work on scam software.

36
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,380
If we disobeyed,

37
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,620
they'd beat us.

38
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,900
Just stay safe.

39
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,220
Once I find Xiaoxiao,

40
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,140
I'll get you both out.

41
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,780
But this place is heavily guarded.

42
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,660
How can you get us out alone?

43
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,540
Hide now.

44
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,540
These idiots didn't even lock the door.

45
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,540
Hai.

46
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,020
What... What are you doing here?

47
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,260
I told them to take care of you.

48
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,420
Is this how they do it?

49
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,180
Well, look at this.

50
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,820
How is this taking care of you?

51
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,780
That wretch Ne Zha

52
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,860
has no idea how to be gentle
with a beauty.

53
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,940
Does it hurt?

54
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,140
Hai,

55
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,700
can you talk to Zha

56
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,260
and ask her to let me go?

57
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,340
Don't even mention that wretch to me!

58
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,220
I brought her here.

59
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,020
But ever since she hooked up with Fo,

60
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,060
she doesn't even respect me anymore.

61
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,380
But don't worry.

62
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,540
Once you're mine,

63
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,820
I'll get you out.

64
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,060
Hai!

65
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,700
I...

66
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,420
What?

67
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,300
Haven't you had enough here?

68
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,220
Hai,

69
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,900
I'm... I'm just worried
the security guards might see you.

70
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,420
It'd be hard for you to explain.

71
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,100
Relax.

72
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,180
They're all slacking off outside.

73
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,300
Pleasure me today,

74
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,460
and I'll make sure you're
taken care of every day after.

75
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,220
Hai!

76
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,620
Who's there?

77
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:23,940
Hai!

78
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,420
One of the security guards ran out!

79
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,540
That wretch Ne Zha

80
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,500
must've sent someone to watch me.

81
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,380
She's trying to dig up dirt on me.

82
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,220
Don't be scared.

83
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,740
I'll get you out another day.

84
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,500
Wait for me.

85
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,300
Xiong.

86
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:09,980
Xiong.

87
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,260
Watch this.

88
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,660
This is the last drink for us.

89
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,700
Let me top you up.

90
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,940
I can't drink anymore, Rui.

91
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,140
I... I still...

92
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,500
I still have my shift.

93
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,900
Easy, easy.

94
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,620
I gotta go on duty.

95
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,420
You're done drinking?

96
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,980
Hey, easy does it.

97
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,860
Where's my jacket?

98
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,660
Your jacket...

99
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,900
It's...

100
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,740
Did you see my jacket?

101
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,980
I'm asking you, where's my jacket?

102
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,860
I said, did you see my jacket?

103
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,580
Xiong,

104
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,380
I think I saw your jacket on the bed.

105
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,820
Let's go check.

106
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,380
Yeah, I think I remember
seeing it there too.

107
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:05,980
Right?

108
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,740
- Yeah.
- I think so.

109
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,900
Here it is. See?

110
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,420
Yeah. I couldn't find it earlier.

111
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,620
Because you're drunk.

112
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,540
Let's go.

113
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,620
Wait.

114
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,300
Thanks.

115
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,460
No problem.

116
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,820
Take it easy.

117
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,020
Rui.

118
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,900
Who's calling me?

119
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,780
I'm seeing double. Too drunk.

120
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,420
I need to sleep.

121
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,780
Gotta work tomorrow. I'm going to bed.

122
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,260
