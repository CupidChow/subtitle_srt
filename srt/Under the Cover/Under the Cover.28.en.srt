00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,500
Alright.

192
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,780
Mr. Wu, Mr. An,

193
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,260
Zheng Jiahe has taken hostages
at the Yuncheng Road Community Center.

194
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,300
He's demanding to see Han Chuan.

195
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,340
And...

196
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,220
He's wired with explosives.

197
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,660
- My child!
- Stay calm!

198
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,180
- Calm down!
- Step back!

199
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,540
- Move back!
- Stay calm!

200
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,700
Stay back!

201
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,500
Please step back, thank you!

202
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,780
Calm down!

203
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,780
- Please stay calm.
- Get back!

204
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,860
Move back! Back!

205
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:26,820
Don't move!

206
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,620
Where's Han Chuan?

207
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,380
I want Han Chuan!

208
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,420
Get Han Chuan here!

209
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,380
I want him here!

210
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,860
Make way, please.

211
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,980
Step aside. Make way, people.

212
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,860
Don't move!

213
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,460
Zheng Jiahe, calm down!

214
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,940
Tell us what you want.

215
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,620
We can work something out.

216
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,180
Don't act rashly!

217
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:54,740
Him!

218
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,100
He killed my wife

219
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,140
and took my money.

220
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,540
I want him dead!

221
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,380
Fine!

222
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,340
Let the hostages go!

223
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,300
I'll stay with you!

224
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,020
Han Chuan!

225
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,580
Don't move.

226
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,820
Han Chuan!

227
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,540
Don't move!

228
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,780
I said stay back!

229
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,340
Don't move!

230
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,740
I'm unarmed.

231
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:23,940
Look.

232
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,460
I said don't move!

233
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,140
Or I'll press it!

234
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,900
Alright.

235
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,940
I won't move.

236
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:36,980
I'm not moving.

237
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,580
Why did you kill my wife?

238
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,820
I killed your wife?

239
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,500
Yes!

240
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,940
You said it yourself!

241
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,620
After I went
to the Public Security Bureau,

242
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,620
you held a grudge.
You wanted to teach me a lesson!

243
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,020
So you killed my wife!

244
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,460
There were so many people
at the Public Security Bureau that day!

245
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,820
Why target me?

246
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,220
Why? Why?

247
00:13:59,380 --> 00:13:59,900
Zheng Jiahe!

248
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,860
I never said those things.

249
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,020
I saw it with my own eyes!

250
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,740
I want you dead.

251
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,140
Target is highly agitated.

252
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,540
He may detonate at any moment.

253
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,580
Request permission to shoot.

254
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,340
I want you dead!

255
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,140
Calm down!

256
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,860
Don't throw your life away
over a moment of rage!

257
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,900
I can't calm down!

258
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,140
You keep pushing me!

259
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,060
Fine.

260
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,580
If I'm going down,

261
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,860
I'll take everybody with me.

262
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,300
We'll all die together!
