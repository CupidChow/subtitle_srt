00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,700
they've got backup.

193
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Three motorcycles in total.

194
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,420
I see them.

195
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,500
An Fei, follow the left one.

196
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,100
Car Three, middle.

197
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,380
Car Four, right.

198
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,540
Car Two,

199
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,700
intercept the fake tax vehicle.

200
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,260
Yes, sir.

201
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:00,860
Understood.

202
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,020
The location of Laundering Hub No.1
has been confirmed.

203
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,860
SWAT team, move out!

204
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,220
Laundering Hub No.1, SWAT in position.

205
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,340
Laundering Hub No.2, SWAT in position.

206
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,660
Laundering Hub No.3, SWAT in position.

207
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,300
Move!

208
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,140
Copy that.

209
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,820
Copy that.

210
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,740
Move.

211
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,660
Stay calm!

212
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,740
Fo's here. Stop arguing!

213
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,900
Hey, enough.

214
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,900
Fo.

215
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,900
- Fo.
- Fo.

216
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,700
Fo.

217
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,340
Fo.

218
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,460
Zha.

219
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,380
Zha's method
of laundering money with gold

220
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,380
is brilliant.

221
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,900
I just gave it a try.

222
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,220
In just one day,

223
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,100
we earned 20 million worth of gold.

224
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,460
Given this achievement,

225
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,300
I think we can implement it officially.

226
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:32,860
Zha,

227
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,580
what's the problem?

228
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,900
Do you realize the mess you've caused?

229
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,300
Fo,

230
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,140
I was boosting company profits.

231
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,860
We only have three laundering hubs
at home.

232
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,940
Because of your unauthorized operation,

233
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,860
the police took them all out.

234
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,860
Happy now?

235
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,380
Fo,

236
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,780
there's a mole from the police among us.
