[Episode 15]

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,780
Yang Yang.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,140
Have you sorted out
the interrogation materials?

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,060
I'll report to Mr. Wu.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,900
I’m almost done, Mr. An.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,300
Okay.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,100
Hello.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,460
This is the Jianghai
Public Security Bureau.

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,380
So much?

11
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,540
What's wrong?

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,700
The dirty money

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,020
that the three money laundering hubs

14
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,860
didn't get to clean is tallied.

15
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,380
It's a total of 180 million.

16
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,260
180 million?

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,180
How far back do these money trails go?

18
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,540
About ten days.

19
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,700
So within one month,

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,780
they can scam people out
of 500 to 600 million.

21
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,380
That's only the amount
of a single scam compound.

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Fortunately, Mr. Han
understood our hints.

23
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,300
Otherwise,

24
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,620
there would be more victims
who got scammed.

25
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,460
Yaqi.

26
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,180
Trace back to the source
along the flow of funds.

27
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,900
At the same time,
issue an announcement to the public

28
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,220
to collect clues from victims
who failed to report the cases in time,

29
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,420
and return the money to them
as soon as possible.

30
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,420
Okay.

31
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,620
Once their access
to money laundering is blocked,

32
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,580
I guess

33
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,380
there won't be a major fraud

34
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,300
before they set up
new money laundering hubs.

35
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,500
In this case,

36
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,220
will it lessen Mr. Han's pressure?

37
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,260
Not necessarily.

38
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,780
Black Dong is a group leader
of the compound.

39
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,700
He's in a high position.

40
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,100
He has lost power,

41
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,220
and thus many others might vie for it.

42
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,780
I hope Han Chuan won't be involved.

43
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,780
Hai.

44
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,780
Shisan is quite sensible.

45
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,620
If he competes with you for the position
of a new group leader,

46
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,980
he won't survive tomorrow.

47
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,700
Without Black on the second floor,

48
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,500
it feels quite peaceful here.

49
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,580
What are you doing?

50
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,860
Congratulations, Hai.

51
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,460
In the future, you'll be the boss
of the second floor.

52
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,300
No wonder Black Dong likes you!

53
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,540
You are sensible.

54
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,380
But it's still too early to say this.

55
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,380
Fo hasn't announced it yet.

56
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,540
Fo will just come over
to go through the motions.

57
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,900
Hai, you are the only one

58
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,140
who can replace Black Dong.

59
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,940
Should anyone have objections,

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,820
they'll have to go through me!

61
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,860
Guys, am I right?

62
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,980
Yes!

63
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,180
Hai!

64
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,300
Hai!

65
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,380
Hai!

66
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,500
Hai!

67
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,580
Hai!

68
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,660
Hai!

69
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,620
Hai!

70
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,740
Hai!

71
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,300
Alright.

72
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,660
Shisan.

73
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,260
I know Fo values you much,

74
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,260
but it means nothing!

75
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,020
You are a newcomer after all.

76
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,620
Just stick with me

77
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,540
and don't get any bright ideas.

78
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,180
Understand?

79
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,780
Everyone, work hard!

80
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,140
Follow me

81
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,260
to earn money and share it together!

82
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,580
Of course,

83
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,540
it's also for Fo's sake.

84
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Fo, you are here.

85
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,100
Fo.

86
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,060
Congratulations,

87

the leader of the second floor.

88
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,460
Fo, I was just kidding.

89
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,580
It didn't mean anything

90
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,020
without your permission.

91
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,380
So you still know

92
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,580
Fo has the final say here.

93
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,060
Fo.

94
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,260
Who would you appoint

95
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,620
as the new group leader?

96
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,620
Let's welcome the new group leader.

97
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,500
Fo, Zha.

98
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,500
Hai.

99
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,820
From today on,

100
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,060
Sang Tuo will be your new group leader.

101
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,420
Call him Sang.

102
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,380
Sang!

103
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,340
- Sang!
- Sang!

104
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,700
These are the names that got dropped
in interrogation??

105
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,340
Right.

106
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,860
Ba Sihai, Black Dong,

107
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,180
Ne Zha and Tie Fo.

108

[Personal Information]
They are core figures

109
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,980
in the scam organization,

110
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,060
especially Tie Fo.

111
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,220
His original name is Cai Huaping,
and he's a Cantonese.

112
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,900
His whole family
has immigrated to Dongbang.

113
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,660
At first, he was a manager
in the compound.

114
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,660
He killed the owner two years ago

115
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,580
and replaced him.

116
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,620
[Richest Man Suo Bangquan Was Killed]
The victim was Suo Bangquan.

117
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,340
He controlled
the largest scam compound in Dongbang.

118
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,220
He was known as the Richest Tyrant,

119
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,780
always acting extremely ruthlessly.

120
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,740
Later, his whole family
was killed by Tie Fo.

121
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,540
I heard that his youngest son ran away,

122
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,060
and Tie Fo hunted him down
throughout Dongbang.

123
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,260
But he was never found.

124
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,180
No one knows where he is.

125
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,580
Fo.

126
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,900
He is just a handyman.

127
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,020
He's been a handyman
since he came to the second floor.

128
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,140
Why?

129
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,500
Why make him the leader here?

130
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,220
Hai.

131
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,980
Right timing makes heroes.

132
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,100
Since Fo is willing
to give me this chance,

133
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,260
why can't I take it?

134
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,460
How many deals have you closed
since you got up here?

135
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,940
You can't even tell

136
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,220
the basic ways of scamming!

137
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,900
There are many ways to scam.

138
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,420
If you are a man,

139
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,260
we can use a young lady
to lead you into the group

140
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,500
and ask you to pay a security deposit.

141
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,940
If you are a woman,

142
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,100
we can say you bought contraband
when shopping online.

143
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,620
You wanna make money?

144
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,300
We'll bait you into the group
with this "invest in a store" scheme..

145
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,580
If you are a child,

146
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,940
it will be even simpler.

147
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,700
We just need to sell game accounts

148
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,500
directly on relevant platforms

149
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,780
and trick you into online loans.

150
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,100
Hai.

151
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,380
Your ways are too outdated.

152
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,660
Obsolete.

153
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,980
Obsolete?

154
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:43,940
Fine.

155
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,940
Tell me something new.

156
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,100
Say it!

157
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,220
To make a little money like you do,

158
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,500
we just need to hold on

159
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,860
to the bottom desires of human nature.

160
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,100
But to make a lot of money,

161
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,660
we have to grasp
the general trend of the economy.

162
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,220
In the past two years,

163
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,140
the domestic economy
hasn't been promising.

164
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,540
Few can make money by investing.

165
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,700
Everyone clutches their wallets tightly.

166
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,700
To scam now,

167
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,340
we need to sell a "foreign paradise".

168
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,780
"The foreigners always look brighter."

169
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,060
In recent years, the Middle East
and U.S. stocks have been booming.

170
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,580
People at home

171
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,620
only feel that the future abroad
is bright.

172
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,460
They can't see any flaw at all.

173
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,980
Anyone can make empty promises.

174
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,820
Can you say something specific?

175
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,780
Sure.

176
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,020
If there are people
who want to immigrate,

177
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,460
we'll disguise ourselves
as immigration agents

178
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,260
and lure their whole families
abroad first.

179
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,540
For the first deal,

180
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,900
we can make 80,000 to 120,000 dollars.

181
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,740
Once they're stranded,

182
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,060
we'll disguise ourselves
as local government personnel

183
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,940
and local gangs

184
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,500
to squeeze out their remaining value.

185
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,300
For those who want to study abroad,

186
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,220
it will be even easier.

187
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,460
We can just open a fake school.

188
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,220
All students by then

189
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,100
will be my hostages.

190
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,460
Their parents have to
transfer money to me

191
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,060
whenever I ask them to do so.

192
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,900
Besides,

193
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,740
there are also surrogacy, investments,

194
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,540
adult entertainment, gambling

195
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,220
and so on.

196
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,460
People who admire foreign countries,

197
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,500
who do underground deeds,

198
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,820
and who want to transfer assets
after making a lot of money

199
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,060
are everywhere!

200
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,340
This is the general trend.

201
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,900
Good for you.

202
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,180
Going tough with the villains?

203
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,500
Aren't you afraid of the backfire?

204
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,740
Hai.

205
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,900
I'm not going tough.

206
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Let me tell you.

207
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,820
Most people don't spend money

208
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,420
on real information.

209
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,140
They just pay for a dream

210
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,020
and a beautiful vision.

211
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,220
Couples who buy diamonds

212
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,140
wish to be together forever.

213
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,100
Those who love fortune-telling

214
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,420
just did it to escape evil omens.

215
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,940
We are also creating a dream.

216
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,220
A daydream

217
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,460
that lets those people feel

218
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,380
they can change their lives abroad.

219
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,540
Everyone.

220
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,180
We've had a hard time.

221
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,740
We are just creating a little hope

222
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,220
and then sell it out

223
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,060
for some money.

224
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,580
Is there any problem?

225
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,660
Hai.

226
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,060
My technique is too advanced

227
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,620
for you.

228
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,980
You won't be able to learn it.

229
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,900
I suggest

230
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,220
that you use Shisan.

231
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,780
You should attach great importance

232
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
to talents like him.

233
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,500
Fo.

234
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,820
I can also help Zha

235
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,940

as soon as possible.

236
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,260
Good.

237
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,420
Fo, thank you for your appreciation.

238
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,780
Shisan.

239
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,780
I did well, didn't I?

240
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,820
I'm telling you,

241
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,380
I memorized those words
all night yesterday.

242
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,380
My legs were shaking
when I spoke just now.

243
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,660
See? My hands are still sweating.

244
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,420
I didn't even know...

245
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,420
Why do you have to be the leader?

246
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,860
Why do you have to be the leader?

247
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,660
Shisan.

248
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,780
Do you know you'll have no turning back

249
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,740
once you become a group leader?

250
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,380
The scams you just mentioned,

251
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
you're not to use any of them!

252
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,380
Go to Tie Fo now

253
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,740
and give up the position.

254
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,380
Why?

255
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,140
Go now!

256
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:10,940
Why?

257
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,580
What did you say?

258
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,460
Why should I?

259
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,620
Tell me why!

260
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,820
I just want to be the group leader.

261
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,180
You don't want it, but I do.

262
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,660
The others can be the leader,

263
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,380
why can't I?

264
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,580
Just because you don't like it?

265
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,060
Yeah.

266
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,980
You did save me before.

267
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,140
I appreciate it.

268
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,420
But even if you saved me once,

269
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,980
can you save me every time?

270
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,100
The reason why we are bullied here

271
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,180
is that we don't have power or backing.

272
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,100
Now you ask me to quit
just because you don't like it.

273
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,860
Do you know how much I sacrificed

274
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,820
for the role?

275
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,740
Have you forgotten?

276
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,940
Your family

277
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,740
died because of those scammers.

278
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,060

In such an environment,

282
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,220
can you be a good person?

283
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,420

284
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,420
and my brother

285
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,300
died because of them.

286
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,580

287
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,380

288
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,700
