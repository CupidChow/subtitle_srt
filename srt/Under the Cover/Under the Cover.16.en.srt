[Episode 16]

3
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,780
What's wrong, Shisan?

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,540
You mess up like this.

5
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:32,940
I'm telling you.

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,260
In this compound,

7
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,780
statistics mean everything.

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,980
If you don't improve your performance,

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,260
I'll send you and your sister

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,820
to retail.

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:44,860
Did you hear it?

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,380
Did you?

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,420
Hai is talking to you!

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,340
Are you deaf?

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,060
Where is your buddy Sang?

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,820
He used to call you dearly.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,660
What?

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,740
So he just ignores you now?

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,140
How about I find you some work?

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,500
Get him moving.

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,260
Get up!

22
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,580
See the boxes of water over there?

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,420
Move them away!

24
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,620
Shisan.

25
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,180
Zha asked you to meet her at night.

26
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,220
I've done what I promised you.

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,340
When will you fulfill your promise?

28
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,700
Zha.

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,940
I will definitely keep my promise.

30
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,860
But it's not the time yet.

31
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,660
I'm worried about my sister right now.

32
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,180
I don't want to talk
about your sister today.

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,460
I just want you

34
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,020
to keep your promise.

35
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,780
Zha.

36
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,380
Here's to you.

37
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,220
For what?

38
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,540
For having my sister taken care of.

39
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,700
Do you know

40
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,540
how much I have to pay

41
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,420
to make you the group leader?

42
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,740
I don't like him at all.

43
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,860
I like tough guys like you.

44
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,940
Zha, thank you for your hard work.

45
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,100
Zha.

46
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,820
I'll refill the wine.

47
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,060
For you,

48
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,900
it's worthwhile to work hard.

49
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,220
But why are you

50
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,020
so stubborn?

51
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,020
What do you mean by this?

52
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,460
Are you really stupid or not?

53
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,940
I already got you the position
of the group leader.

54
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,940
Why did you refuse it?

55
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,300
That old man gave you a chance

56
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,340
to make you admit your mistake.

57
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,340
Hide first.

58
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,860
Why did you come to me so late at night?

59
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,580
Why can't I come to you

60
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,380
so late at night?

61
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,700
I have something. Let me in first.

62
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,740
What?

63
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,580
You wouldn't even offer me tea.

64
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,540
Just cut to the chase.

65
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,100
I'm busy.

66
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,100
I just can't figure Fo out, you know?

67
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,580
He actually made Sang Tuo
the group leader.

68
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,540
I'd give in if he had chosen Shisan.

69
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,660
Sang Tuo is a nobody!

70
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,780
Give in?

71
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,460
But I heard

72
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,300
that since you couldn't deal
with Sang Tuo,

73
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,140
you vented your anger on Shisan.

74
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,820
I didn't scold Sang Tuo

75
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,220
just to save Tie Fo's face.

76
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,100
He called Shisan his buddy, didn't he?

77
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,740
So I bullied his buddy to vent my anger.

78
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,660
So he's humiliated as well!

79
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,060
I don't know what Fo thinks,

80
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,220
but now that he did it,

81
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,660
he must have a reason.

82
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,820
Why don't you ask him yourself?

83
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,460
Wait, you...

84
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,180
Don't you feel anxious at all?

85
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,100
By promoting a newcomer, Tie Fo is

86
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,900
clearly trying to undermine both of us.

87
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,660
And also,

88
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,620
remember how Mr. Suo died?

89
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,340
It was Tie Fo who killed him.

90
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,380
We are the only veterans on this island.

91
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,820
All others died.

92
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,140
Now, Tie Fo can easily kill us

93
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,980
if he wants to.

94
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,380
Our men have no respect for us anymore.

95
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,380
At this time,

96
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,300
we have to unite.

97
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,300
So you don't call me a wretch now?

98
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,780
I was just faking it in front of them.

99
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,300
Don't take it to heart.

100
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,500
Hai.

101
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,900
You should go.

102
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,580
No rush.

103
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,420
Why is your room so hot?

104
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,700
Later, Fo and Sang Tuo

105
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,380
will discuss the money laundering here.

106
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,540
Do you want to join us?

107
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,820
Listen.

108
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,460
Don't threaten me with Tie Fo.

109
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,100
If you push me too far,
I won't be afraid of him.

110
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,660
Then just tell him in the face.

111
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,180
Why did you tell me?

112
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,340
See you.

113
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,500
What a letdown.

114
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,700
Think about what I told you.

115
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,300
I'll be leaving.

116
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,700
Flirty wretch.

117
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,380
I'll deal with you sooner or later.

118
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,940
Zha.

119
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,220
Hai's been venting his anger
on me lately.

120
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,940
If he doesn't see me in the dorm later,

121
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,140
he will cause trouble for me.

122
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,500
Alright.

123
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,180
I see.

124
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,580
I'll send Four-eyes for you next time.

125
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,340
No.

126
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,180
Shisan.

127
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,860
Could you?

128
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,860
Hai, let me do it.

129
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,260
Showing your friendship, aren't you?

130
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,380
Fine.

131
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,700
Pick it up.

132
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,420
Sang.

133
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,020
Hai.

134
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,980
Satisfied?

135
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,060
Not bad.

136
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,340
Since you are satisfied,

137
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,780
can you do me a favor?

138
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,460
Shisan is my buddy.

139
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,180
Please don't make things difficult
for him again.

140
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,740
I hope you could do me this favor.

141
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,500
Mr. Sang, now that
you have already done this,

142
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,340
I have to show you some respect.

143
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,860
Right?

144
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,500
Come on.

145
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,100
Good buddy of Mr. Sang.

146
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,180
Sit down.

147
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,980
Thank you, Hai.

148
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,660
Sang Tuo.

149
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,380
I don't need you to help me.

150
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,820
What's wrong with Xiaoxiao?

151
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,540
Xiaoxiao has had a high fever
for three days in a row.

152
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Her foot is badly infected.

153
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,820
The doctor on the island said

154
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,620
she should be sent
to a large hospital on the mainland,

155
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,380
or she'll have to be amputated.

156
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,420
Amputated?

157
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,780
Peng Yulin!

158
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,700
Hai!

159
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,740
Hai.

160
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:58,940
I'm coming.

161
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,460
Hai.

162
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,900
Hai.

163
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,820
Sleeping all the time.

164
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,620
Did you go to the sixth floor
again yesterday?

165
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,300
Hai, I hadn't done it for a long time.

166
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,940
So I relaxed.

167
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:15,980
I...

168
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:16,900
Hai.

169
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,900
I'm telling you.

170
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,180
Don't screw up the day after tomorrow.

171
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,340
Yes, sir!

172
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,340
I won't delay your transportation
of fresh meat.

173
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,980
Have you checked the boat?

174
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,300
Hai, I have.

175
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,620
Hai.

176
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,860
Next time,

177
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
you can just send someone here.

178
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,340
You don't have to come in person.

179
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,660
Or you can just give me a call.

180
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,300
I'm dedicated, after all.

181
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,420
Yes, you are dedicated.

182
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,500
So dedicated!

183
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,380
Hai.

184
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,300
I checked the boat.

185
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,140
As for the stuff inside...

186
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:48,860
Well...

187
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,860
It's particularly safe.

188
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,340
It's still 40℃.

189
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,940
She keeps having a fever.

190
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,540
Since this morning,

191
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,100
she has been having convulsions.

192
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,260
The doctor said
that if the fever persists,

193
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,660
it can be life-threatening.

194
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,700
We can't wait any longer.

195
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,180
I planned

196
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,980
to take both of you out secretly

197
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,340
when Ba Sihai exits the island.

198
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,220
But now it seems

199
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,140
I'll have to hijack the boat.

200
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,180
Hijack the boat?

201
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,100
Ba Sihai will leave the island
the day after tomorrow.

202
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,260
The boat is at the dock,

203
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,340
fully fueled,

204
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,300
ready to go.

205
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,660
How to hijack it?

206
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,100
Can I help?

207
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,860
I'll figure out a way.

208
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,460
But the bigger problem is

209
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,980
that there's surveillance everywhere
in the building.

210
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,260
I need to figure out
how to take you both to the dock.

211
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,740
Can you ask Ne Zha for help?

212
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,700
She trusts you very much now,
doesn't she?

213
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,020
You said you wanted to see Xiaoxiao,

214
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,500
and she immediately let you come up.

215
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,020
Ne Zha would let me come up,

216
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,620
but it's impossible for her
to let you out.

217
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,260
It'll be easy if I get
an elevator keycard.

218
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,180
But only those group leaders
have elevator keycards.

219
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,060
Sang Tuo.

220
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,060
Sang Tuo is your good buddy.

221
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,820
Can you ask him for help?
