00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,380
[Episode 19]

3
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,220
Fo,

4
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,660
hanging him

5
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,820
seems too merciful.

6
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,620
Why not retail him?

7
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,580
At least we'd profit.

8
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,900
Why'd you shoot on sight?

9
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,620
Mr. Han,

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,860
we'll secure the island first!

11
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,380
Sang Tuo.

12
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:38,820
Sang Tuo.

13
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,260
Shisan.

14
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,380
I made the right bet.

15
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,500
I knew you'd come for me.

16
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,180
These traitors!

17
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,260
Take care of him.

18
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,100
Get over here now!

19
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,500
Get up!

20
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,660
Boss.

21
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,620
Sang Tuo.

22
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,580
Sang Tuo.

23
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,140
Sang Tuo.

24
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,540
Hands off him.

25
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,660
Shisan,

26
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,180
rest for now.

27
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,020
We'll talk later.

28
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,740
Wait, Sang Tuo.

29
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,660
What's this about?

30
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,860
Let me introduce myself.

31
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,780
I'm Sang Tuo.

32
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,460
My father was Suo Bangquan.

33
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,180
How did Mr. Suo die?

34
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,580
Tie Fo killed him!

35
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,380
Two years ago,

36
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,020
Fo killed the boss's whole family

37
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,420
and took over.

38
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,020
Let me tell you,

39
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,220
actually,

40
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,420
not everyone was wiped out.

41
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,540
The boss had an illegitimate son
who got away.

42
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,660
Sang Tuo,

43
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,380
everything I did was for the compound.

44
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,340
And

45
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,500
I never knew you were...

46
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,420
If you had, would I still be alive?

47
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,780
See,

48
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,620
I'm your elder.

49
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,660
You're practically my nephew.

50
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,260
We could work hand in hand

51
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,140
to expand the compound...

52
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,620
Where was this "nephew" talk

53
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,540
when you wiped out my family

54
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,100
and hunted me down?

55
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,020
Spare me.

56
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,260
I don't want anything.

57
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,900
I'll give you everything, alright?

58
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,820
So you don't have a rebellious bone.

59
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,860
Then

60
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,540
how could you bring yourself

61
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,140
to slaughter my entire family?

62
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,740
Are you inherently

63
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,380
a bad guy?

64
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,740
Tuo,

65
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,340
I was wrong!

66
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,140
Had you killed me outright today

67
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,900
instead of torturing me,

68
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,780
you might not have ended up like this.

69
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,740
Oh,

70
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,900
let me show you

71
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,940
how this should be done next time.

72
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,100
Wait a minute.

73
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,100
Sang Tuo!

74
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,700
- Sang!
- Sang!

75
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,340
- Sang!
- Sang!

76
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,300
- Sang!
- Sang!

77
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,900
- Sang!
- Sang!

78
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,740
- Sang!
- Sang!

79
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,620
- Sang!
- Sang!

80
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,540
- Sang!
- Sang!

81
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,540
- Sang!
- Sang!

82
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,860
Sang.

83
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:25,940
Here's to you.

84
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,940
You'll still head the technical team.

85
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,780
Thanks, Sang.

86
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:48,940
Come here.

87
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,700
Shisan.

88
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,660
You know what?

89
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,780
Today is the happiest day of my life.

90
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,100
So you've been planning
to take back the compound all along.

91
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,500
You were just using me this whole time.

92
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,940
How can you call it using?

93
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,220
You promised

94
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,660
you'd help me get revenge.

95
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,860
The truth is, I don't enjoy killing.

96
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,060
Every one of those dead men today

97
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,140
had a hand in my parents' murder.

98
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,180
Let me tell you all,

99
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,700
this compound

100
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,700
was always mine!

101
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,540
Tie Fo was nothing

102
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,700
but a dog working for our family.

103
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,500
We provided for him.

104
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,780
Never did we expect

105
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,740
that this dog would

106
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,180
turn on his masters.

107
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,900
Just for that little money,

108
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,180
he left me homeless.

109
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,580
So I have to take revenge.

110
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,860
I have to take back
what was rightfully mine!

111
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,260
My uncle

112
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,340
cut off his own tongue

113
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,860
just to earn Tie Fo's trust.

114
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,140
All for this day!

115
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,540
So tell me!

116
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,900
Did Tie Fo deserve to die?

117
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,140
- He deserved to die!
- He deserved to die!

118
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,340
- That's right!
- He had it coming!

119
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,540
- He should die!
- He deserved to die!

120
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,060
I'm a bastard child.

121
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,700
My birth mother died in childbirth.

122
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,540
My stepmother kicked me out,

123
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,860
dumped me in that orphanage

124
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,300
where my father groomed his killers,

125
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,900
and wouldn't let me take over
the compound's business.

126
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,940
That's why Tie Fo never recognized me.

127
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,100
That's why I could

128
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,020
disguise myself as fresh meat
and infiltrate the compound.

129
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,980
And that's how

130
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,980
I got to know my buddies here!

131
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,820
Boss!

132
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,620
- Boss!
- Boss!

133
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,020
Shisan,

134
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,460
on this journey,

135
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,940
The person I am most grateful to is you.

136
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,460
If not for you,

137
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,460
I might have been killed long ago.

138
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,900
Or perhaps I would have been
left alone on the island.

139
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,860
This day wouldn't have come so soon.

140
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,620
Everyone!

141
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,980
To Shisan!

142
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,220
To Shisan!

143
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,380
Shisan,

144
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,140
now that you're back,

145
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,380
stop putting on that police act.

146
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,260
- Police?
- Police?

147
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,540
He's really a cop?

148
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,860
So you knew my identity all along?

149
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,860
The day after we parted at the market,

150
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,900
Dahn found your bag.

151
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,180
Everything was still inside.

152
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,540
Want to check?

153
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,260
Then why not turn me in?

154
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
Why would I?

155
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,700
You were helping me.

156
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,700
I wanted to see

157
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,980
how you'd fool those bastards.

158
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,540
From the lucky number "four nines"

159
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,260
to the acrostic poem
that enraged the marks,

160
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,380
to the plaque
with "Water Springs from Heaven".

161
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,140
I've always wondered

162
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,860
why they

163
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,900
never questioned your identity

164
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,380
or suspected

165
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,580
why all your marks

166
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,180
came from Jianghai City.

167
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,580
Shisan,

168
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,060
I knew

169
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,140
you wanted to take them down
step by step.

170
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,340
You were helping me.

171
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,620
Everyone, let's hear it for Shisan,

172
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,420
or should I say,

173
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,500
Chinese police officer Han Chuan!

174
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,660
Shisan,

175
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,260
now that you're back,

176
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,700
there's something I want to ask you.

177
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,940
Would you like to keep working with me?

178
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,260
Running scams with you?

179
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,540
Will you?

180
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,220
What do you think?

181
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,580
But you don't get a choice anymore.

182
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,100
This is my compound.

183
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,340
You think there's a place here

184
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,500
for a cop?

185
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,940
- No!
- No!

186
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,100
- No!
- No place!

187
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,100
- No!
- No way!

188
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,580
Since cops can't stay,

189
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,980
and he won't change his mind,

190
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,700
what should we do?

191
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,380
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

192
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,220
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

193
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,300
Shisan,

194
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,380
I'm giving you one last chance.

195
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,580
Will you work with me?

196
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,780
Please.

197
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,260
Think carefully before you answer.

198
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,140
Or I'll really pull this trigger.

199
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,780
I won't.

200
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,980
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

201
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,460
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

202
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:39,780
Don't move!

203
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,580
Shisan.

204
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,620
It's all their fault for shouting.

205
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,420
How could I bear to kill you?

206
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,860
You saved my life.

207
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,860
From the first day I called you Shisan,

208
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,980
you've always been like a brother to me.

209
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,220
In my compound,

210
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,660
no matter what you used to do,

211
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,940
whether you were a cop

212
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,340
or a pimp,

213
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,300
you are

214
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,500
all the same here!

215
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,860
I have only one goal.

216
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,100
To make everyone earn more money!

217
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,060
Boss, we're with you!

218
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,220
- Boss!
- Boss!

219
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,820
We'll follow you!

220
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,660
Boss, we'll follow you!

221
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,180
He's your boss.

222
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,100
Call him Shisan!

223
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,060
- Shisan!
- Shisan!

224
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,140
- Shisan!
- Shisan!

225
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,860
I believe
our Chinese police officer, Han Chuan,

226
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,140
will soon become part of our big family.

227
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,100
Everyone, to Shisan!

228
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,100
To Shisan!
