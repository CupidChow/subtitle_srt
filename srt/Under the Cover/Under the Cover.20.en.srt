[Episode 20]

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:21,940
Shisan,

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,460
you've been here long enough.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,900
Aren't you curious
what's on the seventh floor?

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,500
Today I'll show you.

7
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,220
Shisan，

8
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,180
all this gold,

9
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,780
all this money,

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,940
everything here

11
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,820
belongs to both of us.

12
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,500
Take as much money

13
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,980
as you want.

14
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,500
No need to ask me.

15
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,740
Spend it

16
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,100
however you like.

17
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,180
You can even burn it
to light your cigarettes.

18
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,300
Well?

19
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,140
I don't need it.

20
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,740
Then what do you need?

21
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,420
Don't answer yet.

22
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,260
Let me think.

23
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,140
I know.

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,260
You need to be a cop, right?

25
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,860
You need to serve justice.

26
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,100
You need to take down criminals.

27
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,580
Here,

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,700
take this money.

29
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,980
What do you want?

30
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,140
Starting tomorrow,

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,060
I'll have Dahn

32
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,460
create a new identity for you.

33
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,300
After tomorrow,

34
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,140
you'll be part of our glorious

35
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,340
Dongbang police force.

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,420
You'll be able to arrest
countless criminals

37
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,940
throughout Dongbang.

38
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,460
You can enforce

39
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,620
all the justice you want.

40
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,540
Here.

41
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,820
All this money

42
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,020
will be your operational budget.

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,820
Of course,

44
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,460
if you don't like the laws of Dongbang,

45
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,420
I can change them for you.

46
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,020
You may not know,

47
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,820
but local officials here

48
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,820
really love gold.

49
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,420
I can use this gold to bribe them

50
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,780
and change all the laws you don't like

51
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,860
into the ones you do.

52
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,940
What do you think?

53
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,460
You're completely insane.

54
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,060
How am I insane?

55
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,060
Have some confidence, Shisan.

56
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,980
Laws are made by people.

57
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,700
Those with power and influence
can make them.

58
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,460
So why can't we?

59
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,740
Give it up.

60
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,260
I'll never become someone like you.

61
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,860
Me?

62
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,860
I believe you'll truly become
my brother.

63
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,500
Just like I believed

64
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,620
you'd really come to save me.

65
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,300
Right?

66
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,780
You'd better take me
to basement level two.

67
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,420
I'm going to make you stay here

68
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,220
and corrupt you.

69
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,020
Tidy up the gold room!

70
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,140
From now on, Shisan lives here.

71
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,940
No problem.

72
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,820
Shisan,

73
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,420
there's something else.

74
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,220
If not for yourself,

75
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,420
think about your sister.

76
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,180
Let me tell you,

77
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,340
Dahn is already on his way
back to the island.

78
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,740
Don't forget that your sister
and Li Bailing

79
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,900
are still at Dongbang Police Station.

80
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,180
What do you want?

81
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,060
Mr. Dahn.

82
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,700
They're both still here.

83
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,100
Got it.

84
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,100
Got it.

85
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,460
Understood.

86
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,900
Don't worry.

87
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,500
I will

88
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,460
guard the gate and wait for your return.

89
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,340
Wake up.

90
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,460
You two are disrupting
official business.

91
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,900
Move.

92
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,460
Wait inside.

93
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,540
Sir,

94
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,700
I think we ate something bad.

95
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,300
We need to use the restroom.

96
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,100
Fine. I'll take you there.

97
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,180
Follow me.

98
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,180
What's wrong?

99
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,260
That cop's suspicious.

100
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,300
He's trying to catch us.

101
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,740
There's a back door over there.

102
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,860
Let's get out of here.

103
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,460
Let's go.

104
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,900
The suspects are escaping! Stop them!

105
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,500
Stop right there!

106
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,180
Stop running!

107
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,340
Stop!

108
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,340
Bailing, what are you doing?

109
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,300
Run.

110
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,020

provided a key lead.

152
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,020
There's a terminal server
inside the compound

153
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,340
where there is a black box.

154
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,540
Every penny they've scammed

155
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,740
and all transaction records

156
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,340
are stored there.

157
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,820
For this operation,

158
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,540
we must protect this crucial evidence.

159
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,700
Without evidence,

160
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,300
even if we extradite them,

161
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,940
we can't arrest or convict them.

162
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,100
Black box?

163
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,540
Search over there!

164
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,980
You're really keeping that Chinese cop?

165

Uncle, I know your concerns.

166
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,380
In my whole life,

167
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,820
few people have treated me
like a human being.

168
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,140
Apart from you, he's the only one.

169
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,060
Everyone else just wants my power

170
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,460
or my money.

171
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,340
What about the people below?

172
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,700
Don't worry.

173
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,980
If I can take this place,

174
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,660
I can hold onto it.

175
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,420
And if he insists on returning to China?

176
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,580
No.

177
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,140
I believe I can win him over.

178
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,620
Everyone in this world
has something they're after.

179
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,780
As long as he desires something,

180
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,020
I can reach his heart.

181
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,180
Damn you.

182
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,860
You pretended to be Shisan to trick me,

183
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,540
and now I have to bring you food?

184
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,660
That girl's shoe.

185
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,100
She ran ahead!

186
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,620
Son of a gun!

187
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,620
Uncle,

188
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,860
how's Dahn handling things?

189
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,620
The gift had been delivered.

190
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,980
The mayor was pleased.

191
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,460
Good.

192
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,580
What about Mr. Emmett?

193
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,220
Also delivered.

194
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,740
Good.

195
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,020
Now,

196
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,340
let's welcome

197
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,020
our lovely Chinese police officers.

198
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,780
Bad news! Shisan is missing!

199
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,740
Go.

200
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,300
Call all the security guards

201
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,260
to find him.

202
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,460
Sang,

203
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,140
the ventilation ducts
run through the entire building.

204
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Every room has them.

205
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,740
We don't have enough guards right now.

206
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,780
Then call everyone over.

207
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,380
Move!

208
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,060
Got it.

209
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,460
Okay. Alright.

210
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:23,900
You go too.

211
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
I need to protect you.

212
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,820
It's fine.

213
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,180
I don't think he'd hurt me.

214
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:29,980
Go.

215
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,660
Han Chuan,

216
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,940
what are you trying to do?

217
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,740
Who are you?

218
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,380
What are you doing in my place?

219
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,180
Get out!

220
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,020
Get out!

221
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:32,860
Out!

222
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:33,780
Get out now!

223
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,900
This is my place.

224
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,580
Don't worry.

225
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,540
I'm sure we'll find
that Chinese cop soon.

226
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,100
