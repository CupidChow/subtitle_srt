We've been waiting.

195
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,580
Come on in.

196
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,900
We're about to set sail.

197
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,180
Here, Hai.

198
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,940
Have a smoke.

199
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,820
Mine's thicker than yours.

200
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,980
I meant this one.

201
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,540
Take a seat.

202
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,180
Hai, are we...

203
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,460
working here?

204
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,220
Of course not.

205
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,780
Don't ask too many questions.

206
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,580
You'll see when we arrive.

207
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,100
These two beauties are here
for customer service too?

208
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,380
Yeah.

209
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,980
When men and women work together,
the job becomes easier.

210
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,540
Right.

211
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,060
Alright, everyone, listen up.

212
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,420
Everyone take out your phones

213
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,860
and let your families know you're safe.

214
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,700
Then hand them over to me.

215
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,460
Alright?

216
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,660
Hand over our phones?

217
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,780
Why?

218
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,300
No choice.

219
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,780
Company policy.

220
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,500
We're all here to make big money
after all.

221
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,740
Big money? What is that?

222
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,740
Why would your company
confiscate phones?

223
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,860
I'd say it's not a legitimate company.

224
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,500
I'm out. I'm leaving.

225
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,940
Take me back!

226
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,460
Listen here,

227
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,580
once you're on this boat,

228
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,340
the only way off

229
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,980
is in a body bag.

230
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,100
You're threatening me?

231
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,780
I'm calling the cops.

232
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,060
You punk, you're pushing your luck?

233
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,540
Reception's bad here.

234
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,340
Let me get someone to help you.

235
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,460
Come here.

236
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,540
What do you want?

237
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,460
What are you doing?

238
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:17,780
Move!

239
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,860
What are you doing? Let him go!

240
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,820
- Calm down.
- What are you doing?

241
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,300
Stay calm.

242
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,380
- What are you doing?
- Calm down.

243
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,380
Stay calm.

244
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:24,900
Let him go!

245
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,220
Hey, easy now.

246
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:26,980
It's okay.

247
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,540
It's alright.

248
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,540
Cool off.

249
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,340
Sit there.

250
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,820
Sit there.

251
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,780
Harder!

252
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,500
Running, huh?

253
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,100
Try running now!

254
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,180
How's that feel, huh?

255
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,500
Call the cops now.

256
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,180
I dare you!

257
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,940
Fun, isn't it?

258
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,020
Anyone else wanna call the cops?

259
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,660
Over here.

260
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,060
Go ahead, call them!

261
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,140
See what happens!

262
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,780
Hand it over.

263
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,560
[Fei]

264
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,500
Who is it?

265
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,100
A coworker.

266
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,100
Answer it.

267
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,420
Put it on speaker.

268
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,740
You've got some nerve.

269
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,660
It's been days.

270
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,300
Why didn't you let me know you're safe?

271
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,140
Got some good news for you.

272
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,500
Can't talk now.

273
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,740
Busy making money.

274
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,540
What's so important?

275
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,300
Listen,

276
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,380
you got promoted to deputy team leader.

277
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,260
You owe us a celebration.

278
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,500
Deputy team leader?

279
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,620
Tell the manager I won't take the post.

280
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,740
Same pay, more work.

281
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,660
You just got there,
and your consciousness is...

282
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,660
What consciousness?

283
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,580
A security team leader?
And just a deputy?

284
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,420
You take it if you want.

285
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,860
I'll talk to the manager when I'm back.

286
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,860
Gotta go.

287
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,140
I'm hanging up.

288
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,580
Get up.

289
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,140
What do you do?

290
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,820
I'm a cop. Didn't you hear it?

291
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,860
Damn.

292
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,300
A lousy security guard

293
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,260
pretending to be a policeman?

294
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,460
Try pushing me again!

295
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,740
You owe me a phone!

296
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:10,940
What do you want?

297
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,740
Pay for my phone!

298
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,460
Harmony brings wealth.

299
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,580
I don't think you have the guts.

300
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,540
Move out.

301
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,700
Hurry up.

302
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,300
Hurry! Keep up!

303
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,100
Faster, faster.

304
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:08,860
Move it!

305
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,860
Faster, faster.

306
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:19,940
Hurry!

307
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,460
Keep up.

308
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:27,900
Move it!

309
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,060
Quit dragging your feet!

310
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,140
Hurry. Keep up.

311
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,500
Hurry. Move it.

312
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,140
Move! Hurry!

313
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:39,940
Faster!

314
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,620
Move it.

315
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,420
What's going on?

316
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,020
What are you doing?

317
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,340
You'll get used to it.

318
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,060
Listen up,

319
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,700
this area is our company's graveyard.

320
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,100
Anyone who tries to run

321
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,220
or doesn't obey

322
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,500
ends up here.

323
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:23,980
- Seen enough?
- Hurry up!

324
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:25,980
Faster!

325
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,460
Xiaoxiao.

326
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,740
- Let me go!
- Don't move!

327
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,660
Let me go!

328
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,100
Let go!
