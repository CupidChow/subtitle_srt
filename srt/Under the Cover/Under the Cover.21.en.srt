[Episode 21]

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,700
Search the place!

4
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,460
Turn every room inside out!

5
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,260
Shishan.

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,820
You scared me to death.

7
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,940
Search every corner of this place!

8
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,780
Come with me.

9
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,260
Turn this room inside out!

10
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,500
Check every desk,

11
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,460
every cabinet!

12
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,780
Move it!

13
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,580
What are you doing?

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,780
Four-eyes.

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,500
You're supposed
to be looking for Shisan.

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,860
Instead, you're taking out trash?

17
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,860
The kitchen bin is full.

18
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,500
Thought it wouldn't take long...

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,100
Don't move.

20
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,300
Gee, Xiaoxiao.

21
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,500
You can hit like a truck.

22
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,420
Yang, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,220
I thought those corrupt cops
had caught up with me.

24
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,620
It's alright.

25
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,900
My classmate Li Bailing
is still at the police station.

26
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,820
You need to rescue her.

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,940
Your classmate?

28
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,020
Xiaoxiao!

29
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,980
What are you doing?

30
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,780
She died saving me.

31
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,340
She died saving me.

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,860
She died saving me!

33
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,620
Xiaoxiao, calm down.

34
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,780
- Xiaoxiao, listen to me.
- She died saving me!

35
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,700
- Listen to me.
- She died saving me!

36
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,620
Listen, Xiaoxiao.

37
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,060
Rest assured.

38
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,220
We will wipe out these criminals

39
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,220
completely.

40
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,780
But right now,

41
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,620
I need you to tell me everything

42
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,900
that happened in Dongbang

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,020
during this time.

44
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,420
Four-eyes.

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,740
Told you I needed
to take out the trash first.

46
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,260
I...

47
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,660
This has been rotting for a month.

48
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,540
Take it easy.

49
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,060
Sir, we've searched everywhere.
No sign of him.

50
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,980
Let's go.

51
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,980
Dump this already.

52
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,940
Got it.

53
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,580
Take care.

54
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,500
Shisan.

55
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,740
Safe now.

56
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,980
Are you okay?

57
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,100
Did Sangtuo do anything else to you

58
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,820
besides locking you in the gold room?

59
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:44,980
No.

60
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,260
Rui,

61
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,100
I need another favor.

62
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,140
Don't worry.

63
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,740
You'll stay hidden here.

64
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,780
I've been trying

65
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,500
to find out how you're doing.

66
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,940
Once the heat dies down,

67
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,740
I'll sneak you to the dock.

68
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,780
After Sang Tuo wiped out Tie Fo's crew,

69
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,300
the compound lost half its people.

70
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,140
They've been shipping in

71
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,260
fresh meat daily

72
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,220
to replenish their numbers.

73
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,180
As long as their boats keep coming,

74
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,340
you'll have a chance to leave.

75
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,900
You can get
into Sang Tuo's office now, right?

76
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,660
I need your help.

77
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,060
I deliver their meals now.

78
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,660
Could use that to get upstairs.

79
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,340
But

80
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,940
you're a cop.

81
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,740
You finally escaped.

82
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,900
Get out while you can.

83
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,820
If they catch you again,

84
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,980
they'll kill you.

85
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,340
Sang Tuo won't stay patient
with you forever.

86
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,060
I have to go up there

87
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,780
and get the evidence.

88
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,020
My colleagues are already in Dongbang.

89
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,900
They'll storm the island in a few days.

90
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,740
With the evidence,

91
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,340
none of them will get away with it.

92
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,100
Really?

93
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,980
The Chinese police are really coming?

94
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,100
Found him?

95
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,820
We've turned every floor upside down.

96
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,620
From the torture chamber
to your office.

97
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,700
Still no sign of Shisan.

98
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,980
I put you in charge of security
under Biao.

99
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,940
You told me

100
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,620
you'd turned this compound

101
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,380
into an impenetrable fortress.

102
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,340
Now, after all this time,

103
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,540
you can't even track down one man?

104
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:18,980
Sang,

105
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,420
I installed over 200 cameras

106
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,060
across the whole building.

107
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,260
The only place without one
is your office.

108
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,500
None of the cameras have spotted him.

109
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,260
He can't be in the building.

110
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,180
Then keep looking.

111
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,980
If you don't find him by noon tomorrow,

112
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,780
you'll be retailed.

113
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,700
Got it.

114
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,580
Alright.

115
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,740
Understood.

116
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,540
Sang,

117
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,220
at least eat something.

118
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,180
Rui,

119
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,380
you and Shisan are so close.

120
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,660
You must know where he went.

121
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:58,860
Right?

122
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,820
I don't know.

123
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,380
I haven't seen him.

124
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:07,940
Get out.

125
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,940
You know,

126
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,300
I treated him so well.

127
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,620
He said he didn't want to run scams.

128
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,300
Fine.

129
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,500
I let him work as a cop in Dongbang.

130
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,020
Why did he still run?

131
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,660
He's a Chinese cop.

132
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,500
He has his own country.

133
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,300
Yes.

134
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,980
You're right.

135
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,300
He's a cop.

136
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,460
We're not on the same path.

137
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,180
I thought of him as a friend.

138
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,220
But he only ever wanted to arrest me.

139
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,620
He's a stone that'll never be warmed.

140
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,660
I shouldn't have been
so lenient with him.

141
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,700
Right?

142
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,020
He'll never be one of us.

143
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,700
We should just use him.

144
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,260
Yes.

145
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,860
You're right.

146
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,820
I should just use him.

147
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,820
I shouldn't have gotten
emotionally attached.

148
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,540
He's just a tool.

149
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,660
A tool for me to exploit his identity

150
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,580
to break into the Chinese market.

151
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,100
Right?

152
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,300
That's correct.

153
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,420
Yeah.

154
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,660
If he won't cooperate,

155
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,020
I'll make him suffer.

156
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,380
Since he won't take the easy way,

157
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,500
I'll do this the hard way.

158
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,980
Search every inch!

159
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,500
Turn over every rock three times!

160
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,660
Here!

161
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,420
There!

162
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,780
Search carefully!

163
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,540
Search!

164
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,020
Zha,

165
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,300
this is no time

166
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,460
to relax.

167
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,700
Help me search.

168
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,380
Zha,

169
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,780
you're not still
protecting Shisan, are you?

170
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,500
Protect him?

171
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,940
I just wanted to sleep with him.

172
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,860
Yet he wanted me dead.

173
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,980
Then why are you here...?

174
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,020
There's a footprint on the wall.

175
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,620
He must've gone to the cafeteria.

176
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,660
Now let's see where you run.

177
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,460
Shisan,

178
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,300
do you want to escape that badly?

179
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,980
Where's my sister?

180
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,060
Han Xiaoxiao?

181
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,100
She's at the police station.

182
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,820
I need to see her.

183
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,180
If you don't let me,

184
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,780
I'll keep trying to escape.

185
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,060
Shisan,

186
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,420
you wanted to see her.

187
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,940
I gave you the chance.

188
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,020
But you threw it away.

189
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,820
Now,

190
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,820
you don't get

191
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,940
to decide who you see.

192
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,260
Sang Tuo,

193
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,380
I came to Dongbang,

194
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,900
came here, just to find her.

195
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,900
I know you have her.

196
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,340
Let her go,

197
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,900
and I'll do whatever you say.

198
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,020
Really?

199
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,500
Yes.

200
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,420
But

201
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,820
after what happened today,

202
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,780
how am I supposed to trust you?

203
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,500
What do you want then?

204
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,340
What do I want?

205
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,140
I heard your colleagues
are coming tomorrow.

206
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,540
You're coming with me to meet them.

207
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,860
What are you planning now?

208
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,700
Yaqi.

209
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,740
Give her

210
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,020
the anti-inflammatory drug in an hour.

211
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,260
Got it.

212
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,700
Xiaoxiao, Xiaoxiao.

213
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,820
[Unknown number]
Xiaoxiao, Xiaoxiao.

214
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,020
Xiaoxiao.

215
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,260
Xiaoxiao.

216
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,420
You're safe now.

217
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,380
Just rest here.

218
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,660
Don't be afraid.

219
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,020
It's okay.

220
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,820
Hello?

221
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,540
It's me.

222
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,380
Don't worry.

223
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,740
We'll be there on time tomorrow.

224
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:03,860
Alright.

225
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,180
Who was it, Mr. An?

226
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,560
The director general
of Dongbang Police Station

227
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,440
will meet with us tomorrow.

228
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,060
Calling this late?

229
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,700
That's not standard procedure.

230
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,460
Here's the plan.

231
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,380
Yang Yang,

232
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,380
you'll come with me tomorrow.

233
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,700
Yaqi, stay here with Xiaoxiao.

234
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,940
- Got it.
- You don't have to stay with me.

235
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,020
I'm not scared anymore.

236
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,460
Someone has to stay with you

237
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,660
and ensure your safety.

238
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,420
Your brother risked everything
to get you out.

239
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,940
If something happens to you,

240
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,380
I can't face him.

241
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,300
Be good.

242
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,260
But I don't even know

243
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,620
how my brother is doing right now.

244
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,900
Don't worry.

245
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,700
I'll get both you
and your brother home safely.

246
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,700
Now get some rest.

247
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,060
Officer An Fei, right?

248
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,420
Yes.

249
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,860
-Hello.
- Hi. I'm Dahn.

250
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,220
Hello. Please come in.

251
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,460
Come in.

252
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,620
Mr. An, this way.

253
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,460
Let me introduce you.

254
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,580
This is our newly appointed
director general, Mr. Sang.

255
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,460
And this is Officer An Fei,

256
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,900
the Chinese representative

257
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,820
of this cross-border joint operation.

258
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,740
Hello, sir.

259
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,060
I'm An Fei, the Chinese representative
of this operation.

260
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,700
This is my colleague, Yang Yang.

261
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,980
I've heard so much about you, Mr. An.

262
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,180
Finally meeting you in person.

263
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,060
Sir, you've heard of me?

264
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,340
Well, know the enemy and know yourself.

265
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,660
I make it a point to understand

266
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,340
both friends and foes equally well.

267
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,220
Let me introduce myself.

268
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,820
I'm the acting director general
of this police station.

269
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,140
My name is Sang Tuo.

270
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,500
What happened to Mr. Emmett,
our previous contact?

271
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
A shame, really.

272
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,620
The criminal networks here

273
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,820
run deeper than you'd think.

274
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,260
Mr. Emmett

275
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,780
was removed for corruption.

276
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,980
So I'll be temporarily

277
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
assuming the role.

278
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,260
Which means we'll be working together.

279
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,140
Understood.

280
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,060
By the way, where's Mr. Han?

281
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,380
He's outside. I'll go get him.

282
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
Mr. Han, this way.

283
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,220
Han Chuan.

284
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,140
An Fei.

285
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,500
Yang Yang.

286
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,220
Mr. Han.

287
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,340
What took you so long?

288
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,100
You're still as buff as ever.

289
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,060
You've gotten tanned.

290
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,540
You're still so pale.

291
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,860
Enough small talk.

292
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,940
Let's get down to business.

293
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,740
Take your seats.

294
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,380
Sit.

295
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,660
Mr. Han.

296
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,780
Congratulations, Mr. Han.

297
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,140
You've reunited with your team

298
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,540
and will soon be going home.

299
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,380
Not yet.

300
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,900
I still have unfinished business

301
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,380
at Dongbang Police Station.

302
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,780
I need to stay and assist you, Mr. Sang.

303
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,980
Right.

304
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,060
So to expedite Officer Han's return,

305
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,020
we need to take down

306
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,780
this scam compound quickly.

307
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,340
What's your plan for this, Mr. An?

308
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,220
We'll move up the attack on the island

309
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,260
to tomorrow.

310
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,820
Tomorrow?

311
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,340
Based on our past experience,

312
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,140
the key to operations

313
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,300
against scam compounds is surprise.

314
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,460
If we catch them off guard,

315
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,700
we can maximize the protection
of ill-gotten gains

316
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,580
and evidence,

317
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,260
ensure criminals are punished,

318
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,700
and minimize people's losses.

319
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,060
By the way, Mr. Sang,

320
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,500
Han Chuan has been away
from the compound

321
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,740
for a while.

322
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,140
The preparations for the operation

323
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,620
should be almost done, right?

324
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,340
Of course.

325
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,180
My troops are ready to move
onto the island at any time.

326
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,820
But Mr. An,

327
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,220
what's your plan

328
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,500
once we're on the island?

329
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,940
According to Han Chuan's intel,

330
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,740
Red Obsidian Island is surrounded
by mountains on three sides,

331
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,580
with a dock on the southeast.

332
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,900
The main road leads
straight to the office building.

333
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,260
But don't forget,

334
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,500
the criminals' forces
are concentrated on the main road.

335
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,500
We won't take the main road.

336
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,420
But there's a jungle
to the left of the main road.

337
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
We can send a team
to feign an attack there.

338
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,180
Then on the right side, we can...

339
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,140
The right side is a deep valley
with hornets.

340
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,740
That's suicide.

341
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,820
There are also several paths
on the southeast side of the island

342
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,900
that lead to the office building.

343
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,940
Those trails are a maze,

344
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,300
full of swamps.

345
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,980
Another death trap.

346
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,340
And it's very easy
to be surrounded by the enemy there.

347
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,020
Your plan won't work.

348
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,460
Mr. Sang, it seems

349
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,420
you know Red Obsidian Island
better than we do.

350
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,100
Excuse me.

351
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,940
Mr. Yang, some water.

352
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,460
Mr. Han.

353
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,220
Thank you.

354
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,380
Mr. An.

355
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,100
Thanks.

356
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,660
Mr. Sang.

357
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,660
I'll pass.

358
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,340
Pardon me.

359
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,860
Got it.

360
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,060
I am from Dongbang, after all.

361
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,540
It's only natural I'd have easier access

362
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,060
to such information.

363
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,340
Mr. An,

364
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,740
don't underestimate this compound.

365
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,180
The criminals there

366
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,860
are all desperate men.

367
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,060
The guns they use

368
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,020
are even better

369
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,860
than my service pistol.

370
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,980
Hard to believe a small compound

371
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,980
could outgun the entire police force.

372
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,940
Of course.

373
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,300
Here, money can buy lives

374
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,420
and even make people sell their own.
