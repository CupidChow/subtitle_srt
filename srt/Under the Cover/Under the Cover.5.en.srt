00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,380
[Episode 5]

3
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,100
I can't believe it.

4
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,100
She lied there like a dead pig.

5
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,780
Come.

6
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,260
Hai.

7
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,620
Give her a lesson.

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,340
She's unskilled at all.

9
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,300
Teach her how to serve people.

10
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:55,900
Go.

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,700
Alright, Hai. Let's go.

12
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,540
Wait.

13
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,460
Hai?

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,420
Let me teach you.

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,220
Once she's trained,

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,420
give her to Zha.

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,020
It's profitable as well
to send her to the sixth floor.

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,540
We can also do Zha a favor.

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,580
Understand?

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,460
Understood, Hai.

21
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,780
Alright.

22
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,220
Beauty.

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,620
You're reading an English book?

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,340
Can you understand it?

25
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,580
What's wrong?

26
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,180
Who messed with you again?

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,420
Do you have to go to the second floor?

28
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,700
You don't want me to go?

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,740
To tell the truth, Shisan,

30
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,420
I've always thought
you're a good person.

31
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,700
All they do is unconscionable deeds
on the second floor.

32
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,100
Both Ba Sihai and Black Dong

33
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,820
are beasts with no humanity at all.

34
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,460
They organize gambling games
every month,

35
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,060
doing whatever it takes to win.

36
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,140
They have fun scamming people

37
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,740
and treat them as nothing.

38
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,940
Don't you worry.

39
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,180
I know what I'm doing.

40
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,740
By the way,

41
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,260
how did you get in?

42
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,820
I was also scammed into this.

43
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,700
Forget about me, Shisan.

44
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,700
I heard

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,340
Black Dong bought a mark
at a high price some while ago.

46
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,180
A little girl who was raising money
for her mother's treatment.

47
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,340
It's not just about making money,

48
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,100
but even murdering.

49
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,860
Sooner or later, karma will find him.

50
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,420
I'm afraid that when you've been there
long enough,

51
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,980
you'll become one of them.

52
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,100
How much do you know about the girl

53
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,940
targeted by Black Dong?

54
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,820
I heard she's
a college student in Jianghai.

55
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,300
Poor girl.

56
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,140
Jianghai?

57
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,660
Shisan, don't change the subject, okay?

58
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,100
I sincerely advise you not.

59
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,900
Tell me if you have any difficulty.

60
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,140
I'll solve it for you.

61
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,500
Rui.

62
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,860
Please save it.

63
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,460
I must go up to the second floor.

64
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,300
But I promise you

65
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,460
I'll never harm people.

66
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,660
Remember what you said.

67
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,260
What's this?

68
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,140
Open it and check.

69
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,380
You don't have clothes
to change, do you?

70
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,700
I wore those before.

71
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,860
You can take them.

72
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,140
But our sizes are different!

73
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,900
Well, you don't know this.

74
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,460
My figure was the same as yours.

75
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,660
I was as handsome as you.

76
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,900
It's true.

77
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,660
Thank you, Rui.

78
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:49,700
Shisan!

79
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,380
I heard you're going
to the second floor.

80
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,500
Why don't you take me with you?

81
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
I'm capable.

82
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,820
I'm telling you this.

83
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,860
There are many bad people
on the second floor.

84
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,820
If there's no one to take care of you,

85
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,020
you'll be bullied.

86
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,380
What do you think?

87
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:04,860
No need.

88
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,620
I can go by myself.

89
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,260
Rui.

90
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,700
Please help me persuade him.

91
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,780
Let's go up there together
to help Shisan.

92
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,500
I'm not going.

93
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,580
Aren't we friends?

94
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,660
If you want to go, just go.

95
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,300
I'll stay in the cafeteria
and go nowhere.

96
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:24,940
You...

97
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,220
Shisan, if he won't go, I'll go.

98
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,100
I don't care, I've decided.

99
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,780
You have to take me with you anyway.

100
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,760
[You have no right not to work hard?]

101
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,680
[If you want to turn your life around,
make madness a habit first]

102
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,200
[Where there's a will, there's a way]

103
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,040
[There are no losers, only quitters]

104
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,660
This is the second floor.

105
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,860
It's the most profitable place
in the compound.

106
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,300
These are your spots.

107
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,180
Dong, are we only dealing

108
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,420
with this poor student in this gamble?

109
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,780
She has no money to enjoy herself,

110
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,340
but

111
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,060
the amount of the life-saving money
for her mother

112
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,060
is yet to be known.

113
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,460
This time,

114
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,300
we will definitely win.

115
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,420
That's Black Dong
who gambled with Hai, right?

116
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:47,980
Right.

117
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,460
What a fool.

118
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,140
Who are you talking about?

119
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,380
Yes, you.

120
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:09,940
Dong.

121
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:11,980
My name is Shisan.

122
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,260
Busy working, huh?

123
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,180
What are you doing?

124
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,300
Don't touch my buddy!

125
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,220
Dong.

126
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,140
You take such a stupid mark
as a treasure?

127
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,660
Do you want to die?

128
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,220
I said, don't touch my buddy!

129
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,060
So?

130
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:38,620
Fo is here.

131
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,660
- It's lively
- What are you doing?

132
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,540
on the second floor.

133
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,420
Come here.

134
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,060
Who is this?

135
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,060
Greet Fo.

136
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,220
Fo...

137
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,060
Are you celebrating something here?

138
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,340
Fo, that's not it.

139
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:00,980
No, Fo.

140
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,380
We were...

141
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,780
Fo, they did it first.

142
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,180
They wanted to fight and bully us.

143
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,020
Stop it.

144
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,540
Don't always fight and kill.

145
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,620
Everyone is here

146
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,180
to make money.

147
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,780
Only by being kind can you make money.

148
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,500
Fo.

149
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,980
Both of them are newcomers
in Hai's group.

150
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,860
We were joking just now.

151
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,860
They couldn't stand the joke

152
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,780
and got mad.

153
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:32,900
Fo.

154
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,740
I have admired Dong for a long time.

155
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,140
I want to learn from Dong.

156
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,420
Sorry, Fo.

157
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,900
They are new here
and don't know the rules.

158
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,780
I'll train them later.

159
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,900
Sorry for that.

160
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,460
It's normal for young people

161
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,500
to be spirited.

162
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,740
How about this?

163
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,260
In the gamble
between your two groups this time,

164
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,540
the winning side

165
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,380
will have an extra 3% bonus

166
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,260
this month.

167
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,100
Thank you, Fo.

168
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,340
Thank you, Fo.

169
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,420
Thank you, Fo.

170
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,820
Of course,

171
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,700
the losing side

172
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,340
will face a small punishment.

173
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,180
That would be

174
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,500
retail.

175
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,980
Hai.

176
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,940
Since both of the young ones
want to show their skills,

177
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,100
give them a chance.

178
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,540
I'm totally okay with it.

179
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:47,860
I agree.

180
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,140
Okay, you guys continue.

181
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,420
Goodbye, Fo.

182
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,780
You caused me trouble
as soon as you got up here.

183
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,980
You caused me trouble!

184
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,420
It's serious this time.

185
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,900
It looks like there will be deaths.

186
00:08:59,260 --> 00:08:59,820
Get to work!

187
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,180
Shisan.

188
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,500
This is the best batch in our group.

189
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,020
You caused the trouble.

190

How much is it?

375
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,300
It's 9,999.

376
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,100
Why is it this amount?

377
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,580
I guess you already figured it out.

378
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,060
Han Chuan, it's really you!

379
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,380
Where are you now?

380
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,900
I can't tell you.

381
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,900
But I left you another message.

382
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,340
That doggerel.

383
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,380
Exactly.

384
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,420
To the far east
the power-drunk elites parade,

385
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,780
their bottomless greed
befouls the lake's pure shade.

386
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,540
Of all vile traits,
stupidity reigns supreme.

387
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,300
With ambition cloaked in virtue.

388
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,860
The stench will be left in history.

389
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,620
And empty bells toll in moonlight,
mocking victory.

390
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,940
The world now sees
the eastern masquerade.

391
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,420
Where thugs conspire
to forge their crooked trade.

392
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,740
Till thunderclaps rip
through this waking night.

393
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,140
Exposing minds enslaved
by partial sight.

394
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,420
Han's lost grace now rots
without a shrine.

395
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,820
As moral rivers churn
with evil like thine.

396
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,300
Han Chuan.

397
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,660
What does it mean exactly?

398
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,300
An Fei.

399
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,900
It's time to test
our tacit understanding.
