[Episode 18]

3
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:54,900
Shisan.

4
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,300
When you get out,

5
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,260
contact this number.

6
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,140
Who is this person?

7
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,460
His name is Dahn.

8
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,380
My childhood friend and a policeman.

9
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,500
When you get out,

10
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,260
he will arrange the hospital
and accommodation for you.

11
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,620
OK.

12
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,100
Remember,

13
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,460
all mobile phones
on the boat are monitored.

14
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,100
You can only text.

15
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,140
Don't make any calls.

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,220
By then,

17
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,180
just send the codes on it.

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,980
What do these codes mean?

19
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,300
Dahn has a set of codes
for police communication.

20
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,740
I learned it before.

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,060
The codes roughly mean

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,580
you are a friend of Sang Tuo's.

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,740
You just escaped from the scam island

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,180
and need medical care and assistance.

25
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,940
If the compound detects these codes,

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,980
they'll take it as a system disorder

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,860
and won't delve into it.

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,060
Thank you.

29
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,060
Shisan.

30
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,140
I don't know how long
I can cover for you.

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,340
If Tie Fo finds out

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,100
it's me who helps you escape,

33
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,820
he will definitely kill me.

34
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:08,900
Shisan.

35
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,500
You must come back with the police
as soon as possible.

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,420
I'll be waiting for you.

37
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,900
What are the coordinates now?

38
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,580
Fo is here.

39
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,740
What are you doing?

40
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,020
Fo.

41
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,780
Locate the boat first.

42
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,500
Quickly!

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,960
[No tracker signal]

44
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,060
Fo.

45
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,620
All phone trackers are offline.

46
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,580
He hijacked the boat,

47
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,980
killed people,

48
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,220
and took the girls away.

49
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,140
In such a short time,

50
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,540
he couldn't have done so much
by himself.

51
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,380
Someone must've helped him.

52
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,660
Check all the surveillance
in the building right now.

53
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,580
OK.

54
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,420
Xiaoxiao, we are here.

55
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,460
Xiaoxiao?

56
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,020
Xiaoxiao?

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,340
Xiaoxiao.

58
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,940
Chuan!

59
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,220
Xiaoxiao fainted.

60
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,220
Xiaoxiao.

61
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,700
Xiaoxiao.

62
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,700
Xiaoxiao!

63
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,860
Wake up! I'm scared.

64
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,860
Xiaoxiao!

65
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,540
Chuan!

66
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,780
Let's go.

67
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,420
Shisan?

68
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,380
Mr. Dahn.

69
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,260
My sister...

70
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,300
I've already contacted the hospital.

71
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:37,900
Let's go.

72
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,900
Tell me on the way there.

73
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,500
Fo.

74
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,740
I've checked all the surveillance
in the building.

75
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,140
The footage from when Shisan escaped

76
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,060
has all been deleted.

77
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,500
Our men in the mainland sent news.

78
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,140
Shisan is now in Banglian Hospital.

79
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,580
They have sent someone to find him.

80
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,540
Hurry up!

81
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,140
I didn't expect Tie Fo
to be so powerful.

82
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,620
Fortunately, you spotted them in time.

83
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,980
Otherwise, we'd be in trouble.

84
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,740
But don't worry,

85
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,180
I have contacted the police station.

86
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,180
None of them can escape.

87
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,380
Thank you.

88
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,700
Doctor, how's my sister's surgery?

89
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,620
It was successful.

90
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,660
She is out of danger.

91
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,900
She'll recover after resting
for a few days.

92
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,340
Thank you.

93
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,500
Now that your sister is out of danger,

94
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,300
let's talk about your matter.

95
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,980
I have heard of your deeds in China.

96
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,820
Go back to the police station
with us for investigation.

97
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,780
Take him!

98
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,020
Mr. Han, I'm sorry.

99
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,100
We have just contacted
the Chinese police

100
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,060
and confirmed your identity.

101
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,540
Sorry for wronging you.

102
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,300
It's okay.

103
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,500
I didn't hide my identity
as a police officer on purpose.

104
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,700
We are both police officers.

105
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,660
I understand.

106
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,580
Mr. Dahn.

107
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,260
Can I use your phone
to make a call?

108
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,100
Sure.

109
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,580
Be my guest.

110
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,740
Thank you.

111
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,460
Hello.

112
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,500
An Fei.

113
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,220
It's me.

114
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,620
Han Chuan.

115
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,820
It's really you.

116
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,540
What's up?

117
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,340
Sounds like you're worried about me.

118
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,220
It's all right.

119
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,300
I'm fine.

120
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,860
Is there a Chinese police officer
with us?

121
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:24,780
Yes.

122
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,260
We've received the official
cooperation request from China.

123
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,380
Bring him to me.

124
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,260
Yes.

125
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,260
According to the clues

126
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,100
Han Chuan sent to us
at the risk of his life,

127
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,900
we've basically confirmed

128
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,940
the location and personnel

129
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,340
of the scam group led by Tie Fo.

130
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,060
Upon deliberation
by the Ministry of Public Security,

131
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,660
in accordance with the Guidelines

132
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,180
on the Applicable Law

133
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,100
in Handling

134
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,500
Cross-Border Telecom and Cyber Fraud
and Related Criminal Cases

135
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,260
jointly issued

136
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,340
by the Supreme People's Court,
the Supreme People's Procuratorate

137
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,780
and the Ministry of Public Security,

138
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,300
to dismantle the telecom and cyber

139
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,060
scam gangs entrenched in Dongbang,

140
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,180
we hereby establish

141
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,740
the 118 Special Task Force for Major
Transnational Telecom and Cyber Scam Cases

142
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,820
and will officially send a request
for cooperation to the Dongbang police.

143
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,620
Our mission this time:

144
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,540
First,

145
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,260
safely bring Han Chuan
and Han Xiaoxiao back to China.

146
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,300
Second,

147
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,540
actively cooperate with the local police

148
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,980
to dismantle this scam group

149
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,980
and extradite

150
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,140
all Chinese telecom scam perpetrators.

151
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,220
I appoint An Fei as the leader

152
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,460
who will take Yang Yang and Wang Yaqi

153
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,340
to go abroad in three days.

154
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,860
- Yes!
- Yes!

155
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,860
Hello, Mr. Emmett.

156
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,500
I'm Han Chuan.

157
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,260
Mr. Han, thank you for your efforts.

158
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,740
We have always wanted to dismantle

159
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,780
this scam group.

160
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,820
But there wasn't a breakthrough

161
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,580
until you came along.

162
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,380
Just doing my job.

163
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,260
I just received the document

164
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,700
that the joint operation

165
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,060
between China and Dongbang
targeting this scam group

166
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,420
has been approved.

167
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,780
That's great.

168
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,980
I'll appoint Dahn as the leader.

169
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,660
He'll lead the operation

170
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,260
and cooperate with the Chinese police

171
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,460
to dismantle the scam group.

172
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,420
- Yes!
- Yes!

173
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,980
The main building
of the compound is here.

174
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,340
There are two small houses to its south

175
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,940
where the major forces
of the security are garrisoned

176
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,340
and where Tie Fo and Jian Biao
positioned their heavy weapons.

177
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,260
Not ideal for frontal assault.

178
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,500
In front of the main building,

179
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,380
there is a path next to Parrot Cliff

180
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,700
leading directly to the south dock

181
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,500
where motorboats are hidden.

182
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,420
It's Tie Fo's alternate escape route.

183
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,820
Carefully read

184
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,460
the protocols
for this transnational operation.

185
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,660
We don't have jurisdiction overseas.

186
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,660
Be sure to remember this.

187
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,260
The suspect of the money laundering hub

188
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,700
provided an important clue.

189
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,860
Inside the terminal server
in the compound,

190
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,180
there's a black box.

191
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,380
Every amount of money they scam

192
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,620
and all transaction records

193
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,180
are kept in this black box.

194
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,660
Mr. Wu specially instructed us

195
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,700
that in this operation,

196
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,500
we must protect this important evidence.

197
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,580
Without the evidence,

198
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,220
even if they are extradited back,

199
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,860
we can't arrest or sentence them.

200
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,780
Okay, I see.

201
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,580
Mr. Han.

202
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,660
There is an emergency.

203
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,180
Mr. Dahn asked me to pick you up.

204
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,460
Hadn't I spent time
restoring the surveillance records,

205
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,940
I could have been deceived by you.

206
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,580
Pull this traitor

207
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,700
outside

208
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,900
and let everyone see

209
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,660
the consequence of betrayal.

210
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,380
Yes!

211
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,860
Move faster.

212
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,740
Put these clothes on right now.

213
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,140
Carefully check the firearms
and ammunition.

214
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,700
Hurry!

215
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,020
San.

216
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,860
Teach him how to change.

217
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,340
Hurry up.

218
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,060
Mr. Dahn, what's going on?

219
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,820
Our official operation
is on the day after tomorrow, isn't it?

220
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,100
There is an emergency on the island.

221
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,300
We must act in advance.

222
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,820
Ready for action!

223
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,460
Since we got the location
of Red Obsidian Island,

224
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,980
we have kept our eyes
on all human smugglers

225
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,900
in Dongbang's territory.

226
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,940
This morning,
a smuggler sent news

227
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,140
that Tie Fo's preparing to flee.

228
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,740
I guess

229
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,500
he already knew that you had escaped

230
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,140
and found out your police identity.

231
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,020
I don't know how long
I can cover for you.

232
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,140
If Tie Fo finds out

233
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,900
it's me who helps you escape,

234
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
he will definitely kill me.

235
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,020
It happened suddenly.

236
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,500
We prepared in a hurry.

237
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,220
Let's get on the boat first.

238
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,980
It was Sang Tuo

239
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,340
who helped Shisan escape.

240
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,380
He pretended to be loyal

241
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,860
and cheated us all!

242
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,460
Today, you'll see

243
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,740
how he'll end up
after he betrayed Fo

244
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,340
and our compound!

245
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,660
The last time I saw you,

246
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,820
I thought you looked familiar to me.

247
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,900
Unexpectedly,

248
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,460
you are really his son.

249
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,860
Even this rebellious bone
at the back of your skull

250
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,260
protrudes as prominently

251
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,180
as your father's.

252
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,020
If I get a chance,

253
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
I will kill you.

254
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,820
All right.

255
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,380
Then let's see how long

256
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,140
