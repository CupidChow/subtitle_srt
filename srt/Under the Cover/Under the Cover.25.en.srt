You're injured.

Shisan,

9
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,620
does the sound outside
sound like firecrackers to you?

10
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,260
Yes.

11
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,780
When I was little,

12
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,060
I set off firecrackers once
for my birthday.

13
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,220
My brother bought them for me.

14
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,100
Back then,

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,900
no one in my family liked me.

16
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,300
Only my brother treated me like family.

17
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,700

The reason?

My stepmother

20
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,900
was afraid I'd steal
my brother's inheritance.

you know what?

27
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,220
The smell of gunpowder from bullets

28
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,820
is completely different
from that of firecrackers.

29
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,180
Bullets smell worse.

30
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,900
