190
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,060
And empty bells toll in moonlight,
mocking victory.

191
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,520
[Hu Pei, Donghu University]

192
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,580
The world now sees
the eastern masquerade.

193
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,860
Where thugs conspire
to forge their crooked trade.

194
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,180
Till thunderclaps rip
through this waking night.

195
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,660
Exposing minds enslaved
by partial sight.

196
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,100
Han's lost grace now rots
without a shrine.

197
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,620
As moral rivers churn
with evil like thine.

198
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,100
Dongbang, scam, Han Chuan.

199
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,100
Donghu University, Hu Pei.

200
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:02,900
Mom.

201
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,580
I've just finished class.
I'm on my way.

202
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,460
Hu Pei.

203
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,860
Ms. Zhou.

204
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,460
How is your mother doing?

205
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,620
The surgery has been scheduled
for tomorrow.

206
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,940
You have to take care of your mother
just after entering college.

207
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,260
This is from the teachers
in our department.

208
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,580
We hope it could lessen your burden.

209
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,700
No need, Ms. Zhou.

210
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,020
The money I raised online

211
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,100
will arrive today.

212
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,580
If you can crowdfund online,

213
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,780
we can donate as well.

214
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,580
How about taking it as borrowing?

215
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,980
You can pay us back in the future.

216
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,100
Okay, I'll definitely pay it back.

217
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,460
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

218
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,500
Dong.

219
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,020
The money raised by Hu Pei
on Love Fund has arrived.

220
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,060
Great.

221
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,860
I can't get it through.

222
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,700
Give it a try.

223
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,860
Hello.

224
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,020
The subscriber you dialed...

225
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,820
Mine can't get through either.

226
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,340
It is likely

227
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,660
that the signal
of Hu Pei's mobile phone

228
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,580
is blocked by the scammer.

229
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,860
None of us made it.

230
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,900
Why are you staring?

231
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,300
Get lost.

232
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,700
I see Dong's deal is about to close.

233
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,660
So I came to learn.

234
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,900
Shisan, stop looking.

235
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,420
Let's go back to work, too.

236
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,220
All right.

237
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,700
Brat.

238
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,820
I'll let you see

239
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,860
how you will die.

240
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,500
Okay.

241
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,740
Is Hu Pei from your university?

242
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,700
Hu Pei?

243
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,060
Yes, she is.

244
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,820
But she is not here.
She went to the hospital.

245
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,540
Which hospital?

246
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,380
Donghu Hospital.

247
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,300
Okay, thank you.

248
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,780
Hello?

249
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,300
Hello, Ms. Hu Pei.

250
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,180
It's the customer service of Love Fund.

251
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,060
My staff number is 13102.

252
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,180
I contacted you yesterday.

253
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,620
Hello.

254
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,980
Well...

255
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,540
Can I withdraw it in advance now?

256
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,340
Your application has been approved.

257
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,060
The fund has been transferred
to your account.

258
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,660
You can use it at any time.

259
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,580
Great.

260
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,340
Thank you.

261
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,820
You can check your bank account

262
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
to confirm it.

263
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,180
Okay.

264
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,340
I see it.

265
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,420
The money is here.

266
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,900
Ms. Hu, because your fund
is specially approved,

267
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,300
you will receive
a verification code later.

268
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,100
You need to tell me
the verification code,

269
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,340
so I can make a record for you.

270
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,220
That's all.

271
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,380
Okay.

272
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,020

273
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,660
Ms. Hu.

274
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,660
Have you received the verification code?

275
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,100
I received it. Let me take a look.
