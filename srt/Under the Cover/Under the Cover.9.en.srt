00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,380
[Episode 9]

3
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,300
Rui.

4
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:32,900
Fo.

5
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,700
Fo.

6
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:38,980
It was me.

7
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,180
Wait.

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,940
Give me one good reason.

9
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,580
Fo.

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,300
Ever since Black Dong
lost to me last time,

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,540
he's been targeting on me.

12
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,100
He wants me dead.

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,060
I knew what kind of man he is.

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,100
Instead of keeping my guard up
all the time,

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,740
I'd rather strike first.

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,220
I know the rules.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,620
I'll take the punishment.

18
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,700
But a guy like Black Dong?

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,860
I can't bear with him!

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,100
Great!

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,100
Since you stepped up,

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,900
this

23
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,100
ends here.

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,940
A few days ago,

25
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,820
you were put
in the electric chair for so long,

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,780
but you never broke.

27
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,980
I admire that.

28
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,500
You're tough.

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,100
You have guts.

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,300
But

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,380
I prefer to see your ability
to make money.

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,660
Thank you, Fo.

33
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,340
Sang Tuo,

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,460
you told me it was a laxative.

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,620
How did someone end up dead?

36
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,740
If I had told you it was poison,

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,580
would you have dared to use it?

38
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,620
That's murder!

39
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,660
So what if it is?

40
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,940
I did it for Shisan.

41
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,700
Don't you know
what kind of scum Black Dong is?

42
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,180
Either he dies, or we do.

43
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,260
Sang Tuo, you...

44
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,420
What about me?

45
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,060
We're stuck in this rotten place.

46
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,300
What choice do I have?

47
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,580
Quit the act.

48
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,060
The minute you asked to go upstairs
with Shisan,

49
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,700
I knew you aimed for no good.

50
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,260
No good?

51
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,060
No good how, exactly?

52
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,700
So tell me,

53
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,700
no good how?

54
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,100
Shisan.

55
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,740
Shisan.

56
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,700
Shisan.

57
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,340
What's going on?

58
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,420
Shisan, it has nothing to do with Rui.

59
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,220
I did it.

60
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,300
I got the drug.

61
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,980
I told Rui to use it on him.

62
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,900
When I saw you come down
from that electric chair,

63
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,700
I felt awful.

64
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,180
I swore I'd finish Black Dong.

65
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,340
If not this time,

66
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,140
I'll try again.

67
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:18,820
Sang Tuo.

68
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,620
I was going to take him down,

69
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,500
but in a fair game.

70
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,460
A dirty trick like this

71
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,140
makes you no different from them,
got it?

72
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,820
And

73
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,780
you don't kill.

74
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,100
Got it.

75
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,700
From now on, I do what you say.

76
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,020
The two group leaders
on the second floor,

77
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,380
one is ruthless
and the other is scheming.

78
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,860
And another thing,
take this as a warning.

79
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,020
Anyone standing with me is a friend.

80
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,980
Everyone else is an opponent.

81
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,020
Don't hit me!

82
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,140
Do you have to go to the second floor?

83
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,940
I swore I'd finish Black Dong.

84
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,820
She has to pay with her life today.

85
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,780
In this place, I have the say.

86
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,420
She is not on the sixth floor?

87
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,180
She is not on the sixth floor.

88
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,780
He arranged them
all on the seventh floor.

89
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,300
Now I've got a foothold
on the second floor

90
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,420
and I've managed
to make contact with An Fei.

91
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,420
Next, it's not just about
saving Xiaoxiao.

92
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,020
I want the whole compound shut down.

93
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,740
First,

94
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,460
I must finish Black Dong.

95
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,540
Then I use Ba Sihai and Ne Zha

96
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,660
to climb my way up

97
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,860
so I can get my hands
on the evidence of their crime

98
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
and send it back.

99
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,820
Out.

100
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,260
Dong,

101
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,660
Shisan won't stop until we're dead.

102
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,740
Fo even favored him
and didn't punish him.

103
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,620
- Dong! We should chop him up!
- Chop him up!

104
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,380
So this is what you're going to do?

105
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,580
This is the biggest humiliation ever.

106
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,220
Use your brain.

107
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,900
And you too.

108
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,260
Fo clearly favors him.

109
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,140
And you still want to take revenge

110
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,620
in a violent way?

111
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,460
Put the knives down.

112
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,020
Put them all down.

113
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,700
Down.

114
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,180
There's this hostess on the sixth floor,

115
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,940
named Li Bailing.

116
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,180
Bring her to me.

117
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,780
Dong.

118
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,980
How about having a good rest first?

119
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,620
Enough.

120
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,740
Off you go.

121
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,180
Let's go. Floor six.

122
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,340
You two, come to the restroom with me.

123
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,420
- Dong.
- Dong.

124
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,460
Let me help you.

125
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,540
Shisan, Fo is asking for you.

126
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,380
Hold up.

127
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,420
Xiong, it's late.

128
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,660
What does Fo need him for?

129
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,980
Shut it. Mind your own business.

130
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,780
Fo.

131
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,500
What's this supposed to mean?

132
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,060
Shisan,

133
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,140
let me introduce someone to you.

134
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,180
So the bond runs deep.

135
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,820
Shisan,

136
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,980
I guess I don't know you

137
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,500
as well as I thought.

138
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,260
But the good thing is,

139
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,060
she's already told me everything

140
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,460
she needed to say.

141
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,340
Now it's your turn.

142
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,740
If your stories don't match,

143
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,420
sorry,

144
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,300
both of you die.

145
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,180
Chop chop.

146
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,220
What are you waiting for?

147
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,620
Don't touch her, Black Dong!

148
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,220
Fo.

149
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,500
She's my sister.

150
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,260
She goes to school in Dongbang.

151
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,500
I don't know how she wound up in here.

152
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,580
But I came to the compound

153
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,780
partly to lay low from the cops,

154
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,980
and partly to find her.

155
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,620
Fo, that doesn't line up.

156
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,260
She didn't say Shisan
was hiding from the police.

157
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,500
Of course she doesn't know!

158
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,220
In our line of work,

159
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,580
who tells their family about anything?

160
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,540
Unlike you,

161
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,060
no common sense.

162
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,860
No wonder your numbers suck.

163
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,140
Keep talking while you still can.

164
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,460
Looking for your sister?

165
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,740
Why didn't you say so at the start?

166
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,420
It doesn't matter

167
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,860
how we got in.

168
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,500
The point is that both of us

169
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,540
are making contribution to the compound.

170
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,380
But look at him.

171
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,780
He's jealous of me

172
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,900
and picks on me again and again.

173
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,940
If he knew I had a sister,

174
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,740
who knows what he'd do.

175
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,700
Fo.

176
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,820
Please don't mind me for being blunt.

177
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,620
A team that focuses only on ranks
but not on harvest

178
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,500
won't go far.

179
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,300
So you want me

180
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,300
to kill Black Dong?

181
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,060
You're hilarious.

182
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,060
Nope.

183
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,020
Fo.

184
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,020
Let her go.

185
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,060
I don't want her in this line of work.

186
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,180
Let her go and I'll do whatever you ask.

187
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,260
I'll cover her numbers.

188
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,580
Please?

189
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,380
Sure.

190
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,140
Fo.

191
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,220
You actually believe him?

192
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,380
You've been here for so long

193
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,620
but haven't landed one big ticket.

194
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,580
Here's the deal.

195
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,020
Two days. Close a big deal.

196
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,140
If you pull it off,

197
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,620
I'll send your sister home.

198
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,460
How big?

199
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,420
Twenty million.

200
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,660
Heh. You're pricey, aren't you?

201
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,300
Fo.

202
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,700
Twenty million in two days.

203
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,820
That's not realistic.

204
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:43,780
Black Dong.

205
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,420
Brother.

206
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,820
You can say "no" again if you want.

207
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,460
Fo! Fo!

208
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,220
Fo!

209
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,460
Two days.

210
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,420
Twenty million.

211
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,740
I'll do it.

212
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,900
Please let her go.

213
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,820
That's more like it.

214
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,100
Siblings' love is so touching.

215
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,780
But if you can't make it,

216
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,460
you two can die together.

217
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,140
Black Dong.

218
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,100
Yes?

219
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,380
Send some guys back to the Mainland

220
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,900
to dig up Shisan's info.

221
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,220
Send his photo

222
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,060
to our people.

223
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,380
Find out what he really does.

224
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,020
Got it, Fo.

225
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,420
I'll see to it right away.

226
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:10,940
Shisan,

227
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,660
I heard about your sister.

228
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,500
It's twenty million, not twenty bucks.

229
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,380
No one in this place

230
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,700
has ever done that in two days.

231
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,140
Shisan.

232
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,700
Do something.

233
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,980
If you can't raise that much money,

234
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,740
Fo will take you and your sister...

235
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,060
Sang Tuo.

236
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,140
Do me a favor.

237
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,580
Shisan, here, what you asked for.

238
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,300
Took me forever

239
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,900
to beg Ba Sihai for this.

240
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,380
These are all the rich people,

241
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,660
millionaires, billionaires.

242
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,260
Time to show your real skills.

243
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,100
Got it.

244
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:11,980
Get back to your work.

245
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,500
Hai, look at him.

246
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,540
Under such pressure,

247
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
he remains calm.

248
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,940
He's got something.

249
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,140
If he pulls this through,

250
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,460
we must keep an eye on him.

251
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,860
Just in case he won't come at me

252
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,580
when he's promoted.
