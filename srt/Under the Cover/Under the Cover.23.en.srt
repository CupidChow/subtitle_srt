00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,380
[Episode 23]

3
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,220
Mr. An.

4
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,820
Mr. An, are you alright?

5
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,220
Mr. An.

6
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:58,620
Stay still.

7
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,780
They're still watching us.

8
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,100
Play along.

9
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,740
Get me to a hospital now.

10
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,980
Then spread the word

11
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,820
that I'm critically injured,

12
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,740
on the brink of death.

13
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,580
Understood.

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,180
Mr. An,

15
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,020
you're as bold as you are brilliant.

16
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,660
With this move,

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,660
Sang Tuo will believe
Mr. An is severely injured.

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,220
And he won't come after us for a while.

19
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,140
But I still think this was too risky.

20
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,060
What if the coordination failed...

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,980
It wouldn't.

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,340
My brother and Mr. An
have been partners for nearly a decade.

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,820
He's spent more time with Mr. An

24
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,420
than he has with me.

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,580
Your brother would surely
pick up on my cues.

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,100
Knowing him,

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,340
he'd rather die
than press the detonator otherwise.

28
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,340
But

29
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,380
Sang Tuo is ruthless.

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,180
Would he actually kill my brother?

31
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,380
Relax.

32
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,500
Your brother's sharp.

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,500
He'll be fine.

34
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,460
By the way,

35
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,340
I already gave the jade pendant

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,300
to your brother.

37
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,380
Sang Tuo's not likely
to suspect a thing.

38
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,100
That's great.

39
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,980
I just hope he discovers
the secret inside it.

40
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,340
Shisan,

41
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,580
look who I brought.

42
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,620
Shisan.

43
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,020
Xiong.

44
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,340
Sit.

45
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,300
Before Xiong's family went bankrupt,

46
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,740
they were in the jade trade.

47
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,740
Let him take a look.

48
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,780
Really?

49
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,060
They gave me this piece of jade
when I was on the island.

50
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,140
I don't know much about it.

51
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,100
Help me check it.

52
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,820
Sure.

53
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,860
Let me see.

54
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,940
Shisan,

55
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,500
who gave this to you?

56
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,260
Doesn't matter who.

57
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,300
Just tell me.

58
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,860
This jade is fake.

59
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,580
Look,

60
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,540
this is a seam.

61
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,540
Two jade pieces are fitted together.

62
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,340
But the craftsmanship is exceptional.

63
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,140
Only a seasoned expert,

64
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,580
with a high-powered flashlight
at the right angle,

65
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,140
could spot it.

66
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,180
Most people would never know.

67
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,780
This is strange.

68
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,980
Such high-end work
on low-grade material.

69
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,900
The labor cost alone
wouldn't justify it.

70
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,620
Dahn gave me fake jade?

71
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,340
Mr. Dahn gave this to you?

72
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,540
You didn't hear this from me.

73
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,060
I was never here.

74
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,820
Never saw any jade.

75
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,740
I've got patrol duty.

76
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,020
Shisan,

77
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,100
nice move.

78
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,580
Saved yourself some hush money too.

79
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,620
Two jade pieces are fitted together.

80
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,420
Shisan!

81
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,180
There's a whole hidden world inside it.

82
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,140
We need to find a way to read it.

83
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,740
Such a tiny chip.

84
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,420
We need a special interface

85
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,300
and a computer.

86
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,860
But we've got nothing.

87
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,340
What do we do now?

88
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,420
Shisan,

89
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,500
I'll figure something out.

90
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,900
You?

91
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,500
Sang Tuo framed Mr. Emmett.

92
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,340
That's why Mr. Emmett
is under investigation.

93
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,580
What's the point of saying all this now?

94
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,540
I hope you can help us

95
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,300
report to the mayor that Sang Tuo
is the mastermind

96
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,380
behind the compound.

97
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,500
Mr. An Fei,

98
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,700
you're a Chinese police officer.

99
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,300
Yet Sang Tuo has pushed you so far

100
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,660
that you have to disguise yourself
just to meet me.

101
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,580
And I, as the director general's wife,

102
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,260
am also being pressured
by them to the point

103
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,620
that I'm too afraid to step outside.

104
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,420
That's why

105
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,580
we can't let him keep running wild.

106
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,980
He has connections everywhere.

107
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,260
All the evidence has been tampered with.

108
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:49,900
Right now,

109
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,820
I just want my children
to grow up safely.

110
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,860
I don't want

111
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,540
to offend those people.

112
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,420
You bunch of losers!

113
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,740
Were you all raised in a pigsty?

114
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,540
Clean this mess up now!

115
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,420
Damn it!

116
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,460
Four-eyes,

117
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,180
you really don't treat your men right.

118
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,220
Nothing but instant noodles?

119
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,060
Business has been slow.

120
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,020
Just make do with this.

121
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,220
I knew you were craving something.

122
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,380
Look what I've got here.

123
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,780
Nice.

124
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,540
Guys!

125
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,420
Come on, take it.

126
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,180
Come on!

127
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,140
Dig in!

128
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,180
I brought you all some good food.

129
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,540
Great. Great.

130
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,620
It's still hot. Eat up.

131
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,180
You'll work better on a full stomach.

132
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,900
Here, chopsticks.

133
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,180
Share it among yourselves.

134
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,820
Alright.

135
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,780
Tastes good.

136
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,020
Rui.

137
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,380
You're serious?

138
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,780
I thought you were just bragging.

139
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,140
You bet.

140
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,420
Told you

141
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,540
I was a top student.

142
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,140
A cutting-edge tech talent.

143
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,940
Don't underestimate me.

144
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,260
Shisan,

145
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,900
your sister...

146
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,100
What about her?

147
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Anyone who can write code like this

148
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,140
is remarkable.

149
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,980
She's a pro.

150
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,940
The chip in this jade pendant

151
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,300
is a key to activate a Trojan program.

152
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,860
Previously, when she was forced

153
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,620
to develop scam programs
in the compound,

154
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,020
she secretly implanted

155
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,460
a Trojan in the black box.

156
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,620
But she was rescued

157
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,620
before she could finish it.

158
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,260
Now, what we need to do is

159
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,580
connect this chip to the black box.

160
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,660
Then we can activate the Trojan

161
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,620
and transfer all the data

162
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,060
from the black box.

163
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,700
So now we need to find a way

164
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,940
to connect to the black box.

165
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,740
Shisan, here's the plan.

166
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,420
You figure out a way
to draw Sang Tuo away.

167
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,180
I'll go implant the Trojan.

168
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,580
No, it's too dangerous.

169
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,380
I'll do it.

170
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,260
Shisan,

171
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,620
this isn't as simple
as just plugging it in.

172
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,740
You really can't handle it.

173
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,460
Any updates

174
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,420
on Mrs. Emmett?

175
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,860
Just a repairman came by yesterday.

176
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,780
Everything was normal.

177
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,780
She stayed at home

178
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,980
and didn't go to the mayor anymore.

179
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,460
We've scared her into submission.

180
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,940
Repairman?

181
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,220
What repairman?

182
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,300
Just a regular worker.

183
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,580
Her fridge broke down.

184
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,860
She made calls yesterday?

185
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,980
According to our phone surveillance,

186
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,140
no.

187
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,260
Then how did she call for a repairman?

188
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,620
Dig into it!

189
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,180
Come in!

190
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,380
Shisan?

191
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,540
I know my sister isn't with you.

192
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Come have a drink with me.

193
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,740
Let's talk.

194
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,340
Shisan.

195
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,100
How did you know

196
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,340
Xiaoxiao isn't with me?

197
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:35,780
Bottoms up.

198
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,660
Here.

199
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,780
What are you trying to say?

200
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,780
Turn yourself in.

201
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:23,820
Shisan,

202
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,780
is that all we have to talk about?

203
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,260
How old were you in 2017?

204
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,860
Twenty-two.

205
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,260
I was twenty-three that year.

206
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,020
I had just joined
the police force for half a year.

207
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,620
Once, I was sent to arrest a thief.

208
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,940
That thief was 17.

209
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,820
Skinny and short.

210
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,780
His eyes were frighteningly bright.

211
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,180
A repeat offender.

212
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,260
He'd been stealing
from the same supermarket

213
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,180
for a month

214
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,300
before he got caught.

215
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,180
Then he was really stupid.

216
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,980
To keep stealing
from the same place for a month.

217
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,940
By the time I arrived,
he'd already run to the rooftop.

218
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,980
Nowhere left to run.

219
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,060
He stood at the edge,

220
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,020
clutching the money he'd stolen.

221
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,140
He said he didn't want to be arrested.

222
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,300
Said he'd rather die than go to jail.

223
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
I tried to talk him down.

224
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,900
It took forever,

225
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,340
but he finally listened.

226
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,540
Then he loosened his grip,

227
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,500
and the money slipped.

228
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,220
He reached out to grab it.

229
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:45,980
And then?

230
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,140
He fell?

231
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,540
I caught him.

232
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,020
He was dangling in mid-air,
regretting it.

233
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,220
He begged me through tears,
saying he didn't want to die.

234
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,620
He asked me to save him.

235
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,740
People only feel real fear and regret

236
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,260
when death is staring them

237
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,540
in the face.

238
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,540
So what happened in the end?

239
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,580
You pulled him up?

240
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,460
When I lunged forward,

241
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,540
my arm got cut.

242
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,540
I couldn't hold onto him.

243
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,300
And he couldn't climb up.

244
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,340
Once the blood started dripping,

245
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,540
we both lost our grip.

246
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,420
For the next two or three years,
I kept dreaming of him.

247
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,460
In the dreams, he'd beg me to save him

248
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,980
and say he didn't want to die.

249
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,340
That wasn't him begging you.

250
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,940
Just you blaming yourself.

Han Xiaoxiao,
