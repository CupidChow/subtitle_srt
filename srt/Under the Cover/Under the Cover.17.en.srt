00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,380
[Episode 17]

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,100
Shisan.

4
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,700
How long are you going to stay silent?

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,260
Sang Tuo...

6
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,780
Your sister's on the sixth floor, right?

7
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,420
I guess you want this elevator keycard

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,700
to take your sister and Li Bailing out

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,980
the day after tomorrow, right?

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,940
So you already knew.

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,260
You can use this keycard
to go up to the sixth floor

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,020
and see whether you'll make it out.

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,060
What do you mean?

14
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,460
You can use the elevator
with the keycard.

15
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,060
But there are

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,740
127 security guards
throughout the building.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,780
They won't let you out
unless they see me, the leader

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,660
of the nude chat group.

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:13,820
Shisan.

20
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,300
Let me ask you now.

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,660
Am I wrong to be the group leader?

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,100
I knew about your sister this afternoon.

23
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,940
I arranged the best medicine
on the island for her.

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,060
Her fever has gone,

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,340
and she survived.

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,020
Shisan, let me ask you again.

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,300
Am I wrong to be the group leader?

28
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,740
I know you want to hijack the boat.

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,380
You came to me

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,940
to ask me to help you
take your sister out.

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,940
You have no other choice.

32
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,220
Ne Zha? Ba Sihai?

33
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,820
Among the three group leaders,

34
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,380
only I can help you.

35
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,620
Shisan.

36
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,660
I'll ask you one last time.

37
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,660
Am I actually wrong

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,700
to be the group leader?

39
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,580
You're wrong!

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,460
Sang Tuo.

41
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,620
I treat you as my own brother.

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,340
I said I would save you.

43
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,180
But I don't want you to be imprisoned
for ten years

44
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,340
longer than others or more
just because you are a group leader.

45
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,380
So whether I think you are wrong

46
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,020
has nothing to do
with whether you help me.

47
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,740
Shisan.

48
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,660
Ever since I was born,

49
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,100
you've been the first person

50
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,220
who cares whether I'd go to prison.

51
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,900
Actually, even if you hadn't come today,

52
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,660
I'd still help you.

53
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,820
But I'm telling you,

54
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,700
your plan to hijack the boat won't work.

55
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,540
Why?

56
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,260
I didn't know this
until I became a group leader

57
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,940
that the boat for fresh meat

58
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,180
won't always be moored at the dock.

59
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,500
Once it's checked without any problems,

60
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,420
they will drive it away.

61
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,300
It will be docking again
the night after tomorrow.

62
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,900
But only for a short time.

63
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,500
It will leave
right after it picks up Ba Sihai.

64
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,780
And the security on the shore
will guard strictly.

65
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,420
You alone,

66
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,180
with two girls?

67
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,460
That's impossible.

68
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,300
Does this boat

69
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,340
only wait for Ba Sihai?

70
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:24,900
Yes.

71
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,700
Only by luring Ba Sihai away

72
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,980
can you stall the boat.

73
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,900
By then, I'll try to help you

74
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,380
handle to guards on the shore,

75
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,020
so you'll have a chance.

76
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,100
Lure Ba Sihai away...

77
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,260
Now Tie Fo can easily kill us

78
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,820
if he wants to.

79
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,820
At this time,

80
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,940
we have to unite.

81
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,780
So you don't call me a wretch now?

82
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,220
I was just faking it in front of them.

83
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,780
Don't take it to heart.

84
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,780
I have an idea.

85
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,820
Ba Sihai and Ne Zha

86
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,300
may seem incompatible,

87
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,620
but Ba Sihai

88
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,300
has always coveted Ne Zha
for her beauty.

89
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,220
My plan

90
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,260
is to use Ne Zha

91
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,260
to stall Ba Sihai
from getting on the boat.

92
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,780
Zha.

93
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,700
You have worked hard to rebuild
the money laundering hubs.

94
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
I will make you
a beauty-enhancing lunch.

95
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,540
The night after tomorrow, Ba Sihai
will definitely take the bait.

96
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,420
I'll go to the dock
and deal with the men on the boat.

97
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,900
Sang Tuo.

98
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,340
Help me take Xiaoxiao and Li Bailing

99
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,300
to the dock.

100
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,900
OK.

101
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,620
What's up?

102
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,780
Do you feel sorry

103
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,140
and come to apologize?

104
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,860
Your apology isn't sincere.

105
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,780
What rubbish is this? Take it away.

106
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,780
What does this mean?

107
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,740
Someone asked me to give it to you.

108
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,100
Who?

109
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,060
Zha.

110
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,220
I'll get you your beauty-enhancing meal.

111
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,340
I was told not to say.

112
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,620
Baby, do you like it?

113
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,980
I like it.

114
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,500
I like it.

115
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,220
He looks all proper on the surface,

116
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,140
but he's so good at this.

117
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,340
Is it given

118
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,980
by the person
who wouldn't tell her identity

119
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,900
last time?

120
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,340
I can't tell you either.

121
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,560
[Tonight at 12, your office, no lights]

122
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,620
[Tonight at 12, my office, no lights]

123
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,540
Interesting.

124
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,260
I'll answer nature's call.

125
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,540
Quickly.

126
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,460
So troublesome.

127
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,740
Oh, the fancy tricks.

128
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,100
Hai.

129
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,140
Hai?

130
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,540
Who are you?

131
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,820
I saw you!

132
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:09,900
Come out!

133
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,580
I saw you. Come out now!

134
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,620
Don't shoot...

135
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,260
Throw your pistol!

136
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,380
Go! Sail the boat!

137
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,420
Okay...

138
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,820
We are almost there, Xiaoxiao.

139
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,860
Hold on.

140
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,420
Xiaoxiao.

141
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,820
Shisan.

142
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,340
Xiaoxiao.

143
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,300
Get on the boat first.

144
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,620
Come on.

145
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,780
Let's go.

146
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,380
Where is Sang Tuo?

147
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,580
He got us downstairs
and went back by himself.

148
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,780
He said he had something urgent.

149
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,140
Something urgent?

150
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,820
I'll show you some special care tonight.

151
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,740
Why did you come so late?

152
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,220
Speak!

153
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,100
You look all proper,

154
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,660
but you know all the tricks.

155
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,900
Then tonight,

156
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,900
let me

157
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,220
teach you well.

158
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,540
Shout!

159
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,300
Did you hear it clearly?

160
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,580
It's Ba Sihai and Zha?

161
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,780
I heard clearly.

162
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,260
It's them.

163
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,940
Louder!

164
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,100
Louder!

165
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,020
Louder!

166
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,900
The more you shout, the more I like it.

167
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,620
Shout!

168
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,900
Wretch, are you trying to kill me?

169
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,340
Ba Sihai?

170
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,740
Why did you stop?

171
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,940
Go on.

172
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,980
Fo, I didn't know it!

173
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Fo.

174
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,980
Fo, listen to me.

175
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,060
Shut up.

176
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,180
Fo...

177
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,540
No... She seduced me!

178
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,140
I...

179
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,100
Wait...

180
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,740
I didn't do anything. I came in,

181
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,820
and she just kept whipping me.

182
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,020
I...

183
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,020
Hai.

184
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,820
You worked for me over the years.

185
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,940
If you like her,

186
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,540
you could have told me.

187
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,300
It would be okay.

188
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,140
No.

189
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,020
I... I was wrong.

190
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,500
I was wrong, Fo.

191
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,620
I beg you.

192
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,100
I...

193
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,420
We are brothers.

194
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,820
If you want her, I'll give her to you.

195
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,900
No need to be so sneaky.

196
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,060
No, I don't...

197
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,580
What?

198
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,620
You don't want her now?

199
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,620
No...

200
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,860
I...

201
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,660
I...

202
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,540
Get up.

203
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,900
So be it.

204
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,740
Go back and rest early.

205
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,860
You have to work tomorrow.

206
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,500
What?

207
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,900
Are you not satisfied with the result?

208
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,780
No...

209
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,700
No, I mean...

210
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,980
I'm satisfied!

211
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,340
Thank you, Fo!

212
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,140
Thank you, Fo!

213
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,340
Bad news, Fo!

214
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,540
Shisan is missing.

215
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,740
