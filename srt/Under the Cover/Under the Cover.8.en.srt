00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,380
[Episode 8]

3
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,700
Shisan.

4
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:28,620
Hai.

5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,140
Shisan, my buddy.

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,780
Did you enjoy yourself last night?

7
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,580
Hai, you misunderstood.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,340
I was about to explain it to you.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,980
Well, no need to explain.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,220
I understand.

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,980
Why is it so lively here?

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,540
Now that Black Dong has lost,

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,540
he gets exasperated

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,540
and wants to make a scene.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,620
How about it, guys?

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,060
Great.

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,660
It feels great.

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,180
Great figure.

19
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,860
Are you curious?

20
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,180
You did it?

21
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,820
Shisan.

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,740
Don't tell me

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,140
you feel bad for her.

24
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,940
Black Dong.

25
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,340
Our gamble is over.

26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,060
What more do you want to do?

27
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,580
The game will never be over

28
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,980
until I win.

29
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,300
This chick

30
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,260
screwed my deal yesterday.

31
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,460
She has to pay with her life today.

32
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,900
Her life?

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,940
See?

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,780
Is it her?

35
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,740
It's her, right?

36
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,020
Do she looks like the one?

37
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,100
It's her.

38
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,700
It was posted
on the campus website this morning.

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,420
[Three hours ago]

40
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,740
It's her, look.

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,940
It's her.

42
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,620
How can she do that?

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,660
Shameless.

44
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,620
That's her.

45
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,580
So shameless.

46
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,180
Shush.

47
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,420
Yeah.

48
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,620
No one can tell by her innocent look.

49
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,740
Right.

50
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,180
She looks decent usually.

51
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,180
How can a girl do this?

52
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,580
Why are you so stupid?

53
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,940
No wonder you were scammed.

54
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,820
You deserve it.

55
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,980
You didn't live up to your mother.

56
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,460
Your mother is still in the hospital!

57
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,500
This girl

58
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,020
made quite a contrast.

59
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,180
You should reflect on yourself

60
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,220
for the reason why you got scammed.

61
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,180
Why did she die?

62
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,060
Go away!

63
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,060
All of you, go away!

64
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,500
Hu Pei jumped off the building!

65
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,340
I didn't want her to die.

66
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,380
But she chose to do so.

67
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,980
In the beginning,

68
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,100
I pretended to be her mother's doctor

69
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,500
and called her,

70
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,380
saying that her mother
was getting worse.

71
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,580
And later,

72
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,420
I pretended to be a hospital staff,

73
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,740
urging her to pay.

74
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,020
I asked for 15,000

75
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,900
and she believed it!

76
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,020
She spent all the previous donations

77
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,540
on the surgery.

78
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,380
And she had borrowed money

79
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,780
from all her relatives and friends.

80
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,220
She had nothing left.

81
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,500
What should she do?

82
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,180
Only I

83
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,420
was kind enough to lend her money.

84
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,020
There is always a price to pay
for borrowing money.

85
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,980
What did she have?

86
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,180
She had nothing!

87
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,300
She could only undress herself.

88
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,620
That's the only way!

89
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,660
In the beginning,

90
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,140
just like you, Shisan,

91
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,020
she pretended to be lofty.

92
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,180
I just said a word.

93
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,580
Guys, guess what I said.

94
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,220
- What was it, boss?
- What was it, boss?

95
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,420
I said,

96
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,140
"Your mother is dying."

97
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,620
So she undressed.

98
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,900
So she undressed!

99
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,460
Look at her.

100
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,860
What a loving daughter!

101
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,820
I didn't waste her video either.

102
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,220
I sold it to a loaner
for more than 100 grand.

103
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,780
It doesn't matter that she dies.

104
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,020
Her mother is still alive.

105
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,620
Her mother who's lying on a hospital bed

106
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,460
will have to pay instead.

107
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,460
Am I right, guys?

108
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,620
- Right!
- Right!

109
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,700
Sihai.

110
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,380
This is what you get for offending me.

111
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,860
Hit him!

112
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,060
Fo.

113
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,620
We are just doing business, right?

114
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,420
Black Dong got furious from losing

115
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,100
and killed someone indirectly!

116
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,140
Does it matter to you

117
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,740
whether there are deaths or not?

118
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,700
Shisan hit the group leader.

119
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,900
According to the rules,

120
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,300
his hands should be chopped.

121
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,540
Nonsense!

122
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,620
Shisan hit you

123
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,060
because you went too far.

124
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,620
We might be targeted
by the Chinese police.

125
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,580
Our business will be affected by then.

126
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,700
Rubbish!

127
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,260
Your group

128
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,340
keeps messing with me

129
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,260
and tricks me!

130
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,100
Get lost

131
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,860
with all your nonsense.

132
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,460
Believe it or not...

133
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,380
Are you done?

134
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,140
As group leaders,
you two quarrel like this.

135
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,580
Your noise ruined the peace
for the Buddha.

136
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,420
How is it proper?

137
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,300
Black Dong.

138
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,100
This business we're doing

139
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,620
aims for the money, not life.

140
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,660
Yes, Fo.

141
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,740
I got it.

142
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,620
Fo.

143
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,140
Hai.

144
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,100
Shisan is from your team.

145
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,420
Fo.

146
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,260
Sorry for not controlling him strictly.

147
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,340
You have to be punished, too.

148
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,660
As for the speech

149
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,980
about being targeted by the police...

150
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,780
Shisan taught you that, right?

151
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:00,940
Fo.

152
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,500
Shisan was indeed impulsive.

153
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,100
But

154
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,260
he's quite capable

155
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,380
and has great potential.

156
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,060
Since what he said makes sense,

157
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,540
I won't chop his hands.

158
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,580
But after all, he beat the group leader.

159
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,580
He should be punished.

160
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,660
From today on,

161
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,180
whoever goes against
the order of hierarchy

162
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,820
and despises their superiors

163
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,260
will be severely punished.

164
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,100
In this place,

165
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,460
I

166
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,780
have the say.

167
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,940
Han Chuan.

168
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,820
Han Chuan!

169
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,460
Exit the country?

170
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,700
Are you going to find Han Chuan?

171
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,580
Master.

172
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,260
Hu Pei's death

173
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,700
is the revenge and provocation

174
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,220
made by those criminals.

175
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,060
So?

176
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,540
So you're going to find Han Chuan?

177
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,260
Right.

178
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,500
Where are you going to find him?

179
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,660
Dongbang.

180
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,660
Dongbang is as vast
as two provinces of our country.

181
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,780
Alright.

182
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Even if you get there,

183
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,620
tell me how you will investigate.

184
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,940
We don't have
extraterritorial jurisdiction.

185
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,500
We have neither the location
of the scam group

186
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,300
nor the information
about their personnel.

187
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,940
Even so, we can search for those.

188
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,380
It's better than doing nothing.

189
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,620
Do you think I'm willing to do that?

190
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,620
What we can do now

191
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,180
is to wait for Han Chuan

192
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,700
to send further leads

193
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,660
and to find a way
to contact him directly.

194
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,540
Acting recklessly like this

195
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,740
will only make things worse!

196
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,940
An Fei.

197
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,300
You are a police officer.

198
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,100
Bear in mind your duties and discipline.

199
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,060
Master, I...

200
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,700
What?

201
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,420
The only thing you should do

202
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,540
is focus on your work.

203
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,740
Pay close attention to the leads
from Han Chuan

204
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,060
and try to collect

205
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,780
information about the scam group.

206
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,420
Clear?

207
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,100
Yes.

208
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,700
Report.

209
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,420
Mr. An, something's up.

210
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,380
Go ahead.

211
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,580
Hu Pei's mother committed suicide.

212
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,380
What?

213
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,500
Go and check it now.

214
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,140
Report to me from the scene in time.

215
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:07,860
Yes.

216
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,500
What's going on?

217
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,460
Somebody

218
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,780
sent her daughter's nude video to her.

219
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,140
It's so awful.

220
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,020
Shisan.

221
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,700
Shisan.

222
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,780
Fetch the towel...

223
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,100
Shisan.

224
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,300
Why don't we go back to the cafeteria?

225
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,460
What's wrong with cooking?

226
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,860
If you go on like this,

227
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,460
sooner or later, you'll lose your life.

228
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,340
Ba Sihai and Black Dong

229
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,580
can't be messed with, Shisan.

230
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,580
Rui.

231
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,340
I'll rest for a while.

232
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,860
I found Xiaoxiao.

233
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,140
She is not on the sixth floor?

234
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,460
She is not on the sixth floor.

235
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,540
Tie Fo attaches great importance
to the this department.

236
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,060
He arranged them
all on the seventh floor.

237
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,260
Xiaoxiao, wait for me.

238
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,700
I will take you out.

239
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:39,940
Biao.

240
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,260
Rui.

241
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,100
What brought Jian Biao here?

242
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,060
I have no idea.

243
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,860
Stop thinking of it.

244
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,140
Here, this is for you.

245
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,100
What is this?

246
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
As I analyze it,

247
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,740
Black Dong must have targeted
on Shisan this time.

248
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,700
It seems

249
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,820
that he will go tough
on Shisan this time.

250
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,660
Instead of being dealt with passively,

251
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,100
we might as well take action first.

252
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,820
- You want to poison him?
- Wait a moment.

253
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,580
This is the laxative.

254
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,900
Put it in his dishes

255
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,260
and teach him a lesson.

256
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,540
It won't kill him.

257
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,900
And he will know

258
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,220
that many people are targeting him here.

259
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,820
At least, he won't dare to be so bossy

260
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,060
and won't dare to act rashly anymore.

261
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,580
Are you sure it won't go wrong?

262
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,020
I will never harm Shisan.

263
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Not dealing with Black Dong
is what really harms him.

264
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,260
Dong, have something.

265
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:27,620
Dong.

266
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,580
Your favorite spicy beef.

267
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,180
Are you blind?

268
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,060
Look!

269
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,140
Check this out!

270
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,300
I can't eat it anymore.

271
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,060
Well...

272
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,260
Cut it out.

273
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,780
Get us something lighter.

274
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,260
OK.

275
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,980
We'll have it.

276
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,780
Enjoy.

277
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,060
Dong.

278
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,300
Where's my dish?

279
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
I thought I could make something

280
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,540
especially suitable for you.

281
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,100
But I don't have any beef
in the kitchen.

282
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,100
I have to take this, if you don't mind.

283
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,020
I guarantee it won't be spicy.

284
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:17,980
Go ahead.

285
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,220
Thank you, Dong.

286
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,620
Eat up.

287
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,740
Doctor, hurry up!

288
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,660
- What's going on?
- He's dying.

289
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,940
- Help!
- Dong.

290
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,460
Hurry.

291
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,420
Hurry up.

292
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,300
Don't worry, Dong.

293
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,100
Save me.

294
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,420
I'll measure your blood pressure first.

295
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,500
Doctor, he is dying. Hurry.

296
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,380
Check on him!

297
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:01,820
Doctor!

298
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,140
He is dying.

299
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,860
I'll kill him!

300
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,820
I'll kill him!

301
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,260
It doesn't matter

302
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,940
how you fight

303
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,020
for your grudges.

304
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,460
But

305
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,300
now that someone's dead,

306
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,260
this changes

307
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,620
everything.

308
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,580
Who did it?

309
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,380
If you turn yourself in,

310
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,900
I can reduce your punishment
at my discretion.

311
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,580
But if I find you out,

312
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,500
you'll have a miserable death.
