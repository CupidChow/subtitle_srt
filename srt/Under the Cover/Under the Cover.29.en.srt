13
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,220
Isn't this Sang?

14
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,660
You know him.

15
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,620
Why are you asking me?

16
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,260
Of course, I know him.

17
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,340
His name is Sang Tuo.

18
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,300
He's the mastermind behind this scam.

19
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,020
Impossible.

20
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,060
He told me.

21
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,300
He's innocent.

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:44,860
Did he contact you

23
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,700
before you came here?

24
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,540
You already know the answer!

25
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,300
All these years, it must have been hard

26
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,820
for you searching for your child.

27
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,340
I understand how you feel now.

28

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,740
No way!

39
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,700
He used AI

40
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,140
to deepfake my face in those videos!

41
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,580
I've been at the station every day.

42
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,540

61

we dismantled his overseas scam hub,

But if you kill her today,

76
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,820
what will happen to Chenchen?

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,660
What if he comes back

78
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,540
only to find his father is a murderer?

79
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,340
Will he be bullied and shunned

80

at school?

81
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,580
Will his life be ruined

82
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,540
by having a murderer for a father?

83
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,540
Haven't you thought about that?

84
