1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:08,541
<i>Your son shoplifted from my store.</i>

2
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,676
That is,

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,778
<i>if you show me your sincerity.</i>

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,846
<i>Manager.</i>

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,385
Twenty-three years ago,
within this jurisdiction,

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,854
there was a robbery
of an armored cash transport vehicle

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,723
belonging to the Mitsuba branch
of the Yamato Trust Bank.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,793
The culprit, Nobukazu Oshima,

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,328
stole 30 million yen in cash

10
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,331
<i>and fled to a forest five kilometers away.</i>

11
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,966
He had an encounter with Officer Kiyohara.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,901
<i>There,</i>

13
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:39,272
<i>he and Officer Kiyohara shot each other,</i>
<i>and both died.</i>

14
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,875
It's believed that Oshima's accomplice

15
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,478
took the 30 million yen
and Officer Kiyohara's gun,

16
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,980
but the 30 million yen and the gun

17
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:50,884
were never found
and their whereabouts are still unknown.

18
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,787
<i>We thought we had</i>

19
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:58,091
<i>hidden that gun away with the crime</i>
<i>that the four of us committed</i>

20
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,759
<i>when we were in elementary school.</i>

21
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:01,461
<i>But…</i>

22
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,998
<i>The gun that was lost 23 years ago</i>

23
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,733
<i>was used in the recent incident,</i>

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,668
<i>which is a very serious matter.</i>

25
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:20,346
<i>That gun brought forth our reunion.</i>

26
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,304
There are 14 security cameras installed
throughout the store,

27
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,073
and all of the footage is recorded here.

28
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,876
Where is the recorded footage stored?

29
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,845
In the computer over here.

30
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,586
Please show me the footage
from January 16th.

31
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,854
January 16th.

32
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,555
Here it is.

33
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,494
Detective Tobina,
what is camera number 14 filming?

34
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,767
Inside the store from the back.

35
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,803
It's the snack aisle.

36
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,304
Just as I thought.

37
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:23,443
Friday's footage from camera number 14
is the only one that's missing.

38
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,480
I wonder if the footage

39
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,850
contained something
that was inconvenient for someone?

40
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,888
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto

41
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,124
is clearly lying.

42
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,662
May I see the footage from January 17th?

43
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,796
Yes, ma'am.

44
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,133
Footage from camera 14 is here.

45
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,448
Ms. Nara, why do you say
that Ms. Makiko Iwamoto is lying?

46
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,084
She said that on Friday,
the day before the incident,

47
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:09,322
she came to this supermarket
to give her son his wallet.

48
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,959
My son called me
to say he had lost his wallet,

49
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,861
so I went to give him some money.

50
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,330
Your son called you on his smartphone?

51
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,033
No, he doesn't have a smartphone.

52
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,735
<i>How did her son,</i>
<i>who doesn't own a smartphone,</i>

53
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,804
manage to contact her?

54
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,439
A payphone?

55
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,041
Where's the payphone?

56
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,843
There are no payphones in this supermarket
or anywhere nearby,

57
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,681
and besides, how can he make a call
at a payphone without his wallet or money?

58
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,015
You're right.

59
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,357
He might have used the landline here
at the supermarket.

60
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,127
I'll request the call records.

61
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,464
No need to request it.

62
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,468
The call records should be arriving soon.

63
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,271
Ms. Nara, we received the phone call
records from the supermarket.

64
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,906
Please hand them to Detective Tobina.

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,742
Yes.

66
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:17,991
Come in.

67
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,729
There's a record of a call from the office
at Smile Sakuma to Ms. Iwamoto's salon.

68
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,497
Here it is.

69
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,966
- Is that right?
- Yes.

70
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,403
That doesn’t necessarily mean
that her son was the caller.

71
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,840
Right.

72
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:43,983
Hello?

73
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,852
<i>Makiko?</i>

74
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,521
- Junichi?
- Yeah.

75
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,857
What's up?

76
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,693
Um…

77
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,861
Oh,

78
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,197
am I being called to the station again?

79
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:00,967
No.

80
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,369
Can we talk privately?

81
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,806
When?

82
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,009
Today, if possible?

83
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,712
Okay.

84
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,616
Come to my shop. I’m available all day.

85
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,425
<i>I want to talk about the day</i>
<i>before the incident.</i>

86
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,061
Sure. Friday?

87
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,329
Yeah.

88
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:33,399
You said you went to the supermarket
after getting a call from your son.

89
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,201
Yeah.

90
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,839
Do you know where your son called from?

91
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,710
From the supermarket, I guess.

92
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:44,877
Which phone did he use?

93
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,981
I don't know exactly where,

94
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,617
but probably a phone
in the store's office or something.

95
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,952
Not a payphone?

96
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,424
He couldn’t have used a payphone
since he didn’t have his wallet.

97
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,827
Right.

98
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,065
Wait, am I a suspect?

99
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,735
No.

100
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:10,837
It’s not like that.

101
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,605
But you’re here as a detective, right?

102
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,845
There’s no need for you to worry.

103
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,580
It's all good.

104
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,816
Oh really?

105
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,251
Sorry to take up your time.

106
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,888
Since you’re already here,

107
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,990
I’ll cut your hair.

108
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,526
- Now?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,395
But I’m on duty.

110
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,663
No one would even notice.

111
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,832
They will if I return
with a cleanly trimmed hairstyle.

112
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,301
I won't give you
a cleanly trimmed hairstyle.

113
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,270
I’ll give you a really unique,
and edgy hairstyle.

114
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,839
That’ll be even more obvious.

115
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,541
Junichi,

116
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,244
you’re my childhood friend,
so I’ll only charge you 100,000 yen.

117
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,745
That's too expensive.

118
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,646
100,000 is insane.

119
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,715
It's only natural to help each other out.

120
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,017
- We're childhood friends after all.
- You're serious?

121
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,821
I sometimes cut Naoto’s hair too.

122
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,357
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

123
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,127
He brings me cake every time he comes.

124
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,430
Mont Blanc?

125
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,265
What?

126
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,301
You remember that I like Mont Blanc?

127
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,970
Yeah…

128
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,641
It came to me just now.

129
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,812
Then do you remember <i>that</i> as well?

130
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:27,814
<i>That?</i>

131
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,250
When you tried to kiss me.

132
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,586
Have you kissed anyone before?

133
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,488
What?

134
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,135
By the way,

135
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,804
I haven’t cut Keisuke’s hair

136
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,107
since we divorced four years ago.

137
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,612
Oh, it's not like we broke up
because we hated each other or anything.

138
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,746
I see.

139
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,749
We moved to my current house
after we got married.

140
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:08,187
Keisuke was working
at an architectural firm in Yokohama,

141
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:13,025
but he started a new firm in Tokyo
with a senior colleague.

142
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,163
He got so busy that he wasn’t able
to come back here very often,

143
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,234
so he suggested that we move to Tokyo.

144
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:25,404
He said we could sell the current house,
buy an apartment in Tokyo,

145
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,406
and find a tenant for this shop.

146
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,545
But I had regular clients here,

147
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,415
and there was also the matter of Masaki.

148
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,719
Ever since elementary school,

149
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,122
he set his sights
on Hamadai Middle School in Yokohama,

150
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,525
and he’d been attending cram school too.

151
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,262
In the end,
neither of us would compromise,

152
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,498
and couldn't reach an agreement,

153
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,900
so we decided to divorce.

154
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,173
I see.

155
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,309
What about you, Junichi?

156
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,478
Are you married?

157
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,483
- No.
- You have a girlfriend?

158
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:12,852
Yeah.

159
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,821
You do, huh?

160
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,892
Hey, can the four of us
get together sometime?

161
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,895
- You're changing the subject.
- That’s not it.

162
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,330
I want the four of us to get together.

163
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,567
Sounds good. When?

164
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,734
Tomorrow.

165
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,771
That’s short notice.

166
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,074
Naoto's older brother's wake is tomorrow.

167
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,911
I'm planning to go,
but what about you, Makiko?

168
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,415
That’s tomorrow, huh?

169
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,416
Yeah.

170
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,217
Apparently it's a quiet event
for just family members.

171
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,088
I see.

172
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,894
Let’s all go.

173
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,568
Can you tell Keisuke too?

174
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,438
Okay.

175
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,343
Come get a haircut again any time.

176
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,078
Okay.

177
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,183
- Then see you tomorrow.
- Okay, see you.

178
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,351
Bye.

179
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,304
You're back early.

180
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,272
What's the matter?

181
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,441
Hey there.

182
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,143
Welcome home.

183
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,946
I have to leave right away.

184
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,481
I just came to get a change of clothes.

185
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,715
What?

186
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,385
Tomorrow, I have a meeting
and a wake in Mitsuba,

187
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,121
so I'll be staying there starting tonight.

188
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,860
It’s for work, right?

189
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,365
You've been going to Mitsuba a lot lately

190
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,301
and of course, I know it's for work, but…

191
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,341
Are you worried about Makiko and me?

192
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:23,983
The only time Makiko and I meet up
is when it concerns our son Masaki.

193
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,085
Yeah.

194
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,097
Sorry for making you worry.

195
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,535
How are you feeling?

196
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,438
I'm okay.

197
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,074
This little one is kicking a lot.

198
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,178
It’s a healthy baby.

199
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,632
<i>Junichi came to confirm my story.</i>

200
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,901
You were able to handle it?

201
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,369
Yeah.

202
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,074
If the lie is going to be exposed
later on anyway,

203
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,512
should we tell Junichi
about the shoplifting?

204
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,048
We've already discussed this.

205
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:33,052
We have to avoid anything that would
hinder Masaki's school acceptance.

206
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,956
Besides, if we talk about the shoplifting,
we'll have to lie about the threats too.

207
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,162
Okay.

208
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,766
We won't tell Junichi about
the shoplifting or anything else.

209
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,405
I need to tell Naoto

210
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,676
to go along with our story too.

211
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,760
How’s Masaki?

212
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:21,834
I haven't been able to
get an explanation of why he shoplifted.

213
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,737
Actually,

214
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,106
I talked to Masaki about that already.

215
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,941
What?

216
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,610
He seemed to be in shock
because the person

217
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,846
who caught him shoplifting was murdered.

218
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,917
He told you why he shoplifted?

219
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,018
Yeah.

220
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,554
Apparently he got in a fight
with Hisashi Machida.

221
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,521
Why?

222
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,559
My best friend called me a nerd.

223
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,394
Hisashi called you that?

224
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,097
He called me a clueless nerd.

225
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,098
I see.

226
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,469
So I tried to prove to him
that I'm not a nerd.

227
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,605
He shoplifted for something like that?

228
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,208
Don't say things like that
and corner Masaki, okay?

229
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,310
This is a sensitive topic for guys.

230
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,712
- So it’s my fault?
- What?

231
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,349
Because I made him study hard,
to get him into Hamadai Middle School?

232
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,484
I’m not saying that.

233
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,386
You’re doing a really good job
with Masaki.

234
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,257
If anyone is to blame, it's me.

235
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,660
I hadn't been seeing Masaki
because of work.

236
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,769
Then

237
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:36,408
do you want to make today
your once-a-month visit?

238
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,716
<i>Sorry about what I said today.</i>

239
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,392
Sorry, I have to finish up some work.

240
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,163
Okay.

241
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,433
Here. Let's eat.

242
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,302
Thank you.

243
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,570
Why don't we

244
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,705
go somewhere together next time?

245
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,042
Like an amusement park.

246
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,078
- No thanks.
- Really?

247
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,481
Is it too embarrassing
to hang out with your mom now?

248
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,882
Of course.

249
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,085
That's how it is, huh?

250
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,522
I guess that's only natural.

251
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,596
So, the gun

252
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,300
is in the possession
of the person who killed Sakuma, right?

253
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,871
- If the culprit didn't get rid of it yet.
- You're right.

254
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,874
Wouldn't it be difficult
to keep something like that hidden?

255
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,542
After all, it's a gun.

256
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,278
Where would you even hide it?

257
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,149
Oh man, I have absolutely no idea.

258
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:55,454
If the person who took
Officer Kiyohara's gun 23 years ago

259
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,825
is the same person who committed
this recent crime,

260
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,094
it means the culprit was hiding it
all this time, right?

261
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,067
If it’s not the same culprit, how did
the gun come to that person's possession?

262
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,007
Ms. Nara.

263
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,578
I'm going to Hideyuki Sakuma's
wake tomorrow night.

264
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,381
I might be able to get some clues.

265
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,049
Maybe I’ll go too.

266
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,150
What?

267
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,020
Actually, never mind.

268
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,122
We’ll attract too much attention.

269
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,327
Will your former classmates
be attending the wake too?

270
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,763
I'm not sure.

271
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,798
Is that right?

272
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,067
Yes.

273
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,237
Oh,

274
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,107
if you bump into Ms. Makiko Iwamoto,

275
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,708
try to get more information from her.

276
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,445
About the lie she told.

277
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,617
A mother went to the supermarket
to pick up her son.

278
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,521
The security footage from that day
of the snack aisle is missing.

279
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,225
Aside from returning a forgotten wallet,

280
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,061
you can probably think of another reason

281
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:12,064
why a mother would go
to the supermarket, right?

282
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,101
I'm sure I don't need
to spell it out for you. I'll be off now.

283
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,437
Oh.

284
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,006
Detective Tobina.

285
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,209
This part of your hair is nicely trimmed.

286
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,524
About the lie she told…

287
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,026
Aside from returning a forgotten wallet,

288
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,762
you can probably
think of another reason, right?

289
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,068
You were here?

290
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,103
Welcome back.

291
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:52,838
Thanks.

292
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,391
What's the matter?

293
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,074
You tried to kiss me.

294
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,881
What are you cooking?

295
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,286
I haven't decided yet.

296
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,056
Maybe I'll make soup.

297
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,459
Okay.

298
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,994
<i>Is work tough?</i>

299
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,797
No,

300
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,766
I just had it too easy until now.

301
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,102
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

302
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,842
You know the recent murder case?

303
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,578
The victim…

304
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,720
is the older brother of one of
my elementary school classmates.

305
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,122
Wow.

306
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,859
So you reunited with your classmate

307
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:25,631
as a detective
and a victim's family member?

308
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:26,598
Yeah.

309
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,668
- For the first time in 23 years.
- Wow.

310
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,803
What a strange coincidence.

311
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,875
Maybe the classmate is the suspicious one.

312
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,416
- Maybe I'll have beer after all.
- Yeah.

313
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:47,986
I know.

314
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,989
I won't tell Junichi

315
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,659
about Masaki's shoplifting incident.

316
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,761
I'm sure they won't ask you about it,

317
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,631
but if they do, you'll have to lie,
and I'm sorry about that.

318
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,669
I should be the one
apologizing to you instead.

319
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,804
What?

320
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,040
My brother blackmailed you…

321
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,810
But I was on a business trip abroad,

322
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,746
and I had left my smartphone in Japan,

323
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,749
so I couldn't do anything to help you
at a time like that.

324
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,319
Stop that.

325
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,655
You always have my back.

326
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,463
I'm sure you didn't want to come
to my brother's wake.

327
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,566
Nobody is saying it out loud,

328
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:38,270
but everyone in the family
is more relieved than sad that he's gone.

329
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:45,177
My mother is not related to my brother
by blood so it's understandable,

330
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,046
but even my father is relieved.

331
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,884
- Keisuke.
- Hey.

332
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,219
Keisuke is here.

333
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,025
Junichi too.

334
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,010
<i>Express your emotions</i>

335
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,811
<i>Give the reward</i>

336
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,179
<i>To myself</i>

337
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,815
<i>Face myself, make no mistake</i>

338
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,652
<i>That's how I overcame it all</i>

339
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,788
Yes! I'm really cool! I'm so cool!

340
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,992
I'm on a roll! I'm always…

341
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,828
You're still here?

342
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,402
Oh,

343
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,904
where's Mr. Tobina?

344
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,842
I'm sure he's at a reunion.

345
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,111
What?

346
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,784
I wonder where the gun went.

347
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,320
Yes.

348
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,657
I've been thinking about that too!

349
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,628
If the late Officer Kiyohara knew

350
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,431
that his gun would be used years later
to commit murder,

351
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,399
he wouldn't be able to die in peace.

352
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,504
The civilian who was killed
by a stray bullet at the bank

353
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,307
is the one who can't rest in peace,
don't you think?

354
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,850
Are you okay?

355
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,623
Yes…

356
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,560
You're right.

357
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:47,599
Thank you for coming today. Please drink.

358
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,034
Thank you.

359
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,171
Who would've thought
the four of us would meet again?

360
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:56,942
Let's make a toast.

361
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,578
A toast doesn't feel right.

362
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,346
It's a wake after all.

363
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,948
Don't worry about that.

364
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,317
He was a good-for-nothing brother.

365
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,855
Will I become a suspect if I say that
in front of the detective?

366
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,824
I knew he was a lousy older brother
ever since we were kids.

367
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,396
Maki, you'll drink beer, right?

368
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,630
Thanks.

369
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,499
I can't, I'm driving.

370
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,500
Okay.

371
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,168
I'm okay too.

372
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,269
All right.

373
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,479
Let's make a toast
without saying "cheers."

374
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,148
Then,

375
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,117
let's toast to our reunion.

376
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,630
The three of us met from time to time,

377
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,700
but we haven't seen Junichi
ever since we graduated.

378
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,436
Although I saw him once in passing.

379
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,871
- What?
- You saw me?

380
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,707
I haven't heard about this.

381
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,643
Where? When?

382
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,311
He's like a detective interrogating me.

383
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,947
He <i>is</i> a detective.

384
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,516
When I saw him,
he was still a police officer.

385
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,819
I think we were about 20.
I was still in university.

386
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,420
I was in Yokohama around then.

387
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,354
Yeah.

388
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,491
My friends and I left a pub in Yokohama,
and there was a fight going on outside.

389
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,426
<i>And a crowd of onlookers had gathered.</i>

390
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,330
Kiyohara, let's go to the after party.

391
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,598
I'm not sure.

392
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,301
Come on, let's go!

393
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,102
- Why not?
- Make way!

394
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,271
Make way, please.

395
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:34,773
Make way, please. Excuse me.

396
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,408
Watch out!

397
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,410
Calm down. Tell us what happened.

398
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,412
What happened? Calm down.

399
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,214
Don't get violent with me.

400
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,348
Don't get violent with me.

401
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:45,917
You can't get violent.

402
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,286
Just calm down.

403
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,187
‪Shut up!

404
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,957
Stop it. Keep your hands to yourself.

405
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,862
You gotta keep your hands to yourself.

406
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,431
<i>How cool!</i>

407
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,366
I can imagine Junichi doing that.

408
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,070
- Why didn't you come talk to me?
- I couldn't.

409
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,172
Oh right, I was on duty.

410
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,473
It's not just that.

411
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,677
I didn't want you to know that I was
going to mixers to escape boredom.

412
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,347
What's up with that?

413
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,449
Keisuke has always been like that.

414
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:23,421
But Keisuke's dad would've been so happy

415
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,857
if he knew that you became a detective.

416
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,393
After all,

417
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,563
you carried on his legacy.

418
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,598
Not at all.

419
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,467
I could never carry on his legacy.

420
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,372
- Good morning.
- Morning.

421
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:55,787
I grew up without a dad,
so I got so attached to Keisuke's pops.

422
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,322
Pops?

423
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,758
- He always called him that, huh?
- Yeah.

424
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,860
I called him "Dad,"

425
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,863
but he called him "Pops."
Even though he was my dad.

426
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,131
Pops.

427
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,300
Sorry…

428
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,936
He called him Pops!

429
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,637
What is it, Junichi?

430
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:16,575
Kendo was so much fun.

431
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:20,078
Do you remember
the team competition in sixth grade?

432
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,581
How could we ever forget that?

433
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,215
Naoto cried because he lost his match.

434
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,350
Yeah.

435
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,718
So I had no choice but to win.

436
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,621
At that moment,
Maki was a goddess in my eyes.

437
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,289
<i>You were so cool.</i>

438
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,059
<i>I knew that if I won my match,</i>
<i>our team would win.</i>

439
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,962
Yeah, since Keisuke and Junichi
were up next after Maki.

440
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,630
So there was no way we'd lose.

441
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,603
MITSUBA CITY KENDO CHAMPIONSHIP

442
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,406
- All right!
- Match!

443
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,842
- Hooray!
- You did it!

444
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,777
Come back here!

445
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,312
I'm so sorry.

446
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,216
Keisuke, come back here now.
You too, Junichi!

447
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,953
He got so mad at us for that.

448
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,456
- Junichi!
<i>- Yeah,</i>

449
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,524
because we were in the middle
of a competition.

450
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,060
Of course Pops would get mad.

451
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,528
- He's calling him Pops again.
- Pops.

452
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,399
Sorry.

453
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:21,106
That thing we always did after practice
was fun too, huh?

454
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,207
Oh, that cafe?

455
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,975
What was it called?

456
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,343
- Saboten.
- Yeah!

457
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,380
There was a broken arcade machine
that we played endlessly with one coin.

458
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:29,547
Yeah, I remember that.

459
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,416
Is that cafe still in business?

460
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,318
Do you know, Naoto?

461
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,586
I'm not sure.

462
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,789
- Is the owner still alive? He was old.
- He was only like 50 back then.

463
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,491
But he was so unfriendly.

464
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,661
- Yeah, he sure was.
- Let's go see if it's still there.

465
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,396
- What?
- What?

466
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:55,206
His finger was totally inside the cup.

467
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,709
‪His outfit hasn't changed at all.

468
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,044
He hasn't changed at all.

469
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,578
He's the same as 20 years ago.

470
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,080
He looks exactly the same.

471
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,715
Yeah, he's still in shape.

472
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,316
Whoa, look at this!

473
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,618
- I remember this!
- Yeah me too!

474
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,687
How nostalgic!

475
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,422
I got the lucky one.

476
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,491
I bet the price hasn't changed either.

477
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,560
- Never mind, it has.
- It changed.

478
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,561
That's only natural.

479
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,564
- The price went up.
- Understandable.

480
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:20,665
What should we order?

481
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,768
We've got to order our usual combo set.

482
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,171
- Yeah.
- Both the drink and the entree?

483
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,872
- Of course!
- Of course!

484
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,241
It's so much food.

485
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,714
Speaking of which, Naoto, you always
took the cherry pits home with you,

486
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,615
didn't you?

487
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,918
Yeah, he did.

488
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,721
You planted them, right?
What happened to them?

489
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,656
Um…

490
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,525
He didn't plant them.

491
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:48,426
Why?

492
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:52,130
Naoto took back the seeds and the stem,
and what he wanted was the stem.

493
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,699
- The stem?
- Yeah.

494
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,238
What are you guys laughing about?

495
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,807
I told Naoto that if he could tie the stem

496
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,410
into a knot with his tongue,
he'd become a good kisser.

497
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,481
You told him that?

498
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,153
Let's do it.

499
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,891
Okay, give it a try.

500
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,560
<i>Seriously?</i>

501
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:23,995
You guys are idiots.

502
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:27,766
- You practiced with the stems?
- I tried so hard to tie a knot.

503
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:31,102
- I didn't think he'd really do it.
- No way, you knew he'd do it.

504
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:32,537
Yeah.

505
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,806
You're horrible.

506
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:36,641
Oh.

507
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,675
Really?

508
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,645
- He did it.
- What?

509
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,546
Are you serious?

510
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,647
You tied it with your hands.

511
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,883
No he didn't use his hands.
He's an amazing kisser now.

512
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,886
- He's a really good kisser now.
- Ew!

513
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,090
Thank you very much.

514
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,825
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

515
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,829
We used to come here a lot

516
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,198
- when we were young.
- Yes.

517
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,472
Kendo, right?

518
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,409
- What?
- You remember us?

519
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,211
What?

520
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,584
- Wait!
- No way!

521
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,785
Look at this!

522
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,421
- Wow! No way!
- This is so nostalgic.

523
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,256
Ready,

524
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,058
say cheese.

MITSUBA CITY KENDO CHAMPIONSHIP

526
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,797
The Naoto we grew up with

527
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,768
is now the next president
of the Sakuma Land Development Group.

528
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,404
Not that I do anything special.

529
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,039
Hey Naoto,

530
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,876
you're building a big facility on the site
of our old elementary school, right?

531
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:45,844
Yeah.

532
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,046
Keisuke is in charge of the design.

533
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,682
- I see.
- Yeah, it's a big project.

534
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,317
Thank you, future President.

535
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:53,918
Stop that.

536
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,520
It's all thanks to the future President?

537
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,388
You too, Maki?

538
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,492
Keisuke's company
won the rights, fair and square.

539
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,965
But why a shopping mall
and a community center all of a sudden?

540
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,168
The gymnasium was used
for a day care center up until now, right?

541
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:15,940
Well, the building had to be demolished
because it was old and dilapidated.

542
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,709
Construction will start soon.

543
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:18,910
What will happen to <i>that</i>?

544
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,446
The protesters?

545
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,580
No…

546
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,084
Our time capsule.

547
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,824
Let's go there right now.

548
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:34,993
What?

549
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,194
Let's open it…

550
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,730
The time capsule.

551
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:41,633
Are you serious?

552
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,068
- Why open it?
- The gun…

553
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,573
Junichi, you're okay with it
since you're a detective?

554
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,874
No way,

555
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,676
in fact it'll be even worse for you.

556
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,813
We hid the gun that caused such
a stir back then. If that gets out…

557
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,215
Let's go.

558
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:02,921
Let's go.

559
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,194
Junichi never changes.

560
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,765
Yeah.

561
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,968
Just a little further.

562
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,336
- Where is it?
- A little further.

563
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,204
- Junichi.
- What?

564
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,272
Let's go this way.

565
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,908
- This way?
- Yeah.

566
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,077
It's closer that way.

567
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,812
No, this way is closer.

568
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,147
Just choose which way is best.

569
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:30,982
Let's split into two groups.

570
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,951
Only Keisuke and I know the route.

571
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,187
- Which way do you want to go, Maki?
- Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

572
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,956
Rock, paper, scissors.

573
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,290
Rock, paper, scissors.

574
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,692
- I got paper.
- Me too.

575
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:41,793
You and me, Naoto.

576
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:42,694
All right, let's go!

577
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,629
What? Wait for me.

578
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,330
Come on.

579
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,331
- Hurry up, Naoto.
- Wait.

580
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,265
- Naoto.
- Sorry.

581
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,399
Come on, Naoto.

582
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,300
Hurry up.

583
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:51,703
‪Wow.

584
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:18,830
Let's go.

585
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:31,676
- You okay?
- Yeah.

586
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,618
Keisuke. What's wrong?

587
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,154
I don't know…

588
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,992
But I heard

589
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,095
a gunshot nearby.

590
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,665
Wait…

591
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,436
- Where's Naoto?
- He's behind me.

592
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,205
Where's Naoto?

593
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,240
What?

594
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,310
NO TRESPASSING

595
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,246
- Naoto!
- Naoto!

596
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,415
Naoto!

597
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,749
- I'll go look for him.
- Naoto!

598
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,117
I'll go too.

599
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,890
Maki, head back.

600
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,658
Call the police.

601
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:22,894
By myself?

602
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,267
I'll look for Naoto.
Keisuke, you should go with her.

603
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:31,869
What?

604
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,072
Take care of Makiko.

605
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,177
Okay.

606
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,214
- Naoto!
- Makiko.

607
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,850
Let's go, Makiko.

608
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,518
Come on, Makiko.

609
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,388
Naoto.

610
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,523
Naoto.

611
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,795
Naoto.

612
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,998
Naoto.

613
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,805
What's the matter? Are you okay?

614
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,976
Can you walk over there?

615
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,245
It's okay.

616
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:15,947
Take your time.

617
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:18,850
It's okay.

618
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,519
That's good.

619
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:25,456
It's okay.

620
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,127
Sit here.

621
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,331
Are you okay?

622
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,100
Yeah.

623
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,304
I'll go check things out.

624
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:42,640
You stay here.

625
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,709
No, I'll go with you.

626
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,478
It's all right.

627
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,505
Junichi and Naoto are…

628
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,808
Let's hurry and call the police.

629
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,545
We're going to run away?

630
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,848
We're doing this
to save Junichi and Naoto.

631
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,654
Then go by yourself, Keisuke.

632
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,290
Hurry!

633
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,608
- Are you okay?
- Naoto.

634
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:52,843
Are you okay?

635
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:54,712
Where's Junichi?

636
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:58,916
Where's Junichi?

637
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:12,930
Junichi!

638
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,001
- Is everything all right?
- Junichi.

639
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,871
- What's wrong?
- Where's the police?

640
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,407
- Well…
- Call them right now.

641
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,209
What happened?

642
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:27,912
You shouldn't go over there.

643
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:35,920
Don't go.

644
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,356
Don't go.

645
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,159
Junichi.

646
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,528
Your pants are wet.

647
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:20,898
Dad!

648
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,468
Dad!

649
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,516
I'll be leaving now! Bye!

650
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:40,584
Detective Ito!

651
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:50,761
I'm Nagai.

652
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,464
Have you known Detective Tobina for long?

653
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,369
I've known him ever since
he came here two months ago.

654
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:02,173
In other words,
Detective Tobina came here,

655
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:06,711
and shortly after,
the latest incident occurred?

656
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,280
Yes, I guess so.

657
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,150
I see.

658
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:21,158
Dad!

659
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,060
Dad!

660
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,362
No!

661
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:25,963
Dad!

662
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,500
- No!
- Dad!

663
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,170
- No!
- Dad!

664
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,772
When I got here,

665
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,941
it was too late.

666
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,946
There's another dead person over there.

667
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,015
I think it's the bank robber.

668
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,023
My dad

669
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,726
took him down?

670
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,834
I think so.

671
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,091
Keisuke.

672
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,463
- Keisuke.
- What are you doing?

673
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,102
Keisuke!

674
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,748
Keisuke!

675
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:22,146
Will this really be all right?

676
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,648
The detective is telling us to dig it up.

677
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,351
But even if it's Junichi
telling us to do so,

678
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,255
why do we need to dig it up
after all this time?

679
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,623
No one else is around, right?

680
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,102
What I'm about to tell you
is confidential information.

681
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,309
I'm telling you this because
we are involved in this case,

682
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,578
but I need you to keep this a secret.

683
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,917
- What is it all of a sudden?
- You have to keep this between us.

684
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,420
Promise me.

685
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,127
Okay.

686
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,998
I promise.

687
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,767
I promise too.

688
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,105
Naoto's older brother,

689
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,341
Hideyuki Sakuma, was found dead…

690
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,445
in the office

691
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,048
above Smile Sakuma.

692
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,289
The estimated time of death
is 10:00 p.m. on Saturday night.

693
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,760
The owner of the hardware store next door
heard what sounded like a gunshot.

694
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,170
The bullet extracted from the body
was fired

695
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,740
from Kazuo Kiyohara's…

696
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,078
From Pops'…

697
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:10,654
The bullet was fired from
the gun that belonged to Keisuke's father.

698
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,160
It was identified as his gun.

699
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,634
That can't be.

700
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:24,802
There's no doubt about it.

701
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,906
The gun that was placed
in the time capsule,

702
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,108
and buried here,

703
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,246
is the murder weapon that killed Sakuma.

704
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:02,906
<i>The only ones who knew</i>
<i>about the buried gun,</i>

705
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,976
<i>were the four of us.</i>

706
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,586
<i>‪At last, all the players will be present.</i>

707
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,888
<i>‪You're saying that I have an accomplice?</i>

708
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,423
<i>‪"Raise your hand, and I’ll arrest you."</i>

709
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,725
‪-That's what you're saying!
‪-That's not what i'm saying!

710
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,994
‪I didn't open the time capsule.

711
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,562
<i>‪Okay.</i>

712
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:26,730
<i>‪I believe you.</i>

713
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:27,831
