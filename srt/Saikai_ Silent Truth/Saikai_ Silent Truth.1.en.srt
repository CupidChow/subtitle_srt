1
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:16,916
Will we find it?

2
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,385
I'm sure we will.

3
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,652
- I'm pretty sure.
- It's so fun.

4
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,588
There's a lot. We've seen them before.

5
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:22,489
Yeah.

6
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,390
We found a lot.

7
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,324
Yeah, a lot.

8
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,726
Your bug cage is so small.

9
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:27,627
This cage?

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,928
It won't fit in there.

11
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,964
- You think so?
- No worries.

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,832
Just one is enough anyway.

13
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:33,900
You're right.

14
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,103
I don't want it to be too small though.

15
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,843
Just a little farther.

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,912
- Junichi.
- Yeah?

17
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,313
Let's go this way.

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,214
What?

19
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,649
- This way?
- Yeah.

20
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,051
It's closer that way.

21
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,585
No, this way is closer.

22
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,654
This way is dangerous.
The other route worked last time.

23
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,056
Just choose which way is best.

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,093
Let's split into two groups.
Only Keisuke and I know the route.

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,228
Which way do you want to go, Maki?

26
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,230
‪NO TRESPASSING

27
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,565
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

28
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,868
Rock, paper, scissors.

29
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,070
I'm paper.

30
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,137
You and me, Naoto.

31
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,105
All right, let's go!

32
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,139
What?

33
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,541
Wait for me.

34
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:15,542
- Hurry up, Naoto.
- Wait.

35
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:16,776
- Naoto.
- Sorry.

36
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:17,744
Naoto.

37
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,346
What should we do if we meet the culprit?

38
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,382
The one on the run.

39
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,818
That bank robber, with a gun.

40
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,386
We won't run into the robber.

41
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,557
What if, by some chance,
we run into the culprit?

42
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,025
I'll protect you.

43
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:36,763
I see…

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,435
- Are you okay?
- Ouch.

45
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,706
Thanks.

46
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,279
Hey.

47
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,614
Hm?

48
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,450
Have you kissed anyone before?

49
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,452
What?

50
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,826
- Stop!
- Ouch!

51
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,028
Are you serious?

52
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,633
It's your fault for fooling around.

53
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,681
What was that?

54
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,284
What was that--

55
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,344
<i>That day,</i>

56
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,849
<i>the four of us committed a crime.</i>

57
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,262
<i>The crime we committed</i>

58
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:20,433
<i>was sealed away in a time capsule</i>
<i>that would never be opened in the future.</i>

59
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,085
<i>It's been 23 years since then.</i>

60
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,421
<i>I never saw them again.</i>

61
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,386
<i>Riichi.</i>

62
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,388
Already?

63
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,926
MITSUBA POLICE

64
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,603
Hello, it's Tobina.

65
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,705
Hey, where are you right now?

66
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,240
Well, right now I'm…

67
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,542
Mr. Kamata in Mikoto-cho

68
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,212
is complaining again,
so could you go and check on him?

69
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,018
<i>He specifically asked for you.</i>

70
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,252
I'm off duty right now.

71
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,087
Someone reported you guys to the police.

72
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:48,988
Shut up.

73
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:49,922
Hello.

74
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,858
Hello there.

75
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,927
- What's going on?
- It's that old man.

76
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,663
This way.

77
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,897
Try to keep it down.

78
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,898
Shut up.

79
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,535
Mr. Kamata. Hello.

80
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,037
They're so loud.

81
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,306
- Are you all right?
- Their motorcycle is so loud.

82
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,441
Why don't you tell me what happened

83
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:12,145
- while we play a game of shogi?
- Sounds great.

84
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,079
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

85
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,480
<i>Are you serious?</i>

86
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,216
That's insane.

87
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,953
You were off-duty, but got called in
when it's not even a major incident?

88
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,423
It just means things are peaceful.

89
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,125
But still, what if you were on a date,

90
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,161
or in a situation where you didn't
want to leave?

91
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,531
You've got a point.

92
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,633
I was so close to winning a good hand.

93
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,101
What do you mean?

94
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,770
Nothing shady, I hope.

95
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,372
- Hello.
- What are you talking about?

96
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,608
You've completely blended in,
in the two months you've been here.

97
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,710
- Captain.
- Yeah?

98
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,211
I just sent you my report.

99
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,412
- Okay.
- Please review it.

100
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,448
Mr. Tobina, you used to live
in this town, right?

101
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,016
Until sixth grade.

102
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,451
Really?

103
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,586
Do you have friends that still live here?

104
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,857
I haven't seen them at all
since I graduated.

105
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:58,758
Really?

106
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,127
You haven't even
run into them around town?

107
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,596
Nope.

108
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,032
You might not notice them
even if you ran into them.

109
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,934
It's been over 20 years, right?

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,403
- It's been 23 years.
- Wow.

111
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,004
That's crazy.

112
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,207
Do you remember the girl
you liked in elementary school?

113
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,479
Be honest. I don't remember at all.

114
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,214
- Bye.
- Bye.

115
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,585
Stop!

116
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,619
Ouch.

117
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,888
<i>Are you serious?</i>

118
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,492
<i>It's your fault for fooling around.</i>

119
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,661
- Welcome.
- Hi.

120
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,199
- Thank you.
- Thank you as always.

121
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,501
Likewise.

122
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,470
Your hair has gotten longer.

123
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,038
You think so?

124
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,110
Masaki got accepted.

125
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,713
To Hamadai Middle School?

126
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,483
No way! That's awesome!

127
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,852
That's great, Maki! Congratulations!

128
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,821
Clam down, Naoto.

129
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,322
But it's great news.

130
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,125
Both you and Masaki worked
so hard for this moment.

131
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,661
Thank you.

132
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,432
Speaking of Masaki…

133
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,300
- Hey there.
- Hello.

134
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,835
- Can you hold this for me?
- Sure.

135
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:17,770
Thank you.

136
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,374
Congratulations on your acceptance
into Hamadai Middle School.

137
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,608
Thank you.

138
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:25,645
So happy for you.

139
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,113
There's cake here.

140
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,115
- Cake?
- Mr. Naoto brought it.

141
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,783
- Wow.
- Thanks.

142
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,218
THE DAYS OF MARKING TIME
WILL COME TO AN END

143
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,619
AND A NEW CHAPTER WILL BEGIN

144
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,058
MAKIKO

145
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:43,796
Hello.

146
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,531
<i>Keisuke?</i>

147
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,834
<i>When can you come over here?</i>

148
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,769
Let's see…

149
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,771
You didn't come back last month either.

150
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,506
<i>Sorry.</i>

151
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,709
I'm okay, but I'm thinking about Masaki.

152
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,512
You did promise to meet him
once a month, after all.

153
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,647
Sorry, I haven't even had time
to sleep lately.

154
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,850
I'm still in the office as we speak.

155
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,284
I see.

156
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,987
Well, try to take it easy.

157
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,923
Instead of taking an hour and a half
to come here,

158
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,525
I'd rather have you get some rest.

159
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,027
I'll go there once things
settle down here.

160
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,296
I want to celebrate Masaki's
school acceptance too.

161
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:18,931
<i>Yeah.</i>

162
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,333
<i>Later.</i>

163
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,401
Bye.

164
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,811
Nice, Junichi.

165
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,480
Very nice.

166
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,416
Good job, Maki.

167
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,553
Good job, Naoto. Go.

168
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,722
Very good.

169
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,626
Meditation!

170
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,140
SMILE SAKUMA

171
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,497
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

172
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,999
- I'll come again.
- We'll be waiting.

173
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,503
Hello, this is Ma saison.

174
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,606
<i>Where is Makiko Iwamoto?</i>

175
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,341
<i>Is she there?</i>

176
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,777
She's with a client right now.

177
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,413
If you'd like to make an appointment,
I can do that for you.

178
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,583
<i>Makiko Iwamoto.</i>

179
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,753
Manager.

180
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,654
Yeah.

181
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,022
Um…

182
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,325
The caller keeps repeating,
"Makiko Iwamoto."

183
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,966
Hello, this is the manager,
Iwamoto, speaking.

184
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,637
<i>Long time no see.</i>

185
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,073
<i>It's Sakuma.</i>

186
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,445
<i>- Excuse me, but…</i>
- Can you come here right away?

187
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,315
To Smile Sakuma.

188
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,050
What?

189
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,087
Um…

190
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,956
<i>Do you finally remember</i>

191
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,192
<i>who I am?</i>

192
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,003
I'm not sure what this is regarding,

193
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,138
but I'm currently assisting
another client.

194
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,507
His name is Masaki, huh?

195
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,677
Your son, I mean.

196
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,148
Why do you know about Masaki?

197
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,684
<i>Your son</i>

198
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,689
<i>shoplifted from my store.</i>

199
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,040
NAOTO

200
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,280
<i>The person you have called</i>
<i>cannot answer the phone right now.</i>

201
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:39,065
SMILE SAKUMA

202
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,570
Ms. Iwamoto!

203
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,538
Hello.

204
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,606
It's unusual to see you here
at this time of the day.

205
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:48,541
Is your shop closed?

206
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,009
No, it's open today.

207
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,944
I see. You know,

208
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,780
it's taking so long
for my bangs to grow out.

209
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:58,350
But there's an event coming up
so I'm trying to grow them out.

210
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,385
Please do my hair again.

211
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,320
Of course, any time.

212
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,200
<i>Do you finally remember</i>

213
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,068
<i>who I am?</i>

214
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:22,001
Sorry for taking you away from work.

215
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,806
I sincerely apologize for the trouble
my son has caused.

216
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,382
Come inside.

217
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:40,820
Where's my son?

218
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,190
I have him waiting somewhere else.

219
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:53,265
We can't let him overhear
the conversation between adults, right?

220
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,003
Don't worry.

221
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,608
This is my personal office.

222
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,559
This thing

223
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,195
is 330 yen.

224
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,298
I'm very sorry.

225
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,336
He's still just a kid.

226
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,671
There's no need to make a big fuss

227
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,974
over something as minor as shoplifting.

228
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,211
Some people might think like that,

229
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,615
but shoplifting is still a serious crime.

230
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,552
Besides, I'm the store manager here.

231
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,321
I have a certain position to uphold.

232
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:06,338
I can refrain
from reporting this to the police.

233
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,941
I'll even give you this video footage.

234
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,111
That is,

235
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,081
if you show me your sincerity.

236
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,053
Sincerity?

237
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,622
Okay. Roger.

238
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,492
There was a report of a break-in
at a residence.

239
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,427
The culprit is still at the scene.

240
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,662
Tobina…

241
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:30,596
and…

242
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,131
Nagai.

243
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,265
Head to the scene.

244
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,266
Awesome!

245
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,234
Yes!

246
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,537
It's been a while
since we dealt with a culprit!

247
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,073
Mr. Tobina, I'll bring the car around!

248
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,708
Mitsuko.

249
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,843
Mitsuko!

250
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,881
<i>Who needs those useless wings?</i>

251
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,250
He's a complete stranger.

252
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,386
When I came home, he was watching TV
like he owned the place.

253
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,989
Who's that on the bed?

254
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,557
My mom!

255
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,628
- I'll go inside.
- Okay.

256
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,963
Hey dear,

257
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,332
next time he forgets something,

258
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,800
let's not take it to him anymore.

259
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,069
It won't do any good.

260
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,036
Nagai.

261
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,338
Yes.

262
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,506
Hello.

263
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,608
"Mr. Yoshihiko Nakamura."

264
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,911
"Specialized Nursing Home."

265
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,713
"Chitose-en, Irohadai."

266
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,215
Hello, Mr. Nakamura.

267
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,750
Hello.

268
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,820
OPPOSE THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE SHOPPING MALL!

269
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,255
- Nagai.
- Yeah?

270
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,224
What's that?

271
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,626
It's an elementary school
that closed down.

272
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,162
That's where I went.

273
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,765
Seriously? That's crazy.

274
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,002
There're plans for a building complex,

275
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,838
and the residents are staging
a protest against it.

276
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,106
A building complex?

277
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,142
A community center
and a large-scale shopping mall.

278
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,779
It will be built by Mitsuba City
and Sakuma Land Development.

279
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,314
Sakuma is a big name around here.

280
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,583
They run the supermarket Smile Sakuma.

281
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,196
That guy just now…

282
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,198
the manager of this store,

283
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,001
is Naoto's older brother.

284
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,738
He decided to let us go this time.

285
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,575
But promise me

286
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,445
that you'll never do this again.

287
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,016
Do you understand what you've done?

288
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:00,979
It's okay.

290
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,252
It's okay now.

291
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,319
Thank you for coming all the way here.

292
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,221
How's Masaki?

293
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,423
He's in bed already.

294
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,099
Did you get in touch with Naoto?

295
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,801
No.

296
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,304
I think he'll contact me
once he reads my message.

297
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,111
You're meeting up with him tonight
at 11:00 p.m., right?

298
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,012
Yeah.

299
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,116
Hey,

300
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,186
are you seriously going to comply
with his demand?

301
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,488
There's no other option.

302
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,891
Do you think someone
who's demanding 300,000 yen

303
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,726
will stop with just this once?

304
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,362
He's going to give me
the security video footage.

305
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,164
He can make copies of that.

306
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,865
Then what do you suggest we do?

307
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,035
He says he'll report our son to the police
if we don't pay him 300,000 yen.

308
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,604
Even if Masaki is reported
for shoplifting,

309
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,139
the police can't do anything about it.

310
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,242
He's only 12 years old.

311
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,710
What if his school finds out?

312
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,381
Can you guarantee that his admission
to middle school won't be revoked?

313
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,483
Well…

314
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,520
I guess there's a chance
of that getting revoked.

315
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,255
There are tons of other middle schools.

316
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,558
It's not that simple.

317
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,160
You don't get it, Keisuke.

318
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,664
Do you have any idea how much I struggled

319
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,799
to secure that highly recommended school?

320
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,970
Either way,

321
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,007
there's no other choice
but to buy his silence.

322
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:16,181
If that's what you want,
then I'll pay the 300,000--

323
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,249
It's okay.

324
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,686
I already went to the bank
and withdrew the money.

325
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,523
I'll go with you.

326
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,226
- What?
- I'll talk to him.

327
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,728
I'll make him sign a written agreement.

328
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,863
If he accepts the money,
it will be considered extortion.

329
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,466
He's the one who will be in trouble
if the police get involved.

330
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,438
Okay.

331
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,640
Thank you.

332
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,181
Masaki.

333
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,317
I'm coming in.

334
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,560
I'm Masaki's father.

335
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,032
You didn't come alone.

336
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,535
Where's the money?

337
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,370
Let's talk first.

338
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,306
No, hand me the money first.

339
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,309
Unless you want me to cancel this deal.

340
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,200
Whoa.

341
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:17,602
Wow.

342
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,472
I want written confirmation
of this exchange,

343
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,941
- and hand over the security footage.
- Now, now,

344
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,710
just slow down.

345
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,250
Let's have a chat. Man to man.

346
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,495
SMILE SAKUMA

347
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,563
NAOTO SAKUMA

348
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,031
SORRY FOR THE SUDDEN CALL

349
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,566
ARE YOU BUSY? CAN WE TALK?

350
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,967
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

351
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,936
MASAKI SHOPLIFTED
FROM YOUR BROTHER'S SHOP.

352
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,273
How was it?

353
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,242
Sorry.

354
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,143
What?

355
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,679
Just as I thought, he won't end things
with 300,000 yen,

356
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,681
and he didn't give me the footage either.

357
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,018
He said if we don't
do as he says tomorrow,

358
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,653
he'll report it to Masaki's school.

359
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,957
We shouldn't let him manipulate us
any further.

360
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,296
What is he asking for now?

361
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:54,566
JANUARY 17TH

362
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,807
What time is it?

363
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,277
It's past seven.

364
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,512
Your night shift finally ended?

365
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,082
I'm so sleepy.

366
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,152
It's tough working as a nurse.

367
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,422
I can fall asleep in ten seconds.

368
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,029
Good night.

369
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,935
- You're leaving already?
- Yeah.

370
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,638
Being a detective is tough too, huh?

371
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,875
- Bye.
- I'll be off.

372
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,722
I messaged Naoto and left a voicemail too.

373
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,691
But he hasn't contacted me yet.

374
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,661
I called Naoto's workplace.

375
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,964
Sakuma Land Development?

376
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,065
Yeah.

377
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,634
Our design team is handling
Naoto's project,

378
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,536
and I'm involved as an architect.

379
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,638
The huge supermarket
that's going to be built

380
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,039
on the old school site?

381
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:08,974
Yeah, that one.

382
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:12,410
What? You're part of that project?

383
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,247
Naoto didn't mention it at all.

384
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,250
And what happened when you called?

385
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,552
He's on a business trip to Korea

386
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,288
and will be returning to Haneda
before 9:00 p.m. tonight.

387
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,524
Before 9:00 p.m., okay.

388
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,360
Hey.

389
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,428
You're really doing this?

390
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,831
Yes, I'm going to comply with his demand.

391
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,967
I'm going to protect Masaki
no matter what.

392
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,442
Okay.

393
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,945
We're meeting him at 11:00 p.m., right?

394
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,148
I'll go check-in at the hotel once.
I want to shower too.

395
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,117
You're not returning to Tokyo today?

396
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,585
I'm staying here tonight.

397
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,788
You can stay at my place.

398
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,323
Oh…

399
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,724
well, um…

400
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,861
I can expense it anyway.

401
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,196
Then

402
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,332
I'll go back to my shop.

403
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,210
You should at least come over for dinner.

404
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,145
Oh…

405
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:23,548
I bet you're eating unhealthy things
since you're on your own.

406
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,786
It's been a while,
so let's have a meal with Masaki.

407
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,237
Hey.

408
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,640
I have a lot of work to do today,
so I'll be staying overnight.

409
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:50,508
Okay.

410
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,578
<i>How are you feeling? Still doing okay?</i>

411
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:56,681
I'm okay.

412
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,483
What about you, Keisuke?

413
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,586
<i>I'm okay.</i>

414
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,421
<i>Call me if you need me.</i>

415
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,223
Bye.

416
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,601
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.

417
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,986
This is where it was all along?

418
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:38,556
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

419
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,892
<i>but I need to talk to you about something.</i>

420
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,996
<i>Masaki shoplifted</i>
<i>from your older brother's supermarket.</i>

421
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:54,673
I'll be off.

422
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,376
I think I should go too--

423
00:27:58,443 --> 00:27:59,644
You shouldn't come.

424
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:12,290
SMILE SAKUMA

425
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,976
Good morning.

426
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,113
I'm going to begin the morning Smile Sale.

427
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,348
Manager, I'm taking the key.

428
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,751
You're not here?

429
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,456
IGAWA

430
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:45,623
Manager.

431
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,456
Chief, good morning.

432
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,191
Good morning!

433
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,794
The murdered victim

434
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,563
is said to be the son
of the Sakuma Land Development Company.

435
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,565
The oldest son, not the second son.

436
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:28,466
- Okay.
- No way.

437
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,568
It's a big case.

438
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,838
The Prefectural Police's First Division
will be coming and setting up.

439
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,541
But it's under our jurisdiction.

440
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,876
Please do your best.

441
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,777
Yes, sir!

442
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,445
Yes, sir.

443
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,647
- Let's go.
- We'll be off.

444
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,949
VICTIM

445
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:48,920
Captain, your handwriting is insane.

446
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,790
Maybe you should have someone else
do the writing.

447
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:55,660
I'm the one who's going to write
on this board! Shut your mouth!

448
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,195
Heave-ho.

449
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,596
Thanks.

450
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,332
Captain is fired up.

451
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,302
It's been decades since we've had
a murder case like this.

452
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,838
I never thought we'd have
a command center set up here.

453
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:07,939
You seem happy.

454
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,275
I'm nervous

455
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,510
to be paired up with a detective
from the First Division.

456
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,411
Let's do this.

457
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:42,507
MURDER INVESTIGATION OF
THE NISHIMATSU-CHO SUPERMARKET MANAGER

458
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,209
I'm the captain
of Kanagawa First Division.

459
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,109
My name is Shirakawa.

460
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,445
I'm Kosugi,
the chief of Mitsuba Police Station.

461
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,414
I will be heading this investigation.

462
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:15,173
<i>The victim has been identified</i>
<i>as Hideyuki Sakuma, 40 years old.</i>

463
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,109
<i>The manager of Smile Sakuma</i>
<i>in Mitsuba Minami.</i>

464
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,778
The crime scene was the manager's office
on the store premises.

465
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,047
It was a space
used exclusively by the victim.

466
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,816
The body was first discovered

467
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,351
by a supermarket employee.

468
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:29,187
Shortly after 9:00 a.m., the employee
went to the manager's office

469
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,990
to borrow the key to the safe
and discovered the body there.

470
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,559
It appears he was shot
and killed with a handgun,

471
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,527
but the weapon has not yet been found.

472
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,498
The Sakuma family is known as one of
the most prominent families in the area.

473
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,901
The current head of the family,
and the father

474
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,435
of the victim, Hideyuki,

475
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,905
is Hidemasa Sakuma,
and he is currently hospitalized.

476
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:47,906
Last year,

477
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:51,709
he suffered a stroke
and hasn't been discharged yet.

478
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:55,680
It is said that the family business
is effectively being run

479
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,082
by his second son, Naoto Sakuma,

480
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,618
who is the managing director
of Sakuma Land Development.

481
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,354
What was the victim doing
the day he was killed?

482
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,689
Tobina.

483
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,558
Tobina, your partner will be Ms. Nara.

484
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:08,860
Apparently,

485
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,630
she's the odd one out
in the prefectural police force.

486
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,801
- Your voice is so loud. Shush.
- Yes, sir.

487
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,938
Nagai, you team up with Mr. Murakami.

488
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,439
The one who's talking right now.

489
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:24,442
Understood.

490
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,412
- Sasakura is…
- Shush.

491
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,956
We are from
the Kanagawa Prefectural Police.

492
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,559
We have come to speak
with the Sakuma family.

493
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,910
<i>Hey Junichi, what are you doing?</i>

494
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,678
Stop that.

495
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:01,646
What're you doing?

496
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:02,947
Keisuke, come and join me.

497
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,149
- There's a branch right there.
- I'm not doing that.

498
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,584
One costs tens of thousands.

499
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,853
Liar. He's lying, right Naoto?

500
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:10,989
What are you guys doing?

501
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,690
Naoto!

502
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,894
We're sorry!

503
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,106
I'm Hideyuki's younger brother.

504
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,640
My name is Naoto Sakuma.

505
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,908
I'm Nara.

506
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:32,844
I'm Tobina.

507
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,148
Junichi?

508
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,620
He was my classmate in elementary school.

509
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,055
I see.

510
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,224
I haven't seen him since graduation,

511
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,026
so it won't interfere
with the investigation.

512
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,595
‪I see.

513
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:00,004
Oh my, you've become a fine young man!

514
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,672
You're a detective now?

515
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,274
Long time no see.

516
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,343
I'm sorry,

517
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,612
but my mother isn't feeling well.

518
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,914
Then please take a rest.

519
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:13,885
Perhaps we can talk with you another day.

520
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,687
Then I will excuse myself.

521
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,391
Junichi, please come

522
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,593
- visit again when you have more time.
- Yes.

523
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,962
I'll welcome you
with freshly-baked madeleines.

524
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,664
Thank you.

525
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,732
Goodbye.

526
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,043
Sorry to interrupt this nice reunion,

527
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,479
but we need to ask you about your brother.

528
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,380
Of course.

529
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,650
Your older brother lived here, right?

530
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,588
He came back two months ago and lived
in that detached house.

531
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,925
He wasn't living
in this spacious main house?

532
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,928
It's been like that ever since
we were kids.

533
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,865
Your brother was the son
of your dad's previous wife, right?

534
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,034
Yes.

535
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,536
After they divorced,

536
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,041
she lived with my brother for a few years,

537
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,845
but then she left him
and went off somewhere.

538
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,080
So my brother came to live here.

539
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,616
Where was your brother before he came here
two months ago?

540
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:19,750
In Tokyo.

541
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,486
Were you in contact with him?

542
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,155
We hardly kept in touch,

543
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,125
and I didn't even know
where he was living.

544
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,094
Once in a while he would contact me,

545
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,164
only to ask me to send him money
or something like that.

546
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,334
Do you know anyone who had
a grudge against your brother?

547
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,671
I don't know anything about my brother's
social circle.

548
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,274
But…

549
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:47,745
recently,

550
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,947
our company

551
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,884
has been receiving threats.

552
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,051
Threats?

553
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,721
That's troublesome.

554
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,458
It said that if we proceed

555
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,094
with the construction
of the building complex that our company

556
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:03,995
is planning,

557
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,696
divine punishment will befall us.

558
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:06,597
OPPOSE THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE SHOPPING MALL!

559
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,399
<i>What's this building complex?</i>

560
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,168
<i>We plan to collaborate with the city</i>

561
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,969
to build a facility

562
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,739
that combines a community center
and a shopping mall.

563
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:19,010
I believe the person who sent the threat

564
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:22,280
is a local retailer who opposes
the construction.

565
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,750
If possible, we'd like to see
that letter containing the threat.

566
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,218
I'm sorry.

567
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,453
We received two threatening letters,

568
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,590
but we threw both of them away.

569
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,959
By the way,

570
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,361
regarding last night…

571
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,331
Where were you, Mr. Naoto?

572
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,068
I returned from my business trip to Korea.

573
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:49,840
I arrived at Haneda Airport
just before 9:00 p.m.

574
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,877
It usually takes about an hour
to get here by car,

575
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,580
but I got caught in traffic,

576
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,149
so I think I didn't get home

577
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,919
until a little before 11:00 p.m.

578
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,988
Could you tell me which flight
you were on?

579
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,556
Yes.

580
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,558
Please wait one moment.

581
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,130
<i>It seems like</i>

582
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,000
his older brother
was quite a troublemaker.

583
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:21,539
<i>The families of victims usually exude</i>
<i>a palpable sense of grief,</i>

584
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,275
but there was no such feeling present.

585
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,514
The owner of a hardware store
located next to

586
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,384
the scene of the crime,
said he heard what sounded like gunshots.

587
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,120
He stated that he heard them
shortly before 10:00 p.m.

588
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,856
Based on the reports from forensic experts
regarding the rigor mortis,

589
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,459
it's safe to conclude
that the victim was shot

590
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,660
shortly before 10:00 p.m.

591
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:44,795
Sir.

592
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,565
We contacted the victim's family,

593
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,700
but they have no idea
who the perpetrator might be.

594
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,036
However, it appears
that the victim's half-brother,

595
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,605
Naoto Sakuma,
had recently been receiving threats.

596
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:56,641
Sir.

597
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:58,843
Mr. Sakuma is currently

598
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,879
working on a project
to build a large complex, and it appears

599
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,349
he has been subjected to harassment
by retailers opposed to the development.

600
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,251
It is unclear whether it's related
to this case.

601
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,452
Sir.

602
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,789
We have new testimony from the employee
who was the first to discover the body.

603
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:12,857
The day before the incident,

604
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,992
an acquaintance, a hairdresser,

605
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,261
<i>reportedly came to the supermarket,</i>
<i>but not to shop.</i>

606
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,063
She apparently left with her son.

607
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,866
This was unusual because this hairdresser

608
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:25,536
used to frequent the store,
but hadn't been seen there recently.

609
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,806
Therefore, we asked the hairdresser
to come to the station tomorrow.

610
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,075
She's the manager
of the hair salon, Ma saison.

611
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,710
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto.

612
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,847
The first name is Makiko,

613
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:41,385
and the last name is Iwamoto.

614
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,787
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto.

615
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:44,989
Roger.

616
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,858
Regarding the bullet…

617
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,293
Is something the matter?

618
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,229
I had a classmate with that same name.

619
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,598
Oh my…

620
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,672
- You have everything?
- Yeah.

621
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:02,640
Bye.

622
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,608
Run, run.

623
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,378
- Bye.
- Bye.

624
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,966
Following Mr. Naoto Sakuma,

625
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,569
this would be reunion number two, huh?

626
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,549
Thank you for waiting.

627
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:46,450
I'm Nara.

628
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,024
I'm Tobina.

629
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,295
Thank you

630
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:01,065
for taking time out of your busy schedule
for us.

631
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,600
Let's get straight to the point.

632
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,802
We'd like to ask you some questions.

633
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:05,970
Okay.

634
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,738
The manager of Smile Sakuma,

635
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,941
Hideyuki Sakuma, was murdered.

636
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,909
Are you aware of that?

637
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,679
Yes, I saw it on the news.

638
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,381
On Friday evening,

639
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,584
you went to Smile Sakuma, right?

640
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,119
Yes.

641
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,754
What did you go there for?

642
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:29,093
My son called me to say
he had lost his wallet,

643
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,795
so I went to give him some money.

644
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,663
You have a son?

645
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,932
- Yes.
- Is he in elementary school?

646
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,801
Yes. Sixth grade.

647
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:41,105
I see. Your son called you
on his smartphone?

648
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,642
No, he doesn't have a smartphone.

649
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,544
I see.

650
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,680
Actually, my sister's daughter,

651
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,916
my niece, is in fifth grade,

652
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:55,052
and they're arguing about whether or not
she should have a smartphone.

653
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,021
I totally understand.

654
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,189
By the way,

655
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,890
did your son find his wallet?

656
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,661
Yes, he had left it at home.

657
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,329
- Is that right?
- Yes.

658
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,433
Thank you so much for coming here today.

659
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,302
Not at all.

660
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:14,205
That's all the questions we have
for today.

661
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,105
Detective Tobina.

662
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,141
Please see her out.

663
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,177
Yes.

664
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,768
I didn't know you became a detective.

665
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:47,638
What's up with you, Junichi?

666
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,707
You didn't contact me even once.

667
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,477
- Why are you laughing?
- Because

668
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,881
I totally thought
you had forgotten about me.

669
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,949
There's no way I'd forget you.

670
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,684
You didn't even blink an eye when we met.

671
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,520
I heard from Naoto

672
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:05,789
that you appeared before him
as a detective.

673
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,793
I see.

674
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,598
What? Is there something on my face?

675
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,335
You haven't changed at all.

676
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,671
You too, Junichi.

677
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,411
But man,

678
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:30,981
I was surprised to hear that you have
a child in sixth grade

679
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:32,950
and became a hairdresser.

680
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,319
You surprised me too.

681
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:39,790
The Junichi we grew up with
is now a detective.

682
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:47,298
It's been 23 years.

683
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,500
Yeah.

684
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,139
Where are you living right now?
Near Yokohama?

685
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,074
No, around here.

686
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,542
Since when?

687
00:42:58,609 --> 00:42:59,810
Two months ago.

688
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,011
What?

689
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,014
Why are you being such a stranger?
You should've contacted me.

690
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:04,915
How could I?

691
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,884
I don't have your contact information.

692
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,901
MAKIKO IWAMOTO

693
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,235
Contact me any time.

694
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:27,938
Thanks.

695
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:37,681
Hey…

696
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:38,582
Yeah?

697
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:41,819
- Your name…
- Ah.

698
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:42,920
Oh?

699
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:47,024
You're wondering why I'm using
my maiden name when I have a kid?

700
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,192
Yes, exactly.

701
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,760
I got divorced.

702
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,097
Oh.

703
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:55,466
I see.

704
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:56,800
Oh,

705
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,371
I'll introduce you to my ex-husband.

706
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,908
Long time no see, Junichi.

707
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:05,809
What?

708
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,544
Keisuke?

709
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,582
Keisuke!

710
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,783
Wow.

711
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,419
- No way.
- How have you been?

712
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,654
What a surprise.

713
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,988
I can tell.

714
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,725
Reunion number three, huh.

715
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,062
You haven't changed.

716
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:28,165
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto
was my old classmate after all.

717
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,969
She was teasing me,
pretending she forgot about me.

718
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,338
She was always like that.

719
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,274
She's lying.

720
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,009
She is?

721
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,577
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto

722
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,514
is clearly lying.

723
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:46,684
Please elaborate.

724
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,620
I didn't know you became a detective.

725
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:53,957
Hello.

726
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,493
I understand.

727
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,064
We have an emergency meeting.

728
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,932
MITSUBA POLICE STATION

729
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,334
We have called you all together

730
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,804
as an emergency situation has come up.

731
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:10,107
Furthermore, you are strictly prohibited
from disclosing

732
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,009
the information I am about to share,

733
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,077
for any reason whatsoever.

734
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,646
The handling of this information,

735
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,182
including its potential release
to the media,

736
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,351
is being discussed by senior officials
of the prefectural police.

737
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:26,790
The bullet extracted from the body
of the victim, Hideyuki Sakuma,

738
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:31,528
was determined to have been fired
from New Nambu M60.

739
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:32,696
Seriously?

740
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:36,734
The New Nambu M60, the standard issue
handgun of our police force,

741
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,204
was the weapon used
in the murder of a civilian.

742
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,473
That's the shocking result we received.

743
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,874
That's crazy.

744
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,143
The handgun in question
has already been identified.

745
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,178
It was determined to be the handgun

746
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,949
of Police Officer Kazuo Kiyohara,
who died in the line of duty 23 years ago

747
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:55,285
and whose weapon
had been missing ever since.

748
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,224
Twenty-three years ago,
within this jurisdiction,

749
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:03,026
there was a robbery
of an armored cash transport vehicle…

750
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,094
YAMATO TRUST BANK ROBBERY CASE

751
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,864
…belonging to the Mitsuba branch
of the Yamato Trust Bank.

752
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,232
Stand back!

753
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:11,135
Put down that bag!

754
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:17,007
<i>The culprit, Nobukazu Oshima,</i>

755
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,575
<i>stole 30 million yen in cash</i>

756
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,145
<i>and fled to a forest five kilometers away.</i>

757
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,914
He had an encounter with Officer Kiyohara.

758
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:25,949
<i>There,</i>

759
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:30,320
<i>he and Officer Kiyohara</i>
<i>shot each other, and both died.</i>

760
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:31,822
<i>Oshima is believed</i>

761
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:35,425
to have had an accomplice, who is said
to have taken the 30 million yen

762
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:39,363
and Officer Kiyohara's gun,

763
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:43,700
but the 30 million yen and the gun
were never found

764
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:44,835
and remain unknown.

765
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:50,440
The handgun
that was lost 23 years ago was used

766
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:51,842
in the recent incident,

767
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,145
which is a very serious matter.

768
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,048
We're changing the investigation strategy.

769
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:01,251
Investigators have been mobilized
to locate and recover the murder weapon.

770
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,188
Further instructions
will be given at a later date.

771
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:05,722
Yes, sir.

772
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,080
‪Dad! Dad!

773
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:35,118
‪Dad! Dad!

774
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,621
Dad!

775
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,261
<i>On that day</i>

776
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,331
<i>the four of us committed a crime.</i>

777
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,067
<i>We thought we had sealed</i>

778
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:55,305
<i>the crime we committed in a time capsule</i>
<i>that would never be opened in the future.</i>

779
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,175
<i>Along with that gun.</i>

780
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:03,447
This will be a secret

781
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:08,452
between just the four of us.

782
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:10,420
Okay?

783
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,788
<i>‪You came as a detective, right?</i>

784
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,590
<i>‪Can the four of us meet together?</i>

785
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,358
<i>‪You came to confirm my story?</i>

786
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,726
‪About the lie…

787
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,595
‪Let's open the time capsule.

788
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:54,264
‪We hid the gun that caused
‪headlines back in the day.

789
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,033
<i>‪Let's just keep it between us for now.</i>

790
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,768
<i>‪Promise you'll do that.</i>

791
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:58,769
