1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,540
<i>The murdered victim is Hideyuki Sakuma,</i>
<i>40 years old.</i>

2
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:08,908
It's a big case.

3
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:11,678
<i>The Prefectural Police's First Division</i>
<i>will be coming and setting up.</i>

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:12,846
<i>Please do your best.</i>

5
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,247
Long time no see, Junichi.

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,550
You appeared before him as a detective.

7
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,853
If you bump into Ms. Makiko Iwamoto,

8
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,521
<i>try to get more information from her.</i>

9
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,156
<i>About the lie she told.</i>

10
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,758
<i>Reunion for the four of us.</i>

11
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,195
Let's open the time capsule.

12
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,731
<i>We hid the gun that caused</i>
<i>such a stir back then.</i>

13
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,199
<i>Detective Tobina came here,</i>

14
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,269
<i>and shortly after,</i>
<i>the latest incident occurred?</i>

15
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,438
<i>What I'm about to tell you</i>
<i>is confidential information.</i>

16
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,975
<i>I'm telling you this</i>
<i>because we are involved in this case,</i>

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,110
but I need you to keep this a secret.

18
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,713
The bullet extracted from the body
was fired

19
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,848
<i>from Kazuo Kiyohara's…</i>

20
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,121
The bullet was fired from the gun
that belonged to Keisuke's father.

21
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,623
It was identified as his gun.

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,658
That can't be.

23
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,361
The gun that was placed

24
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,363
in the time capsule, and buried here,

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,468
is the murder weapon that killed Sakuma.

26
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,871
It looks like it was recently dug up.

27
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,156
What combination should we use?

28
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,591
It doesn’t matter,

29
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,460
we won’t be opening it again.

30
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,061
Really?

31
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,364
Let’s remember it just in case.

32
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,000
What should we use?

33
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,434
What about 1029?

34
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,237
Oh, never mind.

35
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,072
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,108
We can use my birth date.

37
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,213
What's the combination?

38
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,584
- One…
- Zero…

39
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,521
- Two…
- Nine.

40
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:29,709
It's gone.

41
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,419
One of us here opened the time capsule

42
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,988
and took out that gun.

43
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,293
Was the bullet found
in Naoto's brother's body

44
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,663
- really fired from my dad’s gun?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,433
Bullets fired from a gun
have rifling marks,

46
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,168
<i>and the rifling marks</i>

47
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,636
of all police handguns are registered.

48
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,241
Is it possible that someone other than us
found and took the gun?

49
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,875
Let's start by confirming that.

50
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,114
Did any of you tell someone the location

51
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,884
or the combination to this time capsule?

52
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,319
No.

53
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,921
I didn't tell anyone.

54
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,456
I didn't either.

55
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,324
If that's the case,
we're the only ones left.

56
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,562
Let me confirm one more thing.

57
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,398
Did any of you

58
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,768
open this time capsule?

59
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,171
I did not open it.

60
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,309
- I didn't open it.
- I didn't open it.

61
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,844
- Then why is it missing--
- Hey!

62
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,046
What about you, Junichi?

63
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,015
You could’ve opened the time capsule too.

64
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,550
I didn't open it.

65
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,985
Did you tell anyone the combination?

66
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,354
No.

67
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,060
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,830
It was you, Naoto?

69
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,570
No! That's not it…

70
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,775
It's all because I suggested burying it
in a time capsule back then.

71
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,044
I've been thinking…

72
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,781
Let's bury a time capsule
after the graduation ceremony.

73
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,350
Time capsule?

74
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,754
Once we graduate,
the school will be closed down.

75
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,857
That means no one will go there anymore,
right?

76
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,994
Yeah, let's do it.

77
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,596
I have something

78
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,200
I want to bury in the time capsule.

79
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,104
It was my fault for taking the gun
in the first place.

80
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,408
I had it hidden in the drawer of my desk
at home,

81
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,177
but I had regretted taking it,

82
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,547
so I felt relieved when I was able
to bury it in the time capsule.

83
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,082
It’s also my fault too,

84
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,720
since it was my idea to go to the forest.

85
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:57,690
Since the armed bank robber
is still at large,

86
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,460
all elementary and middle school students
in the city

87
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,628
will all walk home together in groups.

88
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,665
- What?
- You've got to be kidding me.

89
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:09,035
Even after returning home,
you guys are prohibited from going outside

90
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,237
unless accompanied
by a parent or guardian.

91
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,473
- What?
- No way!

92
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,310
- Hey!
- Hey!

93
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,579
Screw the group system!

94
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,247
- I knew you'd say that.
- Yeah!

95
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,682
What should we do?

96
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,585
- We're going there, of course.
- We are?

97
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,719
We're going, right Keisuke?

98
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,920
- Of course.
- Yeah.

99
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,222
You coming, Maki?

100
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,891
I guess I have no other choice.
I'll go too!

101
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,126
All right!

102
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,561
There's no point
in bringing all that up now.

103
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,366
What's done is done, and we can't undo it.

104
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,737
Let me confirm one last thing.

105
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,707
Tell me your alibi for Saturday night,

106
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,511
- the night the incident occurred.
- Hey, wait a minute.

107
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,112
This is like an interrogation.

108
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,816
I just want to know
who opened the time capsule.

109
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,050
But that's not all.

110
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,054
"The person who killed
Naoto's brother is among us."

111
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,857
"Now's your chance to come forward."

112
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,094
"Raise your hand, and I’ll arrest you."
That's what you're saying!

113
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,696
- That's not what I'm saying!
- That's enough!

114
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,268
Let’s call it a day.

115
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,840
Is that okay, Junichi?

116
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,082
- Okay.
- Let's go.

117
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:31,951
Keisuke, can we talk?

118
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:32,952
Hey…

119
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,554
I have no intention of starting a fight.

120
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,134
The police are aware that Makiko is lying.

121
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,803
Makiko’s lie?

122
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,806
Isn't it true that the reason
Makiko went to Smile Sakuma on Friday

123
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,943
was because her son shoplifted?

124
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,114
Huh?

125
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,684
There's no way Masaki would shoplift.

126
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,253
- You really don’t know?
- Yeah.

127
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,623
I guess Makiko didn’t consult with you.

128
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,763
Was the breakup so bad
she can't consult you?

129
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,799
Mind your own business.

130
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,667
The fact that the police
suspect shoplifting,

131
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,103
means they think Makiko and Sakuma

132
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,671
had some kind of connection.

133
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,574
Don't underestimate the police.

134
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,083
Damn it.

135
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,730
It's all right.

136
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:56,636
What's all right?

137
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,773
Well, I don't really know…

138
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,711
But it'll be all right.

139
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:21,494
Fine.

140
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,296
Give me time. I'll tell the truth.

141
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,530
Why can't you tell me now?

142
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,500
I can, but Makiko…

143
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,337
Something important is at stake
for Makiko.

144
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,508
I took lightly the things
that were important to Makiko.

145
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,643
That's why we ended up breaking up.

146
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,055
But I had regular clients at this shop,
and there was also

147
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,790
the matter of Masaki.

148
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,895
Ever since elementary school,
he set his sights on Hamadai Middle School

149
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,097
and he’d been attending cram school too.

150
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,735
Okay, fine.

151
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,672
I'll talk to Makiko tonight and make sure
we talk to the police tomorrow.

152
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,543
Fine. Let's get back.

153
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,646
Can I ask you a question too?

154
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,381
What is it?

155
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,316
What did you think

156
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,053
when you found out that Makiko and I
married and then divorced?

157
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,924
Nothing in particular.

158
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,227
When we were kids, Makiko liked you.

159
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,663
That’s ancient history.

160
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,968
Did you think, "Why did you marry Keisuke?
You used to like me."

161
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:36,969
No way.

162
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,938
Or "You and Keisuke ended up divorcing?"

163
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,340
"You would have been happy
with me forever."

164
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,342
That would've never crossed my mind.

165
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,277
Why didn't you contact Makiko?

166
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,613
After you graduated and moved,

167
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,583
<i>didn't you ever think about</i>
<i>contacting Makiko?</i>

168
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,286
If I had, I would’ve contacted her.

169
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,423
You're right.

170
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,962
You contacted her though, huh?

171
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,597
No.

172
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,668
Around the time when I saw you
in Yokohama…

173
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,437
Keep your hands to yourself.

174
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,473
<i>Junichi, you were a police officer,</i>
<i>and I was a university student.</i>

175
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,877
Makiko was attending a cosmetology school
in Yokohama

176
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,245
while working part-time at a cafe.

177
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,283
Thank you for waiting.

178
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,551
Thank you.

179
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,586
Watch out.

180
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,589
There’s someone staring at you, Iwamoto.

181
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,024
What?

182
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,861
Thank you for waiting.
What would you like to order?

183
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,631
You’re Makiko Iwamoto, right?

184
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,066
What?

185
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:42,735
What?

186
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,904
Keisuke?

187
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,338
Yeah.

188
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,307
No way!

189
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,510
I met her by chance, so I talked to her.

190
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,846
I see.

191
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,216
I ran into both you and Makiko.

192
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,287
I didn’t tell Makiko that I had seen you.

193
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,357
I didn’t want you to take Makiko
away from me.

194
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,130
I wouldn’t take her away.

195
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,799
Even if you didn’t,
she would’ve gone to you.

196
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,936
I guess so.

197
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,437
Hey!

198
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,007
You’ve always been like that.

199
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,543
Let's go back.

200
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,430
He's sleeping.

201
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,334
It seems the police already know about
Masaki's shoplifting.

202
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,737
We have to tell the police about it.

203
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,240
Wait a minute,
what's going to happen to Masaki?

204
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,777
The police might contact the school,

205
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,012
and his acceptance could be revoked.

206
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,648
It would also cause trouble for the school
that recommended him.

207
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,786
We can have Junichi help us with that.

208
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,421
- Will he be able to help us?
- I’ll ask him to help us out.

209
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,991
- What if he can’t do anything about it?
- Just calm down.

210
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:17,096
I thought you understood and supported me.

211
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,298
Someone died!

212
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,467
There's no way we can just
keep quiet like this.

213
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,936
If we keep lying, we'll become suspects.

214
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,538
It's better to tell them beforehand.

215
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,475
Of course, we won’t tell them everything.

216
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,546
Let’s decide how much to disclose.

217
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,649
Let's also discuss

218
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,451
what to say when we’re asked about
our alibi for Saturday.

219
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,191
Okay.

220
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,802
Why didn't you contact Makiko?

221
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,215
Good morning.

222
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,383
Good morning.

223
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,652
You're here early.

224
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,187
You too, Chief Kosugi.

225
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,024
I hope Tobina
isn't causing you any trouble.

226
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,526
Trouble?

227
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,897
I hope he hasn’t been rude
or inconvenienced you in any way.

228
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,198
I'm not one to talk.

229
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,937
I hear that you're a standout figure
at headquarters, Ms. Nara.

230
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,274
I hear that people are saying
I’m difficult to deal with.

231
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,144
The police force is still very much
a male-dominated, hierarchical society.

232
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,884
I imagine things are quite difficult
with all the different factions.

233
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,352
Factions?

234
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,455
I guess you’re not concerned with it.

235
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,125
Since I'm already
in a faction-based workforce,

236
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,661
I think I'll try flattering someone
for once.

237
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,463
Thanks.

238
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,502
Drink up.

239
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,019
Sorry for taking up your time
this morning.

240
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,921
I don’t mind.

241
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,789
I'm glad you called.

242
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,191
I had decided to go jogging every morning,

243
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:30,229
but I gave up after three days, and I was
feeling disappointed with myself.

244
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,099
Wow, even you have days like that, huh?

245
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,136
What about you?
What's up with you this morning?

246
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:38,470
What do you mean?

247
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,438
Well…

248
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,541
Could it be that you were swayed
by a woman you used to like,

249
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,575
perhaps at a class reunion?

250
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,576
Huh?

251
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,479
- What?
- You had a class reunion yesterday, right?

252
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,048
Ms. Nara had mentioned it.

253
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,119
<i>How was the reunion last night?</i>

254
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,654
Oh, it was a wake, huh?

255
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,723
It was like a class reunion.

256
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,461
Did you guys have fun
reminiscing about the past?

257
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,563
Yes. We had a lot of fun.

258
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,098
I see.

259
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,002
So? Did you glean any intel from it?

260
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:14,707
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto says she wants to talk
about her visit to Smile Sakuma on Friday.

261
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:15,941
Detective Tobina,

262
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,843
you were able to persuade her?

263
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,311
No, I didn’t do anything.

264
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,113
She said she wanted to talk to us.

265
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,416
Her ex-husband, Mr. Keisuke Kiyohara,
will be coming too.

266
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,453
Finally, all the players will be present.

267
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,210
Your jacket button?

268
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,878
<i>It's missing.</i>

269
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,314
<i>It’s the jacket I was wearing</i>
<i>when I met Sakuma.</i>

270
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,083
You’re sure you were wearing it that day?

271
00:16:58,817 --> 00:16:59,785
<i>Yeah.</i>

272
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,421
<i>I wonder if I dropped it there…</i>

273
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,190
The police suspect

274
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,793
that you and Sakuma
had some kind of connection.

275
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,597
<i>If a button was found at the crime scene,</i>
<i>they would have questioned you about it.</i>

276
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,600
Maybe they’ll find it later.

277
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,604
Maybe they found it already
and we’ll be asked about it today.

278
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,638
Yeah…

279
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,942
If they ask, you should acknowledge
that it's your button.

280
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,911
Since we're going to tell them

281
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,380
that we went to that office
to cut that initial deal with Sakuma.

282
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:29,982
Okay.

283
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,284
<i>Without further ado,</i>

284
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:36,321
<i>please tell us about what happened</i>
<i>at Smile Sakuma on Friday.</i>

285
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,158
I’m sorry,

286
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,727
I lied about something.

287
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,130
I went to the supermarket on Friday

288
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,099
because I received a call

289
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,602
from Mr. Sakuma saying that my son
had shoplifted.

290
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,373
My son was accepted into middle school
through a recommendation process,

291
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,644
and I didn't want his admission
to be revoked.

292
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,348
Mr. Sakuma told me

293
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,820
he would not contact
the police or the school,

294
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,622
if I proved how sincerely sorry I was.

295
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,194
So I agreed to pay him 300,000 yen.

296
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,762
And then?

297
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,171
She contacted me,

298
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,807
and the two of us went
to hand him the money.

299
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,011
What time was that?

300
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,546
It was eleven o'clock at night.

301
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,218
Agreeing to that deal
might have been reckless.

302
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,721
But it was in my son’s best interests,

303
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,490
so I don't regret the decision.

304
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,760
The agreement was that

305
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,629
in exchange for 300,000 yen,

306
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:54,399
he wouldn't report your son's shoplifting
to the police or the school.

307
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,137
But what happened to the video footage?

308
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,541
The security camera footage?

309
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:03,675
Yes.

310
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,447
I was supposed to receive that
in exchange for 300,000 yen,

311
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,983
but I was so nervous
during the transaction

312
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,518
that I forgot to get it from him.

313
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,554
I was planning to contact him again,

314
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,390
but then that whole incident happened.

315
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,061
I see.

316
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:25,998
Yes.

317
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:34,940
The thing is…

318
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,712
the data from the day of the shoplifting

319
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,316
hasn't been found yet.

320
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,018
Is that right?

321
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,154
I wonder what happened to it?

322
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,593
Did Mr. Sakuma dispose of it?

323
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,495
Do you think he did?

324
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,531
That Mr. Sakuma, who extorted
300,000 yen because a child shoplifted?

325
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,599
I don't think so.

326
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,269
That day, we gave him 300,000 yen,
and that was the end of it,

327
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,141
but honestly, I was still worried
that he might keep demanding more.

328
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,845
Mr. Sakuma might have hidden it
somewhere safe.

329
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,053
Now we’ve told you all we know.

330
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:25,490
But is there anything else
you’d like to know?

331
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,727
Let's see…

332
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,932
Detective Tobina, was there anything else?

333
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,402
- No.
- Then that's it.

334
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,806
Thank you for coming today.

335
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,307
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

336
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,576
I'll walk you guys out.

337
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,248
One more thing…

338
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,317
About my son's shoplifting…

339
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,988
will it be reported to the school?

340
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,690
We will report this as a fact
to the investigation headquarters.

341
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,559
As for reporting this to the school,

342
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,295
we will leave it to the discretion
of Detective Tobina of the local police.

343
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:12,771
I'll see you out.

344
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,708
Thank you.

345
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,849
I'm glad we got that over with.

346
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,320
They didn't say anything
about the jacket button,

347
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,424
and they didn't ask us
about our alibi for Saturday either.

348
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,707
Thank you for being understanding
about the shoplifting incident.

349
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,777
By the way,

350
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,148
I assume
that Mr. Keisuke Kiyohara's father

351
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,817
is indeed Police Officer Kazuo Kiyohara,

352
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:02,387
who was killed in the line of duty
23 years ago, right?

353
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,556
That's correct.

354
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,927
I learned about it when I read
the files from 23 years ago.

355
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:11,863
I'm sorry.

356
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,666
I should have informed you about it
in advance.

357
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,134
I agree.

358
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,444
I'm sure you know--

359
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,245
The victim's younger brother,

360
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,147
Mr. Naoto Sakuma,

361
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,684
Mr. Keisuke Kiyohara,

362
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,620
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto,

363
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,857
and you, Detective Tobina.

364
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,461
The four of you

365
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:47,999
were the first people
to discover the body of Officer Kiyohara.

366
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,536
Is that correct?

367
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,540
Yes.

368
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,011
That's correct.

369
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,787
This is very interesting.

370
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:14,025
The four people involved
in the incident 23 years ago

371
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,363
are reunited because Sakuma was murdered.

372
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,202
Detective Tobina.

373
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:26,838
Yes?

374
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,640
I want the four of you to gather together

375
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,575
so that I can confirm something.

376
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,580
Okay.

377
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,859
Junichi? What's up?

378
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,027
Sorry to bother you at work.

379
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,295
It's all right.

380
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,663
Do you have time right now?

381
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,865
I have a client waiting for me.

382
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,033
Oh, I see.

383
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,035
Then can we talk later?

384
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,438
Sure.

385
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,411
- Welcome back.
- Hi.

386
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,412
This is my son, Masaki.

387
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,548
Oh.

388
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,350
- Hello.
- Hello.

389
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,653
This is…

390
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,954
I'm Junichi.

391
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,692
You like playing baseball?

392
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,760
Yes.

393
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,395
Want to play catch?

394
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,130
- What?
- Let's do it.

395
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,098
- Really?
- Let's do it.

396
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,572
Nice catch.

397
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,575
Very nice.

398
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,344
Good job.

399
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,924
All right, good job.

400
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,125
Good one.

401
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,394
Give it all you've got.

402
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,129
- Come.
- Okay.

403
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,868
- Whoa!
- Sorry!

404
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,002
Hold on.

405
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,538
You must be naturally athletic.

406
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,175
You're Keisuke and Makiko's child
after all.

407
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,711
Your parents

408
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,481
were both really good at sports.
Did you know?

409
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,451
- I heard that they used to do kendo.
- That's right.

410
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,786
- I used to do it with them.
- Oh, wow.

411
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,788
Keisuke's father,

412
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,458
your grandfather,
is the one who taught us.

413
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,228
- He taught us how to play ball too.
- Wow.

414
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,931
I

415
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,635
<i>lost my father when I was little,</i>

416
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,271
<i>so I was very attached to him.</i>

417
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,542
Keisuke's dad was a police officer.

418
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,746
And what do you do?

419
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,114
I'm a detective.

420
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,416
What is it?

421
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,450
What is it?

422
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,754
You're not a very good liar.

423
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,859
Hey, I'm not kidding.

424
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,193
Look.

425
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,861
JUNICHI TOBINA

426
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,330
- You're serious?
- I'm serious. I'm a detective.

427
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,399
- Wow.
- A real detective.

428
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:13,872
What is it?

429
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,678
Am I going to get arrested?

430
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,056
Well, shoplifting is a crime, huh?

431
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,395
We won't arrest you this time.

432
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,766
I promised my mom and dad
that I'll never do it again.

433
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:44,769
Good.

434
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,072
Understood.

435
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,078
- Is Makiko scary when she gets mad?
- What?

436
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,480
Thank you.

437
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,449
- Thank you.
- Please come again.

438
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,217
- See you again.
- Bye.

439
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,197
Makiko has been tough ever since
she was in elementary school.

440
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,600
- We have a friend named Naoto--
- I know him.

441
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,735
You know him?

442
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,371
Naoto used to get bullied.

443
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,539
When that happened, Makiko would get angry

444
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,841
and make us get revenge.

445
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,242
- You did it?
- Yeah.

446
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,245
Because we're too scared
to stand up to her.

447
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,647
- Since she's so tough.
- Hey!

448
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:29,648
- Oh crap.
- Hey.

449
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,282
- Run!
- Hey, stop right there.

450
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,252
- I'm scared.
- Who are you calling tough?

451
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:35,787
I'm scared.

452
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,857
- Stop telling him unnecessary things.
- Watch out.

453
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,725
Watch out for her.

454
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:43,762
So?

455
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,097
What did you want to talk about?

456
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,539
I want you to come
to Mitsuba Police Station again.

457
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,341
What?

458
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,779
Detective Nara realized
that the four of us were the first

459
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,882
to discover Keisuke's father's body,
and she wants to talk to us.

460
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,489
Okay.

461
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,358
I'm sure it goes without saying,

462
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,595
but please pretend you don't know about
the details of the investigation I leaked.

463
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,398
Specifically, the fact that the weapon

464
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:24,069
used in the Sakuma murder
was the gun we buried 23 years ago.

465
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,308
Okay.

466
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,277
But first,

467
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,814
there's something I want to ask you.

468
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,615
What is it?

469
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,418
I want to confirm one more time.

470
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,788
Makiko…

471
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,260
You didn't open the time capsule, right?

472
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,301
Makiko…

473
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,673
You didn't open the time capsule, right?

474
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,611
Junichi, do you suspect me?

475
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,147
Given the circumstances,
I have no choice but to ask.

476
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,450
Given the circumstances,

477
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,486
you really think
I could dig that up on my own?

478
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,726
Yeah.

479
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,429
Are you serious?

480
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,398
Junichi, even you had to have
another person to help dig that up.

481
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,071
I guess you couldn't do it alone.

482
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,880
You're saying that I have an accomplice?

483
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,753
Do you think I'd take

484
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,790
such a risk with someone?

485
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,798
I've had enough of that already.

486
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,333
<i>That day,</i>

487
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,037
<i>we all learned our lesson, didn't we?</i>

488
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,942
We were told not to leave the house
because a bank robber

489
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,277
was on the loose,

490
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,246
but you said you were going to the forest.

491
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,218
I went with all of you guys
because you're the one who suggested it.

492
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,255
<i>What do you mean?</i>

493
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,025
If Keisuke or Naoto
had suggested going to the forest,

494
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,194
I would've just said, "Are you crazy?"
and went home.

495
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,296
Why?

496
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,035
I don't know why.

497
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:48,880
Anyway, I won't take any more risks.

498
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,786
- Me too.
- Because you're a detective?

499
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,527
Liar.

500
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:06,831
You're a detective, but leaked
info about the investigation to us.

501
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,272
You're right.

502
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,009
What situation have we gotten
ourselves into?

503
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,417
Right when we finally got to reunite

504
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,220
after 23 years…

505
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,496
I

506
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,200
didn't open the time capsule.

507
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,008
I understand.

508
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:55,680
I believe you.

509
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,823
Good evening.

510
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,659
Good evening to you too.

511
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,195
Excuse me, I'm from
the Mitsuba Police Station.

512
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,998
We're asking people if they saw
anyone suspicious around here.

513
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,200
It's regarding January 17th.

514
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,302
January 17th?

515
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,204
Were you walking your dog
at this time on that day?

516
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,873
I don't remember.

517
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,041
- I see.
- Sorry.

518
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,570
MITSUBA POLICE STATION

519
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,707
Thank you for coming here
time and time again.

520
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:59,444
We haven't yet heard your alibis
for Saturday night,

521
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,012
which is the night

522
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,814
Hideyuki Sakuma was murdered.

523
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,816
So we will question you two individually.

524
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,320
After that,
when Mr. Naoto Sakuma joins us,

525
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,322
we will ask all of you some questions.

526
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,257
Okay.

527
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,495
Makiko and I meet once every two months.

528
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:20,665
The main purpose is to talk about our son.

529
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,034
That Saturday was the day
we were supposed to meet,

530
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,236
and given our son's shoplifting incident,

531
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,637
we discussed what to do.

532
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,840
We left our son with my parents

533
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,111
and talked together at a restaurant
near the train station at 8:00 p.m.

534
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,381
After that, I went to the hotel

535
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:37,949
and checked in.

536
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,718
I went back to the hair salon.

537
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:45,590
But I still wanted to discuss
my son a little more,

538
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:50,028
so we arranged to meet again
at a restaurant.

539
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,730
What time was that?

540
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,034
- I think it was around 10:30.
- I think it was around 10:30.

541
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,905
Then we went to her house,
and drank together.

542
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,174
Since it was a hassle
to go back to the hotel,

543
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,710
I just stayed there until morning.

544
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,045
I remained there.

545
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,080
Ms. Iwamoto,

546
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:13,017
you were at the hair salon until
a little before 10:30, is that right?

547
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,085
Yes.

548
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,421
Was anyone else there with you?

549
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,589
No, I was alone.

550
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,534
Is it because they used to be married?

551
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,672
It's very interesting
how perfectly their alibis

552
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,442
line up with each other.

553
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,052
Now,

554
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:52,623
what I'm about to tell you
must be kept strictly confidential.

555
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,591
Yes, ma'am.

556
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,195
- Yes.
- Yes.

557
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,299
It turns out

558
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,203
that the weapon used in the murder
of Hideyuki Sakuma

559
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,473
is the gun that belonged
to Officer Kazuo Kiyohara,

560
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,142
which went missing 23 years ago.

561
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,077
- What?
- Ms. Nara.

562
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,379
Is this allowed?

563
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,715
This is confidential information
about the investigation.

564
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,619
You must be shocked by this news.

565
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:22,687
Yes.

566
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,159
Are you sure about that?

567
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,060
Yes.

568
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,964
Bullets fired from a handgun

569
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,932
have what are called rifling marks.

570
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,802
Rifling… marks?

571
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,770
I've never heard of that before.

572
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,641
- Really?
- Yes.

573
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,312
The person who killed Mr. Sakuma

574
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:51,582
was in possession of the gun that belonged
to Mr. Kiyohara's father.

575
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,452
Whether the culprit had the gun
for many years,

576
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,722
or acquired it recently is unclear.

577
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,690
But the source of the gun

578
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,360
is likely a key to solving the case.

579
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:07,765
So, that means the person who killed
Mr. Sakuma is someone connected

580
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,302
to the incident from 23 years ago?

581
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,604
I cannot say for sure.

582
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:19,410
But it is true that
there is some connection

583
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:23,548
between this incident
and the incident from 23 years ago.

584
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:26,651
Therefore,

585
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,554
I have a question for all of you

586
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,657
who were the first to discover
Officer Kiyohara's body.

587
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,063
While playing in the forest,

588
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,433
all of you heard gunshots.

589
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,970
While fleeing the forest,

590
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,740
you discovered the body
of Officer Kiyohara

591
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,844
and immediately left the forest
to report it to the police.

592
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,717
That's what the investigation file states.

593
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,956
Are there any discrepancies?

594
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,660
It was a long time ago,

595
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,797
so my memory is a bit hazy,

596
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,199
but I think it's mostly accurate.

597
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,739
What about you, Mr. Kiyohara?

598
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,747
I was in shock after discovering
my father's body,

599
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,282
and I was very upset.

600
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,086
<i>I don't remember the details very well,</i>

601
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,520
but yes, I think

602
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,023
that statement is generally accurate.

603
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:44,528
When the police discovered
Officer Kiyohara's body,

604
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,797
<i>his gun was already missing</i>

605
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,799
from his holster.

606
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,871
Did any of you witness anything
at the scene?

607
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,475
For example, a suspicious person

608
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,677
or any unusual sounds would be helpful.

609
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,880
Ms. Iwamoto, do you remember anything?

610
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:07,518
I don't remember much of what happened.

611
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,186
I was in a panic.

612
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,658
- I'm sorry.
- Mr. Sakuma, how about you?

613
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,994
I don't remember much either,

614
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:20,698
but there was a man lying on the ground
a short distance away

615
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,067
from Keisuke's father.

616
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,003
That must've been the culprit
Nobukazu Oshima.

617
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:27,571
Yes.

618
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,175
<i>He robbed 30 million yen</i>
<i>from an armored cash transport vehicle</i>

619
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,345
of a bank in Mitsuba City
and fired his gun.

620
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:40,484
That bullet
killed a male resident of that city.

621
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:47,024
It was always believed
that he had an accomplice,

622
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,696
and when we discovered
Officer Kiyohara's body,

623
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,699
the gun was missing.

624
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,302
It's presumed that the accomplice took it.

625
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,137
That's what Chief said.

626
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:02,873
There's

627
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,211
something that bothers me
about that speculation.

628
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,695
But never mind.

629
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,601
That's it?

630
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,635
For today.

631
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,376
In any case, the murder of Mr. Sakuma

632
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:41,812
is undoubtedly connected to the incident
that occurred 23 years ago.

633
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,149
See you again…

634
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,984
Mr. Keisuke Kiyohara.

635
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,088
Mr. Naoto Sakuma.

636
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,657
Ms. Makiko Iwamoto.

637
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,062
Mr. Junichi Tobina.

638
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,900
See them out.

639
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,568
Yes.

640
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,612
<i>Junichi,</i>

641
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,014
I

642
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,684
didn't open the time capsule.

643
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,321
Junichi.

644
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,593
Hm?

645
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,029
Are you leaving already?

646
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:34,832
Yeah.

647
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,367
I see.

648
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,304
Sorry, did I wake you?

649
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,506
No, it's time for me to wake up.

650
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:43,541
Okay.

651
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,542
Yeah.

652
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,878
Hey Junichi,

653
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,081
once your work settles down,
I want to go on a date.

654
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,483
A date?

655
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,721
- Yeah, I'll think of places to go.
- Yeah.

656
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,256
Okay.

657
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,224
Okay.

658
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,293
I gotta go.

659
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,829
- Someone suspicious?
- Yes.

660
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,931
Reports of sexual harassment
are increasing in this area.

661
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,033
I haven't seen anything.

662
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,367
I see.

663
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:11,635
Thank you for your time.

664
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,772
- Thank you.
- It's a great day for a walk, huh?

665
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,542
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

666
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,010
What a big dog.

667
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:23,481
- High-five. Wow.
- Good boy.

668
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,350
- It's a well-trained dog.
- Thank you.

669
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,352
He says you are well-trained.

670
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,221
Recent ongoing?

671
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,155
OPPOSE THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE SHOPPING MALL!

672
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,390
I think I remember seeing someone
walking around

673
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,593
inside the school grounds
during my evening walk.

674
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:37,628
When was that?

675
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:38,863
That was the day

676
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:41,699
when I ended up taking a late walk,
so it was Friday.

677
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:44,969
Was it a male or a female?

678
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:45,936
It was a man.

679
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,771
Can you describe him?

680
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,207
I couldn't see since it was too dark.

681
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,177
But I can identify the parked car.

682
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,679
It was a black SUV
with a Shinagawa license plate.

683
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,484
SHINAGAWA

684
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,557
<i>Is it because they used to be married?</i>

685
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,760
<i>It's very interesting how perfectly</i>
<i>their alibis line up with each other.</i>

686
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,910
‪I'l do it.

687
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:28,078
No,

688
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,214
- I'll do it.
- No.

689
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,882
Think of Masaki.

690
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,252
Plus, he might use his strength
against you.

691
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,422
- Can you really do it, Keisuke?
- Yeah, I can do it.

692
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:20,564
Wow!

693
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,566
So cool!

694
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,235
- Tobina.
- Yes?

695
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:29,139
You better not get too cocky.

696
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:31,442
I'm sorry.

697
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,110
All right, let's go.

698
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,013
Excuse me.

699
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,381
Enjoy.

700
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,670
You're saying that I have an accomplice?

701

708
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,229
<i>What are you doing?</i>

709
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,930
<i>The alibi has been proven wrong.</i>
