1
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,600
I'm the miracle doctor who drowned in your book.

2
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,920
Gu Xiaofeng.

3
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,120
Are you...

4
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,039
You're finally awake.

5
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,520
It's true.

6
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,680
Yes.

7
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
My brother...

8
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,880
Cherish the present.

9
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Can you tell me

10
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,680
What's wrong with you?

11
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,560
Don't ask anything.

12
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,720
I just want to hug you quietly.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,080
Okay.

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,800
Gosh.

15
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,960
They're giving us sugar.

16
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,240
Let's show them too.

17
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,280
Gu Xiaomei, come to the hospital.

18
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,040
My grandpa...

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
Something happened to Grandpa Mo.

20
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,760
Grandpa Mo!

21
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,800
Grandpa.

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,840
Gu Xiaomei is here.

23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,240
Xiaofeng.

24
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,079
Coming.

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,320
Xiaofeng is here.

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,760
How could this happen?

27
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,520
Grandpa Mo, I can save you.

28
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,440
Xiaofeng.

29
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,680
Don't do this.

30
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,120
Xiaofeng.

31
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,040
The hospital will never give up on treating patients.

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,440
Feng.

33
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,960
Grandpa Mo's illness...

34
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,480
can't be helped even if the deity comes.

35
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,120
Grandpa Mo.

36
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,079
I'm useless.

37
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,760
I can't save you.

38
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,880
Xiaofeng.

39
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,000
call me Grandpa Mo according to seniority.

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,640
In terms of medical skills,

41
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,480
I should call you master.

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,440
Don't blame yourself.

43
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,320
Son.

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,880
Follow me.

45
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,240
Feng studied Chinese medicine.

46
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,880
Chinese medicine?

47
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,560
has thousands of years of history in our country.

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,200
You have to believe it.

49
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,120
I believe it.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,240
I believe everything.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,640
You've recovered.

52
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,280
I promise you I will study medicine.

53
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,440
Sure.

54
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,880
Grandpa.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,840
Grandpa Mo.

56
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,200
Don't scare me, grandpa.

57
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,480
Grandpa Mo, wake up.

58
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,320
Grandpa Mo!

59
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,440
Grandpa, don't scare me.

60
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,960
Grandpa Mo.

61
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,000
I won't make you angry again, grandpa.

62
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,720
Wake up!

63
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,960
Wake up, grandpa!

64
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,600
Wake up, grandpa.

65
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
My grandpa told me to give this to you.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,280
Feng.

67
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,160
Help the dying.

68
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,280
It's the responsibility of

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,440
is the responsibility of Chinese medicine.

70
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,920
But my grandson is extremely talented.

71
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,440
He's limited.

72
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,960
Please take care of him.

73
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,760
Ren Yi.

74
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,400
Grandpa Mo is very nice.

75
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,640
He taught me everything.

76
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,640
He always thinks about me.

77
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,040
But I don't have Grandpa Mo anymore.

78
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
You still have me.

79
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,040
No matter what happens,

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,960
let's face it together.

81
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,120
OK?

82
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,200
Ren Yi.
