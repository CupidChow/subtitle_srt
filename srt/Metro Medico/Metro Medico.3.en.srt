1
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,000
I said it wasn't intentional.

2
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Will you believe me, sir?

3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,280
Come here.

4
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,480
Let's see how much longer you can endure.

5
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,840
Change your clothes so you don't catch a cold.

6
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,760
Hey.

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,400
Dr. Ren.

8
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,000
We couldn't find the patient you mentioned.

9
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,960
Young master, do you need my help to treat your headache?

10
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,280
No need.

11
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,080
Just stay away from me.

12
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,200
Young master, you've had a tiring journey today.

13
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,560
I

14
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,720
should do something for you.

15
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,200
Ah.

16
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,640
Alright.

17
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,160
The letter.

18
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,080
Where did he hide it?

19
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,160
In my room.

20
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,840
In the cabinet.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,280
In the drawer.

22
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,840
In the second drawer.

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,680
It's locked.

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,240
Could the key be on him?

25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,520
Young master.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,680
Young master.

27
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,480
As expected, it's on him.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,560
Get out.

29
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,360
Hey, hey, hey!

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,560
Who even wants to look?

31
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,040
I don't believe you won't come out.

32
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,200
Even my master doesn't want me anymore.

33
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,440
Except for you,

34
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,160
I have nowhere else to go.

35
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,040
Liar.

36
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,440
Who are you?

37
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,800
What?

38
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,840
I can't believe my brother is such a jerk.

39
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,760
Don't worry.

40
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,520
From now on, you'll live here.

41
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,040
Okay.

42
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,000
If anyone dares to make you leave,

43
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
I'll make them leave instead.

44
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,800
Hmph.

45
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,040
Sigh.

46
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,480
Should we go easy or tough this time?

47
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,680
Watch me.

48
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,400
Okay.

49
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,120
Miss,

50
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,280
let me take you out for some fun.

51
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,000
So you actually came back.

52
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
How many times have I told you?

53
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,560
You need to cooperate with the treatment.

54
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,800
With my special condition,

55
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,480
even if I survive the liver cancer surgery,

56
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,640
I can't handle chemotherapy.

57
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,760
I'm not getting treated.

58
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,000
Your illness

59
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,200
I can cure it

60
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,640
You're a doctor too?

61
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,360
Of course

62
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,920
Hey

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,160
Wait, don't tell me yet

64
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,320
Let me guess

65
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,760
You're my brother's colleague, right?

66
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
You like my brother, don't you?

67
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,560
I do not!

68
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,680
He and I, we... ah

69
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,040
No need to explain

70
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,960
There are plenty of female doctors and nurses who like my brother

71
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,480
I can't tell her my real purpose

72
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,040
But

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,880
You're the first one he's brought home

74
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,680
By the way, what's your name?

75
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,840
Gu Xiaofeng

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,800
Gu Xiaofeng

77
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,000
Feng as in maple leaf, right

78
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
No wonder you seem so familiar

79
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,640
So it's fate arranged by the heavens

80
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
As my sister-in-law

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll accept you first

82
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,000
Mm

83
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,160
What do you mean?

84
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,800
About you pursuing my brother

85
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,960
I'll help you

86
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,680
Okay

87
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,120
But

88
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,960
The way you're dressed

89
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,320
Isn't really my brother's type

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,880
Mm

91
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,600
Not bad, not bad

92
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,320
Is this really okay?

93
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,520
What do you think?

94
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,360
What exactly is her goal?

95
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,280
What goal could I possibly have?

96
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,800
I just want to know

97
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
what your goal is.

98
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
You should take her to the police station.

99
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,840
I don't want to leave the young master.

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,200
I haven't gotten the letter yet. I can't give up now.

101
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,920
It does fit the delusional infatuation type.

102
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Yeah.

103
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
This object of delusion—

104
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,680
—is it random?
