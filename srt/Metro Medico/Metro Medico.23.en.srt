1
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,320
You didn't expect

2
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,680
the person you couldn't tolerate

3
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,960
In the end,

4
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,840
I saved my daughter.

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,840
I did my best.

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:47,920
You...

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,840
Take care of her.

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,400
You're scary.

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,240
Done.

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,760
In less than a month,

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,000
Mo will wake up.

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,720
You're amazing.

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,280
You have to wait for a month.

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,320
I didn't do anything.

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,640
I didn't do anything.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,560
Then who did it?

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,000
Did you give the manuscript to someone else?

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,920
How dare I?

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,840
Oh.

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,800
Can't you fix it here?

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,520
Actually, I'm confused now.

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,039
Every time I didn't draw Gu back,

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,680
before she came back.

24
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,080
So I'm worried

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,520
if we don't follow

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,240
the plot you set,

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,080
anything could happen.

28
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,479
May I ask

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,960
where you went last time.

30
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,560
I was just asking.

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,760
Just asking.

32
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,920
Brother Mo,

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,919
I've bought it from the clinic.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,199
From now on,

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,640
no matter I'm here or not,

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,120
I hope you can protect it.

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,400
Only if you trust Chinese medicine,

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,000
can you feel how powerful it is.

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,240
Okay.

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,720
Bye.

41
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,360
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm too ashamed to see you.

43
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,480
Tell me.

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,720
When did you wake up?

45
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,600
Just...

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,880
Just now.

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,280
Really?

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,880
Ren Yi.

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,040
Let's not disturb him.

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,240
Okay.

51
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,400
Open your eyes.

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,920
Is it fun?

53
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,360
Gao Xi.

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,400
Brother Mo.

55
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,440
I don't want to hear you say thank you.

56
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,000
I...

57
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,440
Go ahead.

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,280
I want to go to the toilet.

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,120
Mo is awake.

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,440
Wang Yu Qiang is arrested.

61
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,680
I’m relieved.

62
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,680
Ren Yi.

63
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,480
Thank you for buying Grandpa Mo's clinic for me.

64
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,720
But Wang Yu Qiang insisted

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,360
It's all his doing.

66
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,280
Let's go. Let's go.

67
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,880
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
It's okay.

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,040
It's not your fault.

70
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,280
The evil will be punished sooner or later.

71
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,560
Have you seen the butterfly effect?

72
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,640
Gu Xiaofeng.

73
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,320
The butterfly

74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,200
That butterfly...

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,360
It's just...

76
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,480
I'm afraid you'll disappear suddenly.

77
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,520
My existence

78
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,280
has nothing to do with comics.

79
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,720
It doesn't

80
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
to me.

81
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,360
Because Gu is not a fiction.

82
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,040
Since I existed in history,

83
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,600
it's probably because something hasn't been solved.

84
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,320
That's why I travelled back and forth.

85
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,960
The Jiuzhou Continent.

86
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,920
In the year of Tianqi,

87
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,080
Doctor Gu Xiaofeng was ordered

88
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,000
to save the plague in Haicheng. This may be the root.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,720
Gu Xiaofeng found something strange,

90
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,800
but he was ambushed.

91
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
I disagree.

92
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,040
I'll be fine.

93
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,800
What are you doing?

94
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,200
That's just your assumption.

95
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,480
Besides,

96
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,800
how can you solve

97
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,040
such a big plague?

98
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,480
The plague wasn't that bad.

99
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,200
It's only because someone did it on purpose.

100
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,240
As long as we catch the mastermind,

101
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,680
the plague will be controlled soon.

102
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,240
In that case,

103
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,960
I can't let you take the risk.

104
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,320
I can protect myself.

105
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,360
If you don't save them,

106
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,480
they will die too.

107
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,600
That's different.

108
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,880
Ren Yi.

109
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,440
I'm a doctor.

110
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,840
You want me to watch so many people die?

111
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,040
I can't do that.

112
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,720
Xiaofeng.

113
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,840
You want me to watch you take the risk?

114
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,680
How can I do that?

115
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,680
Cheers.

116
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,680
Cheers.

117
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
This time,

118
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm here to say goodbye.

119
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,640
Gu Xiaomei.

120
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,840
If you fight them alone,

121
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,720
how can you come back safely?

122
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Do you remember

123
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
the question Gao Xi asked me before?

124
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,320
May I ask

125
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,520
where did you go last time?

126
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,480
Twice.

127
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,080
I went back to the bottom of the Lake of Haicheng.

128
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,680
not the Pangu era set by Gao Xi.

129
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,320
I also found something in common.

130
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,320
Ren Yi.

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,520
I came back because of your call.

132
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,880
It's not a story at all.

133
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,360
So...

134
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,880
I believe

135
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,159
as long as we are in sync,

136
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,520
I will come back.

137
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,440
Goodness.

138
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,880
I'm just going somewhere far.

139
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,760
Ren Yi.

140
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,840
Make everyone happy.

141
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,560
Marry me.

142
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,320
Ren Yi.

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,880
Wait for me.

144
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,760
Okay.

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,680
Yes.

146
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,400
Yes.
