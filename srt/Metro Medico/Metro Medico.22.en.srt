1
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,800
Qian Chunmei has a mother like you.

2
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,680
to have a mother like you.

3
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,080
The patient is dying.

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's do it at the same time.

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,560
The chance of success will be higher.

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,560
I can use acupuncture to stop the bleeding.

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,560
This will minimize the damage to the patient.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,040
and we can get more emergency time.

9
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,080
She's finally out of danger.

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,720
Luckily, you came in time.

11
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,640
It's you and me.

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,520
the perfect combination

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,960
of Chinese medicine and Western medicine.

14
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,600
Yes.

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,640
It's me and you.

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,240
Yes.

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,160
Mok Ho-gyeom.

18
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,880
Mo Haojin.

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,480
You must be fine.

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't scare me.

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,479
Mo Haojin.

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,560
Mo Haojin.

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,680
Let's go.

24
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,360
Mr. Jiang.

25
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,560
How is he?

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
He was hit in the head.

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,280
His brain is badly damaged.

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,640
We don't know

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,640
if he can wake up.

30
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,720
What happened?

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,400
Where did you kidnap Gu Xiaomei?

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,880
We didn't kidnap her.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,840
I saw her in your car today.

34
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,480
GUILDT.

35
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,640
Let’s invite Dr. Gu here.

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,680
None of your business.

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,800
You said you didn't tie her up.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,160
Kid.

39
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,080
I think you're here for trouble.

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,840
Let’s settle the score together.

41
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,440
Gu Xiaofeng.

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
You're a jinx.

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,920
If anything happens to Mo,

44
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,240
I won't let you go.

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,400
Mowgli is in this state because of you.

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,520
How dare you pretend to be pitiful?

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,120
Leave now.

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,240
I'm not leaving.

49
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,440
This is a hospital.

50
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,560
Enough!

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,640
Let's save him together.

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Okay.

53
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,360
No hospital

54
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,160
they won't allow you to treat patients without permission.

55
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,360
Being discharged

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,600
is the only choice.

57
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,680
What if it can't be cured?

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,840
I trust you.

59
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,800
En en en

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,640
Brother Mo.

61
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,480
I can save you.

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,160
Look.

63
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,160
Look. Look. Look.

64
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,520
You...

65
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,400
This slap is for you.

66
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,920
It's not your turn to speak for Mo.

67
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,520
You...

68
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,760
I'll write you to death again.

69
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,440
Believe it or not,

70
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,200
I'll make you shut up forever.

71
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
You're breaking the law.

72
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,280
So what?

73
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,200
I don't belong here anyway.

74
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,079
I'll just go back to the world of comics.

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,680
You...

76
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,560
Can you really save Mo?

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,160
Thank you for saving Mo.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
It's not your turn to say thank you.

79
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,200
Well,

80
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,040
what can I do for Mo?

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,200
Actually,

82
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,120
You...

83
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,160
Not bad.

84
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,600
Just give up if you can't catch up.

85
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,680
Why don't you give up?

86
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,480
I...

87
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,640
I still have hope.

88
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
I still think I have a chance.

89
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,960
While I still see you as my target,

90
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,640
Wake up.

91
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,560
Don't be like Ren Yi.

92
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,680
like that Lin Yi.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,760
Regret?

94
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,760
I lured the wolf into the house.

95
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,159
I should be the one

96
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,880
should be me.

97
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,280
There's one more thing I don't understand.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,080
Master knew

99
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,480
Qian Chunmei's success rate is slim.

100
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,880
Why do you keep trying?

101
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,480
Didn't you say it was for some instrument?

102
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,280
In the past,

103
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,920
Master would never trade patients

104
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,440
just because of a few instruments.

105
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Of course Mr. Jiang didn't do it for a deal.

106
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,720
He just wants to make up for it.

107
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,440
Mr. Jiang and Qian Chunmei's parents

108
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
have known each other for a long time.

109
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,400
It's strange.

110
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,360
Zhou Hong refused

111
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,840
she refused.

112
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,720
to send her daughter to the hospital for a check-up.

113
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,120
She chose you instead.

114
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,800
Because the two of them were fierce.

115
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,640
So Mr. Jiang

116
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,600
put in a good word

117
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,840
for you.
