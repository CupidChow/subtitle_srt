1
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,400
Here.

2
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,480
acupuncture can be cured.

3
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,840
Yes.

4
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,560
Qian Chunmei is waiting for you to protect her.

5
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,440
I trust you.

6
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,800
[I trust you.]

7
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,560
Come here.

8
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,000
Come here.

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,560
You don't trust me?

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,000
Ah.

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,760
Ren Yi.

12
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,080
I remember everything.

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,280
But...

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,480
I'm traumatized.

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,400
No way.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,440
Because you're the doctor

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,759
There's no turning back the ending.

18
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,960
So I drew an extra for Gu.

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,920
That's why this can't happen.

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,800
What's the extra ending?

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,920
Well...

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,800
I just drew the introduction for you.

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,000
You came back before you came back.

24
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,680
That's why you're disappearing now.

25
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,280
[Unless...]

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,760
Mo Haojin.

27
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,680
What are you doing?

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,400
Shouldn't I ask you that?

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,440
If you were willing to cooperate with me,

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,080
I wouldn't have put in so much effort.

31
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,240
She's not a real person.

32
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Why bother?

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,000
Ah.

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:15,840
Ah!

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Stop pretending.

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,280
What did you do to her?

37
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,840
Is it...

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,160
It's too late.

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,240
Gao Xi.

40
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,800
Gao Xi.

41
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,840
If I can save him,

42
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,160
I will never give up on any patient.

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,160
You didn't have to do that before.

44
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,920
I'm sorry

45
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,280
was my fault.

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,720
As long as my daughter lives to 18,

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Do whatever you want.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,880
I'll save him.

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,560
But that's not why.

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,000
It doesn't matter.

51
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,880
Since you promised,

52
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,040
I can guarantee

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
I can guarantee that.

54
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,120
Xiaofeng.

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,200
Xiaofeng.

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,440
Ren Yi.

57
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,600
Xiaofeng.

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,720
Xiaofeng!

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,760
Where did she go?

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,600
According to my previous inference,

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,600
if Gu's extra comic is published,

62
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,400
Gu might never come back.

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
I checked the hospital's CCTV.

64
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,320
The only suspect is...

65
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,320
Gao Xi.

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,800
Mo Haojin.

67
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,680
You always pull my collar.

68
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,360
Don't you know how to be tender?

69
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,600
Change the ending for me.

70
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,640
The manuscript has been printed.

71
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,920
Let's do it again.

72
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,880
Dr. Ren.

73
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,560
Gao Xi.

74
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,040
Where did you take the manuscript?

75
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,280
Didn't you say

76
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,000
Gu Xiaofeng has disappeared?

77
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,320
Even if we get the manuscript back,

78
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,240
it's useless.

79
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,800
You...

80
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,720
How do you know if you don't try?

81
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,040
I don't want to try.

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,400
Gao Xi.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,320
I'll send her to Pangu Era.

84
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,760
Ah.

85
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,600
So

86
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,160
it's impossible to come back.

87
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,240
Hey.

88
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,399
Let's go.

89
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,560
Keep writing according to your original setting.

90
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
If the publisher finds out that Gao Xi stole your manuscript,

91
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,080
it won't be published.

92
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,320
Yes.

93
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,280
What can I do for Gu Xiaomei?

94
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,280
Before Miao Zi Shi is finished,

95
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,240
Watch Gao Xi.

96
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Brother.

97
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,480
Xiaofeng.

98
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,960
You must come back.
