1
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,440
It's here.

2
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,680
Do you remember this place?

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,040
This is where we first met.

4
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,520
Xiaofeng.

5
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
Being a doctor

6
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,680
to have you.

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,880
Ren Yi.

8
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,720
Having you in my life

9
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,440
is my greatest luck.

10
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,880
Remember me.

11
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,280
Love is like spring that grows endlessly.

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,120
Whether I can come back or not,

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,680
my love for you will never disappear.

14
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,720
Xiaofeng.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,880
Come back safely.

16
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,640
[Master]

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,120
Master

18
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,000
Xiaodie

19
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,680
I'm back, Master.

20
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,440
Xiaodie, I'm back.

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,480
Master and I are so worried about you.

22
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,320
Xiaofeng.

23
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,520
You fell into the water when you went to Haicheng to save the plague.

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,200
It was Qi Xuan and General Qi who saved you.

25
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,520
Qi Xuan.

26
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,240
Ren Yi, why are you here?

27
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,800
Physician Gu, I...

28
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,920
It doesn't matter.

29
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,600
It's not safe here.

30
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,560
You have to go back.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,840
Thank you for your concern, Physician Gu.

32
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,800
I'm fine now.

33
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
What happened?

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,880
Are you hurt?

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,560
Dr. Gu.

36
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,040
This is inappropriate.

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,240
Physician Gu,

38
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,240
Why are you so rude?

39
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,160
Let's go.

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,560
Dr. Gu.

41
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,120
What are you doing?

42
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,360
Lie down.

43
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,000
What?

44
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,160
You're a doctor who saves lives,

45
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,320
but it doesn't mean you can do that.

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,040
I have something important to do.

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,280
I’m leaving.

48
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,240
What's going on?

49
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,600
It's not Ren Yi.

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,960
Ah.

51
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,800
I'm really back.

52
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,360
Is he really dead?

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,080
or poisoned?

54
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,440
Jiang Zhicheng.

55
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,640
His name is Hashikura.

56
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,280
You are in cahoots.

57
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,160
Hashikura killed you.

58
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,600
I saved you.

59
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,880
What's going on?

60
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,960
It's that letter.

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,760
Confession letter.

62
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,640
Her daughter was infected with the plague.

63
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
was isolated by the government of Haicheng and died.

64
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,320
After the firewood warehouse stole the dead daughter,

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,080
he spread the plague on purpose.

66
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,360
If this world is unfair to me,

67
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,880
why should I care about others' lives?

68
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,840
General Qi.

69
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,360
Are you not going back to the court?

70
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,960
The warehouse is dead.

71
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,720
It's more important

72
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,880
is far more important than returning to the court.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,600
Thank you.

74
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,720
General Qi.

75
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,600
Drink slowly.

76
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,440
Thank you.

77
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,440
Here.

78
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,720
Life and death are human nature.

79
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,520
But

80
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,360
someone doesn't cherish it.

81
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
I have the same jade pendant as you.

82
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,840
In the 21st century,

83
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,720
This is called flirting.

84
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,840
It's not the same

85
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,880
Mine.

86
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,400
I carved the word Xuan.

87
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,080
Ren Yi.

88
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,920
When I'm not around,

89
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,159
you should smile more.

90
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,920
This jade pendant

91
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,760
as your reward for these days.

92
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Xiaofeng.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,520
When will you be back?

94
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,480
Pay special attention to this patient.

95
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,560
Director.

96
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,080
We have a new intern.

97
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,560
The director wants you to take him.

98
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,800
Hello, Director.

99
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,560
I'm the new intern.

100
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,320
Nice to meet you.

101
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,880
It's finally over.
