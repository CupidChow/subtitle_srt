00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,840
Jiuzhou Continent

2
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,400
Year of Tianqi

3
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,360
Divine doctor Gu Xiaofeng, under imperial orders,

4
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,360
went to Haicheng to cure the plague.

5
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,360
Gu Xiaofeng discovered something suspicious,

6
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,680
but was ambushed and silenced.

7
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,440
That letter is the evidence of the crime.

8
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,920
Miao Zishi

9
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,320
Come back with me.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,960
Come back with me.

11
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,440
Hey.

12
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,680
Hey, hey.

13
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,200
Hey.

14
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,240
Thank you.

15
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,000
You're welcome.

16
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,880
What a handsome young man.

17
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,560
But such strange clothes...

18
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,040
Is this a dream?

19
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,360
Hey, young master.

20
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,040
This isn't a dream.

21
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,240
It's him.

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,520
What happened just now was an accident. I'm not going with you.

23
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,040
What do you mean?

24
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,200
You've caused a lot of harm.

25
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,320
And you still want to take advantage of me.

26
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,880
I'm trying to save you.

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
You're talking nonsense.

28
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,960
Where is this place?

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,520
Why did you bring me here? What's your intention?

30
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,920
This is ridiculous.

31
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,360
What's making that noise?

32
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,200
Hello?

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,520
Dr. Ren, you're going to be late for work.

34
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
Okay, I'll be there right away.

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,240
Since someone deliberately caused the plague,

36
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,600
that letter must be the key.

37
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,040
This place is quite strange.

38
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,400
It's best not to act rashly.

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,520
It might be better to play along with him for now.

40
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,400
And use the opportunity to find out who's behind all this.

41
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,600
Young master, you can't leave.

42
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,560
If you leave, you have to take me with you.

43
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,320
Hey, young master!

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,320
We just had physical contact.

45
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,720
Don't you want to take responsibility?

46
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,760
Are you just going to walk away?

47
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,400
If you need a doctor, you can come to me.

48
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,880
I'm looking for you right now.

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,640
Let go.

50
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,400
You let go.

51
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,200
I won't let go.

52
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,200
Stop.

53
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,880
Don't move.

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,040
Dad

55
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,080
Dad, Dad

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,520
Save my dad, please

57
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Dad, Dad

58
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,600
Dad, wake up, Dad

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,880
Dad

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,440
You have to save my dad

61
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,840
Dad, Dad, Dad

62
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,480
Dad

63
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
That's so strange

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
What kind of sedan chair is this?

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,680
Are you sure you want me to take you away?

66
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,080
I'm sure

67
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,360
Dr. Ren, the surgery is about to start

68
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,480
We're running out of time

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,720
Has Ren Yi come back yet?

70
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,040
Dr. Ren went to pick up his sister

71
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,000
He hasn't come back yet

72
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,280
Young master, why are you tying me up?

73
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,800
Young master, I'm scared

74
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,920
If you're scared, just close your eyes

75
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240
The patient has a brainstem hemorrhage

76
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,240
The pupils are starting to dilate

77
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,720
Remove the hematoma and lower the intracranial pressure

78
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm so dizzy.

79
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,160
As an emergency department medical staff member,

80
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,400
leaving your post without permission violates hospital regulations.

81
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,800
Do you know what the consequences are?

82
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,040
I know.

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,160
Forget it.

84
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,640
Take good care of your sister.

85
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,920
Given her condition,

86
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,200
she can't be running around anymore.

87
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,520
Thank you, Master.

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,960
By the way,

89
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,920
that patient from today—

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
how is he doing?

91
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,200
He suffered a severe blow to the head.

92
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,920
It caused serious brain damage.

93
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,120
Whether he wakes up depends on himself.

94
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,080
Hey, I can do this—

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,440
Cure

96
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,720
I can cure this.

97
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,200
A heavy blow to the head.

98
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,680
Then fainting and falling into a deep sleep.

99
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,080
Acupuncture can be used.

100
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,520
Draw blood from the Zhigou and Hegu acupoints.

101
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,520
Try to wake them up.

102
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,240
This—

103
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,080
I can cure it.

104
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,880
You should cure your carsickness first.

105
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,440
Let's go.

106
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,480
Carsick, Master.

107
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,320
What kind of illness is that?

108
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,800
Master, I'll take her away first.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,240
Come with me—oh, young master.

110
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,400
Hey, help me up.

111
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,520
Don't talk.

112
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,600
Young master, to be honest—

113
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,800
Your master is nothing compared to mine.

114
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm telling the truth.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,240
I've treated patients who fell off cliffs.

116
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,120
Since it's all head trauma,

117
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,920
it's definitely worth a try.

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,520
Try?

119
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,800
It's about saving a life.

120
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
You actually used the word "try"?

121
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,360
If you don't have a medical license,

122
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,240
even if you were Hua Tuo reborn,

123
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,440
you absolutely can't go near the patient.

124
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,240
Listen to the young master.

125
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,360
Young Master

126
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,760
Where are we?

127
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,640
Haicheng

128
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,240
Haicheng, huh.

129
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
Do you think I've never seen the world?

130
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,040
Young Master

131
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,160
What are we going to eat?

132
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
Are we going to your residence after eating?

133
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,680
Can I stay at your residence for a few days?

134
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,880
I don't need servants to wait on me.

135
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,360
I'm driving. I need to focus.

136
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,600
I'll listen to you, Young Master.

137
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,800
The buildings here are so tall.

138
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,240
Won't they fall over?
