1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,840
Dr. Ren.

2
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,800
Gu Xiaofeng won't come back.

3
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,200
Why are you torturing yourself?

4
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,440
Give me the medicine.

5
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,520
No.

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,200
Unless you promise me

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,240
forget Gu Xiaofeng.

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,280
Doctor Ren.

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,240
Will you do it or not?

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,000
Gu Xiaofeng.

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,480
Doctor Ren.

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,680
Where are you going?

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,039
Crush him to death.

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,680
Ren Yi.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,840
Three four.

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,440
Xiaofeng.

17
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,520
I'll do it.

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
I'll wait for you.

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,720
Is anyone in the clinic?

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,480
No.

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,400
Mo,

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,000
I might

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,920
let Grandpa Mo down.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,520
Also,

25
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,440
this

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,039
this.

27
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,880
What else can I do for you?

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
just let me know.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,480
Thank you for bringing me here.

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,200
Bye.

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,520
Gu Xiaomei.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,520
If you're willing,

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,040
you can come back anytime.

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,640
Are you still playing?

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,640
Show your cards.

36
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,160
Get lost!

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,320
Gu Xiaomei.

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,160
You're back.

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,360
Who are you?

40
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
This...

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,800
Didn't you leave this to me?

42
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,360
for me?

43
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,520
I'm not good at learning.

44
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,120
I can't understand a lot.

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Now that you're back,

46
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
I'll do chores for you.

47
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,880
I really wrote it.

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,640
You...

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,760
seem different.

50
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,440
I don't remember.

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,640
I'm hallucinating again.

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,160
Mo.

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,240
Do I know

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,480
Do I know him?

55
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:34,880
No.

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,560
Stay away from

57
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,200
with all kinds of people.

58
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,720
There are too many men who like to flirt with.

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,040
Mo.

60
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,600
Yes?

61
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,520
Tell me more about the past.

62
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,680
The past

63
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,480
doesn't matter anymore.

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,880
What matters is

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,160
you and I will protect

66
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,040
your grandpa Mo's clinic.

67
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,320
Gu Xiaomei.

68
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
I won't let you leave me again.

69
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,160
That wasn't an illusion.

70
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,160
Xiaofeng is back.

71
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,320
How could she not know me?

72
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,079
Feng, have you forgotten me?

73
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,160
Hello?

74
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,000
Dr. Ren, there's a patient in the ER.

75
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,120
I need you to come back.

76
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,680
Okay.

77
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,120
Feng, wait for me.

78
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:41,920
Staff schedule.

79
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:45,800
Director team.

80
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:49,960
Props team.

81
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:58,920
The dubbing team.
