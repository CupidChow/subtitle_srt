1
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,680
That was a special situation.

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,440
I can go to

3
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
for Chun.

4
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,960
It's too late.

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,240
He has been sent to the hospital.

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,280
Wait.

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
I have something to say.

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,600
Do you have any last words?

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,920
Well...

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,840
Destroy her!

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,960
Stop!

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,600
AY!

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,560
Go!

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,039
Ah!

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,960
Be careful.

16
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,039
Ah.

17
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,120
I'm glad you're back.

18
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,160
Thank you for saving me.

19
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,360
I failed to protect you.

20
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,640
I won't let you go again.

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
I think...

22
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,560
I think I remember.

23
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,800
Wait for me at home.

24
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,640
I'll find my way home.

25
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,480
Okay.

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,800
Ren Yi.

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,360
Let me do it.

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,640
I want to set up

29
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,920
Five, nine, two, one.

30
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,520
Five.

31
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,880
Nine.

32
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,200
Xiaofeng.

33
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,920
You're back.

34
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,079
Xiaofeng.

35
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,880
You're finally back.

36
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,960
Brother.

37
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
Can you behave?

38
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,159
There are kids here.

39
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,280
Tell me.

40
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,200
how are you going to thank me, God of Matchmaking?

41
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,600
I was just about to ask.

42
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,280
What's going on?

43
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,960
I don't know either.

44
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,280
Xiaofeng.

45
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,040
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

46
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,440
Sure.

47
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,680
Brother.

48
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,280
What about me? What about me?

49
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,080
Kids.

50
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,280
Mind your own business.

51
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,440
Let's go.

52
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,320
Hum.

53
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,960
What are we going to eat today?

54
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,320
I'll take you to eat the best crayfish in Haicheng today.

55
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,720
How delicious is it?

56
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,480
It's very delicious.

57
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Gu Xiaofeng again?

58
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,040
Darn it.

59
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,960
You're the one who's sick.

60
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,320
Your whole family is sick, Xiaofeng.

61
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,840
Your whole family is sick, Gu Xiaofeng.

62
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Do you respect the psychiatrist?

63
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,800
Listen to me.

64
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,760
He said I'm sick.

65
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,159
Some doctors

66
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,120
often say people are sick.

67
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,560
Why can't you accept it

68
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,640
the doctor himself?

69
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,880
That's different.

70
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,400
psychological trauma and physical trauma.

71
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,320
It's all trauma.

72
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,840
Memory loss is also a symptom.

73
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,120
I understand.

74
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,560
But...

75
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,360
You just don't want to admit it, right?

76
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,040
Do you trust me?

77
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,160
I believe you.

78
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,480
I also believe that I will remember.

79
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,000
I already remember you.

80
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,840
Hello?

81
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
Doctor Ren, Qian Chunmei's condition is getting worse.

82
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,159
More serious?

83
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,760
Okay.

84
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,120
Okay.

85
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,040
What's wrong?

86
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,440
Chun's illness

87
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,200
is getting worse.

88
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,240
It seems that reviewing my medical skills

89
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,280
to review my medical skills.
