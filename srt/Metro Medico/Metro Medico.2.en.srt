1
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,160
What a strange place.

2
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,040
Such a handsome young man,

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,920
how could he be so cruel?

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,480
Hmph, drugging someone.

5
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,040
As expected, they're all hypocrites in disguise.

6
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,960
Drink this.

7
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,360
I just need this.

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,520
This works.

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,880
Trying to harm me.

10
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,360
The medicine is bitter, I won't drink it.

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,320
I prepared this for you.

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,240
What other tricks are you trying to pull?

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,600
Have you seen enough?

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,000
Not yet.

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,160
Hurry up and drink it.

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,120
Come on, drink it.

17
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,680
Hmm, what kind of poison is this?

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,960
No matter what kind of poison it is,

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,400
it's not that easy to harm me.

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,320
It hasn't been long since I fell into the water.

21
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,480
That letter must be hidden on him.

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,960
I need to find a way to search him.

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,400
Ah!

24
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,920
Trying to set a fire to harm me.

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,680
People here

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,760
actually eat this?

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,200
Then how do you eat without a spoon or chopsticks?

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
Young master, you eat first.

29
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm not hungry.

30
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,280
Just eat.

31
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,080
You actually don't dare to eat it.

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,320
Young master.

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,960
Can you not stare at me?

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,200
It's so embarrassing.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,760
Why is that lady poking the hamburger?

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,960
I want to eat too.

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,040
You can't eat hamburgers.

38
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,920
Everyone else can eat, I want to eat too.

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
You need to eat light food.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,080
Can't eat spicy food, don't want it.

41
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,920
I want to eat it.

42
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,480
I want to eat the same as her, I want it.

43
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,440
Alright, alright.

44
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,400
Wang Yuqiang.

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,240
Go buy it for her.

46
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,400
At least it can fill you up.

47
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,160
I want to eat at the restaurant.

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
Wang Yuqiang, stop her quickly.

49
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,400
Stop her quickly.

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Call an ambulance.

51
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,160
What's going on? What's happening?

52
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,360
Go take a look.

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,920
What happened? What's wrong?

54
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,840
Are you okay?

55
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,680
What are you doing?

56
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,120
Saving someone.

57
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,320
If something happens, you'll be responsible.

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,680
If you just stand by now,

59
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,960
there will only be bigger problems.

60
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,200
Chunmei

61
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,960
The little girl is awake.

62
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,600
Yes, yes.

63
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,120
Look, look!

64
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,920
After she gave a few acupuncture needles, the little girl really woke up.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,960
That's amazing.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,680
How did she do that?

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,360
Is acupuncture really that powerful?

68
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,600
This girl is really skilled.

69
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,760
You're finally awake.

70
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,240
You really scared your mom.

71
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,040
Yeah.

72
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,440
That's right, it's wonderful.

73
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,920
This little girl isn't just suffering from blood deficiency and internal wind.

74
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,440
Her condition is actually quite serious.

75
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,000
She is probably allergic to something in the hamburger bun—

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,240
specifically, wheat gluten.

77
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,840
This caused an electrolyte imbalance.

78
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,360
Along with abnormal low sodium.

79
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,360
So,

80
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,760
that's why she was in that state just now.

81
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,560
It's just an allergy.

82
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,640
No need to worry.

83
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,880
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,240
Theory.

85
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,640
Stop following me.

86
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,840
I made my judgment after checking her pulse.

87
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,760
Don't you know you should watch for cars when walking?

88
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,760
I only have eyes for you.

89
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,280
You can go home.

90
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,080
I don't have a home.

91
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,480
Then...

92
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,400
What about your master?

93
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,200
My master doesn't want me anymore either.

94
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,280
Except for you,

95
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
I have nowhere else to go.

96
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll take you somewhere.

97
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,880
Okay!

98
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,560
You're saying you don't know her?

99
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,720
She's been following you all along.

100
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,640
It's not that easy to get rid of me.

101
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,640
Young master.

102
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,560
You treated me like that last night,

103
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,040
and now you say you don't know me today.

104
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,400
How heartless.

105
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,280
I'm warning you.

106
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,880
Stop messing with my things.

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,520
The letter must be hidden in his house.

108
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,760
I have to look for it.

109
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,120
Young master.

110
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,960
Is this okay?

111
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,120
Young master.

112
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,000
Are you getting back at me?

113
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
I'm disinfecting.

114
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,520
Looks to me like you're trying to erase evidence. Hmph.

115
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,640
Young master.

116
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,280
Young master, is this you?

117
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,040
Is this you?

118
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,920
Give it to me.

119
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Where did you hide the letter?

120
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,960
Give it to me.

121
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,360
Young master.

122
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,400
You dislike me.
