1
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,120
If you want money,

2
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,960
don't touch her.

3
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,360
Doggie bear.

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
You want to be a hero too?

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,880
Bah!

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,320
I wanted you to come back

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,080
if there's anything you need.

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,280
I didn't expect

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,200
Why did you sell the clinic?

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,400
The bank is rushing me.

11
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,280
and borrowed money from someone.

12
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,600
I can't stand it anymore.

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,480
Grandpa Mo left the clinic.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,160
You can't give up.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,160
What can I do?

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,520
Western medicine

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,440
Chinese medicine has long become

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,280
to comfort people.

19
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,039
With my ability,

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,920
who would believe that?

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,480
Everything has ups and downs.

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,640
Grass has withered.

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,600
Chinese medicine has history for thousands of years.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,320
It can definitely restore its vitality.

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,360
How long do we have to wait?

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,080
What's important is

27
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,000
this thing

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,840
doesn't make money.

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,400
Gu Xiaomei,

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,479
Stay here and protect Mowait Clinic with me.

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,000
I can't.

32
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,320
There are many reasons for amnesia.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,520
You'd better bring her here for a check-up.

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,280
Okay.

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,120
Hurry.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,160
Help!

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,120
Who are you?

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,400
Go up.

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,160
Let's go.

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,680
Xiaofeng.

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,520
Feng!

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,040
Help! Stay still!

43
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,880
Let go of me!

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,000
Xiaofeng.

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,920
Gu Xiaofeng.

46
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,280
Xiaofeng.

47
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,960
I won't let you get hurt again.

48
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,360
Needle, take the needle away.

49
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,200
Needle Hurry

50
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,000
Get the needle.

51
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,960
Let go of me!

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,280
Physician Gu,

53
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,440
As long as you can cure Qian Chunmei,

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,680
the money he owes

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
the sesame money he owes.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,079
It's a win-win situation.

57
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,960
Why make it so complicated?

58
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,280
Sorry, Gu Xiaomei.

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,160
I just want you to stay at Mowait Clinic.

60
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,840
I didn't expect them to do that.

61
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,080
Please save Mowait Clinic.

62
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,360
Please save Mowait Clinic.

63
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,240
OK?

64
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,560
Since Dr. Gu knows the reason,

65
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,200
I won't hide it anymore.

66
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,920
As long as Dr. Gu

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,480
focus on treating my daughter,

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,360
and make sure she lives to 18.

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
As for the rest,

70
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,280
everything else.

71
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,840
Ah.

72
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,000
I can't save her.

73
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Didn't you say

74
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,520
she would save people?

75
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,079
There must be a reason.

76
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,400
Otherwise,

77
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,000
she won't leave the clinic.

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,240
The reason is

79
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,880
in her heart,

80
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,560
in her heart.

81
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,920
I can convince her.

82
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,800
Give me more time.

83
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,880
Qiang.

84
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,560
Why did our boss

85
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,399
for?

86
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,560
Knowing too much

87
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,120
if you know too much.

88
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
If Moye Clinic

89
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,480
has financial needs,

90
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,800
My boss can help.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,440
Okay.

92
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,200
Thank you.

93
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,960
Dr. Gu,

94
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,200
I hope you can figure it out as soon as possible.

95
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,240
Saving a life is better than building a seven-level pagoda.

96
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Chunmei.

97
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,360
I can't wait.

98
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,760
I'm not lying.

99
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,560
I really can't treat patients.

100
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,960
If you want to save your daughter,

101
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,560
don't waste your time on me.

102
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,000
I only trust Dr. Gu.

103
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:05,840
You...

104
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,120
Dr. Gu, have a good rest.

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,280
Every 30 minutes,

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,040
to ask about Dr. Gu's decision.

107
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,840
What should I do?

108
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,920
Why is this happening again?

109
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,320
This version is exactly the same.

110
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,159
Oh.

111
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,480
Thank goodness I have this hobby.

112
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,520
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

113
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,240
Dr. Ren.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,720
Hey.

115
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,520
Soon,

116
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm the only one beside you.

117
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,800
You agreed?

118
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,600
She can live.

119
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,880
You don't agree?

120
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,280
She has to disappear.

121
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,640
I warn you to stay away from Gu Xiaomei.

122
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,400
Mo Haoqian

123
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,800
in love.

124
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,960
is quite manly.

125
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,440
Dr. Gu.

126
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,360
What do you think?

127
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,960
I can't cure it.

128
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,200
Think carefully.

129
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,520
I said I can't cure it.

130
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:33,680
Wisdom Kagego.

131
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:33,520
LU.

132
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:33,920
Wisdom!

133
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,680
Humph!

134
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,680
It can't be cured. You're done.
