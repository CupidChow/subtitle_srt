No.

Yu's leaving.

65
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,500
Should we do something?

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,980
Otherwise, it's too inappropriate.

67
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,820
How about I go talk to him again?

68
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,540
If one of us needs to talk to him, it should be me.

After all,

70
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,380
I'm the one who persuaded Yu to be a firefighter.

71
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,010
No matter what,

72
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,620
I'm responsible for that.

If he is determined to leave,

74
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,100
should we hold a farewell party

for him?

76
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,290
Yes.

77
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,380
Yu has been here for so many years.

78
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,260
He's flawless at work,

79
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,300
and he never asked us for anything.

80
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,010
He always holds it in when he has a grievance.

81
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,930
Now that he's leaving,

82
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,620
we should hold a decent party for him.

83
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,020
We shouldn't let him down.

84
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,900
Come to think of it,

85
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,580

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,810

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,500
don't understand us.

90
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,500
How can we expect ordinary folks to understand us,

91
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,580
right?

92
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,380

93
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,730

94
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,900
and our lives as firefighters.

95
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,500
What do you think?

96
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,140

Do you remember that we also took this truck

100
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,260

105
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,900

Don't you think

107
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,100

108
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,180
contriving?

109
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,180
I tricked you into getting a master's degree

110
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,700
and joining our firefighting team.

111
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,700
But wasn't that a right decision?

112
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,780
After you came,

113
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,540
you fell in love with this industry, didn't you?

114
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,260
Yes.

115
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,900
At first, I thought you were a little frail-looking.

116
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,180
I was worried that you couldn't do it.

117
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,340
But after spending more time with you

118
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,020
and going on more missions together,

119
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,700
I found that

120
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,500
you are the one who's the wildest

121
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,420
and the most willing to risk your life at the fire scene.

122
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,580
No matter what the fire scene is like,

123
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,980
you'd go directly into it.

124
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,620
To tell you the truth,

125
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,100
when I'm on a mission now,

126
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,780
no matter how complicated the situation is,

127
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,700
as long as you're there,

128
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,900
I feel at ease.

Yes.

130
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,980
Every time I go to a rescue scene,

131
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,700
I can figure out

132
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,340
the stress limit and

133
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,380
the stress structure of that place immediately.

134
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,900
I know which brick should be removed,

135
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,740
and which board should be supported.

136
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,180
I can solve all these structural problems.

137
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,940
But the problems in life

138
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,660
are too difficult

139
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,020

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,220
Here's the thing.

190
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,580
We have

191
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,020
some suggestions

192
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,340
on the filming of the show.

193
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,820
First, our normal training can't be affected

194
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,130
during filming.

195
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,580
Second,

196
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,220
you can't spread wrong knowledge

197
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,610
or concepts.

198
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,380
Lastly,

199
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,660
and the most importantly,

200
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,660
during filming,

201
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,010
you must obey orders in all your actions.

202
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,340
If there is any violation of discipline,

203
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,660
I will call off the filming immediately.

204
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,460
Any questions?

205
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,540
No.

206
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,740
Firstly, I'd like to express our gratitude to your station for your support

207
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,940
on behalf of the crew.

208
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,300
Secondly,

209
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,180
our show will be focused on firefighting training

210
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,660
and rescue.

211
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,820
And there'll be no script at all.

212
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,810
We will capture real-time happenings anytime.

213
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,140
So the guests

214
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,060
will be eating, living,

215
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,100
training, and sharing the same schedule

216
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,860
with the firefighters.

217
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,300
So I think the three suggestions

218
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,100
Director Lin just proposed

219
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,660
are totally reasonable.

220
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,780
It also fits the purpose of our show.

221
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,140
That's good.

222
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,570
Come to think of it,

223
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,060
as for filming a show,

224
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,180
it'll also be the first time for us.

225
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,850
If there's anything

226
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,020
we fail to do perfectly

227
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,060
in future work and life,

228
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,540
please understand.

229
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,740
We don't know much about firefighting either.

230
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,220
In the future,

231
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,820
let's learn from and help each other.

232
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,140
Captain Meng.

233
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,420
Director Lin.

234
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,580
Instructor Yang.

235
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,900
I look forward to working with you.

236
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,130
About the show,

237
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,460
did you suddenly change your mind?

238
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,340
Right.

239
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,220
I got a bit touched.

240
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,610
I think our lives as firefighters

241
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,980
should be paid attention to

242
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,700
and understood.

243
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,620
It'll be helpful to our work.

244
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,620
Actually, it was Lou Mingye's idea

245
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,060
to let your station take on the show.

246
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,540
He has quite a unique understanding

247
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,180
on some issues.

248
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,050
Did something happen

249
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,500
at your station?

250
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,820
No.

251
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,140
Captain Meng.

252
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,660
Recently,

253
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,420
I've been thinking

254
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,380
what it takes to be a good director.

255
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,220
What do you think?

256
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,380
Adhere to high standards and strict requirements at work.

257
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,660
Cooperate with the instructor in life.

258
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,900
Think for team members and put myself in their shoes.

259
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,020
This is what you taught me.

260
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,580
But I always feel like

261
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,370
it's not enough.

262
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,620
Here's a word for you.

263
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,420
Empathy.

264
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,020
When I was the director, I found someone with great potential.

265
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,180
I decided to train him well.

266
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,460
After a while, he kept saying he was tired

267
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,940
and he couldn't stand it.

268
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,500
I'm a strict person,

269
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,540
so I asked him to hang in there.

270
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,500
Later, we found something was wrong.

271
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,460
So I asked him to go to the hospital for a check-up.

272
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,260
The result scared me.

273
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,540
It was colorectal cancer.

274
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,100
So he had an operation as soon as possible.

275
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
Although his life was saved,

276
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,300
he couldn't be a firefighter anymore.

277
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,060
Now that I think about it,

278
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,780
I still regret it.

279
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,780
If only we found out about it sooner...

280
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,460
Forget it.

281
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,580
Let's not talk about this.

282
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,940
Go back.

283
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,740
I'll leave the show to you.

284
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,420
Don't worry.

285
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,860
Work well with Yang.

286
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,500
Yes, Sir.

287
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:41,770
Go.

288
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,140
Lin Luxiao.

289
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:58,860
What's up?

290
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,220
I heard that you agreed.

291
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,620
I think it's great.

292
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,610
This is a good opportunity.

293
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,540
Not only can we show

294
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,140
new technologies and new equipment,

295
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,300
but it's also a chance for self  examination and correction.

296
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,820
I think your training method

297
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,460
is outdated.

298
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,340
Now

299
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,940
the pattern you're familiar with doesn't work anymore.

300
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,660
Maybe after this show,

301
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,540
you'll figure it out yourself.

302
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,660
Okay.

303
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,980
I'll see.

304
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,340
It's okay to have problems.

305
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,260
But don't avoid it.

306
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,820
Face it.

310
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,700
Check out this white vest.

311
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,580
It looks nice, right?

312
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,250
I'll buy one more.

313
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,020
How disgusting it is to wear.

314
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,980
Besides, they're not here to film you.

315
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,780
Don't you think you're too old to invest in yourself?

316
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,220
Even if they film us, they'll focus on Yijiu or Shiquan.

317
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,530
How youthful and delightful they are.

318
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,420
Unit Leader Lei.

319
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,300
Will we two be filmed a lot in the show?

320
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,660
You never watched the show?

321
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,940
We'll all be filmed.

322
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,660
I announce

323
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,220
I'm going on a diet, starting tomorrow.

324
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,380
No one shall tempt me with delicious food.

325
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,540
Why do you need

326
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,220
to go on a diet?

327
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,820
Look how thin you already are.

328
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,740
Besides, we have so much training to do every day.

329
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,180
Is there any fat guy in the whole station?

330
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,140
Going on a diet. Don't you have anything else to do?

331
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,180
You have no idea.

332
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,020
The camera adds ten pounds.

333
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,740
Look at those celebrities.

334
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,100
Their faces are as small as a palm.

335
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,700
Their faces are palm-sized, so what?

336
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,260
Do they have this?

337
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,500
Why are you using my facial cleanser, bro?

338
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,420
I want to use it.

339
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,220
Aren't you famous for cleaning your face with cold water only?

340
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,980
When did you ever use the facial cleanser?

341
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,380
My face

342
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,380
is a little rough recently.

343
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,660
I need to take care of it.

344
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,140
My facial cleanser is quite expensive.

345
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,980
How big is your face? How can you use this much?

346
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,820
I applied more so that it's foamier.

347
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,180
So you're the one who wants to be on camera the most.

348
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,340
So annoying.

349
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,700
Assistant Liu.

350
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,060
Lend me and Shiquan your facial cleanser.

351
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,380
Apply more. It'll be foamier.

352
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,300
Okay.

353
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,420
If you ask me,

354
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,100
Jiu and Shiquan are doing it for nothing.

355
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,850
At least Assistant Liu and Unit Leader Lei

356
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,820
are the backbone of our station.

357
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,820
It's understandable that they pay attention to their image.

358
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,460
What about you two?

359
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,220
What are you doing?

360
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,140
Come on.

361
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,380
Didn't you also take out the sunscreen that you haven't used in forever?

362
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,980
You're no better than me.

363
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm different from you.

364
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,220
I'm the driver of Truck 2.

365
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,530
It's the second main-force firetruck in our Special Division Station.

366
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,340
So what?

367
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,300
You are just a substitute.

368
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,620
Why am I a substitute?

369
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,140
Why are you laughing? I...

370
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,580
I won't talk to you.

Although this is our secret midnight diner,

374

you can't put so many things in here.

Look around this room.

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,140
Your trophies are everywhere.

377
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,780
When the show starts filming,

378
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,220
it won't be a surprise, but a
complete shock.

379
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,330
You...

380
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,060
You made it sound like you never ate any.

381
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,580
Come on.

382
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,890
I'll think of a way.

383
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,940
Yijiu. Shiquan.

384
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,420
Here.

385
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,060
I have an important task for you two.

386
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,260
Clean it up over there.

387
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,060
Yes, sir.

388
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,660
-Yes.
-Go.

389
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,540
Unit Leader Lei, there are too many things here.

390
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,220
It'll take quite a while for me and Yijiu to clean it up.

391
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,140
How about letting our businesslike driver of Truck 2

392
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,820
join us?

393
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,900
We can do it much faster together.

394
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,300
Qi Huo.

395
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,060
Come on.

396
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,620
Go clean up with them.

397
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,210
I haven't finished cleaning up here yet.

398
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,300
I haven't...

399
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,700
How did it go?

400
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,180
Who bought so many things?

401
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,100
Who could it be?

402
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,970
Liu.

403
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
I don't mean to blame you,

404
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,420
but look what you did.

405
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,260
How many times have I told you

406
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,250
not to stock up or shop online?

407
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,020
Right?

408
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,220
This is the depot for all of us,

409
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,740
not your personal warehouse.

410
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:16,770
By the way,

411
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,620
here's the booklet with all the guests' information.

412
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,580
Take a look, everyone.

413
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,660
I don't know any of them.

414
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,500
Check if you know any of them.

415
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,440
[Liu Xiahan]

416
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,220
Who is this?

417
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:30,980
I don't know.

418
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,240
[Zheng Ping]

419
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,740
I thought there would be some celebrities.

420
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,220
This...

421
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Who are they?

422
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
Aren't we celebrities ourselves?

423
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,730
Firefighting stars, right?

424
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,500
Isn't this show about our daily life?

425
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,380
Yes. Zheng Yang is right.

426
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,300
At first,

427
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,660
I was worried that they would be disobedient

428
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,770
and snub us when they come.

429
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,450
Now it seems that I worried too much.

430
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,970
I think Mr. Jiang

431
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,900
really wants to promote firefighting this time.

432
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,700
So,

433
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,860
everyone,

434
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:58,980
read the booklet carefully.

435
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,420
Especially you.

436
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,580
Take a good look.

437
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,570
Or you may not even be able to match the names

438
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,620
to their faces when they come.

439
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,340
When did I ever remember names?

440
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,820
It's enough that you remember them.

441
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,420
Liu.

442
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,100
What's wrong

443
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,900
with your shirt?

444
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,180
Look how meticulous Director is.

445
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,340
It's been a whole day since I changed into it,

446
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,100
but none of you noticed.

447
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,060
What do you think?

448
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,140
Doesn't it suit me perfectly?

449
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,860
It can bring out the handsomeness of us firefighters.

450
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,340
You...

451
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,940
Are you wearing Yijiu's shirt again?

452
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,940
Take it off and return it to him.

453
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,300
It's so tight. Do you think it looks good?

454
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,140
I'll wash it for him after wearing.

455
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,100
It took me a lot of effort to put it on.

456
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:35,860
Report!

457
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,020
Report!

458
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,380
What's wrong?

459
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,740
They're here.

460
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,940
So many people.

461
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,740
Which one is Zheng Ping?

462
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,580
Check the booklet.

463
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,980
The one in green.

464
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,300
Green?

465
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,460
Which one is wearing green?

466
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,060
No one is in green.

467
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,730
No one is in green.

468
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,340
In a skirt.

469
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,100
Not this one.

470
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,620
That one in a skirt.

471
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,700
She's that one in a skirt.

472
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,860
You ran even faster than when you're on a mission.

473
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:01,900
Is this her?

474
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,540
Play it cool.

475
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,220
Play it cool, okay?

476
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:03,780
You're so...

477
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,620
That one in a skirt.

478
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,980
That one in a skirt.

479
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,140
Who are those around her?

480
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,100
Hello, everyone.

481
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,860
I'm Xu Zhiyi, 22 years old.

482
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,860
I was an idol trainee abroad.

483
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,170
I just came back to China

484
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,140
and I don't know anything.

485
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,330
-If there's any difficulty in the future,
-They've already started filming.

486
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,620
please help me, seniors.

487
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,100
Yes.

488
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,620
Don't stand on the street.

489
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,620
Ask them to come in.

490
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,100
It'll harm our image.

491
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,260
Dai is here.

492
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,900
Move aside.

493
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,620
I'm about to release a single...

494
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,460
Sorry

495
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,020
for keeping you waiting.

496
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,940
I'm Yan Dai.

497
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,620
Who is this?

498
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,940
Another one.

499
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,620
Dai what?

500
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,260
Which one is she?

501
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,020
This one, right?

502
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,580
This one.

503
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,500
Yan Dai, right?

504
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,580
She's so pretty.

505
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,780
Sis.

506
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,820
I didn't know you'd really come on the show.

507
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,820
So the guest list rumored online is true.

508
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,100
I'm so lucky

509
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,860
to get to film the show with you, Sis.

510
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,580
Hello, Dai. I'm Zheng Ping.

511
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,820
Your aura is even hotter than the sun.

512
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,340
You're quite well-spoken.

513
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,860
Hello, Dai. I'm Liu Xiahan.

514
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,000
Last time, we...

515
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,500
Yes.

516
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,220
Who is she?

517
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,540
It's her.

518
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,650
This one.

519
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,490
There's another one over there.

520
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,100
Do you know her?

521
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,260
Yes.

522
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,020
Who is this?

523
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,660
A big star.

524
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,860
This girl seems to be Nan Chu.

525
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,180
She's a newbie.

526
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,020
She used to learn dancing.

527
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,650
We'll work together in the future.

528
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
Do you know who I am, Sis?

529
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,170
Now I sort of know.

530
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,940
Let's go.

531
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,940
You take care of them. I'll go on the mission.

532
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,140
I take care of them?

533
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,980
On mission! Make way! Be careful!

534
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,860
Hurry! Photographers!

535
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,140
Fire!

536
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,460
South Shanshui Community, 68 Longhua Road.

537
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,620
The fire took place at the shop-front house.

538
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,860
Dispatch Truck 1, 2, and 3.

539
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,300
Lin Luxiao.

540
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,940
They're already going on a mission.

541
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,580
We won't be like them, right?

542
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,380
Wouldn't it be cool if we can be like them?

543
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,300
The sunshine is too strong.

544
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,580
What is the crew doing? Are they serious?

545
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,620
Hold this for me.

546
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,820
My fan is out of battery too.

547
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,220
What's the difference between standing here

548
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,020
and standing in the room?

549
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,300
They love meaningless things like this.

550
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,570
I'll call Mr. Jiang.

551
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:02,980
Hello, everyone.

552
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,740
I'm the instructor here.

553
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:05,820
My name is Yang Zhengang.

554
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,380
I'm also one of your sergeants.

555
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,620
First of all, I'd like to welcome you

556
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,100
on behalf of Heping Road Special Division Station.

557
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,620
Come to think of it,

558
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,820
-let me make a brief introduction...
-Sergeant.

559
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,860
Can we talk inside?

560
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,540
The sunshine is too strong here.

561
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,620
My beautiful skin is about to be dried up.

562
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,260
You just arrived here.

563
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,460
You may not be used to it.

564
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,420
But if

565
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,130
you want to experience the life of firefighters,

566
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,740
please put your phones and umbrellas

567
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,540
away.

568
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,340
Forget your previous identities,

569
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,580
and do what a firefighter should do.

570
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,380
Understand?

571
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,060
Yes, Sir.

572
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,340
She's good.

573
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,300
Pretty energetic.

574
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,860
Pretending to be positive.

575
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,820
Why isn't he answering my call?

576
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,900
That's great.

577
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,540
Director.

578
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,980
This is what we want.

579
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,100
Make sure to film more of

580
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,300
their real emotions and reactions like this, okay?

581
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,980
-Okay.
-Film as much as you can.

582
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,060
Okay, no problem.

583
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,100
Hello, Instructor Yang.

584
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,420
You can talk to them first.

585
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:57,970
Okay, I'll talk to them.

586
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,580
Mr. Jiang.

587
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,900
You mean

588
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,860
no matter what we say or do,

589
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,300
it will all be filmed?

590
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:04,940
Yes.

591
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,700
You're right.

592
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,300
Because what I want to do is

593
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,700
a documentary show with no script.

594
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,340
So your reactions

595
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,460
and real expressions

596
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,740
will all be recorded.

597
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,980
How can you be like this?

598
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,500
If I knew, I wouldn't have come.

599
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,340
Of course.

600
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,540
I won't let you do it for nothing.

601
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,900
All your performances

602
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,660
at the fire station during this time

603
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,620
will be assessed by the sergeants.

604
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,380
The one who performs the best

605
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,500
will be the leading role

606
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,180
in our next web drama.

607
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,580
Understand?

608
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,340
Yes.

609
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,980
Mr. Jiang, I'll do my best.

610
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,060
Photographers. Come here.

611
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,450
Hurry.

612
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,000
♫Are we destined to meet?♫

613
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,120
♫Will we miss each other?♫

614
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,850
♫We're not sure yet♫

615
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,250
♫The vague memory♫

616
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,300
♫Becomes clear again♫

617
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,510
♫I accidentally realized that♫

618
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,830
♫We never brought it up♫

619
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,940
Hello, everyone.

620
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,260
I'm Lin Luxiao, Director of Heping Road Special Division Station.

621
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,220
I'm also your Chief Sergeant.

622
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,580
I only have two requirements

623
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,540
for you during your stay here.

624
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,900
Obey orders

625
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,540
and follow the discipline.

626
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,180
Anyone who can't meet the above two requirements

627
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,260
will have to leave the team immediately.

628
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,570
Understand?

629
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
-Yes.
-Yes.

630
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,100
Understand?

631
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,180
-Yes!
-Yes!

632
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,580
See you on the training ground in a bit.

633
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,540
We waited for him for so long.

634
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,060
I thought he would say something important.

635
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,740
Sis.

636
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,420
What?

637
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,420
It'll be recorded.

638
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,460
So what? They can film as they want.

639
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,260
That's all for today.

640
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,860
You all need to make progress

641
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,940
step by step.

642
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,700
We'll show you around

643
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,380
your dorm first.

644
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,220
Yijiu. Shiquan.

645
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,980
-Here.
-Here.

646
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,100
Take them to the dorm and make arrangements for them.

647
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:23,980
Yes.

648
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,740
Everyone, please follow me.

649
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,740
All right. The rest of the crew, let's move inside.

650
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,580
Mr. Jiang. Mr. Huang.

651
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,860
I'll get back to work.

652
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,940
Hurry up.

653
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,460
What?

654
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,820
It felt like he was in charge of the whole situation when he talked.

655
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,460
This won't do.

656
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,500
What are we trying to film?

657
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,100
Conflicts.

658
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,100
Should we replace him?

659
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,860
Nonsense.

660
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,940
Should we replace the fire station too?

661
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,180
Okay.

662
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,020
Let's go.

663
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,530
Go.

664
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,380
All right. Go get ready.

665
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,060
Go.

666
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,740
What are you looking at? Hurry up.

667
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,420
What's going on?

668
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,780
That Lin

669
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,140
doesn't know the ways of the world at all.

670
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,380
He taught us to fold blankets.

671
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
I made some gimmicks

672
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,900
and created some conflicts

673
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,980
to film something different,

674
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,260
as you asked.

675
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,250
He...

676
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,820
He scolded me in the face.

677
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,500
What is it about him?

678
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,380
Why is Lin Qi's brother as annoying as Lin Qi?

679
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,060
Don't.

680
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,340
He's annoying in a different way.

681
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,180
Mr. Jiang.

682
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,980
Speaking of which,

683
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,420
you said you wanted

684
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,900
to do a documentary show.

685
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,100
If he really wants to get serious about it,

686
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,500
we won't have a leg to stand on.

687
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,410
Replace him.

688
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,620
Enough.

689
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:58,900
Forget it.

690
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,540
We should focus on the bigger picture.

691
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,980
At least, the first episode needs to be good.

692
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,650
We have our own legs.

693
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,300
It's impossible that we can't dig some dirt up

694
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,820
in such a big fire station.

695
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,140
Well.

696
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,220
Dear artists,

697
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,300
let's get ready.

698
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,300
Gather downstairs

699
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,540
for training in five minutes.

700
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,100
Although you are not firefighters,

701
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,610
we still applied for badges for you

702
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,140
so that you can have stronger collective consciousness.

703
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,500
Why are you wearing sandbags?

704
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,540
This is our daily training load.

705
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,300
Director Lin has made it easier for you.

706
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,140
Impressive.

707
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,500
This is nothing.

708
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,620
Director Lin is the best.

709
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,900
He is our master.

710
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,420
You are his disciples?

711
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,090
Yes.

712
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,740
When we were little,

713
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,420
Director Lin saved us from an earthquake.

714
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,100
So we decided to be firefighters like him

715
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,020
and save more people.

716
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,620
Also because of this,

717
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,300
he took us as his disciples.

718
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,900
Sis.

719
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:01,940
Look at her.

720
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,020
-When I was little, I was also saved by a firefighter...
-Why is she so cunning?

721
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,900
-Is that so?
-She's already gotten close to them.

722
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,500
Let her be.

723
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,890
Mind your own business.

724
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,380
I'm a dancer.

725
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,820
Dancing requires physical fitness as well.

726
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,580
Nan Chu.

727
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,820
Is it tiring to dance?

728
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,700
Who are you?

729
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,860
Why are you here?

730
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,050
Miss Yan Dai.

731
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,530
Miss Zhiyi.

732
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,300
The crew asked me to bring the luggage here.

733
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,180
Xi Gu.

734
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,620
This is the makeup artist the company assigned to me.

735
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,340
The company treats you newbie pretty well.

736
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,980
They even specially assigned a makeup artist to you.

737
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:48,980
Well...

738
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,050
Miss Yan Dai, let me help you.

739
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,940
Don't touch my stuff.

740
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,850
Xi Gu, right?

741
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,060
Bring me the makeup bag.

742
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,060
Okay.

743
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,980
And my suitcase.

744
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,740
Move it over here.

745
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:03,700
Okay.

746
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,820
Let me help you.

747
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,460
Be careful.

748
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,140
Hey.

749
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,300
I'm talking to you.

750
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,290
Go buy some disinfectant wipes later

751
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,740
and clean up the whole room,

752
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,380
including the desks and the chairs.

753
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,020
Okay.

754
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,340
Xi Gu.

755
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,140
Mr. Shen wanted to see you for something urgent.

756
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,820
Well...

757
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,180
Miss Zhiyi, I'll get going now.

758
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,980
Doesn't she work for our company?

759
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,540
I didn't ask you to do it.

760
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,020
Attention, everyone.

761
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,740
Gather in five minutes to have lunch in the canteen.

762
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,090
We even have to gather for dining?

763
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,660
Why is it so troublesome?

764
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,940
♫Unity is strength♫

765
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,330
♫This power is iron♫

766
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,810
♫This force is steel♫

767
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,660
♫Harder than iron and stronger than steel♫

768
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,300
♫Fire upon Fascism♫

769
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,900
♫Let all undemocratic systems die♫

770
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,820
♫Towards the sun♫

771
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,460
♫Toward freedom♫

♫Emit a radiant glow♫

774
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,740
At ease!

775
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,660
Attention!

776
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,580
Yan Dai.

777
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,700
Xu Zhiyi.

778
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,380
Fall out!

779
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,780
Why were you two late?

780
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,260
Sorry, Director Lin.

781
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,540
We won't do it again.

782
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,380
Sorry.

783
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,460
I repeat.

784
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,700
Since you are at the Special Division Station now,

785
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,810
you must discipline yourselves by the standards of a firefighter.

786
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,460
From your grooming

787
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,060
to internal affairs,

788
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,860
everything has to meet the rules.

789
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,780
Not only the artists,

790
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,940
but also the entire crew at our station,

791
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,540
including photographers and makeup artists,

792
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,460
you must strictly abide by the rules.

793
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,500
Understand?

794
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,940
-Yes.
-Yes.

795
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,460
Understand?

796
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,140
Yes!

797
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,100
Return!

798
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:10,780
Lunch start!

799
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,660
Photographers, set the cameras up.

800
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,660
Get the footage of their dining in all angles,

801
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,060
understand?

802
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,620
Photographers.

803
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,620
Arrange it.

804
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,130
Okay.

805
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,020
Come here.

806
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,020
Film the dishes.

807
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,060
How is it? Is it good?

808
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:22,900
It's good.

809
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,820
Not bad.

810
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,740
Come here.

811
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,340
Auntie.

812
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,380
How long have you been here at the station?

813
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,020
Is there anything impressive?

814
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,860
Tell us about it.

815
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,540
What do firefighters like to eat in their daily life?

816
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,540
Do you know them well?

817
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,460
Also,

818
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,140
what kind of person is Director Lin in private?

819
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,060
Tell us about it.

820
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,460
I can't talk well. Don't interview me.

821
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,580
It's okay. Just relax and say a few things.

822
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,500
[Please don't make noise. Stay civilized while eating.]

823
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,340
You can go back to work.

824
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,180
Get me a plate of food.

825
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,540
You think our food is not good?

826
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,460
Report. I only eat this much, Sergeant.

827
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,380
Don't worry about your figure.

828
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,020
With your physique,

829
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,700
when you're in danger, you'll be too fragile.

830
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,820
It's important for my occupation to stay in shape.

831
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,220
Okay.

832
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,220
Just a reminder.

833
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,860
The training here is tough.

834
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,380
You may faint if you only eat this much.

835
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,420
Sis, he has to meddle in everything.

836
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,140
Don't mind him.

837
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,740
Come on, photographers, pack up.

838
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,620
-They're going on a mission.
-Social rescue.

839
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,340
Get some footage.

840
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,700
Room 502, Dongjing Homeland.

841
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,300
To get the ring.

842
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:47,980
Dispatch Truck 2.

843
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,540
Yu, lead the team.

844
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,820
Truck 2, get ready.

845
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,940
Yes. Let's go.

846
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,740
Alright, forget it.

847
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,770
I thought it was a big deal.

848
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,660
There's nothing much to film.

849
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,340
Thank you for your hard work. You can eat.

850
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,060
Artists,

851
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,180
gather on the playground

852
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:07,860
in ten minutes.

853
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,620
We just started eating.

854
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,140
At ease!

855
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,140
Attention!

856
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,940
Listen up.

857
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,580
Today we'll be doing the cutting training.

858
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,980
Suo. Zhang Shui.

859
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:22,860
Here.

860
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:23,940
Start the training.

861
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:24,340
Yes.

862
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,050
Wait a minute.

863
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,940
Director Lin.

864
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,220
I just discussed with Instructor Yang as well.

865
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,340
For future filming,

866
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,210
we should mainly

867
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,580
focus on the display of the firefighting technologies.

868
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,620
Otherwise,

869
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,620
what we film is only

870
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,770
folding blankets or cutting iron wires.

871
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,500
It's not technical at all.

872
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,500
Besides, the audience won't like to watch it.

873
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,490
Two things.

874
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,500
First,

875
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,460
if you want to say something, say "Report".

876
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,170
No one shall say "Wait a minute".

877
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,140
Second,

878
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,380
if you think it's easy,

879
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,940
give it a try.

880
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,140
It doesn't seem to be hard.

881
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,980
Put on the helmet for him

882
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,340
and let him experience it.

883
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:02,700
Yes.

884
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,380
Mr. Jiang, come on!

885
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,180
Mr. Jiang, come on!

886
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:40,900
Mr. Jiang.

887
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,660
This is unreasonable.

888
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,620
The design is unreasonable.

889
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,300
It's okay. It's normal.

890
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,580
This is the daily training of firefighters.

891
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,540
Maybe some of you

892
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,380
think it's simple,

893
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,220
or even boring.

894
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,300
But day after day,

895
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,740
we are still training this.

896
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,100
Why is that?

897
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,460
Just like

898
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,180
singing and dancing,

899
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,660
you need to practice.

900
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,780
Because when it comes to the cutting training,

901
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,060
if the error exceeds 1mm,

902
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,780
it could be a finger,

903
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,740
or even a life.

904
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,540
So no matter what you thought before,

905
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,620
from now on,

906
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,540
I need you

907
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,460
to have respect

908
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,220
for firefighters.

909
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,540
Understand?

910
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,420
Yes.

911
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,460
Others, do you not understand?

912
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,860
Understand?

913
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,060
-Yes.
-Yes.

914
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,540
Carry on.

915
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,460
Carry on with the training, everyone.

916
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,020
Today, I'll teach you ABC of how to use fire extinguishers.

917
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,260
There are many kinds of fire extinguishers.

918
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,260
But as for the use of it, just remember six words.

919
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:21,780
Lift.

920
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,500
Pull.

921
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,620
Hold, aim, squeeze and sweep.

922
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,020
So what are they respectively?

923
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,700
First, lift the fire extinguisher.

924
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,540
Pull out the safety pin.

925
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,180
Hold the nozzle

926
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,820
and aim at the base of the fire.

927
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,180
Squeeze the handle,

928
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,420
and sweep horizontally.

929
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,650
When you're extinguishing the fire,

930
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,820
pay attention to two things.

931
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,100
First, don't aim at the flame.

932
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,020
Because you can't put out the fire by spraying into the flame.

933
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:46,940
You know?

934
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,500
One more thing.

935
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,380
You must extinguish the fire in the direction of the wind.

936
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,740
You can't do it against the wind,

937
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,940
or you'll get burned.

938
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,180
You should aim at the base of the fire

939
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,780
at the back side of the flame in the direction of the wind

940
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,380
and spray.

941
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,940
Any problem?

942
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,620
-No.
-No.

943
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:07,820
The first one in the row.

944
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:08,860
Come up and have a try.

945
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,490
The first one in the row.

946
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,090
Remember the technique.

947
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,300
Lift.

948
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,060
Pull.

949
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,060
You need to pull out the safety pin.

950
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,500
Pull out the safety pin.

951
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,940
Hold the nozzle.

952
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,580
Aim at the base of the fire.

953
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,060
This is great. Give her a close-up.

954
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,740
Aim at the base of the fire.

955
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,700
What are you doing?

956
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,300
What are you doing?

957
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,380
The fire was coming at you. Why didn't you run?

958
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,260
Sorry.

959
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,020
You're afraid of fire, right?

960
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,140
Five years ago, there was a fire in my house,

961
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,740
and I was saved by a firefighter.

962
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,380
But he died in a mission later.

963
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,060
Return to the team.

964
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,620
Didn't I tell you not to exceed this line?

965
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,460
Don't you understand?

966
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,380
Director Lin.

967
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,540
I'm sorry for that accident.

968
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,620
But that take was very good.

969
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,220
The guests all performed very well.

970
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,180
Keep up the good work.

971
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,020
What's good?

972
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,340
How is it good?

973
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,860
Did you show crew do background check

974
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,780
on the guests before filming?

975
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,980
She's afraid of fire. Do you know that?

976
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,980
Can you take responsibility if something goes wrong here?

977
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,620
Director Lin, how about this?

978
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,500
She experienced a fire before.

979
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,300
I know that.

980
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,620
But I don't know that

981
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,660
she's still afraid of fire.

982
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,860
But it doesn't matter.

983
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,460
It's not a big deal, right?

984
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,170
Besides, what's special of Flaming Youth

985
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,900
is that it's a documentary.

986
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,420
When faced with an accident like this...

987
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,500
Look, one of our guests

988
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,580
overcame her fear and conquered her old self.

989
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,180
How great is that?

990
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,940
She won't be able to act it out even if you ask her to.

991
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Let me tell you.

992
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,540
There's nothing small in front of fire.

993
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,780
If you want them to act, do it outside.

994
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,940
This is a training, you know?

995
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,980
What do you mean?

996
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,820
What do I mean?

997
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,260
Can't you understand?

998
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,660
I'm calling it off.

999
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,340
Get out.

1000
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,780
All units, line up.

1001
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,580
Hey. You called it off and that's it?

1002
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,420
Forget it.

1003
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,180
Who is he?

1004
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,180
He just called it off at will. Who is he?

1005
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,780
He said no...

1006
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,980
We can't get into conflict with him here.

1007
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:48,580
What? Why?

1008
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,780
This is his place.

1009
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,260
I'll take care of it when we go back.

1010
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:51,740
I'll take care of it.

1011
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,420
What kind of person is he?

1012
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:52,860
Calm down.

1013
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,460
Dismissed.

1014
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,660
The filming is called off. You're dismissed.

1015
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,700
How could you...

1016
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,660
They just stopped filming like this?

1017
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,900
You were a bit too dramatic.

1018
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,780
This is good.

1019
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,490
This one.

1020
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,260
Director Lin was really mad this time.

1021
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,170
I've never seen him being so angry.

1022
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,980
Not taking firefighting seriously.

1023
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,900
They got on Director's nerves.

1024
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:30,900
Of course

1025
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,050
he'd be angry.

1026
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,260
If the show is called off,

1027
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,770
will it affect our bonus?

1028
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,860
All you care about is bonus.

1029
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,620
If the show is called off, let it be.

1030
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,060
Assistant Liu.

1031
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,580
What happened today?

1032
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,860
Say something.

1033
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,340
I'm thinking about something.

1034
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,340
Stop thinking.

1035
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,020
We'll all respect Yu's decision.

1036
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,420
I was thinking

1037
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,420
we've been friends for so many years.

1038
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,380
What should I give Yu as a farewell gift?

1039
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,340
We need to give him a gift?

1040
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,820
How much do you pay for the gift?

1041
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,660
I don't know.

1042
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,460
I haven't bought it.

1043
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,220
Right.

1044
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,340
It's weird for men to send gifts to each other.

1045
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,860
We have to.

1046
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,260
Deputy Director Yu is quite nice.

1047
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:41,970
[Tips for Fire Safety]

1048
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,900
Places that have the functions

1049
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,180
of production, storage, operation

1050
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,020
and accommodation combined

1051
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,580
are called three-in-one places.

1052
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,700
This kind of place

1053
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,540
has no strict fire separation.

1054
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,100
The fire protection facilities are inadequate.

1055
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,340
Once there is a fire,

1056
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,780
it will cause serious consequences.

1057
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,260
Features of the fire in three-in-one places are:

1058
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,220
easy to burn,

1059
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,980
easy to produce poisonous gas,

1060
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,100
and easy to make people trapped and injured.

1061
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,700
The operators should rectify conscientiously

1062
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,260
and improve fire safety awareness.
