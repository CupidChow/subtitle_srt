Not approved.

372
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,350
Firefighters from Heping Road Station.

373
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,150
Here!

374
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,450
Remember the content of training.

375
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,710
Remember the rules of rescue.

376
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,180
After you go in,

377
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,310
save people first.

378
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,700
Be careful.

379
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,410
Follow me.

380
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,670
Yes.

381
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,390
Obey orders.

382
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,860
Director Lin.

383
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,280
It's just

384
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,210
we're already here.

385
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,220
I feel so frustrated

386
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,310
that I can't make my contributions.

387
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,460
Why can't we make contributions?

388
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,380
Although we can't help them put out the fire,

389
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,010
we can save people.

390
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,680
Go find stretchers.

391
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,310
Let's go.

392
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,370
Let's go.

393
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,910
Thank you, Auntie.

394
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,020
The drumsticks you made taste like home.

395
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,170
My son used to say the same thing.

396
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,430
Nan Chu!

397
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,600
Nan Chu!

398
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,320
We can't see it from here.

399
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,000
The site of the accident is too far away.

400
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,650
I don't think they'll be back any time soon.

401
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,600
Nan Chu!

It's already midnight,

500

but the fire is still burning.

501
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,200
Due to the complicated situation,

502
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,220
the emergency rescue personnel are divided into different groups to fight in different areas.

503
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,270
They combine fire control and extinguishment,

504
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,700
and they're using alcohol-resistant foam

505
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,670
to cover the tank on fire for cooling

506
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,880
in order to prevent secondary disasters.

507
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,470
Mr. Han.

508
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:50,900
How about we

509
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,830
give Nan Chu a few days off?

510
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,060
Why?

511
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,620
It's been two days.

512
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,050
There are more and more news of casualties.

513
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,730
She asked for it herself?

514
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,440
No.

515
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,250
She's still following

516
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,640
the company's shooting schedule.

517
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,700
It's just Xi Gu said that

518
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,090
she

519
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,110
hasn't been talking much these days.

520
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,090
She either dances or takes photoshoots.

521
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,930
And she goes to the Special Division Station every night

522
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,150
to wait for them to come back.

523
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,830
I'm afraid she might not be able to hold on like this.

524
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,340
If she didn't ask for it herself,

525
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,780
let her be for now.

526
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,360
But...

527
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,830
I think at this time,

528
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,850
a tighter schedule

529
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,130
may be better for her.

530
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:47,640
Got it.

531
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,790
According to the news,

532
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,220
there are over 80 casualties

533
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,280
hospitalized in six hospitals in Beixun City.

534
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,750
Most of them suffer scratches in

535
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,310
their heads, abdomens, and limbs, etc.

536
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,440
Through treatment,

537
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,290
the number of patients under intensive care is decreasing.

538
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,680
According to the newly-drawn layout map

539
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,660
of the residual hazardous chemicals in the park,

540
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,370
the fire and rescue personnel...

541
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,090
Nan Chu.

542
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,380
Have you all had a good rest?

543
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,600
I have a show to film this afternoon.

544
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,240
Let's hurry up and practice one more time.

545
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,920
Nan Chu.

546
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,470
Why don't you take a rest?

547
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,150
No need.

548
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,850
Any news of Director Lin?

549
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,880
Hurry up.

550
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,010
Let's start the dance practice.

551
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,390
On the catastrophic fire and explosion accident

552
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,730
that happened at South Bay Harbor, Beixun City.

553
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,210
Today is the second day of emergency rescue.

554
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,230
According to the news from the Command Center,

555
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,860
after all-night firefighting...

556
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,700
Dad.

557
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,010
Do you think my brother will be fine?

558
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,060
The fire has basically gotten under control.

559
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,880
The firefighters are taking different rescue measures

560
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,100
according to different situations of each spot.

561
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,360
There are still over 100 firetrucks

562
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,710
[News of the Hour: The second day of emergency rescue for the explosion accident at South Bay Harbor.]
There are still over 100 firetrucks

563
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,010
and over 1,000 firefighters
[News of the Hour: The second day of emergency rescue for the explosion accident at South Bay Harbor.]

564
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,860
sparing no effort in on-site rescue.
[News of the Hour: The second day of emergency rescue for the explosion accident at South Bay Harbor.]

565
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:02,940
[News of the Hour: The second day of emergency rescue for the explosion accident at South Bay Harbor.]

566
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:03,910
As of now,

567
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,540
the search and rescue at the scene of accident

568
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,220
-and the investigation on hidden danger...
-Dad.

569
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,860
Should we call Uncle Meng?

570
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,700
Lin Qi.

571
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,210
Here.

572
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:11,680
Inspection of earth

573
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,390
and water quality,

574
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,160
as well as the handling of dangerous articles at the scene

575
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,140
are also going on progressively.

576
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,610
As of now,

577
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,500
the accident has killed 21

578
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,850
and injured over 70.

579
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,120
Among them, 8 are firefighters.

580
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,330
Have a drink

581
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,010
with me.

582
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,610
There are 34 people trapped.

583
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,490
This morning,

584
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,050
the firefighter who was missing for two days, Wang Guannan,

585
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,990
was found in the central fire scene.

586
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,190
Dad.

587
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,250
Are you really not going to ask someone

588
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,800
about my brother's situation?

589
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,630
In the past,

590
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,150
there was an unwritten tradition.

591
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,800
That is whenever a teammate goes on a major mission,

592
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,320
don't ask,

593
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,450
don't talk,

594
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,330
and don't wait.

595
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,690
Train,

596
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,110
eat, and drink as usual.

597
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,840
But no one is allowed to talk about

598
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,570
the mission.

599
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,420
What kind of weird tradition is that?

600
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,860
So you just pretended that you were not worried at all?

601
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,830
Not really.

602
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,790
We just had a tacit understanding in our team.

603
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,680
That is when the mission was completed,

604
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,900
the fire was put out,

605
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,160
and the people were rescued,

606
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,130
they'd come back.

607
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,820
Isn't that just

608
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,380
superstition and metaphysics?

609
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,360
At that time,

610
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,890
I thought it was more like a belief.

611
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,300
I'm sure my son

612
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,680
will come back.

613
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,170
I'm sure your brother

614
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,060
will come back.

615
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,400
Thank you.

616
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,580
Master.

617
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,470
Does everyone have food?

618
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,360
Yes, I do.

619
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,130
Eat slowly.

620
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,600
Don't catch a cold.

621
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:42,710
Wang.

622
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:43,920
Truck 6.

623
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,200
Are you okay, Assistant Liu?

624
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,050
Damn.

625
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:55,850
My phone is broken.

626
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,610
I can't turn it on.

627
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,700
Did you bring your phone?

628
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,410
No.

629
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,890
Have a bite.

630
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,440
Okay.

631
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,290
Try turn it on for me.

632
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:04,750
Okay.

633
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,380
Master.

634
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,850
Have some water.

635
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,020
Give it to Yu. I already have some.

636
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,680
Lin Luxiao. Lin Luxiao.

637
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,390
Slowly.

638
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,940
You and Zhengang, come see me.

639
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,330
Copy that.

640
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,350
Yang.

641
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,070
Captain Meng wants to see us.

642
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,700
Okay.

643
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,390
Captain Meng.

644
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,160
Have you rested well?

645
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,420
No problem.

646
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,390
We can keep working.

647
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,710
Half an hour won't be enough.

648
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,150
We're facing

649
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,580
an even tougher mission.

650
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,350
The Command Center has conducted a survey on the scene.

651
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,700
There are 5 big spots on fire,

652
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,710
and the number of small spots on fire

653
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,570
and dangerous areas with explosion potential is 16.

654
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,840
Captain Meng, please give the order.

655
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,180
The Command Center has decided

656
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,610
to let your station

657
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,920
handle the biggest spot on fire.

658
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,400
Okay.

659
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,460
We promise we'll complete the mission.

660
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,270
Be careful.

661
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,030
Yes.

662
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,660
Put on new breathing apparatuses.

663
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,610
It's okay.

664
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,210
Don't force yourselves.

665
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:28,750
I'm fine.

666
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,180
Yu, help me remove the breathing apparatus.

667
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,850
Here.

668
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,030
Heping Road Special Division Station.

669
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,840
Heping Road, Roger that.

670
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,060
This is Yang Zhengang.

671
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,110
Please speak.

672
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,540
Be careful.

673
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,430
Come back safely.

674
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,690
Report! Captain Meng.

675
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,160
Heping Road Station is ready to fight anytime!

676
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,470
Triumphant return is a must!

677
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,680
Ready to fight anytime!

678
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,690
Triumphant return is a must!

679
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,250
Ready to fight anytime!

680
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,140
Triumphant return is a must!

681
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,190
Thank you.

682
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,910
Thank you all.

683
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,840
Follow me for another round.

684
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,430
Yes!

685
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,060
Let's go!

686
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,270
Yang.

687
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,120
The fire crosses South Bay Harbor.

688
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,460
The area is huge.

689
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:38,640
How about this?

690
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,690
You stay here and give commands,

691
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,990
and I'll take our men on a round of rescue first.

692
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,620
No need.

693
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,710
Zheng Yang, Dagang.

694
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,180
You two, go with me

695
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,020
and see if we can get in.

696
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,070
I'll lead them.

697
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,660
No.

698
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,260
Although Captain Meng agreed to let you join the mission,

699
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,850
I'm the on-site commander this time.

700
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,410
Why do you have to divide our work so clearly?

701
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,210
Firefighting is the priority here.

702
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:52,880
No more talking.

703
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,380
Liu.

704
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:53,680
Here.

705
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,310
You and Lin, take fire nozzles with you and clear the way for us.

706
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,280
Zheng Yang, Dagang, let's go!

707
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,200
Everyone, follow up!

708
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,960
Get the fire under control.

709
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,420
This way up.

710
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,470
Rush inside.

711
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,310
Okay.

712
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,380
Everyone, let's go.

713
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,000
Go!

714
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,640
Zheng Yang, Dagang, follow me.

715
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,940
Spray up!

716
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,290
Nan Chu.

717
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,210
I made some red dates cake.

718
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,430
Have some.

719
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,880
Auntie, I can't eat.

720
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,140
