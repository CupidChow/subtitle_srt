00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,680
Have you forgotten the stories

192
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,320
we read in the award room?

193
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,280
You've changed.

194
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,790
You've become such a utilitarian.

195
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,680
Have you ever thought about

196
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,730
how we can work as a team

197
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,280
when we go on missions

198
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,750
if we see each other as rivals?

199
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,300
You're taking it too far

200
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,610
and mixing things up.

201
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,290
Lou Mingye is my teacher.

202
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,970
Director Lin will always be my master.

203
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,890
A teacher is a teacher.

204
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,520
A master is a master.

205
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,860
They can coexist!

206
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,460
We can learn something from everyone!

207
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,220
If possible,

208
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,940
I even want to learn structural engineering from Deputy Director Yu.

209
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,950
Don't change the subject.

210
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,370
That's a whole other bag.

211
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,430
You're just being mean!

212
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,900
You're biased against Director Lou!

213
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,990
Believe whatever you want.

214
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,800
Assistant Liu.

215
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,640
Are you okay?

216
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm fine.

217
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,870
I'm just…

218
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,760
I'm just a bit out of breath.

219
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,520
Gosh.

220
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,280
You look pale.

221
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,500
Are you feeling unwell?

222
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:12,930
I'm fine.

223
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,930
Don't play tough.

224
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,110
Go to the hospital now.

225
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,660
I'll tell Director Lou about it.

226
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,760
Yu, don't mention him.

227
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,490
It's making me feel worse.

228
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,000
Put your feud aside

229
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,170
at least for now.

230
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,390
All right.

231
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,190
You need a check-up.

232
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,480
Let's go.

233
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,280
Let's find out what's wrong with you.

234
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,160
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

235
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,140
It won't take long.

236
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,910
[Outpatient Department]

237
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,460
Inhale.
[Outpatient Department]

238
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,620
Inhale.

239
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,620
Are there any other symptoms?

240
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,610
The test result is fine.

241
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,840
Maybe you're just under too much pressure at work.

242
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,430
There have been a few sudden deaths

243
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,520
in the E.R.

244
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,660
and the dead were all fitness buffs.

245
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,930
I feel great now.

246
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,890
Dr. Xia.

247
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,780
I was just too angry just now.

248
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,920
Don't worry.

249
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
I'm

250
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,060
right as rain.

251
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,490
Has something happened at the station?

252
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,940
A really annoying guy

253
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,160
came.

254
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,050
He's obsessed with new equipment

255
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:05,890
and new technology.

256
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,480
Everyone at the station

257
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,410
feels so overwhelmed.

258
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,760
He's also made us compete with each other.

259
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,350
I'm worried

260
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,400
that in the end,

261
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,290
even someone like me will wash out.

262
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,440
Try to find solutions

263
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,650
instead of keeping complaining.

264
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,190
You can prove your abilities to him

265
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,110
to shut him up.

266
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,160
Yeah.

267
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,260
Dr. Xia.

268
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,780
I'll get going.

269
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:29,910
Wait.

270
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,370
This is for you.

271
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,170
I've never received any gifts from girls.

272
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,790
Dr. Xia.

273
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:47,890
Dr. Xia.

274
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,810
Our bottles…

275
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,650
It was a two-for-one sale.

276
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,750
What a bargain.

277
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:52,800
I like it.

278
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,670
Leave if there's nothing else.

279
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,760
I'm working the night shift later.

280
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,770
Okay.

281
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,690
I'll leave you to work.

282
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,370
Have a good rest.

283
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,940
I called you here today

284
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,120
to talk to you about something.

285
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,430
My application to work in administration

286
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,650
has been approved.

287
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,160
The appointment has been announced.

288
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,890
Finally.

289
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,150
Great.

290
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,880
When are you supposed to report?

291
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:29,890
Next Monday.

292
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,640
Okay.

293
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,620
I'll send you there on Monday.

294
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,670
What?

295
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,280
Are you unhappy

296
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,040
about your new post?

297
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,600
No.

298
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,290
I'm glad that I can keep working

299
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,300
in the fire department.

300
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,520
But I can't stop worrying

301
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,170
about our station.

302
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,860
What are you worried about?

303
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,600
You were there during that assessment.

304
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,630
I think something has gone terribly wrong

305
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,100
at the station.

306
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,930
They didn't perform well

307
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
in that assessment

308
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,630
just because

309
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,270
drones were new to them.

310
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,870
And perhaps they haven't got enough training.

311
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,390
After they blundered in the first test,

312
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,540
they kept making mistakes in the following tests.

313
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,760
They were too nervous.

314
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,770
Right?

315
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,030
It's no big deal.

316
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,140
Do you believe what you're saying?

317
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,530
You

318
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,420
don't want to interfere with Lou Mingye's work.

319
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,640
I understand.

320
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,600
With reformation

321
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,160
comes pain.

322
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,580
And it needs time.

323
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,260
But come to think of it,

324
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,780
reformation can't be achieved overnight.

325
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,470
We've just left for a few days.

326
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,980
But you know what?

327
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,630
Lou Mingye has filed a complaint against Liu

328
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,650
and asked to remove him

329
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,400
from his position.

330
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,120
What's the beef?

331
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,880
I don't know.

332
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,390
If I did, I wouldn't be so worried.

333
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,810
We've worked at that station

334
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,990
for so many years.

335
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,760
It's like our child.

336
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,520
Now that our child is in trouble,

337
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,870
we can't just sit by.

338
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,240
Yang.

339
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,990
You should

340
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,930
talk to Lou Mingye about it.

341
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,780
After all, he's the director now.

342
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,640
He arranges all the work at the station.

343
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,660
I don't work at Heping Road Station anymore

344
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,230
and have no position there.

345
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,540
What right do I have

346
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,050
and who am I

347
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,770
to intervene?

348
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,900
So,

349
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,130
here is my solution.

350
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,940
Since my accident,

351
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,680
Yu has taken over my place as the instructor.

352
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,030
Now that I'm going to work in administration,

353
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,800
the station needs a new instructor.

354
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,650
So,

355
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,000
I hope you can take the baton

356
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,640
and return to the station

357
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:09,900
as the instructor.

358
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,500
I just got transferred out.

359
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,020
The superiors won't agree.

360
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,150
It's not suitable.

361
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,870
How come?

362
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,520
Captain Meng was transferred in and out of

363
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,910
administration three times

364
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,340
for the best interest of the firefighting teams.

365
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,600
That was how our team was formed.

366
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,280
Lin.

367
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,760
We're both veteran firefighters.

368
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,400
As the old saying goes,

369
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,390
I'm a brick in the revolution

370
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,530
and will go wherever I'm needed.

371
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,700
Let me think about it.

372
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,750
Okay.

373
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,390
Five, six, seven, eight.

374
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,540
Two, two, three, four.

375
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,010
Well,

376
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,510
sorry.

377
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,350
Stop for a sec.

378
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,400
What's wrong?

379
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,740
Nan Chu.

380
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,640
I don't understand the moves the choreographer designed.

381
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,570
They can't show

382
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,080
the pain of losing a child.

383
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,490
I think the moves are fine.

384
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,710
In performance,

385
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,350
constraining emotions works better than letting them out.

386
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,780
Think about it.

387
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,500
If you were in great pain,

388
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,270
you wouldn't want anything to know it, would you?

389
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,650
So,

390
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,580
concealing your feelings

391
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,930
can arouse more sympathy in the audience.

392
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,650
Nan Chu.

393
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,920
You should lead this dance.

394
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,420
Yes.

395
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,180
Nan Chu.

396
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,240
If you dance with us,

397
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,170
we'll have a higher chance of getting chosen.

398
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,680
You're just too nervous.

399
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,940
You can make it.

400
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,750
Okay.

401
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,890
[Lin Luxiao]

402
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:51,880
Hey.

403
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,050
Coach Lin.

404
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,040
What's wrong?

405
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,770
The rehearsal didn't go well?

406
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,880
Yanzi and Sha

407
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,940
have been practicing very hard

408
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,630
but still can't meet the expectations.

409
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,020
They're anxious about it,

410
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,000
but I can't help them on the stage

411
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,760
and don't dare to say much.

412
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,480
I don't want to affect their mood.

413
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,170
This is a rare opportunity.

414
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,270
I don't know what to do now.

415
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,620
You don't need to rehearse again today, do you?

416
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,130
No.

417
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,480
I'll go back and figure something out.

418
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,280
Don't go back.

419
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,240
Come with me.

420
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,890
What are we going to do?

421
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,530
Just walk around.

422
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,530
It's a weekend.

423
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,670
What do you want for dinner?

424
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,630
Anything will do

425
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,440
as long as I'm with you.

426
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,130
When you weren't in the Fire Investigation Department,

427
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,680
we were on different schedules,

428
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,860
and even when we both had free time,

429
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,660
either Lin Qi or someone else got in the way.

430
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,920
Yeah.

431
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,600
Now that I think about it,

432
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,570
actually,

433
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,180
this is just our second date.

434
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,150
Right?

435
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,580
When will you be on leave next time?

436
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,890
Why don't we go on a trip?

437
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,080
There are so many things I want to do with you.

438
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,340
How about we go hiking

439
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,980
and watch the sunset?

440
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,170
We can also go surfing by the beach

441
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,350
or skiing on real snow.

442
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,380
Sure.

443
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,390
You agree?

444
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,490
Nan Chu.

445
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,980
There's something

446
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,500
I need

447
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,390
to tell you.

448
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,820
What's it?

449
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,130
I met Yang

450
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,640
and he said something.

451
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,050
In short, he hopes that I can go back

452
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,730
to Heping Road Station

453
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,620
as the instructor.

454
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,360
What do you think?

455
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,640
I…

456
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,570
I don't know what to think.

457
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,630
There's too much going on.

458
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,640
Neither Yang nor I

459
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,330
work at that station now.

460
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,600
I heard that a lot has happened.

461
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,210
I've worked with people there

462
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,680
for so many years.

463
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,820
Every one of them

464
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,420
has been through thick and thin with me

465
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,150
and fought alongside me.

466
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,680
To be honest,

467
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,200
I'm worried about them.

468
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,800
But

469
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,650
if I go back,

470
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,590
things will go back to the way they were.

471
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,070
I'll be very busy

472
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,830
and won't have much free time.

473
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,150
I know.

474
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,330
I haven't made up my mind yet.

475
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,380
I want

476
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,730
to ask your opinion.

477
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,660
I'm at a loss now.

478
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,120
Don't worry about me

479
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,970
and don't overthink.

480
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,110
If you want to go back,

481
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,410
I'll support you.

482
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,720
I told you

483
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,650
that you belong at the front line.

484
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,360
Let me sleep on it.

485
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,500
Nan Chu.

486
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,350
What's wrong?

487
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,400
Can't sleep?

488
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,870
Did I wake you up?

489
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,220
No.

490
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,890
Is something bothering you?

491
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,880
Coach Lin is going back to the Special Division Station as the instructor.

492
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,360
He's going back to the front line.

493
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,560
Then is he going to be so busy

494
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,900
that you can barely meet him?

495
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,640
I don't know.

496
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,070
Maybe.

497
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,980
Sometimes,

498
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,870
I hope

499
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,420
he can spend more time with me.

500
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,660
But I'm used to it anyway.

501
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,710
It's not a big deal.

502
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,640
But as you know,

503
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,200
many firefighters died

504
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,630
in the explosion at South Bay Harbor.

505
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,110
Instructor Yang lost a leg in it.

506
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,460
I see.

507
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,860
You're worried about Coach Lin's safety.

508
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,060
I never fully understood how dangerous his job was.

509
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,130
But after that accident,

510
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,940
I do.

511
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,630
I can't help but think

512
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,650
that after he goes back to the front line,

513
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,880
something similar will happen again.

514
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,660
What if he didn't survive next time?

515
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,330
Why don't you tell him about your worries

516
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,470
and talk him out of it?

517
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,080
Xi Gu.

518
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,510
I've become so strange.

519
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,420
Am I too selfish?

520
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,250
No.

521
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,180
It's understandable.

522
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,230
I know I should respect his job.

523
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,870
I also know

524
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,310
that he has duties to fulfill.

525
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,250
But I just can't get rid of

526
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,890
those selfish thoughts.

527
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,180
I really hope he can stay in the Fire Investigation Department.

528
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,820
That way, we can spend

529
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,830
lots of time together

530
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,690
and have lots of fun.

531
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,400
I want him to go back,

532
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,580
but I also want him to stay.

533
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,480
I feel so torn.

534
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,050
Is that why

535
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,440
you acted cool in front of him

536
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,990
during the day

537
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,390
but mope under the covers at night?

538
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,880
What is love?

539
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,400
Even death becomes an easy choice in front of it.

540
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,100
Alright. Stop thinking about it.

541
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,660
Sha and the others will come to practice tomorrow morning.

542
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,410
Actually, I don't think you should feel torn.

543
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,380
Because in the end,

544
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,390
you'll still support Coach Lin's choice.

545
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,850
You're right.

546
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,950
I'll always support him.

547
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,980
If he can't make time to see me,

548
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,380
I'll make time to meet him.

549
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:09,640
Alright.

550
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,350
Stop thinking.

551
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,360
Go to sleep.

553
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,310
Are you used to it now?

554
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,700
I'll get used to it

555
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,840
eventually.

556
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,900
It's not like I have a choice.

When are you going to the Fire Investigation Department?

558
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,490

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,860
If you have any requests,

560
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,820
tell me.

561
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,590
No requests.

562
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,520
We just came to see you.

563
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,110
We missed you.

564
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,180
I'd buy it if Zhengang said it.

565
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,790
But it came out of your mouth.

566
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,050

How about this?

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,860
If you just want to catch up,

571
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,820
we can talk after work.

572
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,550
I need to attend a meeting now.

573
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,600
-Wait.
-Captain Meng.

574
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,230
Well,

575
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,610
we're not here

576
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,790
just to see you.

577
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,560
We have a small request.

578
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,410
Get to the point.

579
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,470
I don't have all day.

580
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,940
Have a seat.

581
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,620
Sit.

582
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:22,720
Spill.

583
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,700
Here's the thing.

584
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,340
We were there

585
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,150
during the last assessment.

586
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,960
After going back,

587
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,140
we both felt bad about it.

588
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,740
Ever since we took over Heping Road Station

589
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,180
from the previous director,

590
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,410
we've excelled in every aspect.

591
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,880
But now…

592
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,810
You know.

593
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,050
Actually,

594
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,600
we can't blame it all on Lou Mingye.

595
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,780
He's new there

596
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,420
and unfamiliar with many things.

597
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,430
He needs some time to adjust.

598
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,610
Right?

599
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,200
That assessment

600
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,180
was a hell of a mess!

601
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,140
Yes.

602
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:06,900
It was.

603
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,170
What do you two think?

604
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,890
Here is

605
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,110
my opinion.

606
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,120
The other day,

607
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,840
I talked with him.

608
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,480
Since I left,

609
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,790
there has been no instructor at Heping Road Station.

610
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,860
So I hope Lin can go back

611
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,870
and replace me

612
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,040
as the instructor.

613
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,060
You? Instructor?

614
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,390
When he brought it up,

615
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,570
I refused at first.

616
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,960
I thought I couldn't be an instructor.

617
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,440
Later we discussed it

618
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,950
and had a deep conversation.

619
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,650
I agree with one thing he said.

620
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,200
It doesn't hurt

621
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,670
to give it a try.

622
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,450
Compared with someone

623
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,000
who's transferred from somewhere else

624
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,180
and is unfamiliar with the situation,

625
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,870
I'm a better choice.

626
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,880
I used to be the director there

627
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,730
and still have a deep bond with those firefighters.

628
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,500
I'm also familiar with everything at the station.

629
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,940
If I talk to them as their instructor,

630
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,700
they'll listen to me.

631
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,690
If you have the confidence,

632
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,430
I can give you a chance.

633
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,500
But let me make it clear.

634
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,260
You have to

635
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,310
promise

636
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,320
to improve things greatly

637
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,050
after you go back.

638
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,150
Don't let me down

639
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,830
or let others think

640
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,480
Heping Road Station is under poor leadership.

641
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,610
I know.

642
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,310
Thank you, Captain Meng.

643
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,480
This is the complaint

644
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,170
Lou Mingye

645
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,810
filed against Liu Ruyi.

646
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,880
After you go back,

647
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,350
your first task

648
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,490
is to settle their feud.

649
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:08,820
Captain Meng.

650
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,500
Rest assured.

651
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,140
I give you my promise.

652
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,690
After I go back,

653
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,210
I'll solve

654
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,100
all the problems like this.

655
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,610
Bring people together

656
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,460
at Heping Road Station.

657
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,440
I need to see

658
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,450
a united team.

659
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,630
Yes.

660
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,710
Three things.

661
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:32,640
First,

662
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,860
besides more training every day,

663
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,090
I've applied to the Command Center

664
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,810
to notify us first

665
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,450
when assistance is needed.

666
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,260
It'll be training in real emergencies

667
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,610
and a good chance

668
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,250
to learn from the other fire stations.

669
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,710
If anyone wants out,

670
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,940
you can apply to transfer away.

671
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,660
We don't need idle hands here.

672
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,490
Second,

673
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,840
I have an announcement.

674
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,610
Before we

675
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,160
get our groove back,

676
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,930
no one is allowed to take leave.

677
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,180
I'll abide by this decision too.

678
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,870
I'll cancel all my leave.

679
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,350
I hope the leader of every unit

680
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,480
can abide by it too

681
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,120
to set a good example.

682
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,050
Director Lin.

683
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,800
Hello, everyone.

684
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,810
I'm Lin Luxiao,

685
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,370
your new instructor.

686
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,630
The official appointment

687
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,440
will be announced this afternoon.

688
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,450
Instructor.

689
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,590
Instructor.

690
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,830
Have I allowed you to talk?

691
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:51,640
Sit down.

692
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,660
Third,

693
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,380
Mr. Lin Luxiao,

694
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,070
the former director of this station,

695
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,680
will be back as our instructor

696
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,360
from this day on.

697
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,830
Let's welcome him.

698
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,720
Great!

699
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,870
He's finally back.

700
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,630
Hey.

701
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,210
Milan.

702
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,360
I'm busy. What's it?

703
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,250
Well,

704
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,970
my leave

705
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,860
has been canceled.

706
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,830
I'm afraid I can't come home for Miaomiao's birthday.

707
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,880
I mean,

708
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,480
can you explain it to her

709
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,610
for me?

710
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:53,800
[Yu Qilei]

711
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,340
Hello?
[Yu Qilei]

712
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,770
[Yu Qilei]

713
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,360
Hello?
[Yu Qilei]

714
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,510
If you don't want to come back

715
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,390
or can't come back,

716
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,520
just be honest with us.

717
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,250
Don't give us hope and then shatter it every time.

718
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,310
The new instructor

719
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,990
canceled everyone's leave.

720
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,160
[Yu Qilei]
canceled everyone's leave.

721
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,750
[Yu Qilei]

722
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,970
I have no choice.
[Yu Qilei]

723
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,120
Anyway, Miaomiao is waiting for you to come back every day.

724
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,380
Explain it to her yourself.

725
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,940
I don't know what to say.

726
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,740
Shiquan.

727
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,590
You need more training.

728
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,640
You're too thin.

729
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,130
Instructor.

730
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,970
Come on. I miss eating with you.

731
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,520
Sit here.

732
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,650
Come.

733
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,710
Lower your voice.

734
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,730
I missed you.

735
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,340
Instructor.

736
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,260
Please.

737
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,660
Don't shout in the canteen.

738
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,420
Come on.

739
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,370
Have a seat.

740
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,010
Welcome back.

741
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:52,970
Have some meat.

742
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:53,690
Alright.

743
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,230
Dig in.

744
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,900
Shiquan.

745
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,080
Sit here.

746
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,300
Don't mind me, Master.

747
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,140
It's a small table.

748
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,440
I'll eat somewhere else.

749
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,640
Don't mind him.

750
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,230
Lin.

751
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,320
You're finally back.

752
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,660
We all looked forward to this day.

753
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,550
You have no idea

754
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,310
how insane Lou Mingye is.

755
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,700
Don't talk about him.

756
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,380
Let's talk about you first.

757
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,640
What's wrong with you?

758
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,280
What do you mean?

759
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,580
What do I mean?

760
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,940
Captain Meng has received his complaint.

761
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,500
Stop playing dumb.

762
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,220
Lou Mingye.

763
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,320
It doesn't matter.

764
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,410
It's just a complaint.

765
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,640
He can complain all he likes.

766
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,150
I don't think he can do anything to me.

767
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,490
Liu.

768
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,140
What kind of attitude is that?

769
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:40,770
Tell me.

770
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,830
Do you still want to be the director's assistant?

771
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,630
If you want to resign,

772
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,140
let me know.

773
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,700
I have the complaint letter.

774
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,930
You scared me.

775
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,230
You have it so I can be relieved,

776
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,820
can't I?

777
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,870
Alright.

778
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,390
I haven't decided what to do with it.

779
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,580
Then what will you do?

780
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,350
First, it depends on your performance.

781
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:02,900
Second,

782
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,460
I need to find out who's at fault.

783
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,230
Master.

784
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,070
You don't know.

785
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,660
-He...
-Now let's talk about you, Yijiu.

786
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,890
I've seen what happened in that assessment.

787
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,160
I'm so disappointed in you.

788
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,430
You've been here for a long time.

789
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,580
Have you learned nothing at all,

790
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,500
Yijiu?

791
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,890
What have you been doing every day?

793
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,150
What's wrong?

794
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,500
Nothing big.

795
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,420
Enjoy your meal.

796
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,550
I'll wait for you outside.

797
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,630
Eat.

798
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,720
Eat your fill.

800
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,150
You're so thin.

801
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:46,920
I've lost weight too.

802
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,810
That's great.

00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,440
Nothing serious.

00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,790
Well,

807
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,420
I've been saving up my leave.

808
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,860
I want to go home to see Milan and Miaomiao.

809
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,570
Go.

810
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,880
You don't need to tell me.

811
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,220
The problem

812
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,940
is that no one is allowed to take leave now.

813
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,450
I…

814
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,130
I could've been fine with it,

815
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,490
but Miaomiao's birthday is coming up.

816
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,620
If I missed it,

817
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,920
I'd feel so bad about myself.

818
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,350
I understand.

819
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,900
How about this?

820
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,540
I'll go talk to the director.

821
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,210
Really?

822
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:24,930
Yes.

823
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,030
Thank you, Director Lin.

824
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,830
Thank you.

825
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,800
I can't guarantee that he'll agree.

826
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,560
Calm down.

827
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,480
One more thing.

828
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,660
I'm the instructor now,

829
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,790

830
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,590
Oh, right.

00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,430
Thank you, Instructor.

832
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:37,230
Alright.

833
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,200
I'll go talk to him now.

834
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,040
Wait a minute.

835
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,130
Okay. Thank you.

836

837
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,590
I have something to discuss with you.

838
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,890
What's it?

839
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,820
Yu Qilei

840
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,080
has been saving his leave for a long time

841
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,100
and wants to go home to see his wife and child.

842
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,650
Can you let him go?

843
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,350
I just canceled all leave

844
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,080
yet you came to ask for leave for Yu Qilei.

845
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,970
Who will take my words seriously in the future?

846
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,320
I know Yu Qilei

847
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,660
very well.

848
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,060
He's been working here for a long time.

849
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,230
He won't make such a request

850
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,910
unless he has to.

851
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,140
And he hasn't taken leave for a long time.

852
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,240
His daughter's birthday is coming up.

853
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,170
Please give it a thought.

854
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,140
He deserves a break.

855
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,080
We should manage this station in a humane way.

856
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,810
I'll think about it.

857
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,490
Okay.

858
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,670
You have the complaint letter against Liu Yuyi.

859
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
What do you plan to do?

860
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,920
Let him work as usual for now.

861
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,650

Liu Ruyi used to be my unit leader.

864
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,790
I didn't file that complaint to drive him away.

865
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,910
I just think given his current state,

866
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,020
he's not qualified to be the director's assistant.

867
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,150
I understand.

868

I'm back to help you.

and have a clear division of labor.

871
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,150
I'll follow your plans at work,

872
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,380
but I need time for other things.

873
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:44,910
Okay.

Yes.

I thought we were not allowed to take leave.

881
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,980
I talked to Instructor Lin

882
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,160
and he helped me.

he began to rally people to his side.

887

and sometimes too stern with us.

893
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,640
He's just too rational.

But

895
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,540
he's not unreasonable.

896

Maybe he's just

When Coach Lin doesn't have time for you,

952
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,940
you can see him with this.

953
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,630
Thank you, Xi Gu.

954
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,150
Nan Chu,

955
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,740
as you know,

956
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,340
you have the perfect love in my heart.

957
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,520
No matter what happens,

958
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,370
you and Coach Lin must be happy.

959
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,550
We will.

960
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,630
It's Mr. Han.

Mr. Han.

963
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,250
You asked to see me?

[Beiyao Entertainment]

965
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,930
I heard

966
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:56,150
that you've been working on choreography for Dream Dance.

967
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,260
I haven't been assigned any work recently,

968
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,970
so I…

969
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,120
Why we haven't assigned any work for you?

970
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,630
You should know the answer.

971
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:07,950
Alright.

972
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,680
It's been months.

973
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,450
Your acting classes are close to the end.

974
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,710
Don't you think

975
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,950
it's time for you to come back and make some contributions?

976
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,290
I know.

977
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,010
I'll try my best

978
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,270
to complete whatever tasks you assign me,

979
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,040
but when I'm off work,

980
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,470
I hope I can…

981
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,740
From now on,

982
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,270
your work is dancing.

983
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,510
You'll keep dancing when you're off work.

984
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,790
I don't understand what you mean.

985
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,740
We've decided to support Dream Dance.

986
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,760
You'll be the lead

987
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,080
and try to get on the stage of Beixun Theater.

988
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,630
Really?

989
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,650
Do I look like I'm kidding?

990
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,630
Zong, what are they talking about?

991
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,600
Zong.

992
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:07,840
Stop guessing.

993
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,940
It's good news.

994
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,110
Really?

995
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,500
What's it?

996
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,090
Zong, did I do anything wrong?

997
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,700
I asked you to find a house in Sunshine Garden Community.

998
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,580
Why didn't you do it?

999
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,750
That's because

1000
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,600
it's too far away from the Special Division Station.

1001
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,700
It'll be harder for Nan Chu to meet Coach Lin.

1002
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,250
I…

1003
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:32,960
Yeah.

1004
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,180
Yeah.

1005
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,270
You have a point.

1006
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,740
I do.

1007
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,610
What you did before

1008
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,430
disappointed the public

1009
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,070
and disappointed me.

1010
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,340
I've been thinking about

1011
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,450
what kind of persona you should adopt

1012
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,560
to be back under the spotlight.

1013
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,150
A few days ago,

1014
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,500
Shen Guangzong

1015
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,810
showed me a video of your rehearsal.

1016
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,650
It inspired me.

1017
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,670
I have an idea.

1018
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,010
I think

1019
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,820
maybe you can make

1020
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,290
more people like you

1021
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,640
just by being who you really are.

Fire safety is of great importance.

In daily life,

1029
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,100
we should all take fire safety seriously

1030
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,620
and start with small things around us.

1031
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,220
