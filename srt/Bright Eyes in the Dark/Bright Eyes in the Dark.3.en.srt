Have you caught your breaths?

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,460
Didn't I tell you your area collapsed

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,650
and you shouldn't run around?

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,260
Didn't I tell you that?

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,500
Why do I have to bother about saving you when I'm putting out the fire?

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,220

Who will take the responsibility if something goes wrong?

How can we explain to his family if he's in danger?

Director Lin. Instructor Yang.

30
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,100
Please describe your relationship

31
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,220
in one sentence.

32
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,660

35
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,740
Why aren't you being honest?

He's thin-skinned.

37
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,020
He's embarrassed to say it in front of you.

38
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,100
In my opinion,

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,900
we are in fact

40
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,020
like a married couple.

Like what?

43
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,060
A married couple.

44
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,420
Let me tell you something.

45
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,820
A true relationship between a director and an instructor

46
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,860
should be as intimate as a married couple

47
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,340
and they should complement each other.

48
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:40,780
Think about it.

49
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,940
Think about it carefully.

50
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,980
Isn't what I said right?

51
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,500
Well,

52
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,620
director, can you...

53
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,700
Can you

54
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:47,900
stop recording this portion?

55
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,860
They're recording a show. What are you talking about?

56
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,540
A reality show should be real.

00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,500

58
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,420
Stop talking nonsense.

59
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:53,740
If you say so,

60
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,820
we'll have to have a debate.

63
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,180
didn't I sew it up for you?

64

00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,180

I've asked the real estate agent

93
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,100
to rent out my house.

94
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,260
There are already people viewing it today.

I'll transfer some money to you later.

110

See if

111
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,100
it makes up the rent for a month or two.

112
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,820
Maybe if the landlord is in a good mood,

113
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,100
she'll give us a few more days.

114
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,540

115
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,620

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,100
The point is

123
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,290
that it's not worth it.

124
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,940

I know you too well.

158
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,420
You're using an outdated phone

and living in the cheapest house.

160
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,460
Every penny you saved

161
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,860
has been put into the Dream Dance Club.

162
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,500
But you're acting strange today

163
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,740
and treating everyone to a meal.

164
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,730
Is it because you're saying goodbye?

165
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,860
Maybe I'm being generous

166
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,500
because I secured us a sponsor.

167
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,740
Really?

169
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,300
Your mother persistently forbade you from dancing.

170
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,300
Why do you still insist on it?

171
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,540
Dancing is my original aspiration

172
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,820
and my dream.

173
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,580
I can't give up on that.

174
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,220
Dreams are beautiful.

175
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,340
But the reality...

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,700

177
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,100
our bank account

178
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,180
was already empty.

179
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,300
I tried many ways, but...

180
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,260
but I still couldn't make ends meet.

181
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,700
Your original aspiration is dancing.

182
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,860
My original aspiration is the Dream Dance Club.

183
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,180
But I've woken up from my dream now.

184
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,060
I've seen it clearly for so many days now.

185
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,170
To persist in your dream, you have to have the capabilities,

186
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,100
the conviction, and the determination.

187
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,100

But I don't think

189
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,260
I do.

190
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,140
If

191
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,500
I give up halfway,

00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,780
will you be disappointed in me?

193
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,140
Are you shutting down the dance club?

194
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,940
I don't want to.

195
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,100
Then don't.

196
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,300
If I don't,

197

can you take over?

198
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,020
I can only rest assured

199
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,500

200

Auntie, let's talk nicely.

217
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,900
Last time, because of you,

218
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,420
I was dragged to the police station

219
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
and suffered for almost an entire day.

220
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,620
You did falsely report a fire the last time.

221
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,100
It's not our fault.

222
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,060
What about the rent?

223
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,580
It's a universal rule to pay off your debts.

224
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,420
How long are you going to delay it?

225
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,540
Let me tell you.

226
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,780
if you don't

227
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,500
pay off all the rent you owe me today,

228
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,700
you'll have to move out right now.

229
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,860
You won't pay me, right?

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,900
You can discuss the matters of the rent with me.

233
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,220
I can't talk to you about it.

234
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,340
What's wrong with Le Zhiwei?

235
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,420
He turned off his phone and doesn't reply to my WeChat messages.

236
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,060
He even terminated his house's lease contract.

237
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,810
He's trying to ghost me

238
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,780
and run away without paying, right?

239
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,180
He terminated his house's lease contract?

240
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,300
That's impossible.

241
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,100
We just had dinner together yesterday.

242
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:48,940
Yes.

243
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,540
Fine. Keep on with the act.

244
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,250
Auntie, don't worry.

245
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,540
I'll take care of the rent from now on.

00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,300

249
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,460

No.

252
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,500
Including the rent for the second half of the year,

253
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,380
it's a total of 296,800.

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,740

255
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,260
Transfer it to me now.

256
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,780
Sorry, I don't have that much money right now.

265

00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,580

371
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,620
Once you become popular enough,

372
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,260
you'll get to showcase your area of talent.

373
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,900
Take a look at the contract.

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,660
Mr. Shen,

377
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,500
I have a request.

378
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,340
Go ahead.

379
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,900
I hope the company can pay me 300,000 in advance.

380
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,140
Also, I must be allowed to dance during non-working hours.

381
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,580
Nan Chu.

382
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,140
You're just a rookie who hasn't even signed the contract.

383
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,260
Don't you think it's inappropriate

384
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,820
to make such requests?

385
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,220
If you refuse, I might not be able to sign it.

386
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,060
How about this?

387
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,660
You can talk to Chairman Han.

388
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,620
If he has no objections, then I'll accept it.

389
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,460
Okay.

390
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,900
Nan Chu.

391
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,340
I can consider your requests.

392
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,380
But the terms we discussed before

393
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,660
will no longer be valid.

394
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,250
[Mr. Han]

395
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,140
You get 30%
[Mr. Han]

396
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,660
[Mr. Han]

397
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,540
of your projects' earning
[Mr. Han]

398
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,140
[Mr. Han]

399
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,170
and it'll be a ten-year contract.
[Mr. Han]

400
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,180
and it'll be a ten-year contract.

401
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Can you accept it?

402
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,620
Mr. Han.

403
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,140
I think

404
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,700
Nan Chu doesn't seem to be sincere.

405
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,100
I think we should forget about it.

406
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,020
Let’s talk about it another day...

407
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,530
Mr. Han.

408
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,940
As long as you agree,

409
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,540
I can accept any other conditions.

410
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,620
I know

411
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,260
that you first contacted me

412
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,300
because you know my mom, right?

413
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,700
Of course.

414
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,420
But

415
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,220
they are separate matters.

416
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,140
I have my expectations for you,

417
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,820
and I have my plans.

418
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,900
I'm curious

419
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,540
as to why you suddenly changed your mind.

420
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,940
Because there's something I don't want to give up.

421
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,010
Okay.

422
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,820
Welcome to Beiyao.

423
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,140
Mr. Han.

424
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,420
I have another request.

425
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,380
Can you pay me the signing bonus in a week?

426
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,380
No problem.

427
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,260
Guangzong.

428
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,260
I'll leave it to you then.

429
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:13,940
Mr. Han.

430
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:14,780
Don’t worry.

431
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,940
I'll make the proper arrangements.

432
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,770
Okay.

433
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,250
You're really something, Nan Chu.

434
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,100
Don't worry.

435
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,700
As long as the contract is revised

436
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,930
and you sign it, you'll be a part of us.

437
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,740
From now on,

438
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,010
just follow the company's arrangements.

439
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,740
I'll assign an assistant to you next time.

440
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,220
Then I'll take Xi Gu.

441
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,500
Xi Gu?

442
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,010
Is it a man or a woman?

443
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,140
Have I seen them before?

444
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,020
That's Xi Gu.

445
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,020
You're Xi Gu?

446
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,860
From now on,

447
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:43,780
you'll

448
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,220
be

449
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,740
Nan Chu's makeup artist and assistant.

450
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,500
Really?

451
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:50,900
Well...

452
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,980
Thank you so much.

453
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,460
I will work hard.

454
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,900
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

455
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,860
Okay, cut.

456
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,420
All right, actors, let's take a break.

457
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,020
Let's blow it up and bring that back again.

458
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,900
Let's shoot another take of the reactions.

459
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,140
Get the required equipment.

460
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,300
The smoke is too strong.

461
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,060
Director, control it now.

462
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,180
Put it over there.

463
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,540
Step back.

464
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,700
What are you doing?

465
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,740
Hurry up.

466
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,700
Hurry up.

467
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,570
Producer!

468
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,820
Go back.

469
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,580
Let's go.

470
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,300
Hurry up.

471
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:32,860
Run forward.

472
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,380
Run!

473
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,540
Evacuate!

474
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,460
Hurry!

475
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,260
Hurry up.

476
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,860
Calling Command Center.

477
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,060
Heping Road Special Division Station

478
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,460
has dispatched 3 trucks and 16 people

479
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,700
to deal with the construction fire incident

480
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,940
at Boyu Pictures' base at Xianghu Road.

481
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,260
The cadre's led by Lin Luxiao.

482
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,340
Command Center, copy that.

483
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,460
The fire at Boyu Pictures' base is ongoing and there's a lot of smoke.

484
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,660
A lot of staff are trapped inside

485
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,540
a smoke-laden environment

486
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,380
Head for the rescue immediately.

487
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,700
The other firefighters will also arrive in succession soon.

488
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,580
Truck 1, copy that.

489
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,860
Truck 2, copy that.

490
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,860
Truck 3, copy that.

491
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:32,700
Yijiu. Shiquan.

492
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,420
-Yes!
-Yes!

493
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,620
For today's mission,

494
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,300
you two can only observe.

495
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,300
Without orders,

496
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,620
you cannot take action on your own.

497
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,530
Do you hear me?

498
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,180
-Yes!
-Yes!

499
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,740
Help!

500
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,580
What’s going on?

501
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,330
-Run!
-Help!

502
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,330
Zhiyi!

503
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:58,970
What's going on?

504
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,010
There's a fire.

505
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,260
Everyone, go out quickly!

506
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,100
Hurry up!

507
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,380
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up!

508
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,060
Go!

509
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,940
I can't take it anymore.

510
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,180
We can't get out from here.

511
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,340
Step back!

512
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,620
Sorry.

513
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,660
Sorry.

514
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,420
Don't push!

515
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,940
What are you doing?

516
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,460
Hurry and go.

517
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,900
This way.

518
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,860
Lower your body quickly.

519
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,060
Get some water.

520
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,980
Use water to wet the clothes and cover your mouth and nose with it.

521
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,300
Get your clothes and block the door gaps.

522
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:56,940
Hurry up.

523
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,260
Clothes! Get the clothes!

524
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,380
Fire the water guns.

525
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,420
Get the smoke ejectors ready.

526
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,100
Evacuate the masses.

527
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,340
We're still unclear of the situation.

528
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,180
Be prepared.

529
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,500
Director Lin.

530
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,940
Director Lin, what's the situation?

531
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,100
Wait here.

532
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,020
We'll bring them out.

533
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:47,570
Okay.

534
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,420
Dr. Xia Wan, be careful.

535
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,420
Liu...

536
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,250
It's Assistant Liu.

537
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,730
Be careful.

538
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,220
Okay.

539
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,300
Hurry up.

540
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:57,700
Hurry!

541
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,580
Go!

542
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,940
Keep up.

543
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,300
Yu.

544
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,140
Keep searching for the trapped people.

545
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,420
Okay.

546
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,500
Instructor is commanding on the first floor.

547
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,300
Copy that.

548
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,540
Combat Unit 1, keep up!

549
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,900
Don't panic.

550
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,740
Follow me.

551
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,900
Is someone coming to save us?

552
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,380
Open the door!

553
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,060
Director Lin, why is it you guys?

554
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,980
Didn't you start searching from there?

555
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,700
You came from there?

556
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,420
Yes.

557
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,500
It's too complicated in here.

558
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,180
Someone is calling for help.

559
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,820
Open the door!

560
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,340
Open the door!

561
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,220
Come in.

562
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,780
Attention, everyone.

563
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,420
The situation on the second floor is complicated.

564
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,660
Please mark all the areas

565
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,380
you've searched clearly.

566
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,020
Mark the areas clearly.

567
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,220
Attention to everyone on the second floor.

568
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,260
Start demolition

569
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,700
and eject the smoke.

570
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,260
Get rid of the smoke in the room first.

571
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,260
Start demolition

572
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,460
and eject the smoke.

573
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,660
Requesting for backup.

574
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,500
Team 1 requesting for backup.

575
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,300
Yijiu.

576
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,660
We're just sitting here and doing nothing.

577
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,460
The director said that we can only observe and learn.

578
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,380
We can't improve by observing and learning.

579
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,820
We need to put it into practice.

580
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,740
It's such a good opportunity to prove ourselves.

581
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,660
We've been training for over a year.

582
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,380
We're well-equipped and know how to protect ourselves. It'll be fine.

583
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,860
We'll just stay at the periphery

584
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,740
and evacuate the masses.

585
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,740
We won't go towards the heart of the action.

586
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,220
What do you think?

587
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,420
Nan Chu.

588
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:45,860
Nan Chu.

589
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,660
It's been so long.

590
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,140
Why hasn't anyone come to save us?

591
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,220
Hang in there.

592
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,660
The firefighters will come to save us.

593
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,940
Is anyone there?

594
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,500
Is anyone else there?

595
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,980
Is anyone else there?

596
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,490
Is anyone inside?

597
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,300
Is anyone there?

598
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,820
Is anyone there?

599
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,460
Don't be afraid.

600
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,740
I'll take you out.

601
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,820
Come with me. Hurry.

602
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:24,900
This way.

603
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,170
The wounded, please head this way.

604
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,050
This way.

605
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:29,940
Keep bandaging him.

606
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,420
The patient needs oxygen.

607
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,180
Oxygen.

608
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,530
Let's go.

609
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,060
What's wrong?

610
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,540
I can't open it.

611
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,700
Break it open.

612
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,860
One, two, three.

613
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,580
One, two, three.

614
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,060
Shiquan.

615
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,220
-There!
-Let's go.

616
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,060
Shiquan.

617
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,740
Where's his safety mask?

618
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,500
He didn't bring it with him.

619
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,180
Use mine.

620
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,580
Are you crazy?

621
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,730
Use mine.

622
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,820
Are you sure, Yijiu?

623
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,620
Are you okay, Yijiu?

624
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:56,930
I'm fine.

625
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,060
Yijiu.

626
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,900
Yijiu.

627
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:08,940
What's wrong?

628
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:10,940
What happened?

629
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,580
Where's his breathing apparatus?

630
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,180
Doctor!

631
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,620
Doctor, come here now.

632
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,700
Thank you.

633
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,580
This time, it was really

634
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,580
a close call.

635
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,420
Nan Chu.

636
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,020
You were so cool just now.

637
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,700
I need to learn some firefighting knowledge from now on.

638
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,020
We can never be too prepared.

639
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,660
Mr. Shen, are you okay?

640
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,860
I'm fine.

641
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,020
Are you done with your IV drip?

642
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,580
Go back first.

643
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,020
I'll wait for you. Let's go together.

644
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,860
I...

645
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:52,980
I still have a long way to go.

646
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:53,740
Go back first.

647
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,180
Is this our company's rookie?

648
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,900
I was too flustered just now to get acquainted with her.

649
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,660
This is Nan Chu. She just signed the contract with us.

650
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,100
This is Xu Zhiyi.

651
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,220
Didn't I introduce her to you on the set just now?

652
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,740
Her momentum is pretty good.

653
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,500
Hello.

654
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,340
I'm Nan Chu.

655
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,740
Hello.

656
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,540
You're pretty, smart and calm.

657
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,340
How amazing.

658
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,580
You're too kind.

659
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,980
I hope we can work together sometime.

660
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,300
I think we'll definitely become good friends.

661
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,020
Mr. Shen.

662
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,260
I'll wait for you.

663
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,060
I want to have dinner with Nan...

664
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,660
Chu.

665
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:29,940
Nan Chu!

666
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,580
I want to have dinner with Nan Chu.

667
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:32,980
No need.

668
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:33,980
You

669
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,020
should just go back and rest early.

670
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,420
By the way,

671
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,540
you should memorize your lines well

672
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,460
if you have the time.

673
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,460
How many bad takes did you have today?

674
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,420
I haven't even talked to you about that.

675
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,530
But I just met a new friend.

676
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,140
Enough. Go back.

677
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,380
We'll eat together next time then.

678
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,500
I really owe it to you today.

679
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,740
I'll treat you to a good meal next time.

680
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,180
Why next time?

681
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,380
How about today?

682
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,140
Today's fine too.

683
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,540
But look at me...

684
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,060
I'm in a bad state.

685
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,660
I'll go buy a bottle of water.

686
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,500
Wait.

687
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,260
Nan Chu.

688
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,020
Are you her assistant or is she the assistant?

689
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,220
Why did you let her go buy the water herself?

690
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,740
Ridiculous.

691
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,140
We're screwed.

692
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,180
The director must be angry.

693
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,660
I took off my breathing apparatus

694
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,050
to save someone.

695
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,060
It'll be fine.

696
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,300
I'll take the responsibility if we get into trouble.

697
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,500
Director Lin.

698
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,420
Sit down.

699
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,860
What did I tell you

700
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,770
before the dispatch?

701
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,500
You can only observe.

702
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,180
You can't get off the truck, right?

703
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,340
Who told you to act on your own accord?

704
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,260
It was my idea.

705
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,380
It has nothing to do with him.

706
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,220
Everyone was calling for backup.

707
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,130
I got anxious, so I dragged Yijiu along with me.

708
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,660
Director.

709
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,860
We were wrong.

710
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,740
How do you feel now?

711
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,660
I feel better.

712
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,780
After the IV drip,

713
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,340
go back to the station immediately.

714
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,300
Yes.

715
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,340
Hello.

716
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:23,620
Hello.

717
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,060
Thank you.

718
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,540
You're welcome. It's our duty.

719
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,300
I'm from Dream Dance Club.

720
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,100
Last time, our landlord

721
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,180
falsely reported a fire

722
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,180
to kick us out.

723
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,170
If you hadn't arrived in time,

724
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,740
we would have been kicked out.

725
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,300
I know.

726
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,420
What did the landlord do after that?

727
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,140
We managed to keep the Dream Dance Club.

728
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,180
Thank you.

729
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,180
You're welcome.

730
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,540
We were just doing our job.

731
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,260
Actually, I really want to thank you all.

732
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,900
Including today,

733
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,340
I was saved by you firefighters twice.

734
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,380
Five years ago, there was a fire in my house

735
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,020
and I was also saved by a firefighter.

736
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,140
But that firefighter who saved me

737
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,900
died in a mission.

738
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,370
I always remember him.

739
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,420
So I'm really grateful to you.

740
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,660
I sincerely hope

741
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,220
that you all can return safely

742
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,130
after every mission.

743
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,060
Thank you.

744
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,940
My name is Nan Chu.

745
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,860
I'm Lin Luxiao.

746
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,190
[Fire and Rescue Brigade of Binxi District, Beixun City]
[Heping Road Special Division Station]

747
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,380
You're finally back.

748
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,340
What's wrong?

749
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,860
The team sent someone here

750
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,100
for the matter about Yijiu and Shiquan.

751
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,220
Captain Meng's here?

752
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,170
No.

753
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,700
Then who came?

754
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,460
Who else?

755
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,570
Lou Mingye.

756
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,090
Where is he?

757
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,540
The station's administrative office.

758
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:58,700
Listen.

759
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,900
Talk to him nicely when you meet him later.

760
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,300
Don't argue with him.

761
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,940
Do you hear me?

762
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,560
[Station's Administrative Office]

763
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,260
Sorry, Inspector Lou.

764
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,180
Sorry to keep you waiting.

765
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,010
From the time I heard your trucks returning

766
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,620
until now,

767
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,460
I've waited for you for 26 minutes.

768
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:41,860
We were tidying up

769
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,180
after returning from a mission.

770
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,540
Do you have any orders for us?

771
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,180
Inspector Lou, let’s sit down and talk.

772
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,460
Have a seat.

773
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,340
Have a seat.

774
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,780
I heard someone from your station got hurt.

775
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,900
Captain Meng takes this matter very seriously.

776
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,140
He asked me to come here to find out about the situation.

777
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,580
He's not badly injured and has already returned to the station.

778
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,940
What happened exactly?

779
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,660
About the details,

780
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,940
after the review meeting,

781
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,340
I'll report them to the leader.

782
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,340
Comrade Lin Luxiao.

783
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,620
Someone got injured.

784
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,900
As the director,

785
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,940
don't you think you're greatly responsible for it?

786
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,460
Did you reduce the intensity of your station's daily training

787
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,900
or were the two new comrades not trained properly?

788
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,940
You're required to hand in an apology letter to the brigade

789
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,180
detailing this matter

790
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,100
and your station's daily training.

791
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,940
We also need to re-evaluate whether these two new comrades

792
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,460
are qualified for fire rescue.

793
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,740
No problem, Inspector Lou.

794
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,300
We'll hand it in to the brigade as soon as possible.

795
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,780
Don't worry.

796
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,130
By the way, there's another matter.

797
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,340
Your qualification for this year's evaluation

798
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,620
has been cancelled.

799
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,300
But...

800
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,340
Inspector Lou.

801
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,220
Inspector Lou.

802
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,260
Can the brigade reconsider

803
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,740
our evaluation qualification?

804
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,490
Inspector Lou.

805
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,780
Inspector Lou.

806
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,620
Can the brigade reconsider our evaluation qualification?

807
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:27,900
Inspector Lou.

808
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,380
You’re back.

809
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,740
Are you okay?

810
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:48,780
I'm fine,

811
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,340
probably.

812
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:50,940
You're back.

813
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,820
The great hero.

814
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,900
I was even discussing with Deputy Yu

815
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,940
if we should make a banner for you two.

816
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,380
Which banner slogan do you think is better,
"Failure to fulfill one's apprenticeship"

817
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,860
or "Unrealized lofty aspirations"?

818
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,460
Assistant Liu.

819
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,780
Stop teasing us.

820
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,580
Yes.

821
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,580
I didn't expect the smoke to be so strong and long-lasting.

822
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:06,860
All right.

823
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,340
Go to bed early.

824
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,780
There's a meeting with the director tomorrow.

825
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,420
W-What meeting?

826
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,060
A commendation meeting

827
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,980
to commend you two for being brave and fearless.

828
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,570
Because of you two,

829
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,300
the record of zero casualties this year

830
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,220
has been destroyed

831
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,530
and we're disqualified for the evaluation.

832
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,500
The most hateful thing is

833
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,260
that that kid Lou

834
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,860
got to reproach us.

835
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:36,690
Where are you going?

836
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,330
It's late.

837
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,220
I can't stand it anymore!

838
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm going to the gym to vent my negative energy!

839
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,700
Deputy Yu.

840
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,460
It's okay.

841
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,180
He's not mad at you.

842
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,180
Deputy Yu.

843
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,740
Who is Inspector Lou?

844
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,500
Why do I feel like Assistant Liu

845
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,700
doesn't get along well with him?

846
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,940
It's a long story.

847
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:04,980
This person

848
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,620
used to be on our side.

849
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,090
Assistant Liu was even his master.

850
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,100
But he was later transferred away.

851
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,060
This person

852
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,860
is a bit weird.

853
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,420
For the use of equipment

854
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,860
and the daily training,

855
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,220
he always has his own opinions.

856
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,300
When we bought new equipment,

857
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,180
he even got into a heated dispute with Captain Meng.

858
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,900
In short,

859
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,260
he doesn't know how to fit in.

860
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,660
No wonder Assistant Liu is so angry.

861
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,740
All right.

862
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,860
Don't think too much.

863
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,420
Go and wash up.

864
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,660
You have to get up early tomorrow.

865
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,220
Assistant Liu.

866
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,090
Assistant Liu.

867
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,540
Well, we bought you some drinks.

868
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,180
Don't be angry.

869
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,010
Don't take it personally.

870
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,660
I wasn't targeting you two just now.

871
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,060
Assistant Liu.

872
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,020
We know we were wrong.

873
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,500
When we acted on our own accord,

874
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,460
we were too reckless

875
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,780
and caused trouble to everyone.

876
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,220
Don't be angry.

877
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,580
Please forgive us.

878
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,460
We won't do it again.

879
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,500
I really wasn't targeting you two just now.

880
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,780
It's good that you know your mistakes.

881
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,300
But look at you two.

882
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,100
With your small bodies,

883
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,700
not to mention the general public,

884
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,580
even I'm worried about you going on missions.

885
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,530
In the future, work out more

886
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,460
in this gym.

887
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,140
-Yes!
-Yes!

888
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:48,740
Assistant Liu.

889
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,300
Have some water.

890
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,180
I'm good. Put it there.

891
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,100
Assistant Liu.

892
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,340
You trained your body really well.

893
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,540
I realized that in the entire station, you're the most persistent.

894
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,380
Do you have high expectations for your body

895
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,100
or

896
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,980
do you have to deal with some assessment in the station?

897
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,700
There's no assessment in the station.

898
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,060
I

899
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,020
don't have high expectations

900
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,940
for myself either.

901
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,780
This is a kind of self-awareness.

902
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,940
I can't stop exercising even for just a day.

903
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,340
Do you know why?

904
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,570
Do you?

905
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,540
No.

906
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,540
Come. Have a seat.

907
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,770
It's because I'm afraid of death.

908
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,620
When I was little,

909
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,010
my parents passed away early.

910
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,460
My grandparents brought me up.

911
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,420
I remember once when I was very naughty

912
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,860
and I broke my leg climbing over a wall.

913
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,500
It didn't hurt much.

914
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,860
But my grandma

915
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,980
held me and cried all night.

916
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,660
Since then,

917
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,300
I was especially afraid of getting hurt,

918
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,580
of death,

919
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,660
and of the thought that people around me will worry.

920
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,660
What do you think?

921
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,540
Do you think

922
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,460
it's contradictory for someone like me who's so afraid of death

923
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,740
to be a firefighter?

924
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,260
It's not contradictory at all.

925
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,140
Although I'm afraid of death,

926
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,540
I'm brave.

927
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,460
You can ask around

928
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,220
if there were any fires throughout the entire Beixun

929
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,140
where I, Liu Ruyi, wasn't the first in the front line.

930
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,500
I know

931
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,260
that the more I do,

932
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,650
the safer my teammates will be.

933
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,260
Shiquan.

934
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,860
Do you remember you once said

935
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,260
that the Special Division Station is your home?

936
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,700
My grandparents passed away a few years ago.

937
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,940
I'm alone.

938
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,020
Just like you.

939
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,260
So for me,

940
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,940
the Special Division Station is also my home.

941
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,860
My teammates are also my family,

942
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,340

but also a lot of carbon monoxide

954
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,180
and other poisonous and harmful gasses.

955
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,500
When escaping in a smoke-laden environment,

956
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,650
