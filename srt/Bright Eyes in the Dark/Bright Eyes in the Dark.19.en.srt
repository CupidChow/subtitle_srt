Pick up the lid

and cover the pot gradually along its edge

He fired the nanny that the station hired for him.

61

It's useless no matter how Yu and I try to persuade him.

62
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,180
Come here now.

63
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,020
Hurry up.

it'd be great for you to go back to the station and do some work.

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,940

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,080

I'm fine on my own.

93
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,460
Why did you get me a nanny?

94
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,270
It's a waste of money.

95
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,660
It's not a waste.

96
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,460
If there's a nanny here,

97
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,470
she can help you clean up

98
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,520
and cook for you. Isn't that convenient?

99
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,110
Convenient?

100
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,950
How is it convenient?

101
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,430
It's more inconvenient for me

Do you really think I'm useless?

No, no, no.

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,330

I know you don't mean that.

111
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,420
But I can do everything by myself.

112
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,760
Can you trust me?

113
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,650
I still have my arms

114
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,170
and the wheelchair you gave me.

115
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,730
I can take care of the basics in living

116
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,410

117
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,300
Really.

118
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,840
Go back now.

119
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,560
I beg you.

120
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,450
Can you stop hanging out here?

121
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,340
Don't make me think

125
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,480
How could you say that?

126
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,860
Enough.

127
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,440
Enough, Yu.

128
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,950
All right.

129
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,420
Forget it.

130
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,520
Yang is comfortable at home.

131
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,650
He should do what makes him comfortable.

132

Think about it again.

136
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,670
If there's someone helping you out at home,

137
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,090
it'll be convenient for you too.

138
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,090
Let's go.

139
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,980

140
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,870

You don't have a nanny at home from now on.

142
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,970
Cheer up.

143

Don't lose your temper.

144
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,170
We have to go now.

145
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,430
Call me if there's anything.

We're leaving, Yang.

149
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,880
Talk to him again.

150
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:03,840
Talk to him.

151
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,980
Let's go.

152
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,730
It's okay. Let's go.

Are you here to help us?

155
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,540
You know Instructor Yang's situation.

156
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,940
His parents passed away early.

157
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,230
He's always been alone.

158
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,450
All these years,

159
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,000
he has always regarded the fire station as his home.

160
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,510
The situation is special.

161
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,770
Don't keep going against him.

162
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,750
Go along with his wishes and let him be happy.

163
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,090
That won't do.

164
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,100
How can we leave him alone

165
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,600
at home?

166
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,660
Didn't you say he has phantom limb pains?

167
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,770
I heard that it's very painful when it happens.

168
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,150
There's nothing we can do.

169
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,170
I'll just come and visit him more often when I'm free.

170
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,060
When are you free?

171
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,860
The Fire Investigation Department is busy enough.

172
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,960
The problem now is that Yang doesn't talk much

173
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,060
and you don't talk much either.

174
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,530
How can you not chat with him?

175
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,330
How about this?

176
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:55,960
When it's my turn,

177
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,310
I'll chat with him nonstop.

178
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,200
If it isn't my turn,

179
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,830
I'll call him to harass him.

180
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,440
Count me in.

181
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,870
Coincidentally, it's my turn to take a day off.

182
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,080
Forget it.

183
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,090
If you're on leave,

184
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,770
go home and accompany your family.

185
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,660
I videocall them every day. It's the same thing.

186
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,880
How is it the same thing?

187
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,900
Besides, there are many things to do at the station.

188
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,070
If you two are here,

189
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,160
who will take care of the station?

190
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,090
Are you quitting your jobs?

191
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,220
He's right.

192
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,400
Yu, how about this?

193
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,990
The two of us can take turns.

194
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,550
Okay.

195
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,640
All right.

196
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,520
I'll send you off.

197
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:24,980
Let's go.

198
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,410
I've made it for you.

199
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,300
I can move.

200
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,770
I don't need you to help me with every little thing.

201
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,380
I'm now transferred to the brigade's Fire Investigation Department.

202
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,810
I can't use up my annual leave days either.

203
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,170
It's just right. I can accompany you here.

204
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,890
Don't feel pressured.

205
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,610
It's like a vacation for me being here.

206
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,390
Hello.

207
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,520
Hello, you have a package.

208
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,660
Please put it at the door.

209
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,920
Your community doesn't allow us to enter.

210
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,010
Just let the guards know.

211
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,560
You can't bring it up?

212
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,360
No.

213
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,120
Fine.

214
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll go down and get it.

215
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:26,670
I'm sorry about that.

216
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,760
Okay.

217
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,410
What did you buy this time?

218
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,710
You're wasting money.

219
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,890
I have everything I need at home.

220
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,400
I bought some daily necessities.

221
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,740
It's too late to buy them

222
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,750
only when you run out of them.

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,640
It's weird that your community doesn't allow

224
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,650
mail carriers in.

225
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,410
There's no choice.

226
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,250
There have been many theft cases.

227
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,010
Do you need me to get you anything?

228
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,520
No need.

229
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,990
Okay, wait for me.

230
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,070
I'm fine.

231
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,620
Go ahead.

232
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,050
Okay.

233
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,760
I'll be right up.

234
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,770
Okay, go ahead.

235
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,150
Yang.

236
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,460
Where is

237
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,400
your electricity card?

238
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,870
It's out of credit.

239
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,180
Yang.

240
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,400
Don't come over.

241
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,540
What's wrong?

242
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,890
Yang!

243
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,150
Don't come over.

244
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,160
How did you fall?

245
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,290
Come on. Get up.

246
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,510
Get up.

247
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,770
-Come on. Get up.
-Don't come over.

248
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,870
Don't come over.

249
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,140
Yang.

250
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,070
Don't move. It's okay.

251
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,500
Don't touch me!

252
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,190
Don't touch me!

253
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,160
Yang.

254
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,640
Don't touch me.

255
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,050
All right.

256
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,660
Leave.

257
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,620
Please.

258
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,610
Can you leave me with some dignity?

259
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,550
I'm useless now.

260
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,060
How...

261
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,290
How long can you take care of me?

262
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,650
Just go.

263
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,660
Yang.

264
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,770
It's been so many years.

265
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,170
We've always been by each other's sides.

266
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,530
Since I joined the fire station,

267
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,650
you entered earlier than me

268
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,510
and are a few years older than me.

269
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,870
So you always treated me as your younger brother.

270
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,180
Later,

271
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,280
I became the director

272
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,170
and you became an instructor,

273
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,390
and you've always been helping me by my side.

274
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,140
All these years,

275
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,360
no matter what danger

276
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,760
or what situation we encounter,

277
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,280
you always charged in front of me

278
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,010
and protected me.

279
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,370
Didn't you say

280
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,300
that a good relationship between a director

281
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,520
and an instructor

282
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,890
should be like that of a married couple?

283
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,540
A married couple,

284
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,340
right?

285
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,380
This time, you also protected everyone

286
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,900
and saved everyone,

287
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,890
but you got injured.

288
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,620
How can I leave you alone?

289
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,680
It's my turn to take care of you.

290

291
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,770
Director Lu.

292

[Beiyao Entertainment]

293
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,920
I'll thank you on behalf of Nan Chu.

294
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,640
Thank you for giving her this chance.

295
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,770
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

296
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,170
Okay, bye.

297
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,020
It's done.

298
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,900
Boss, do you think

299
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,630
it's fine to let Nan Chu appear in Director Lu's drama

300
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,760
right now?

301
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,940
I think this girl

302
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,290
is quite astute.

303
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,130
Take it one step at a time.

304
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,780
Boss,

305
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,010
do you think

306
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,520
Nan Chu

307
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,000
is really not up to this job?

308
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,040
Give it a try.

309
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,260
If we wait any longer,

310
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,280
Flaming Youth's hype

311
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,540
will completely die down.

312
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,680
We'll really be unable to do anything by then.

313
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,350
Yes.

314
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,000
You know what?

315
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,640
I always dreamed of you.

316
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,820
But you always ran too fast,

317
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
so I could only see your back

318
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,310
and couldn't catch up...

319
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:15,770
Stop.

320
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,160
Get ready for the next scene.

321
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,630
Take her to change into her outfit.

322
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,390
Okay.

323
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,140
Let's go.

324
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,110
Go get changed.

325
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,990
What kind of makeup

326
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,460
would you like?

327
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,350
Nan Chu.

328
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,900
You have lines this time

329
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,820
and quite a few of them.

330
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,000
I'll give yo a prettier makeup.

333
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,410
I passed the audition. How is it going over there?

[Lin Luxiao]

336
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,320
Something suddenly came up so I'm on my way back to the brigade.

[Lin Luxiao]

338
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,500
Yang is in low spirits,
[Lin Luxiao]

339
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,800
so I'm quite worried.
[Lin Luxiao]

[Lin Luxiao]

341
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,570
Hello?

342
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,240
What's wrong?

343
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,370
Lin, come here now!

344
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,210
Something bad happened!

345
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,430
Yang wants to jump off the building!

346
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,940
What?

347
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,070
Yang wants to jump off a building!

348
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,040
Don't do anything rash.

349
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,250
Keep him calm.

350
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:41,880
I'll be right there.

351
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,420
Comrade.

352
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,160
Stop drinking, comrade.

353
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,320
Calm down.

354
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,740
Come over here first.

355
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,600
Whatever it is, we can talk about it.

356
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,740
There's nothing we can't overcome.

357
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,300
Don't take it too hard.

358
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,220
I'll leave it to you.

359
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,210
Yang.

360
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,050
Get the rescue air cushion ready.

361
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,270
Time is tight.

362
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:02,820
Hurry up.

363
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,390
Yang.

364
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,980
Stop drinking.

365
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,920
Come back with us.

366
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,530
Don't make things difficult for us.

367
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,160
Okay?

368

Yang.

369
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,260
We've been brothers for so many years

370
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,200
and been through thick and thin for so many years.

371
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,770
How many life-and-death situations have we been through?

372
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,360
You've never once been afraid.

373
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,650
Why can't you make it today?

374
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,090
Why can't you get past it today?

376
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,230
We'll step back.

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,570
We won't move.

378
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,630
I know the procedure better than any of you.

379
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,900
Instructor Yang.

380
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,700
We won't move.

381
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,040
You remember Sun Meng, right?

382
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,050
Retreat.

383
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,140
We'll step back.

384
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,260
Yu.

385
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,360
I'm not afraid of death.

386
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,920
Neither am I

387
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,350
trying to make things difficult for everyone.

388
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,640
I just figured it out.

389
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,660
I should have died at South Bay Harbor

390
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,110
and sacrificed my life at the most worthy time.

391
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,060
In my life,

392
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,210
I've only done one job.

393
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,130
This is the only job I can do.

394
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,320
But now,

395
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,980
I can't even do it anymore.

396
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,870
Tell me.

397
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,600
What's the point

398
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,410
of living for me?

399
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
No job,

400
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,500
no life,

401
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,820
and no dignity.

402
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,630
Brothers.

403
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,560
If you still regard me as your instructor,

404
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,080
go back.

405
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,020
Leave me with some dignity.

406
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,580
I also want to

407
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,060
leave a good impression to you.

408
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,100
[Beixun City Fire and Rescue Brigade]

409
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,280
[Beixun City Fire and Rescue Brigade]

410
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,060
Excuse me.

411
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,320
Sorry to bother you.

412
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,680
I'm looking for a female fire control operator with the surname Li

413
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,900
who often contacts Heping Road Special Division Station.

414
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,500
Instructor Yang.

415
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,260
You mustn't do anything stupid.

416
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,230
You always told me

417
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,120
you'd help to turn me into an excellent firefighter.

418
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,220
I still have many questions to ask you.

419
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,070
Can you come up and answer me?

420
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,660
Don't do anything stupid.

421
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,890
Yes, Yang.

422
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,040
We still have a lot of things to do together.

423
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,730
Right.

424
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,070
It's here...

425
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,870
It's nearby.

426
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,560
I think it's that building.

427
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,480
That community.

428
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,530
Have you forgotten?

429
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,710
We saved a little boy then.

430
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,480
He told us

431
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,040
to visit him every festival,

432
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,260
right?

433
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,900
Speaking of which, I remember it now.

434
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,500
Then, we...

435
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,050
I observed just now

436
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,150
that there is a window below the instructor.

437
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,620
I think we can go to the floor below

438
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,300
and rescue him from behind.

439
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,440
We can try it.

440
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,240
Don't.

441
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,380
Instructor Yang is experienced.

442
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,060
He must be able to see that position.

443
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,580
We must not provoke him now.

444
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,890
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable.

445
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,240
The position where the instructor's sitting at is too tricky.

446
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,460
What do you think we should do then?

447
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,470
Yang.

448
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,390
You...

449
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,310
You can't do this.

450
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,240
You have to come down first.

451
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,370
How is it going?

452
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,800
Pay me back the money for the beer

453
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,890
that you owe me first.

454
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,570
Yang.

455
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,170
What are you doing?

456
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,720
Come over first

457
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,940
and we can talk about everything slowly.

458
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,360
I know you're suffering inside.

459
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,340
Tell us about it.

460
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,600
For many things, if you say it out,

461
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,610
you'll feel better.

462
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,390
How about this?

463
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,650
Come over here

464
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,240
and I'll drink with you.

465
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,130
Then this will be over, okay?

466
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:33,980
Yang.

467
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,900
What are you doing?

468
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,410
Get out of there now.

469
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,340
Hurry!

470
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,220
Yang!

471
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:38,680
Don't come over.

472
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,690
You are a firefighter.

473
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,700
Is this appropriate?

474
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,170
Hurry up.

475
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,130
Yang.

476
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,650
Luxiao is here too.

477
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,950
Stop resisting.

478
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,630
Come up.

479
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,520
Come back with us.

480
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:49,980
Okay?

481
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,380
I want to go back too.

482
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,780
But do you think...

483
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,480
I still can go back?

484
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,150
Since

485
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,960
everyone is here,

486
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,980
today,

487
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,400
let's say a proper goodbye here.

488
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,230
Don't...

489
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,700
Wait.

490
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,800
We don't agree to your way of saying goodbye like this.

491
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,310
Look at everyone.

492
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,650
Everyone is watching.

493
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,250
Do you want them

494
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,550
to just watch their instructor

495
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,850
jump off the building?

496
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,590
Then what else do you want from me?

497
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,370
What else do you want from me?

498
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,900
I don't want to admit it,

499
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,020
but I'm useless now.

500
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,000
I really tried.

501
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,220
I tried to persist!

502
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,480
I tried to fight against it!

503
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,410
But I really can't persist anymore.

504
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,820
I can't take it anymore.

505
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:07,850
Yang.

506
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,330
I know you feel bad.

507
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,640
But we are all here.

508
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,990
A group of brothers

509
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,870
is all here with you...

510
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,620
Don't come near me!

511
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,020
Fine.

512
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,240
I won't go over.

513
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,830
You are a firefighter.

514
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,180
You know this procedure

515
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,560
better than anyone else.

516
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,410
And you are an instructor.

517
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,260
You're good

518
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,560
with thinking things through too.

519
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,330
I know it's hard to save you

520
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,550
and it's useless to persuade you.

521
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,280
But we have to persuade you today.

522
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,050
Because you're our brother.

523
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,630
Lin.

524
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,300
I'm very calm

525
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,150
and rational now.

526
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,590
Do you remember

527
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,570
what I told you

528
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,260
that year

529
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,570
when you were tormenting yourself crazily

530
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,050
on the sports ground?

531
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,480
I told you that this obstacle

532
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,310
can only be overcome by yourself.

533
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,750
No one else can help you,

534
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,770
including me.

535
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,760
But now,

536
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,160
I don't even have my legs.

537
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,540
How can I cross this obstacle?

538
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,320
You've thought everything through?

539
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,120
Let me tell you.

540
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,730
Yijiu and Shiquan are watching.

541
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,950
What kind of role model are you?

542
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,800
How will they grow up in the future?

543
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,710
You've been working as a firefighter for so many years.

544
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,220
For so many years,

545
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,310
you also said that you can't do anything

546
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,570
except firefighting.

547
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,090
What are you doing now?

548
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,360
If you just jump today,

549
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,210
you'll be the biggest joke of the firefighting team.

550
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,050
Listen.

551
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,200
You'll be ruining the reputation of the entire nation's firefighters.

552
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,460
You'll be a disgrace!

553
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,560
You also said

554
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,790
that one should be mentally prepared

555
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,890
from the moment they enter the firefighting industry.

556
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,070
We're all mentally prepared.

557
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,300
What did you prepare?

558
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,370
What are you trying to show us?

559
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,470
Are you trying to tell all firefighters

560
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,830
that the only way to face pain

561
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,550
is to commit suicide?

562
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,230
Yang.

563
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,060
Do you think death is easy?

564
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,100
I don't want to do this either,

565
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,090
but I don't want to be a burden to everyone.

566
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,420
Even for the simple task of going to the toilet,

567
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,720
I need someone to help me.

568
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,160
Yang.

569
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,470
I know it's not easy for you.

570
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,150
I know.

571
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,260
We can't understand how you feel either.

572
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,110
Like you said,

573
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,420
we can't help you.

574
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,810
I admit it.

575
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,420
But we can accompany you.

576
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,270
These brothers

577
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,740
can accompany you.

578
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,170
I promise you

579
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,810
that as long as I'm alive,

580
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,990
as long as I haven't sacrificed my life,

581
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,090
I'll be here with you forever.

582
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,060
Yes.

583
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,360
We're all here for you.

584

585
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,050
We'll always be with you.

586
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,850
Instructor Yang.

587
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,490
We'll overcome the difficulties with you.

588

Yang.

589
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,060
Someone else is waiting for you too.

590
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,480
Give me a second.

591
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,540
Calling Command Center.

592
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,020

Please answer me if you hear this.

597
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,830
Say something.

598
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,260
She's waiting for you.

599
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,250
Here, let me give it to you.

600
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,050
Here.

601
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:49,640
Take it.

602
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,740
Come on.

Please answer me if you hear this.

607
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,570

Please answer me if you hear this.

Please answer me if you hear this.

613
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,540
Heping Road...

614
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,140
Roger that.

615
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,120
I'm the instructor,

616
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:36,810
Yang Zhengang.

617
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:38,990
Instructor Yang.

618
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,880
I have an emergency mission.

619
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,740
What is it?

620
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,330
Go ahead.

621
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,530
The public is out of control on the rooftop of Hwasin Home.

622
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,750
Please hurry to the scene

623
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,010
to provide psychological counseling

624
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,490
and ensure the safety of the staff.

625
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,100
I'm at the scene.

626
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,080
Please report the situation.

627
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,200
The situation...

628
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,260
is controllable.

629
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,610
But the suicidal victim

630
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,800
is still emotionally unstable.

631
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,270
Okay.

632
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,110
Please continue to comfort him.

633
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,590
I trust your professional ability.

634
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,030
You've always completed

635
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,540
every mission perfectly.

636
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,550
It won't be an exception this time.

637
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,610
Also,

638
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,810
please ensure the safety

639
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,580
of his life.

640
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,260
Okay.

641
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,830
I promise you.

642
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,600
I promise you.

643
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,310
Instructor Yang.

644
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,570
Hello.

645
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,290
I'm Li Lei.

646
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,090
Thank you for completing the mission.

647
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,570
Welcome

648
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,090
back safely.

649
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,320
[Beixun City Fire and Rescue Brigade]

650
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,040
Captain Meng.

651
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,480
I want to

652
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,050
discuss a technical problem with you.

653
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,630
A technical problem?

654
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,850
If

655
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,460
someone is disabled,

656
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,560
can they be transferred to do office work?

657
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,020
I knew what you were going to say as soon as you opened your mouth.

658
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,280
What are you up to?

659
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,880
This won't be easy.

660
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,140
Because this is the first time

661
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,900
our brigade has encountered something like this.

662
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,460
Zhengang

663
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,060
has been working in firefighting for more than ten years.

664
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,240
In terms of work

665
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,760
and experience, he's more than qualified.

666
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,160
After the accident,

667
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,010
he's only been staying at home

668
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,430
that he's become depressed.

669
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,910
I feel bad.

670
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,430
Please do something about it.

671
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,040
You know that

672
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,760
I trained Zhengang.

673
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,100
How would I abandon him?

674
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,960
I get it.

675
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,100
I will officially propose it at the brigade meeting.

676
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,780
It’s hard,

677
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,140
but

678
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,580
it should workable.

679
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,050
Wait for the news.

680
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,100
Okay.

681
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,070
I'll go back and wait for your good news.

682
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,040
I have something else

683
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,970
to talk to you about.

684
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,570
Right now, Heping Road Station

685
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,040
only has Yu Qilei

686
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,340
as an acting instructor

687
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,560
and is in need of a director.

688
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,660
This afternoon,

689
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,170
someone will be transferred over.

690
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,280
Who's being transferred over?

691
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,830
You'll know by then.

692
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,560
He's very familiar with your station.

693
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,910
Accompany him and hand things over to him this afternoon.

694
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,590
Are you even keeping it a secret from me?

695
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,020
Okay.

696
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,490
I'll go back to the station and get ready then.

697
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,940
[China Fire and Rescue]

698
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,000
Welcome the new director.

699
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,580
I was wondering why Captain Meng didn't tell me beforehand.

700
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,550
So it's you.

701
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,820
I volunteered to come here.

702
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:25,970
Thank you then.

703
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,460
Gather around.

704
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,850
The old team members should know me.

705
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,620
As for the new team members,

706
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,420
let me introduce myself.

707
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,070
I'm the new director of Heping Road Station,

708
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,080
Lou Mingye.

709
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,010
I came here

710
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,560
to reform the station.

711
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,070
I want to turn us

712
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,750
into the fire station

713
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,390
with the highest combat power.

714
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,620
So from now on,

715
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,470
you should get rid of your

716
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,060
past laziness

717
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,940
and

718
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,370
bad habits.

719
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,060
I will improve upon your training method

720
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,960
and add a theoretical class evaluation.

721
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,060
Theoretical class?

722
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,600
What's that?

723
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,440
Theoretical class?

724
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,530
Report when you want to say something!

725
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,550
That's the basic rule of discipline.

726
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,900
I don't care how you were

727
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,500
divided into Units 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the past.

728
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:17,970
In the future,

729
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,900
there will be a new special division unit in the station.

730
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,790
According to the results of your regular missions,

731
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:22,960
training,

732
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,520
and theoretical evaluations,

733
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,280
I'll choose the best members

734
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,630
to join the special division unit.

735
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,940
They'll be the representatives with the highest combat power at Heping Road Station

736
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,550
and become the strongest rescue team

737
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,440
in Beixun.

738
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,750
I don't care about your qualifications,

739
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,140
your age,

740
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,410
or what you used to do.

741
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,920
For me,

742
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,480
your capability is all that matters.

743
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,160
If you want to be recognized,

744
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,590
then work hard

745
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,270
and give it your all

746
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,540
until you deserve this honor.

747
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,470
Correspondingly,

748
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,120
those who don't do well

749
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,220
will be punished.

750
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,070
If you are not convinced,

751
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,540
you can challenge me anytime.

752
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,730
If you can persuade me with your capability,

753
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,000
then I'll listen to you.

754
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:11,560
Report!

755
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,570
Go ahead.

756
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,450
Lou...

757
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,770
Director Lou.

758
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,200
I have a question.

759
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,180
In my case,

760
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,860
I'm the leader of Unit 2.

761
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,490
What will become of me?

762
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,140
All unit leaders

763
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,780
can also be selected for the special division unit.

764
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,510
And we'll select a new unit commander.

765
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,520
Any other questions?

766
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,920
If not, you're dismissed.

767
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,490
You can hand over everything to me now.

771
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,010
I came here this time

772
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,450
to use Heping Road Station as a testing ground

773
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,470
to implement a new firefighting philosophy.

774
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,570
I've already gotten Captain Meng's approval.

775
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,670
If this model works,

776
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,150
it will be promoted to other fire stations.

777
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,540
All of you.

778
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,180
At ease.

779
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,690
Attention!

780
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,090
Look right.

781
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,240
Look forward.

The old training method is to be improved.

786
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,700
Just wait and see.

787
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,760
Strength is steel.

788
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,450
It's harder than steel. It's stronger than steel.

789
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,560
I just hope that after I leave,

790
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,740
you'll lead this team well.

791
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,250
I know what you think of me.

792
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,890
But I don't care.

793
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,080
I'm here to lead the team

794
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,430
with the most advanced philosophy.

795
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,880
All these years, I've seen many new

796
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,220
firefighting equipment in the world.

797
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,570
I firmly believe

798
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,920
that advanced equipment

799
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,390
can reduce the occurrence of accidents.

800
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,370
If everyone can put into practice

801
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,380
such a philosophy,

802
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,900
we can ensure maximal safety.

803
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:13,770
You are the director.

804
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,920
I won't interfere

805
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,220
with work matters.

806
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,700
But I still want to remind you.

807
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,590
Philosophy is not everything.

808
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,940
You can't become an excellent firefighter

809
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,250
by just depending on equipment.

810
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,880
Whether one can become an excellent firefighter

811
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,060
is not up to us to decide.

812
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,550

Why are you here?

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,450

How's your recovery?

823
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,490
Have a seat.

824
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,610
I'm almost adjusted to it.

825
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,090
Compared to most people,

826
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,480
I'm considered lucky.

827

By the way,

828
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,550
there's water in the fridge.

829
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:42,900
Take whatever you want.

830
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,860
No need.

831
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,890
I’m here to tell you

832
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,990
that I've been transferred to the Heping Road Station.

833
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,290
Do you really want to

834
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,710
with Lin Luxiao?

835
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,490
That's not my intention.

836
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,270
I just firmly believe in

837
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,740
the importance of equipment.

838
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,540
There's a limit to human capability.

839
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,190
But the equipment can be constantly upgraded

840
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,450
and improved.

841
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,640
If our equipment is advanced

842
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,730
and complete,

843
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,100
some accidents can be avoided.

844
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,710
Firefighters are human too.

845
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,150
We can't just risk it with our lives.

846
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,960
If the equipment can save the firefighter's life,

847
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,440
I'm willing to do anything.

848
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,460
Captain Meng transferred me here

849
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,890
to make a change,

850
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,160
and also so that the members

851
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,050
