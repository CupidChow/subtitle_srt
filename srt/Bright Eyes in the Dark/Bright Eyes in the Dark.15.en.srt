00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,930
It was news to me too.

196
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,080
No one told me about it.

197
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,370
By the way,

198
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,800
check the link I just sent you.

199
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,880
It'll be live-streamed soon.

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,800
Xi Gu.

201
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,560
Come here.

202
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,400
Okay.

203
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,680
It's the production team's fault

204
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,290
-What's it?
-that the accident happened.

205
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,680
Here,

206
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,320
on behalf of Zhige Entertainment,

207
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,680
I sincerely apologize.

208
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,160
At the same time,

209
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,930
I guarantee

210
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:43,680
[Flaming Youth Press Conference]

211
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
that the filming

[Flaming Youth Press Conference]

213
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,200
of Flaming Youth won't stop.
[Flaming Youth Press Conference]

214
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,010
[Flaming Youth Press Conference]

215
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,320
We'll repay your understanding and support

216
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,170
by producing more interesting content.

217
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,330
Thank you.

218
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,280
Rumor has it

219
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,400
that the executive producer Jiang Ge has left the show.

220
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,330
Is it true?

221
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,810
 There'll be some personnel changes.

222
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,850
But

223
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,680
they're all carefully considered.

224
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,560
So don't read into them.

225
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,440
Of course,

226
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,850
they won't affect the shooting of Flaming Youth either.

227
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,570
I can guarantee that.

228
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,450
Thank you.

229
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,170
Mr. Ran Dongyang.

230
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,920
You're the only celebrity here

231
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,200
who went into the fire.

232
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,280
Can you tell us

233
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,810
how the artists got trapped in the fire?

234
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,440
This accident

235
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,920
was caused by miscommunication

236
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,810
between the production team

237
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,560
and the fire department.

238
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,090
I believe you've watched

239
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,440
the previous episodes.

240
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,290
All the artists have been training very hard,

241
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,570
especially the artists under Beiyao.

242
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,450
They've done a great job.

243
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,600
So the coaches thought

244
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,290
that we could tackle more serious situations in real life.

245
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,280
That's why they arranged that fire safety check.

246
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,200
Unfortunately,

247
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,050
the accident happened.

248
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,080
You've all known

249
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,960
the rest of the story.

250
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,570
Please.

251
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,610
Will the show

252
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,570
call certain coaches to account?

253
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,080
No one should be called to account.

254
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,320
The coaches

255
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,800
only made that decision

256
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,040
because we all

257
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,960
had performed very well

258
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,800
in our daily training.

259
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,810
Of course.

260
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,440
The situation at the scene

261
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,530
was quite complicated.

262
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,170
Mr. Ran.

263
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,810
Did you get the wound

264
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,160
on your face in the fire?

265
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,050
Like I said just now,

266
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,560
the situation at the scene was very complicated.

267
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,690
Most artists in the fire

268
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,040
were girls.

269
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,920
Before the firefighters arrived,

270
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,920
I had to do things

271
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,800
that a man should do.

272
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,800
Mr. Ran.

273
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,080
You're so brave.

274
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,090
Thank you.

275
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,160
Thank you.

276
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,530
Thank you.

277
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,040
Okay.

278
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,920
Let's move on to the next question.

279
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:58,680
Thank you.

280
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,600
Mr. Ran Dongyang.

281
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,440
Why did the artists leave the firefighters

282
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,410
to act alone?

283
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,850
Was that part of the show?

284
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,290
I can only say

285
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,570
that it was an accident

286
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,320
caused by many coincidences.

287
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,330
Like what?

288
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,960
The situation was very complicated.

289
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,930
Like some facilities were under construction.

290
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,080
Like the Special Division Station

291
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,440
didn't notice fire hazards in time.

292
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,570
Like some young people

293
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,960
were too hungry for attention.

294
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,920
Like the factory's firefighting equipment was not up to code.

295
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,800
Who was the artist hungry for attention?

296
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,410
I heard that in the accident,

297
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,440
Miss Nan Chu got hurt the worst.

298
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,440
Are you talking about her?

299
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
What exactly

300
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,800
did she do?

301
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,800
Young people are naive.

302
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,330
They're inexperienced

303
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,730
and do stupid things.

304
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,600
It's understandable.

305
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,320
As someone older than them,

306
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,440
it's my duty

307
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,610
to educate and help them.

308
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,810
But

309
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
the fire was ruthless.

310
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,320
When I arrived, the accident had already happened.

311
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,080
I reacted very fast.

312
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,600
I'd mastered the firefighting skills

313
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,170
we were taught

314
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,550
and stayed calm.

315
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
[Lin Luxiao]
[Yang Zhengang]
and stayed calm.

316
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,160
[Lin Luxiao]
[Yang Zhengang]

317
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,210
Or I couldn't have kept the artists safe
[Lin Luxiao]
[Yang Zhengang]

318
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:08,520
[Lin Luxiao]
[Yang Zhengang]

319
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,690
until the firefighters arrived.
[Lin Luxiao]
[Yang Zhengang]

320
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:10,830
[Lin Luxiao]
[Yang Zhengang]

321
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:11,930
I have to say

322
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,160
that only after I survived a fire

323
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,920
did I fully realize

324
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,600
how great firefighters are.

325
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,690
I suggest

326
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,080
we give a big round of applause

327
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,970
to the firefighters.

328
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,440
Gosh.

329
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,320
What is he talking about?

330
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,400
He's so despicable.

331
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,320
He's shifting the blame to you and the Special Division Station.

332
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,690
How could he say that?

333
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,210
Not just Nan Chu,

334
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:33,970
I shall say

335
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,440
that all the artists including me

336
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,450
have learned valuable lessons

337
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,450
from this accident.

338
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,200
I'll answer no more questions.

339
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,210
Let's

340
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,440
give our best wishes

341
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,320
to Nan Chu.

342
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,440
I hope she feels better soon.

343
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,090
Thank you.

344
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,160
Thank you.

345
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,450
Firefighters.

346
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,560
What is the fire department's response

347
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,280
to this accident?

348
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,850
Will someone be held accountable?

349
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,200
As the chief coach in the show,

350
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,930
it's undeniable that I'm responsible.

351
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,850
No one wanted this

352
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,610
to happen.

353
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,930
The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

354
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,210
I promise

355
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,170
to let you know

356
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,720
as soon as the result is out.

357
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Whoever caused the fire

358
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,440
must be punished.

359
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,970
We'll get to the bottom of it.

360
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,930
Ran Dongyang is such a scumbag.

361
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,080
He caused all this by sneaking out alone

362
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,520
but is acting like a victim.

363
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,290
He's even made it look like

364
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,730
he saved all of us.

365
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,440
Exactly.

366
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,570
How shameless.

367
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,410
[Nan Chu]

368
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,200
Sergeant Lin.
[Nan Chu]

369
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,450
[Nan Chu]

370
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,210
Don't go easy on Ran Dongyang.
[Nan Chu]

371
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:05,720
[Nan Chu]

372
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,200
You can't take the blame for him.
[Nan Chu]

373
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,090
[Nan Chu]

374
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,810
Mr. Ran.
[Nan Chu]

375
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,080
Mr. Ran.

376
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,520
What were you doing?

377
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,440
I thought we'd reached an agreement here.

378
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
What…

379
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,200
What do you mean?

380
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,450
We agreed to smooth things over!

381
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,290
How could you shift the blame to Nan Chu

382
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,400
and the Special Division Station?

383
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,680
I didn't!

384
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,800
Mr. Han, you misunderstood me.

385
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
I didn't mean that.

386
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,050
You got me wrong.

387
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:29,800
Ran.

388
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,800
I can't believe you stabbed me in the back.

389
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,560
Beiyao.

390
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,080
I know what I'm doing.

391
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,840
I need to do several interviews.

392
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,810
I need to go now.

393
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,680
I'm in a hurry.

394
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,210
I gotta go.

395
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:45,930
Hey, Mr. Shen.

396
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,680
I'll treat you and Mr. Han to dinner another time.

397
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,560
I'm in a hurry now.

398
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,930
Ran Dongyang is so devious.

399
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,440
He's such an ass.

400
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,130
[Nan Chu]

401
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,920
Nan Chu must have watched the press conference.

402
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,730
She might be upset these days.

403
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,170
Keep an eye on her.

404
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,410
[Nan Chu]

405
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,560
Mr. Han isn't answering?

406
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,200
No.

407
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,200
What brought you here?

408
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,410
Nan Chu.

409
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,960
I'm here

410
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,810
to apologize to you.

411
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,560
It was all my fault.

412
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,210
If I hadn't believed the nonsense Ran Dongyang said,

413
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,090
we wouldn't have been in danger.

414
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,970
You nearly died.

415
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,930
What he said at the press conference

416
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,080
made me sick.

417
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,530
I can't stand someone like him.

418
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:50,850
Don't blame yourself

419
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,720
for something he did.

420
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,570
I should thank you for saving me.

421
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,520
Don't say that.

422
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:57,840
There's something

423
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,160
I want to show you.

424
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,200
Ready.

425
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,730
Start.

426
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,920
You filmed it?

427
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,850
I know to my cost

428
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,330
how bad people can be.

429
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,170
It's always good

430
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,050
to have a backup plan

431
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,530
when you're dealing with someone like him.

432
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,720
I'll send you this video.

433
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,570
You can do with it whatever you want.

434
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,090
Thank you.

435
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,400
You're welcome.

436
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,050
But I need to remind you

437
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,410
to consider the consequences before making the decision.

438
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:50,800
I know.

439
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,320
I'm leaving.

440
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,090
Bye.

441
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,560
Yan Dai.

442
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,320
Thank you.

443
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,800
Thank you.

444
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,280
I'm leaving.

445
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,650
Bye.

446
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,800
Wait, Nan Chu.

447
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,280
Mr. Han.

448
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,480
Why didn't you answer your phone?

449
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,570
What's up?

450
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,400
You have to watch this video.

451
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,770
This is the evidence that Ran Dongyang lied.

452
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,230
We must make it public.

453
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,540
I think

454
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,010
we should pretend that we never watched this video.

455
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:34,960
Why?

456
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,730
You don't need to know why.

457
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,970
You just need to know

458
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,160
that this may be the best solution.

459
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,410
You must give me an explanation.

460
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,400
Otherwise, I'll post this video online.

461
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:47,760
Fine.

462
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,360
Listen.

463
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,820
Ran Dongyang

464
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,280
is our most important partner now.

465
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,160
That doesn't mean he can get away with lying.

466
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,890
Don't make things complicated, will you?

467
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,080
Calm down.

468
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,800
Trust my judgment.

469
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,320
[Beiyao Entertainment]

470
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,640
I can tell you the truth.
[Beiyao Entertainment]

471
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:06,730
[Beiyao Entertainment]

472
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:06,910
The truth is that you only care about money.
[Beiyao Entertainment]

473
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,480
The truth is that you only care about money.

474
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,560
You don't care about right or wrong.

475
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,240
No!

476
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,130
Listen.

477
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,370
If I were after money,

478
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,840
I could sell this video to Ran Dongyang.

479
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,090
He'd offer a good price.

480
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,320
Think about it.

481
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,840
What will happen

482
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,320
if you post this video online?

483
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,330
I don't care.

484
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,320
Everyone is criticizing the Special Division Station online.

485
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,880
Everyone believes that it was their fault

486
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,720
that we were in danger.

487
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,160
I must seek justice for them.

488
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,330
How about you?

489
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,770
How about the company?

490
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,290
How about the show?

491
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,490
I can assure you

492
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,810
that once the video is out,

493
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,330
the show will be suspended.

494
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,530
Your career

495
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,760
may be over.

496
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,370
Is that what you want?

497
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,970
Ran Dongyang has been in this game for so many years.

498
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:57,970
His influence

499
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,650
is much bigger than yours.

500
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,880
Think carefully.

501
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,610
I bet Yan Dai

502
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,670
sent you this video, right?

503
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,490
If she wanted justice,

504
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,770
why didn't she release it?

505
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,480
Do you get it now?

506
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,770
Mr. Jiang said

507
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,120
you promised

508
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,000
to draw a line with Ran Dongyang.

509
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,480
You heard what he said

510
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,810
at the press conference.

511
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,490
He's only so brazen

512
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,570
because you allow him to be.

513
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,760
Mr. Han.

514
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,360
I'm not backing down.

515
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,170
I must make him pay.

516
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,600
He has no room for improvement.

517
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,410
He's going downhill every day.

518
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,730
Why can't you just let it go?

519
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,410
Why do you have to fall out with him?

520
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,730
What you need to do now

521
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,570
is become successful and famous

522
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,800
as soon as possible.

523
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,610
By that time, you won't have to fix him.

524
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,570
He'll cozy up to you.

525
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,330
Understand?

526
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,720
Yes, Nan Chu.

527
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,050
I'm angry too.

528
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,360
I also want to teach Ran Dongyang a lesson.

529
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,610
But Mr. Han is right.

530
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,720
Our show

531
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,960
is very popular now.

532
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,210
If it got suspended

533
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,080
because of this,

534
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,870
it'd be a great pity.

535
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,290
Fine.

536
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,120
If you all think so,

537
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,320
today is my last day here.

538
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,170
Nan Chu.

539
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,760
Think it through.

540
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,570
If you decide to post the video in the end,

541
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,650
I won't stop you.

542
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,810
But you need to know

543
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,970
how many people's fates will be changed.

544
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,810
Nan Chu.

545
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,160
It's no big deal.

546
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,730
We can just quit.

547
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,090
Xi Gu.

548
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,080
If I leave,

549
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,120
will you resign too?

550
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,080
Of course.

551
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,560
If you leave,

552
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,330
what's the point of me working there?

553
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,160
Don't worry about me.

554
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,810
I can find another job.

555
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,730
Actually, I'm the last person who can quit.

556
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,090
I can't pay off the money I owe the company.

557
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,480
I can't afford to terminate the contract.

558
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,130
Dream Dance is counting on me.

559
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,090
And I don't want you to lose your job

560
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,480
because of me.

561
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,960
If only we had

562
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,360
financial freedom

563
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,080
and could do whatever we wanted.

564
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,890
By the way, Nan Chu.

565
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,800
Have you decided what to do with the video?

566
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,840
I want the public to know the truth.

567
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:51,560
How about

568
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,810
we discuss it with Mr. Jiang?

569
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,000
Does Director Lin know about this video?

570
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,290
If he knows,

571
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,200
he won't let me post it.

572
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,130
You must think twice.

573
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,250
Once the video is released,

574
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,240
you'll fall out with Ran Dongyang.

575
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,320
Things will get out of hand.

576
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,250
Nan Chu.

577
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,000
I think Mr. Jiang is right.

578
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,520
That douchebag Ran Dongyang

579
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,800
will definitely retaliate.

580
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,050
It's gonna be nasty.

581
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,040
Yeah.

582
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,900
Ran Dongyang and his team

583
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,560
will sling mud at you.

584
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,250
Some people will doubt your intentions

585
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,900
and think you have ulterior motives.

586
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,650
I don't mind.

587
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,800
I'm not the one whose hands are dirty.

588
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,280
Why should I be afraid of him?

589
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,760
Just because he's got seniority

590
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,000
and can lie without a blush?

591
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,090
If I keep quiet

592
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,400
for personal gain,

593
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,800
I'll become someone like him.

594
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,410
Besides,

595
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,490
I don't mind going back to dance.

596
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,320
I don't want to be in the same industry

597
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,250
as that scumbag.

598
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,840
I think I have the responsibility to reveal the truth.

599
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,850
It's an open-and-shut case.

600
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,240
There's no need for hesitation.

601
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:27,970
Then do it!

602
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,410
Reveal his true colors, Nan Chu!

603
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,650
You should let the whole world know

604
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,890
what he did!

605
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,010
You have my support.

606
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,160
Mr. Jiang.

607
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,280
Our show is a hit now.

608
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:41,850
You know.

609
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,160
And we've signed with

610
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,330
several advertisers

611
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,810
and sponsors.

612
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,520
If we

613
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,170
release the video now,

614
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,560
our efforts will be in vain.

615
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,640
Mr. Jiang.

616
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,040
I know this show means a lot to you

617
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,480
and you've put lots of effort into it.

618
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,000
So I want to ask your opinion

619
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,080
before I take it further.

620
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,160
Don't worry about me.

621
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
You have more to lose than me.

622
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,560
If you want to release it,

623
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,280
I'm with you.

624
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,810
Say no more.

625
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:19,880
I'm with you too.

626
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,800
The show is one thing.

627
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,880
Right and wrong is another.

628
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,360
Think of it as ridding this trade of vermin.

It's said

that the show may be suspended.

642

Nan Chu

645
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,370
is so cool.

646
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,050
She has a backbone.

647
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,570
I'll say no more.

648
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,770
You know what to do.

649
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,890
She truly cares for you.

00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,970

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,560

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,090
Of course.

653
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,130
I love doing art.

654
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,560
I really do.

655
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,810
I'm where I am today because I'm a man of good character.

656
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,090
Don't you think so?

657
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,330
Yes.

658
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,050
You're a role model.

659
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:47,960
I know that.

660
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,170
Let me be honest with you.

661
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,650
I meant what I said.

662
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,770
I did that for our show.

663
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,560
I did that to increase the ratings

664
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,410
and to get publicity for Nan Chu.

665
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,560
You made it.

666
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,600
She's all over the internet now.

667
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,080
Mr. Han.

If you don't call Nan Chu,

669
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,850
I'll have to go to her myself.

670
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,970
I started my career much earlier than she did.

671
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,240
It's so humiliating for me

672
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,520
to beg a newcomer.

673
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,800
I'd never get over it.

674
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,290
If you don't call her,

675
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,520

676
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,330
You want Nan Chu

677
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,760
to delete the video?

678
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:32,970
Yes.

679
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,360
It's useless.

680
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,330

681
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,130

Please do me a favor.

Ask Nan Chu to make a statement

691
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,800
that she fabricated it.

692
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
I can give her as much as she wants.

693
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,400

that she fabricated the video?

703
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,520
It's a great idea.

704
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,360
It is.

705
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,610
No one will blame me anymore.

706
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,520

My artist

708
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,560
made a fake video to deceive the public.

00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,840
Do you want my company to go under?

710
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,650
Then…

711
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,130
Then tell me.

were criticizing us online.

763
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,520
That's part of the reason.

764
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,640
I just think

765
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,360
the public should know the truth.

766
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,000
If we can't tell right from wrong,

767
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,320
there's no point in doing anything.

768
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,760
With this video out,

769
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,840
you can be off the hook, right?

770
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,960
Actually, it didn't make much difference.

771
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,530
What do you mean?

772
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,080
I was the chief coach in the show

773
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,290
and led the mission that day.

774
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,170
I'm responsible.

775
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,400
But it was not your fault.

776
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,800
Why should you take the responsibility?

777
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,330
For firefighters,

778
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,010
thorough preparation

779
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,640
and precise judgment are both very important.

780
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,080
If the judgment is wrong,

781
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,890
the consequences can be destructive.

782
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,560
Even thorough preparation

783
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,720
can't make up for

784
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,800
bad judgment.

785
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,080
So the process is important,

786
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,890
but the result is more important.

787
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,610
The result this time

788
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,610
was that I put all of you in danger.

789
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,560
Especially you.

790
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,520
So,

791
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,320
I should be blamed

792
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,090
for all the consequences.

793
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,970
But you saved me.

794
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,560
The firefighters at Heping Road Special Division Station

795
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,570
saved everyone.

796
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,360
People criticized you

797
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,850
because they didn't know the truth.

798
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,410
It doesn't matter.

799
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,320
I don't care about that.

800
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,330
I do.

801
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,960
Anyway, the video is out now.

802
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I can't take it back.

803
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,810
I'll face whatever is coming to me.

804
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,320
You're so brave.

805
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,560
I just don't want anyone

806
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,290
to discredit my hero.

807
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:56,960
Nan Chu.

808
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,000
Don't worry about me.

809
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,210
I hope in the future

810
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,720
you can put yourself first

811
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,010
when you're in danger.

812
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,610
I know.

813
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,480
Don't worry about me.

814
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:19,880
Okay.

815
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,570
This time,

816
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,960
I was protected

817
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,130
by you, a girl.

818
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,400
It felt great.

819
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,090
Nan Chu.

820
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,280
Hey.

821
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,890
Bye.

822
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,280
What are we having for dinner?

823
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,000
Dinner?

824
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,240
I'd like something juicy.

825
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,530
The other day, you and Zong…

826
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,280
We found a new restaurant.

827
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,960
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

828
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,810
[Beiyao Entertainment]

829
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:03,180
[The famous actor Ran Dongyang announced a break from showbiz.]

830
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,130
[Han Beiyao]

831
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,010
This is the end of this matter.

00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,400
We'll arrange new work

835
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,210
for Nan Chu.

00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,250
[Nan Yueru: Okay.]

838
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,760
At ease.

839
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,290
Attention.

840
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,430
Eyes right.

841
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,730
Eyes front.

842
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,950
Unity is strength. Go.

843
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,000
Unity is strength.

844
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,440
Captain Meng.

845
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,610
It's not a big deal.

846
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,730
You don't have to come here in person.

847
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,880
You can just make a call or send us a notice

848
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,290
to tell us the result.

849
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,080
You…

850
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,930
This matter

851
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
is a bit complicated.

852
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,640
So I decided to come here

853
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,680
to talk to you face to face.

854
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,770
The production of Flaming Youth

855
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,850
has been shut down.

856
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,010
You can get back on track now.

857
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,970
As for the fire in Yilong Food Factory,

858
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,890
there are different opinions.

859
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,690
The disagreement

860
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,920
centers on your liability.

861
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,280
We had a meeting

862
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,360
to discuss it

863
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,520
and agreed

864
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,610
that we shouldn't

865
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,530
blame the whole thing on you.

866
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:01,570
Right?

867
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,680
Inspector Lou

868
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:06,920
and many other comrades

869
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
object to

870
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,640
punishing you.

871
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,240
I agree with them.

872
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,440
The purpose of you getting on the show

873
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,610
is to educate the public

874
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,090
about fire safety

875
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,920
and let more people

876
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,930
know how firefighters

877
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,240
work and live.

878
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,560
That goal has been achieved.

879
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,770
This accident

880
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,000
was the result of someone else's fault.

881
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,090
You shouldn't take all the blame.

882
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,410
So the higher-ups decided

883
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,600
to waive your liability.

884
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,010
Thank you, Captain Meng.

885
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,560
Thank you, Captain Meng.

886
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
Thank you, Inspector Lou.

887
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,160
I'm just doing my job.

888
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,170
But after the press conference,

889
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,600
there's been controversy online.

890
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,610
We can't

891
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,980
ignore it completely.

892
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,300
So,

893
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,460
you'll be suspended

894
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,820
from duty

895
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,750
while awaiting further instructions.

896
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:08,870
Yes.

897
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,790
I'll obey all the orders from the higher-ups.

898
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,000
I have two announcements.

899
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,000
First,

900
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,680
Flaming Youth

901
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,160
has been suspended.

902
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,240
From tomorrow onwards,

903
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,870
everything will be back to normal.

904
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:24,830
Second,

905
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,150
from tomorrow on,

906
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,360
I'll be suspended from duty.

907
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,510
The instructor

908
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,190
will take over in my absence.

909
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,030
Suspended?

910
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,350
Deputy Yu and Assistant Liu

911
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,630
will assist him.

912
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,870
Understand?

913
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,150
It's all because of the show.

914
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,760
It must be Lou Mingye's doing again.

915
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,240
Why is he so annoying?

916
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,800
Report.

917
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,720
Director Lin.

918
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,990
Can we file a complaint?

919
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,840
It's unfair to suspend you.

920
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:47,790
Report.

921
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,230
It's unfair.

922
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,710
It was not your fault.

923
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,350
Why are you suspended?

924
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:51,680
Enough.

925
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,230
You all keep quiet.

926
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,600
Suspension

927
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,110
is not discharge.

928
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,540
During my suspension,

929
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,810
carry on with your work.

930
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,110
Do you hear me?

931
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,010
I believe that getting on the show

932
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,030
has given all of you valuable insights.

933
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,090
Let's make sure

934
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,430
to keep them in mind

935
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,980
and integrate them

936
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,420
into your future work.

937
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:17,780
Alright.

938
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,040
That's all.

939
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,600
Do you think Master will be transferred away?

940
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,910
It's possible.

941
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,470
But

942
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,700
I also think he may get a promotion.

943
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:36,640
Why?

944
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,490
Think about it.

945
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,430
When we made mistakes,

946
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,270
the punishments were explicit.

947
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,500
We didn't get suspended, did we?

948
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,280
Suspension means uncertainty.

949
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,040
Whatever the higher-ups decide to do,

950
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,020
they can't make Master

951
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,400
the director of another station.

952
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,310
What are you two talking about?

953
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:57,890
Assistant Liu.

call 119 immediately.

987
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,750

990
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,360
Fourthly, you need to know how to escape.

991
