4
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:25,780
Dad.

5
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,340
Come here.

6
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,540
Tell me.

7
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,260
How is it going?

8
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,540
The Fire Investigation Department has released the report.

9
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,380
The fire was an accident.

10
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,500
Fortunately, no one died because of it.

11
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,820
I've asked Huang Huai

12
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,340
to tabulate the detailed injury count.

13
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,500
Also,

14
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,420
we may need to cooperate

15
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,540
with some follow-up investigations.

16
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,140
I've arranged everything.

17
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,700
But

18
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,340
our company needs to pay for

19
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,260
the compensation of our employees and the guests,

20
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,820
as well as the building repairs and

21
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,260
the upgrading and maintenance

22
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,140
of the fire fighting equipment first.

23
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,380
I have also asked Huang Huai

24
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,580
to compile it into a list.

25
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,090
You should focus on your recovery.

26
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:09,780
Don't worry.

27
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,500
How can I not worry?

28
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,220
How can I not be anxious?

29
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,380
Huanyu Building

30
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,260
is our headquarters,

31
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,260
our base camp.

32
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,260
But what happened?

33
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,380
Our backyard was burned.

34
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,700
What impression will it leave on the outside world?

35
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,220
Not to mention we did a show

36
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,250
promoting firefighting.

37
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,940
What would our partners

38
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,580
think of us?

39
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Who would dare to cooperate with us again?

40
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,500
I wanted to

41
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,380
take the chance and promote ourselves

42
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,100
at the 40th-anniversary celebration.

43
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,780
But now,

44
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,260
this happened.

45
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,060
What should we do?

46
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,500
Dad,

47
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,340
I know

48
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,780
what you're talking about.

49
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,700
So I asked our PR department

50
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,900
to draft a statement.

51
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,980
Although this fire was an accident,

52
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,220
I'm afraid someone might use it

53
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,220
to spread some rumors.

54
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,700
Based on my past experience,

55
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,980
we should release the statement first

56
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,660
and guide the public's reactions.

57
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,100
Okay.

58
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,700
Let's do that.

59
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,580
You arrange it.

60
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,220
Okay.

61
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,460
I'll go now, Dad.

62
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,780
Son.

63
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,340
What's wrong?

64
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,100
Are you hurt?

65
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,340
I'm so energetic.

66
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:39,900
I'm fine.

67
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,900
Thank you.

68
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:49,780
Dad.

69
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,380
I'm here.

70
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,340
Don't worry.

71
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,540
Take care of yourself.

72
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,900
I'm leaving.

73
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,100
How's your injury?

74
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,220
Don't worry.

75
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,780
I'm fine.

76
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,140
I'll let you know if I need anything.

77
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,580
By the way,

78
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,220
how is your dad?

79
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,900
The doctor said he needed to stay in the hospital for a few days.

80
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,340
So I have to keep an eye on him.

81
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,340
Tell me if you need anything.

82
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,220
What's wrong with you today?

83
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,140
Nothing.

84
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,340
I know.

85
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,380
The fire

86
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,460
has more or less affected the group.

87
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,700
Although we did public opinion control,

88
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,140
some partners still terminated

89
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,980
their projects and orders with us.

90
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,890
On top of that, my dad is sick.

91
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,380
I get a little tired

92
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,980
dealing with everything here and there.

93
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,660
So the platform is counting on you for now.

94
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,580
Don't worry.

95
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,460
I'm also part of the platform team.

96
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,380
I'll take full responsibility.

97
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,460
And the promotion

98
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,260
has basically been settled recently.

99
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,140
All we're missing is the offline promotion.

100
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,900
Thank you so much.

101
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,540
What's wrong with you today?

102
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,100
You even thanked me.

103
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,220
After this experience, I realized some things.

104
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,540
I only knew that managing the group was not easy.

105
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,020
My dad worked hard.

106
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,580
But I always blamed him for not understanding me.

107
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,010
Actually, I didn't understand him either.

108
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,580
What he said before was right.

109
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,660
He indulged me in all the things I did

110
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,900
since coming back here.

111
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,380
He paid the price for all my actions.

112
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,450
If your dad knows what you're thinking right now,

113
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,020
he would be so happy.

114
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,460
But

115
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,380
we are quite alike.

116
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,660
Without my brother supporting me,

117
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,260
how could I have been brave enough to pursue music?

118
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,820
If I didn’t pursue music,

119
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,340
how could I have gone to Milan?

120
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,700
If I didn't go to Milan,

121
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,100
you wouldn't have met me.

122
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,460
You sound like I wanted to meet you.

123
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,020
You have no idea how annoying you were

124
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,020
when I first met you.

125
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,340
I really wanted to beat you.

126
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,660
But later I found that

127
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,380
both you

128
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,380
and Nan Chu

129
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,980
have taught me a lot.

130
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,220
Even our current platform

131
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,460
was inspired by the two of you.

132
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,660
Jiang Ge.

133
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,980
Have you been watching a lot of chicken soup for the soul lately?

134
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,140
Alright.

135
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Speaking of which,

136
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,660
I want to ask you.

137
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,380
You've been back for so long

138
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,700
and done so many things.

139
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,580
What do you really want to do?

140
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,460
Have you made up your mind?

141
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,980
What I want to do...

142
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,660
I don't know either.

143
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,460
That was not your first rescue,

144
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,220
right?

145
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:18,780
Yes.

146
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,700
And Sergeant Lin was the one

147
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,980
who found me in the fire every time.

148
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,620
He is really my Blue Friend.

149
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,180
I want to share my experience with everyone.

150
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,580
Nan Chu.

151
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,740
A lot of people in the comments

152
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,980
are shipping you and Director Lin.

153
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,180
Really?

154
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,700
What are you doing?

155
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,620
Nothing.

156
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,860
What are you hiding?

157
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,580
Xi Gu!

158
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,980
Xi Gu!

159
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,500
Give it to me.

160
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,090
Can you help me contact

161
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,220
this photographer for me?

162
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,940
See if he has any other photos.

163
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,300
I've known Luxiao for so long,

164
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,860
but I haven't taken a proper photo with him.

165
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,460
Zong is already in touch with him.

166
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,100
He's so considerate?

167
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,420
But he's spending money to buy the photo

168
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:05,940
so he can delete it.

169
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,340
Why would he do that?

170
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,420
Why do you think I did that?

171
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,570
Look at the photo.

172
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,820
Lin Luxiao looks worried.

173
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,100
But you look so blissful.

174
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,340
Anyone would speculate about your relationship

175
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,500
if you showed them the photo.

176
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,340
Let me tell you.

177
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,740
This is a serious matter.

178
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,740
Don't joke about it.

179
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,580
They can think whatever they want.

180
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,060
I did what you said before

181
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,860
and kept a low profile.

182
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,460
But the result is the same.

183
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,820
Instead,

184
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,580
why don't we take the chance to make it public?

185
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,180
I know you want to make it public.

186
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,210
You want the whole world

187
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,460
to know you're in a relationship.

188
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:36,860
But...

189
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,940
You can if you want.

190
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,220
But there's no need to do it.

191
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,220
Director Lin.

192
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,220
Wait.

193
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,740
Why are you here?

194
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,300
I'm here to deliver some food to Nan Chu.

195
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,580
I happened to have half a day off.

196
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,420
By the way, Zong,

197
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,740
I suddenly remembered that

198
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,220
Mr. Han wanted you to do something.

199
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,300
Let’s talk outside.

200
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,940
What is it?

201
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,690
Why don't I know about it?

202
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,580
Are you dumb?

203
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,210
No.

204
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,980
He's here because he's worried. What's wrong with that?

205
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,820
How are you?

206
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,700
Do you feel better?

207
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,420
Were you scared?

208
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,180
Here.

209
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,300
How is it?

210
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,060
Who made it?

211
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,100
I made it.

212
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,860
You know how to make soup?

213
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,490
Of course.

214
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
I'm very good at making soup.

215
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,060
Who has tasted your soup before?

216
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,460
Oh, so many.

217
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,460
Who?

218
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,180
My dad.

219
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,100
And?

220
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,460
Lin Qi.

221
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,580
Who else?

222
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,460
There's another girl.

223
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,220
Which girl?

224
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,490
This girl.

225
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,840
Here.

226
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,500
Sergeant Lin,

227
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,820
how was my performance in the fire?

228
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,100
Excellent.

229
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Shouldn't you reward me then?

230
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,740
What reward do you want?

231
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,460
Take me out to play.

232
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:27,860
Take you out?

233
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,820
Okay.

234
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,860
Dr. Xia almost found out just now.

235
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,860
She won't.

236
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,500
Just follow me,

237
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,340
don't be afraid.

238
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,460
I'm not so sure about that.

239
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,500
Where do you want to go?

240
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,460
It's a rare date.

241
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,940
I have to make a plan.

242
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,580
Go ahead.

243
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,220
I'll take you to buy some clothes first.

244
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,690
Then we have to do things one by one.

245
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,060
One by one?

246
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,860
There are so many things on your list?

247
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,820
I can't let you off easily.

248
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,580
How about this one?

249
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,820
It looks good.

250
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,180
Let's buy this then.

251
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,980
Aren't you going to check out the others?

252
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,740
We have time today.

253
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,100
I won't buy it for myself today.

254
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,340
It's your day off.

255
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,100
I'll buy some clothes for you.

256
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,980
There's no need.

257
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,980
I have to wear my uniform to work every day.

258
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,100
Let's go. The clothes I buy are different.

259
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:54,820
Are you happy?

260
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,620
Yes.

261
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,460
Where are we going later?

262
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,300
Later...

263
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,220
Where do you want to go?

264
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,340
I want to go...

265
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,570
[Xia Wan]

266
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,100
Dr. Xia.

267
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,090
Instructor Lin, it's about time.

268
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,460
We're going to do our rounds soon.

269
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,100
Can you bring Nan Chu back now?

270
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:15,980
Nan Chu?

271
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,460
Nan Chu...

272
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,980
Isn't she in the ward?

273
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,220
When did you learn to lie?

274
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,500
The both of you are eating and shopping.

275
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,940
I saw it all online

276
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,060
via the live stream.

277
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,100
Okay.

278
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,100
I see.

279
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,300
Okay.

280
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,740
Thank you.

281
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,980
What's wrong?

282
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,180
She said someone was secretly filming us

283
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,180
and posting it online.

284
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,340
Let's stay a little longer.

285
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,220
Please.

286
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,820
It's time to go back.

287
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,810
It's not easy for me to come out.

288
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,700
I promise you.

289
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,220
I'll accompany you during my holidays.

290
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,220
I won't do anything else.

291
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,860
Really?

292
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,940
A military order.

293
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,700
Fine.

294
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,180
Let's go.

295
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,500
Let's go.

296
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,700
I saw Lin Luxiao at the hospital yesterday.

297
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,980
He came to visit Nan Chu.

298
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,500
Our "Blue Friend" is so sweet.

299
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,580
My ship is finally sailing.

300
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,340
Look.

301
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,100
There's even a photo.

302
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,420
[#Lin Luxiao Nan Chu #I saw Lin Luxiao at the cinema yesterday! He was there to watch a movie with Nan Chu! Our Blue Friends are so considerate. My ship is sailing!]

303
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,860
Mr. Qi.

304
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,420
It’s the 5G era.

305
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,100
Why are you still surfing in 2G?

306
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,220
Do you know that

307
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,740
our official backstage account is about to explode?

308
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,700
Some netizens even

309
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,740
dug out our previous shows

310
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,340
and edited a separate ship cam

311
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,220
for our master and Nan Chu.

312
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,220
I think it was called...

313
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,970
Love ablaze,

314
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,100
destined couple,

315
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,820
fated union at Beixun Fire and Rescue, right?

316
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:40,820
Interesting.

317
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,700
Yeah.

318
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,940
Now even we are famous.

319
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,340
We have a nickname

320
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,340
called Firefighting Boys.

321
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,460
Even our Super Topic gained a lot of new fans.

322
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,220
Later,

323
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,460
give me a role in your skits.

324
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,460
It's not impossible,

325
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,500
but it depends on your performance, Mr. Qi.

326
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,180
Come on.

327
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,220
Don't just stand there.

328
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,460
Make way.

329
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,100
Make way.

330
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,620
I don't know who

331
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,340
has been sending gifts since this morning.

332
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,340
They even specified it was for the Firefighting Boys.

333
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,980
Firefighting Boys, fighting!

334
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,220
Who are the Firefighting Boys?

335
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,980
Deputy Yu said

336
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,580
whoever it's for will accept it.

337
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,930
There are more than 20 boxes left.

338
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,340
Go ahead.

339
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,060
Take me with you.

340
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,180
Yijiu.

341
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,580
Why am I a little tired today?

342
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,500
I did too much video editing.

343
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,340
Really.

344
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,740
My neck hurts.

345
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,820
You two have more than 20 boxes!

346
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,940
Yes, Mr. Qi.

347
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,340
Alright.

348
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,420
You two take a rest. I'll go.

349
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,100
[I'm so happy. There's nothing more touching than seeing your ship in person. Wishing them happiness together forever. I hope I'll have such a sweet romance too.]

350
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,580
A firefighter and a female celebrity.
[I'm so happy. There's nothing more touching than seeing your ship in person. Wishing them happiness together forever. I hope I'll have such a sweet romance too.]

351
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:44,820
[I'm so happy. There's nothing more touching than seeing your ship in person. Wishing them happiness together forever. I hope I'll have such a sweet romance too.]

352
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,590
XiaoChu must be the ship of the year.
[I'm so happy. There's nothing more touching than seeing your ship in person. Wishing them happiness together forever. I hope I'll have such a sweet romance too.]

353
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,060
XiaoChu must be the ship of the year.

354
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,620
Friends,

355
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,220
here's some XiaoChu ship content.

356
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,460
I'll be enjoying them.

357
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,560
Help yourselves.

358
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,860
I've moved the Civil Affairs Bureau here.

359
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,020
They should get married on the spot.

360
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,080
Looking at it closely,

361
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,180
it's very romantic when you think about it.

362
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,540
They met at the show

363
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,900
and got together after the show.

364
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:07,980
Xi Gu,

365
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,020
when can we leave the hospital?

366
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,220
I'm bored.

367
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,620
The news about you two

368
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,500
is everywhere on the Internet.

369
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,460
The hospital is the safest.

370
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,220
We did nothing.

371
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:27,860
Mr. Han,

372
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,980
I have something to report to you.

373
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,020
MG Diamonds hopes that Nan Chu

374
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,380
can endorse their new products.

375
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,900
I've rejected them before.

376
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,860
But their business team

377
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,420
has offered a very high price.

378
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,980
What should I say?

379
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,780
Keep refusing.

380
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,700
And the fashion Qiude magazine

381
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,860
wants to give Nan Chu an exclusive interview.

382
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,620
They want her to talk about

383
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,690
her relationship with Lin Luxiao.

384
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,140
As you know,

385
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,940
it's hard for me to reject

386
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,940
such an influential magazine in the circle.

387
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,220
I already told you.

388
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,140
Reject all of them.

389
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,700
Okay.

390
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,450
There's also the Jade Gold Film Company.

391
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,020
Do you remember about

392
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,940
the firefighting drama they mentioned before?

393
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,420
Reject it.

394
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,850
Reject all commercial activities

395
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,500
and all interviews.

396
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,660
Tell them

397
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,940
I don't agree.

398
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,220
Got it.

399
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,220
Miss Nan Chu.

400
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,020
What are you doing?

401
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,300
Get out.

402
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,260
Miss Nan Chu.

403
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,660
Stop filming.

404
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,540
Miss Nan Chu, please say something.

405
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,220
Stop filming.

406
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,660
Get out.

407
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,980
Get out.

408
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,900
Please give us a brief answer.

409
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,220
Is the photo taken by the netizen real?

410
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Is it real?

411
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,220
I'm sorry.

412
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,700
The patient is resting now.

413
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,050
If you need an interview,

414
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,260
you can contact the company.

415
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,060
We'll arrange for someone to contact you.

416
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,780
Is Lin Luxiao really dating Nan Chu?

417
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,900
Did your company know

418
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,140
and deliberately conceal it for them?

419
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,980
We saw in the photo that

420
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,220
Lin Luxiao hugged Nan Chu. Was it true?

421
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,380
Is the photo real?

422
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,980
Is it?

423
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,180
Just a few words, Miss.

424
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,460
Back off!

425
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,460
Quiet!

426
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,060
This is the hospital.

427
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,220
Please keep the hospital in order.

428
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,060
You'll disturb other patients like this.

429
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,420
Excuse me, can you give us a brief statement?

430
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,900
I'll call the police if you keep doing this.

431
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,620
Please leave, everyone.

432
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,500
Alright, let's go.

433
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,700
I can tell from their eyes.

434
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,530
The hero saved the beauty.

435
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,180
An accident led to wedding bells.

436
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,020
If this isn't a fairy tale love story, then what is?

437
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,380
A firefighter and a celebrity.

438
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,460
This combination looks good.

439
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,700
Have you heard of rescue romance?

440
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,140
This is rescue romance in its purest form!

441
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,300
You're right. I noticed it too.

442
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,220
It was a normal fire rescue.

443
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,220
Why did it turn into this on the internet?

444
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,220
Guangzong.

445
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,620
Do three things for me now.

446
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,780
First,

447
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,300
make a statement as the company

448
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,700
in response to the false news out there.

449
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,220
Second,

450
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,700
negotiate with all advertisers

451
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,700
and suspend all recent

452
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,460
commercial activities related to Nan Chu.

453
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,140
Third,

454
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,940
ask all relevant personnel,

455
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,980
including Nan Chu,

456
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,300
to keep a low profile.

457
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,220
No one can

458
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,620
make any statement about their relationship.

459
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,020
Got it.

460
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,020
Mr. Han,

461
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,450
are you not optimistic about them?

462
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,660
You're wrong.

463
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,140
I think they are a good match.

464
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,220
I'm afraid they'll be ruined.

465
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,260
A firefighter is a very special occupation.

466
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,740
They don't belong in this industry.

467
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,020
Do you know how many eyes

468
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,450
are watching them right now?

469
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,700
You don't know who has ulterior motives

470
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,020
to make use of them to stir trouble.

471
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,980
Many people in the company want to

472
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,740
use this matter to boost their popularity.

473
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,980
But I don't want to.

474
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,210
We have to protect them.

475
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,380
Got it.

476
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,620
Don't worry.

477
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,860
I'll talk to Nan Chu.

478
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,020
Instructor Lin, I'm sorry

479
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,220
for calling you here.

480
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,220
There are more and more reporters

481
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,530
in the hospital these last two days.

482
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,740
It has started to affect our normal work.

483
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,900
Sorry for the trouble.

484
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,220
Actually, I read some comments online.

485
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,660
I think staying here

486
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,220
is not a good choice

487
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,180
for both you and Nan Chu.

488
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,500
I understand.

489
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,660
Thank you, Dr. Xia.

490
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:57,980
Xi Gu.

491
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,260
We're out.

492
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,540
Don't worry.

493
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,500
No one is following me.

494
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,940
That's good. You scared me.

495
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,860
Zong went to deal with the reporters. Be careful.

496
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:06,860
Okay.

497
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
What did your company say to you?

498
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,660
Nothing.

499
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,660
The news online

500
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,140
is a mess.

501
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,660
And your career has just started.

502
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,300
I don't want to hinder your career either.

503
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,540
People say that

504
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,740
people are afraid of being famous.

505
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,460
The more famous you are, the more troublesome it is.

506
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:31,780
Right?

507
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,660
I'm afraid it'll affect you.

508
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,620
I'm not afraid.

509
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,700
I didn't use this to create hype.

510
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,980
It didn't affect my work either.

511
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,980
They can say whatever they want.

512
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,940
But

513
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,900
did our relationship

514
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,050
affect your work at the station?

515
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,660
No.

516
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,420
We function as normal

517
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,620
and leave for missions whenever applicable.

518
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,250
It doesn't affect us.

519
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,540
That's good.

520
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,180
This is our private life.

521
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,220
I don't want others to point fingers at me.

522
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,420
That's true.

523
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,980
But you just became famous

524
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,300
and a group of people like you.

525
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,780
Surely, some people

526
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,140
in this group must not

527
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,260
want you to have a private life.

528
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,500
They want you to live like

529
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,980
the person in their imagination.

530
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,220
That's troublesome.

531
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,740
I understand.

532
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,650
I know you don't care about that.

533
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,460
But

534
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,140
I'm still worried.

535
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,180
I’m afraid it will hurt you.

536
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,420
Don’t worry, Sergeant Lin.

537
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,660
You protected me in the fire,

538
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,860
but I will protect myself in the workplace.

539
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,140
I'm not a vegetarian either.

540
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,540
Not vegetarian?

541
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,900
What can you eat then?

542
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,230
[Incoming call from Lin Qi]

543
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,780
Lin Qi.

544
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,220
Hello, Brother.

545
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,300
Where are you?

546
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,700
Dad and I are at your house.

547
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,300
Why?

548
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,380
Dad asked me to inform you

549
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,780
to come back with Nan Chu.

550
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,660
He's cooking.

551
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,620
We must get it done.

552
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,180
I've informed you anyway.

553
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,780
It's up to you.

554
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,980
Now?

555
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,020
It is quite sudden.

556
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,500
It's okay.

557
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:08,930
Well,

558
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,460
I'll tell him you'll meet him

559
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:09,980
another day.

560
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,700
Not today.

561
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,460
But Uncle is waiting for you at home.

562
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,460
Why don't we go?

563
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,020
An ugly wife will meet her parents-in-law sooner or later.

564
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,500
Shouldn't we...

565
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,060
Make some preparations?

566
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,460
Why don't I go back and get changed?

567
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,980
It's too far.

568
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,700
Let's go buy something.

569
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,250
Let me think.

570
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,620
Don't be nervous.

571
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,140
It's okay.

572
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,660
I'm not nervous.

573
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,900
My dad is easy to talk to.

574
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,420
Don't be afraid.

575
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,620
It's making me nervous too.

576
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,300
Dad.

577
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:52,940
Dad!

578
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,220
Brother.

579
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,780
You're back.

580
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,940
Where's Dad?

581
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,740
He's in the kitchen.

582
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,540
Dad.

583
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,450
You're back.

584
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,700
Hello, Uncle.

585
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,020
Hello.

586
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,620
This is Nan Chu.

587
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,260
The food will be ready soon.

588
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,220
Take a rest.

589
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,060
Let me help.

590
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,700
-No need.
-No.

591
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,700
My dad is afraid of getting help.

592
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,690
Have a seat.

593
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,420
Sister-in-law.

594
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,180
You're so thoughtful.

595
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,180
It's not your first time here.

596
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,220
You brought so many things.

597
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,540
You talk too much.

598
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,220
Uncle.

599
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,860
I heard you were a firefighter too.

600
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:31,700
Yes.

601
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,850
I have a special feeling

602
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,220
for firefighters.

603
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,060
You may not know this,

604
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,540
I was in a fire when I was 17.

605
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,460
It was Luxiao who saved me.

606
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,980
So I'm always grateful to him.

607
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,460
Yes.

608
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,140
Dad.

609
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,980
I know about this.

610
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,940
At that time,

611
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,900
there was a mistake.

612
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,500
When my brother saved Nan Chu,

613
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,700
he wore someone else's uniform by accident.

614
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,540
In the end,

615
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,420
Nan Chu wanted to repay his kindness

616
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,460
and almost got the wrong person.

617
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,700
So,

618
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,980
people who are fated to meet

619
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,500
will always meet in the end.

620
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,620
Am I right?

621
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,260
It is quite fated.

622
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:15,980
Nan Chu.

623
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,460
I heard you're an actress, right?

624
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:19,900
Yes.

625
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,460
But my dream is to become a dancer.

626
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,500
I started a dance club with some friends.

627
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,690
If you have time,

628
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,860
you can come to watch our performance.

629
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,900
Yes.

630
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,460
Nan Chu

631
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,660
invited me to compose a song.

632
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,260
What does your family do?

633
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,860
My mom is in the US.

634
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,980
My dad passed away very early.

635
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,970
What about your mom now?

636
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,460
Dad.

637
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,140
Let Nan Chu eat something.

638
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,420
You keep asking.

639
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,220
She's quite nervous.

640
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,700
Yes, Dad.

641
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,850
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

642
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,980
Eat first.

643
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,700
Eat it while it's hot.

644
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,460
Try my dad's cooking.

645
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,700
I didn't lie to you, did I?

646
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,180
Eat up.

647
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,620
Okay.

648
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,460
Thank you, Dad.

649
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,220
Mr. Han,

650
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,140
I've almost recovered.

651
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,780
When will you get me a job?

652
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,380
No hurry.

653
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,900
Take care of yourself.

654
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:04,700
The company has

655
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,540
postponed all your recent plans.

656
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,500
Mr. Han,

657
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,220
this injury is nothing.

658
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,260
I haven't had any activity for so long.

659
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,010
If I don't appear on screen soon,

660
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,460
it'll be really dangerous.

661
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,210
The company has its own arrangement.

662
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:22,980
Mr. Han,

663
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,220
if I can't do dramas and advertisements,

664
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,300
I should at least be able to accept endorsements, right?

665
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,980
No need to hurry.

666
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,660
Just recover first.

667
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,050
[Isn't this an official announcement? What are you waiting for? We have moved the Civil Affairs Bureau here for you. The rest is up to you.]

668
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,540
Did you see the news?

669
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,300
You didn't expect that, did you?

670
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,780
Nan Chu is really something.

671
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:11,780
Ran,

672
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
Let's work together.

673
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,700
Nan Chu.

674
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,700
Let them do the work.

675
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,180
Sit with me and watch TV.

676
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,980
Yes.

677
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,660
Chat with Dad.

678
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,220
-Give it to me.
-Okay.

679
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,380
Be careful.

680
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,500
Sit.

681
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,900
Do you like to watch Peking opera, Uncle?

682
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,860
I watch it sometimes.

683
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,140
When I was a kid,

684
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,460
I learned a few moves in dance class.

685
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,740
To be honest,

686
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,300
I'm not optimistic about you two.

687
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,770
Because of my occupation?

688
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,700
No.

689
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,500
On the contrary,

690
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,700
it's because of Luxiao's occupation.

691
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,220
You know he's a firefighter.

692
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,420
His life

693
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,460
doesn't belong to him.

694
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,780
I know.

695
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,900
But I'm ready.

696
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,930
I know

697
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
you two are

698
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,130
in your lovey-dovey period.

699
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,500
You can make

700
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,980
any promise and decision to each other.

701
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,700
But

702
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,300
you have to face

703
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,540
more than that in the future.

704
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,180
You're a smart girl.

705
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,220
You should understand what I mean.

706
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,660
Dad.

707
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:00,860
Sister-in-law.

708
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,300
Have some tea.

709
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,180
I'm leaving.

710
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,540
Dad.

711
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,500
You're leaving already?

712
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,470
Well...

713
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:10,660
Brother.

714
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,220
Dad's leaving.

715
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,380
Dad, let me give you a ride.

716
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,380
No need.

717
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,300
Dad.

718
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,780
Let me drive you home.

719
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:18,660
No need.

720
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,180
I'll send Dad home.

721
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:21,940
Okay.

722
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,380
See you next time, Uncle.

723
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,620
Okay.

724
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,460
How did it go?

725
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,980
Not bad.

726
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,860
Uncle still embodies his military upbringing.

727
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,460
It's a pity that he has a bad temper

728
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,700
and is mean with his words.

729
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,180
Are you done?

730
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,020
Almost.

731
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,180
I'll go take a look.

732
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,940
Go ahead.

733
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,620
Hello.

734
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,260
I'm Xu Zhiyi.

735
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,540
As a witness to the

736
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,140
Huanyu Building fire,

737
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,420
there's something

738
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,460
in my heart that

739
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,380
I want to tell everyone.

740
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,540
The fire

741
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,380
was really scary.

742
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,260
This time,

743
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,860
I was very lucky

744
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,220
to have escaped death.

745
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,300
But I just want to ask.

746
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,980
Do our firefighters

747
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,980
save people

748
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,620
depending on relationships?

749
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,470
[Xi Gu]

750
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,620
Xi Gu.

751
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,700
Nan Chu.

752
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,500
Where are you?

753
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,740
Do you know that Xu Zhiyi

754
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,740
posted a video?

755
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,690
What video?

756
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,980
This Xu Zhiji.

757
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
Is she crazy?

758
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,180
She knew

759
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,300
we're all artists from the same company.

I didn't inform him to be here.

Does the person around him refer to Nan Chu?

Don't store flammable and explosive items in the car,

1012
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,460
like lighters, perfumes, fresheners, and so on.

1013

Keep the car clean

1014
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,180
and send it for regular maintenance.

1015

If the vehicle is old,

1016

Car fires

1019

usually start from one part

and spread to other areas.

If found earlier,

1022

the fire is still small.

1023
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,580
Usually, the fire extinguisher in the car

1024
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,180
is enough to solve the crisis.

If we can't put out the fire,

1026
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,060
we should leave immediately

1027

and evacuate the people around
