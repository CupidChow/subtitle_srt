They're not rare.

9
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,780
But this is a process that every firefighter

10
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,900
has to go through.

11
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,020
Is it that the bereaved fail to understand?

12
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,980
Or is it that the result isn't ideal

13
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,340
despite a successful rescue?

14
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,180
They're actually the same thing.

15
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,300
Quite often,

16
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,940
during rescue operations,

17
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,300
we encounter a lot of unexpected accidents.

18
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,860
That's the way it is.

19
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,500
Just like in life,

20
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,980
things don't always work out
the way we want them to.

21
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,380
We will feel wronged

but life goes on.

24
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,420
My overriding impression

25
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,260
is that although firefighters
can save lives,

26
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,380
they can't really, well,

27
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,020
remove people's emotional distress.

28
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,820
So in your opinion, what does it take

29
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,460
to remove this emotional distress?

30
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,370
I don't know.

31
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,020
After so many experiences of this kind,

32
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,540
have you become somewhat numb?

33
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,380
I feel quite powerless.

34
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,260
It's like there're people

35
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,900
that you just can't communicate with.

36
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,460
Like you live in two different worlds.

37
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,650
No.

38
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,620
We just...

39
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,180
learn to control them.

40
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,620
Control what?

41
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,020
Our emotions.

42
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,100
If it were you,

43
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,740
what would you do?

44
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,820
I don't know.

45
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,660
So,

46
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,100
apart from firefighting

47
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,460
and major rescue operations,

48
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,820
are there also many minor cases

49
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,620
such as retrieving rings

50
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,020
that you need to handle?

51
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,380
We do get many emergency calls

52
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,260
that are similar to the one we've had today.

53
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,890
Why did you insist on giving it another try

54
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,180
when the emergency caller had told you

55
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,540
not to bother?

56
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,260
When we just got there,

57
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,610
I saw signs of tears on her face.

58
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,130
She must have cried before we arrived.

59
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,860
And there was this black-and-white photograph
at her place.

60
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,860
She didn't say it,

61
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,180
but we all knew

62
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,140
that this ring

63
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,220
meant a lot to her.

64
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,940
So minor missions

65
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,260
are also of great importance.

66
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,260
For us,

67
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,860
there're no "major" or "minor" missions.

I can't be of any help.

It should sound more dynamic.

112
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,140
So I have an idea.

113
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,980
We can use a synthesizer

114

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,700
resilient bass.

116
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,140
Then we'll add a melody

117
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,460
with an electric guitar.

118
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,700
And we'll finish by adding a little rhythm

119
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,100
and extending the torque

120
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,220

121
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,460
such as a bell,

122
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,260
so that it won't be too lively,

123
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,700
and will bring out the theme of "fire."

379

Xi Gu.

380
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,740
Thank you.

381
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,740
Have you heard?

382
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,340
Our show has got loads of attention

383
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,580
since we released the second episode
yesterday.

384
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,860
Have you checked out today's
trending topics?

385
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,700
The top three are all related to our show.

386
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,340
Really?

387
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,980
Yes.

388
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,220
Mr. Shen,

389
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,060
there were only three of us in this room,

390
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,820
and you only congratulated Nan Chu
after coming in,

391
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,100
as if the two of us here were invisible.

392
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,820
So this show has nothing to do with us?

393
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,100
Exactly.

394
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,220
He only bought one bouquet too.

395
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,500
What are you talking about?

396
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,500
These flowers are for all of you.

397
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,500
Congratulations, Ms. Yan.

398
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,460
Congratulations, Zhiyi.

399
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,580
Thank you so much.

400
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,460
Have a seat.

401
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,500
OK.

402
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,220
Zong,

403
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,300
Mr. Han is here

404
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,940
and wants to see me.

405
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,060
I'll wait for him at the door.

406
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,100
Go ahead.

407
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,980
Sis,

408
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,940
what's with the dark circles
under your eyes?

409
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,740
I've got dark circles?

410
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,940
It's true I haven't been sleeping well.

411
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:56,940
Xi Gu,

412
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,100
why don't you do Ms. Dai's makeup?

413
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,820
Nan Chu is away anyway.

414
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,580
You seem to be pretty good at it.

415
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,700
It's OK.

416
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,820
You can lend a hand.

417
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:15,820
Mr. Han.

418
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,700
Nan Chu.

419
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,100
The show

420
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,220
is doing pretty well.

421
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,100
Yes.

422
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,980
I didn't expect people would be

423
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,940
so interested in a show about firefighting.

424
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,340
We're thinking about taking this opportunity

425
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,460
to introduce you into the field
of film and TV series.

426
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,820
We've already received some scripts.

427
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,180
I'll ask Shen Guangzong to read

428
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,180
and assess them for you.

429
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,940
Mr. Han,

430
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,580
perhaps the company is rushing things a bit?

431
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:42,460
Why?

432
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,420
You have something to say?

433
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,740
Not really.

434
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,180
I'll do my best to compete all the work

435
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,340
that the company assigns to me.

436
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,700
But as you know,

437
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,340
we agreed when I was signing the contract

438
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,490
that I can set aside some time
for Dream Dance.

439
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,300
OK.

440
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,700
Well,

441
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,860
just focus on the show for now.

442
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,220
As for the dance club...

443
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,660
We'll talk about it later.

444
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,380
What happened to my face?

445
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,460
What did you put on my face?

446
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,460
Nothing.

447
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,700
Gosh!

448
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,460
That looks really bad!

449
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,380
How are you going to do the shooting?

450
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,980
Ms. Yan,

451
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,460
please calm down.

452
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,740
Please.

453
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,660
Get out of the way.

454
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,610
Mr. Shen,

455
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,700
she's ruined Ms. Yan's face,

456
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,740
and you're still protecting her?

457
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,220
Stop it, Zhiyi.

458
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,780
Well...

459
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,700
Ms. Yan,

460
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,170
seems like it's just an allergic reaction.

461
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:42,980
It should be fine.

462
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,700
You see what my skin is like now.

463
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,850
What on earth did you put in my makeup?

464
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,460
Tell me the truth now!

465
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,220
Tell us now!

466
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,700
Who asked you to do this?

467
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,620
Zhiyi.

468
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,900
I really didn't do anything.

469
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,620
I didn't put in anything.

470
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:54,940
Right.

471
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,220
Right.

472
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,250
Of course.

473
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,940
It's going to be fine.

474
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,620
You didn't do anything?

475
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,540
Well, look,

476
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,220
Ms. Yan,

477
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,660
it's true that Xi Gu

478
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,260
can be careless sometimes,

479
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,780
but she would never do something like that.

480
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,900
Mr. Shen!

481
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,220
You haven't known her long.

482
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,140
And even if she wouldn't have
done that herself,

483
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,300
someone else might have asked her to do it.

484
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,220
Stop it, will you?

485
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,020
Sis,

486
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,620
let's call the police.

487
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,300
What's going on?

488
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,890
Xu Zhiyi, what do you mean?

489
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,900

491

What's going on?

492

Mr. Han,

493
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,620
look at Dai's face!

494
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,440
It's all because of this person here!

495
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,380
Such an unprofessional makeup artist

496
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,620
should be fired right away!

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,370

Ms. Nan,

500
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,780
I was doing her makeup and nothing else.

501
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,180
I really don't know how that happened.

502
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
What products did you use?

503
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
They're all are there.

504
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Come on, Xi Gu,

505
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,260
do my makeup for me

506
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,260
with the same products.

507
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,180
What are you waiting for?

508
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,500
We're shooting soon.

509
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Hurry up.

510

511
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,220
can you pass us the beauty blender?

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:45,980
You see,

515
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,460
there's nothing wrong with these cosmetics,

516
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,620
and Xi Gu wouldn't have done anything bad
to you on purpose.

517
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,210
This is just a misunderstanding.

518
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,780
You're just having an allergic reaction.

519
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,540
What's wrong with you, Xi Gu?

520
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
How can you be so careless

521

not a palace drama.

525
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,260
What do you mean?

526
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,220
Yan Dai,

527
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,460
you should go see a doctor.

528
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,540
That's right.

529
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
Ms. Yan,

530
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,980
the car is ready.

531
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,260
Your face is what's important, right?

532
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,140
Let's go see a doctor.

533

Mr. Han,

534
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,860
how am I wrong?

535
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,980
She's just a newcomer.

536
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,060
And Dai's...

537
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,540
I'll go to the hospital with Dai.

538
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,220
Mr. Han,

539
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,540
shall I go with them?

540
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,220
OK.

541
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,060
Zong.

542
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,500
Yes?

543

Zong.

544
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,700
There's something I want to say.

545
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,700
Thank you for helping me just now.

546
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,540
It's nothing.

547
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,620
There's really no need.

548
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,940
I know you're too timid

549
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,900
to do such a thing.

550
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,940
That's just not possible.

551
00:20:59,420 --> 00:20:59,860
All right,

552
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,980
don't take it personally.

Hello.

558
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,060
I heard that Yan Dai's face is swollen.

559
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,730
Is she OK?

560
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,860
She's fine.

561
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,700
There's just some redness.

562
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,060
She's gone to the hospital.

563
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,220
I'll go check on her.

564
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,740
Go ahead.

565
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,500
OK.

566
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,020
I'll get going then.

567
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,300
OK.

568
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,700
Go ahead.

569
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,850
Do you think we should go as well?

570
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,680
Why don't you contact Dr. Xia about it?

571
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,540
Talk to her about the first aid training

572
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,220
while you're at it.

573
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,780
I asked Liu to take charge

574
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,190
of contacting Dr. Xia.

575
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,490
Why not contact her yourself?

576
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,800
The instructor

577
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,270
is looking after his team member?

578
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,980
It's nothing.

579
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,830
Look after yourself.

580
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,750
"It's nothing."

581
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,470
I...

582
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,450
It's just a matter of a phone call.

583
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,100
Why did Instructor Yang
ask Assistant Liu to go there?

584
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,460
Instructor Yang is creating
an opportunity for Assistant Liu.

585
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,550
Look at him.

586
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,060
So handsome.

587
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,240
Smiling from ear to ear.

588
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,100
Yu.

589
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,120
How do I look?

590
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,340
You're very well groomed,

591
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,440
but does Dr. Xia know that you like her?

592
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,750
Probably...

593
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,770
Maybe...

594
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,100
I'm not sure.

595
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,290
Assistant Liu,

596
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,720
be confident!

597
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,850
Confidence!

598
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,450
Look how great your hair looks today.

599
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:30,870
Yes!

600
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,240
Right?

601
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,050
Your left and right pecs
are the same size today.

602
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,510
Right?

603
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,020
Yes!

604
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,560
Confidence!

605
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,780
Confidence!

606
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,540
Confidence!

607
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,340
Confidence!

608
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,070
What?

609
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,250
Oh no.

610
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,550
Where is Liu Xiahan?

611
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,770
I need to borrow his cologne.

612
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,240
Use plenty of it!

613
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:54,810
Dr. Xia,

614
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,700
can I treat you to a meal?

615
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,010
Dr. Xia...

616
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,280
Dr. Xia!

617
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,440
Assistant Liu,

618
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,070
what...

619
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,210
brings you here?

620
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,130
The instructor asked me to come and see you.

621
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,700
About the first aid training?

622
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,120
Yes.

623
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,960
When should I come?

624
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:19,800
Tomorrow?

625
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,680
Are you free tomorrow?

626
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,520
Yes.

627
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,270
Tomorrow it is then.

628
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,820
OK.

629
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,300
Give me the medical record
of the patient in bed 18.

630
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,990
I-I'll pick you up tomorrow.

631
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,340
No need. It's easy for me to get there.

632
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,330
Dr. Xia.

633
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,530
I...

634
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,310
I thank you on behalf of our team.

635
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,240
You're welcome.

636
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,880
Assistant Liu.

637
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,770
Nice hairstyle.

638
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,830
Don't do it again.

639
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,610
"Nice hairstyle."

640
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,060
Ms. Yan.

641
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,240
Is your face OK?

642
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,290
With this allergic reaction,

643
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,280
I'll probably not be able to do makeup
for a few days.

644
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,300
Allergic reactions are tricky.

645
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,770
They tend to come back
if you're not careful.

646
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,780
Right.

647
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,380
I've talked to Mr. Jiang.

648
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,560
We'll give you a day off.

649
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,150
You can get some rest now.

650
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,580
Just one?

651
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,060
This allergic reaction is really serious.

652
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,450
I'll need at least seven days.

653
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,800
You know it's not up to me.

654
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,120
Maybe you'd like to talk to the leadership?

655
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,630
Talk to them myself?

656
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,480
Boss,

657
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,370
allergic reactions are serious.

658
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,310
It's so annoying!

659
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,450
Sis,

660
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,020
it's you who's the victim of this incident.

661
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,540
How come it became a showcase for Nan Chu?

662
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,940
And she got to show off
in front of Mr. Han too.

663
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,530
I mean,

664
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,210
Nan Chu

665
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,560
is such a calculating person.

666
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,620
Nan Chu?

667
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,880
Yes.

668
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,720
Haven't you thought about it?

669
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,320
Even if

670
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,800
she didn't ask Xi Gu to do that,

671
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,320
you saw what she was like

672
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,450
since Mr. Han came.

673
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,880
Trying to please him the whole time.

674
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,560
From waiting for him

675
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,160
to getting her makeup done.

676
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,080
Why?

677
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,470
Because she wanted to show

678
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
that she's very easygoing.

679
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,970
Your face was ruined,

680
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,530
but all of them were on Nan Chu's side.

681
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,040
None of them stuck up for you

682
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,230
or went to the hospital with you.

683
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,260
So scheming

684
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,850
at such a young age.

685
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,450
[China Fire and Rescue]
When we need to perform CPR

686
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:56,490
[China Fire and Rescue]

687
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,920
on a patient,
[China Fire and Rescue]

688
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,300
[China Fire and Rescue]

689
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,310
the first thing we should do
[China Fire and Rescue]

690
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,430
is to make sure
[China Fire and Rescue]

691
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,020
is to make sure

692
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,490
that the patient is lying on their back.

693
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,720
Many patients might be lying on their side

694
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,850
or in other positions.

695
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,460
In such cases, we need to help them

696
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,300
lie as flat as possible.

697
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Then we need to check

698
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,790
if the patient still has a pulse
and is breathing.

699
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,350
If there's neither,

700
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,820
we should perform CPR on the patient.

701
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,710
Find the spot for chest compressions

702
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,060
slightly further down the chest
than the midpoint

703
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,320
between the patient's two nipples.

704
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,050
We do the compressions with our palm.

705
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,150
Place your palm on the compression spot.

706
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,710
Lean forward,

707
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,050
and keep your arms
perpendicular to the ground.

708
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,530
Use the weight of your body
to do the compressions.

709
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,070
Do this at a rate

710
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,000
of approximately 110 to 120 compressions
per minute.

711
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,010
Press down about five centimeters
into the chest.

712
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,780
When you have given

713
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,370
30 chest compressions,

714
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,470
start performing rescue breathing.

715
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,380
Listen carefully.

716
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,220
Stay focused.

717
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,540
OK.

718
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,300
Check at the same time

719
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,110
if the patient's chest rises and falls.

720
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,260
If during the 30 chest compressions

721
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,970
and two rescue breaths...

722
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,980
What were you thinking about?

723
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,780
You looked like you were dozing.

724
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,330
Then we should perform
a second round of CPR.

725
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,800
I didn't quite follow.

726
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,440
Don't worry.

727
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,530
I'll teach you later.

728
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,960
Next, I'm going to talk about

729
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,300
what we should do

730
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,100
if a patient

731
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,070
has a fracture,

732
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,750
is injured, or is bleeding.

733
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,320
I need a partner.

734
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,950
Ma'am!

735
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,460
I'd like to apply to be

736
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,390
Dr Xia's partner.

737
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,280
Please have a seat.

738
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,030
Yes.

739
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,700
Next, I'm going to show you

740
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,000
how to use a triangular bandage.

741
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,340
This method applies to cases

742
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,560
where the patient is bleeding

743
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,490
or needs immediate immobilization.

744
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,510
Let this corner of the triangular bandage

745
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,400
go through the patient's armpit.

746
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,320
Oh, actually,

747
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,620
if you don't mind,

748
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,140
it'd be easier for me to demonstrate it
if you could take off your shirt.

749
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,850
First, hold the bandage like this

750
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,160
and place it over the patient's chest.

751
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,550
If the patient's left arm is injured,

752
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,220
we should...

753
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,360
Relax, Assistant Liu.

754
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,300
Let it go through the patient's armpit,

755
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,570
and then tie both ends at the back.

756
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:51,930
I believe

757
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,310
my demonstration just now

758
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,030
has given you some basic information

759
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,000
about first aid treatment.

760
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,520
Now I'd like you to

761
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,370
form groups and try it for yourselves.

762
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,880
Feel free to ask any questions.

763
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:03,730
Dr. Xia,

764
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,370
can I move now?

765
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:06,920
No.

766
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,300
That's too long.

767
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,230
You can get rid of the excess gauze.

768
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,070
Nan Chu,

769
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,970
are you really doing it correctly?

770
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,860
I guess so.

771
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,310
That is...

772
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,710
Whether it's correct or not,

773
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,720
it looks really ugly.

774
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,240
Is it

775
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,960
treatment for an extensive facial burn?

776
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,300
Yes.

777
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,390
Sergeant Lin,

778
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,530
no need to worry.

779
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,540
I can teach her.

780
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,840
I've got first aid training credentials.

781
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,310
Just go.

782
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,270
You know a lot.

783
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,620
Thanks to outdoor sports.

784
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,790
But if you teach me,

785
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,760
who will be the patient?

786
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,120
We'll just find someone.

787
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,550
I can't untie it.

788
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,140
Well, just try to...

789
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,700
Don't make the knot too complicated.

790
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,070
Keep it simple and secure.

791
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,220
Adjust this area at the top.

792
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,830
Make sure it's neatly done.

793
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,790
Hook it like this.

794
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,350
See?

795
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,120
Now it's nicely fixed

796
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,040
and not too complicated.

797
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,090
Very clear.

798
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,110
Like this?

799
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,530
Yes.

800
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,210
Smooth it out,

801
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,760
and now it looks so much better.

802
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,960
Sis,

803
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,310
look at Nan Chu.

804
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,040
She has Mr. Jiang as her partner

805
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,270
and now keeps Director Lin beside her.

806
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,370
Of course the cameras are on her.

807
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,110
Honestly,

808
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,450
what's the point

809
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,040
of competing with a newbie?

810
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,930
If you want the cameras to be on you,

811
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,700
go and earn it.

812
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,020
Nan Chu, come here and try this
when you're done.

813
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,480
OK.

814
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,470
Drinking it alone?

815
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,440
That brain of yours.

816
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,710
I meant that you should
give Dr. Xia a bottle.

817
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,780
Hopeless.

818
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,450
Liu.

819
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,040
Dr. Xia,

820
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,590
have some water.

821
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,730
Director Lin,

822
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,110
we have guests from the brigade.

823
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,040
The instructor wants to see you.

824
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,630
OK.

825
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,220
Liu.

826
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,310
I'm OK, thanks.

827
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,540
Get them to practice using a stretcher
in groups.

828
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,130
Yes.

829
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,740
Get into groups, everyone.

830
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,550
Have some water.

831
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,240
I'll show you now.

832
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,050
Let's say he's injured.

833
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,740
The taller one stands at the front end.

834
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,120
Now buckle this up.

835
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,720
Like this, right?

836
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,520
Make sure it's securely fastened.

837
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,340
You need to face that direction.

838
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,090
That direction?

839
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:12,560
Yes.

840
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,020
This way...

841
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,440
What's wrong?

842
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,280
Sergeant,

843
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,540
you're way too heavy for us

844
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,290
to carry.

845
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,600
Can we get someone else?

846
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,440
Sure. Go ahead.

847
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,040
You're indeed a bit too heavy for us.

848
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:29,940
Xi Gu.

849
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,470
Come and help me and Ms. Yan practice.

850
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,520
Gu,

851
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,700
don't you want to ease the tension

852
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,550
between you and Ms. Yan?

853
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,080
Ms. Yan said

854
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,000
that she doesn't blame you,

855
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,350
and she's not cross.

856
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,860
We as artists

857
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,950
are exposed to the elements

858
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,340
and inevitably have skin problems.

859
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,100
Now,

860
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,370
she's senior to you and she said that.

861
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,640
Shouldn't you be sensible as a junior?

862
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,700
I'm offering you a chance.

863
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,130
Seize it.

864
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:05,770
Let's go.

865
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,340
Yan Dai,

866
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,270
Xi Gu has agreed to help us.

867
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,210
And she wants to apologize to you.

868
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,080
I'm sorry, Ms. Yan.

869
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,020
I didn't know you have allergies.

870
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,530
It's OK.

871
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,760
I wasn't that vexed.

872
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,070
Let's practice together.

873
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,370
Come on.

874
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:30,930
Here.

875
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,520
Makeup bag.

876
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,850
Be careful.

877
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,280
Lie down.

878
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,150
Xi Gu!

879
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,540
Xi Gu!

880
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:51,970
What's going on?

881
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,440
Get up.

882
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,870
What happened?

883
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,710
We were practice using a stretcher,

884
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,480
but Xi Gu is so heavy,

885
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,160
Ms. Yan and I couldn't lift her.

886
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,420
Did they do it on purpose?

887
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,220
It's fine. It doesn't hurt.

888
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,600
Why do you keep bullying her?

889
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,110
If you have a problem with me,

890
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,120
make me your target, not Xi Gu.

891
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,710
Nan Chu!

892
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,430
Since you're my junior,

893
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,230
I won't argue with you.

894
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,240
Don't push your luck.

895
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,910
What do you even mean?

896
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:11,620
Did you actually see what happened?

897
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,510
You're just talking nonsense!

898
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,220
Don't fight.

899
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,890
Nan Chu.

900
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,860
Ms. Nan!

901
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,360
I'm fine.

902
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,510
What are you doing?

903
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,870
Can't you practice properly?

904
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,070
Are you hurt?

905
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:32,920
Come on,

906
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,590
I'll take you to the infirmary.

907
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,340
If you don't want to practice,

908
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,060
don't waste everyone's time here.

909
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,040
All right now.

910
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,090
Stop looking!

911
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,010
Move.

912
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,610
Go back to practicing.

913
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,080
Stop staring at me!

914
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,250
Move.

915
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,980
This is outrageous!

916
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,340
What happened just now?

917
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,980
They...

918
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,040
They did it on purpose

919
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,130
to pick on Ms. Nan.

920
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,700
I see.

921
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,330
Have a rest.

922
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,320
Mr. Jiang,

923
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,750
this episode has a strong selling point now.

924
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,510
Selling point?

925
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,440
A selling point!

926
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,090
Delete it all.

927
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,020
Wait,

928
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,700
all of it?

929
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,060
It's really deep.

930
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,420
I'll clean it with hydrogen peroxide.

931
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:29,950
Come on.

932
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:30,920
Put it here.

933
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,210
OK.

934
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,510
Hang in there.

935
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,250
Is it OK?

936
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,250
Director Lin.

937
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,600
Nan Chu, are you OK?

938
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,150
Is it bad?

939
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,030
I'm fine.

940
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,130
Do you need my help?

941
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:13,590
It's OK,

942
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,350
I've cleaned her wound.

943
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:15,940
Great.

944
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,040
I'll go back to the hospital now
if there's nothing else.

945
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:18,920
Hold on.

946
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,530
Well... Liu,

947
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,080
go get my key

948
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,590
and drive Dr. Xia back.

949
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,020
Yes.

950
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,320
Thank you.

951
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,080
You're welcome.

952
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:28,880
Bye.

953
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,590
After you.

954
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,480
What are you doing here?

955
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:37,610
Right,

956
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,040
I heard that Nan Chu is injured,

957
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,590
so I came to check on her.

958
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,090
Are you OK?

959
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:40,680
I'm fine.

960
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:41,810
That's good to hear.

961
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,490
The wound is quite deep.

962
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,000
I just disinfected it.

963
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,990
Director Lin...

964
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,120
is very considerate.

965
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,930
All right then.

966
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,980
Go on.

967
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,820
Come back when you're done.

968
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,830
OK.

969
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,850
I'll use this anti-inflammatory

970
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,610
to help it heal faster.

971
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,920
But you'll really have to

972
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,220
bear with it.

973
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,560
It's going to hurt a little.

974
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:14,910
Come on.

975
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,220
It smells kind of bad.

976
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,560
Yes.

977
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,330
It's a folk medicine that I came across

978
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,050
while on a mission in another county.

979
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:29,610
It does smell kind of bad,

980
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,540
but it's really good

981
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:32,720
for this kind of wound.

982
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:33,850
It'll heal really fast.

983
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,800
Sorry about what happened earlier.

984
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,970
I didn't want to argue with them,

985
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,740
but I couldn't control myself.

986
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,540
Don't worry.

987
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,680
I saw it.

988
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,150
It wasn't your fault.

989
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,540
Maybe I should apologize to them.

990
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,520
Why?

991
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,030
I'm afraid it might affect the show.

992
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,210
It won't.

993
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,380
Xu Zhiyi.

994
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,910
Director Lin.

995
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,380
What can I do for you?

996
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,040
Can I

997
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,840
have a private word with Xu Zhiyi?

998
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,440
Sure.

999
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,550
Let's go.

1000
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,530
Xu Zhiyi,

1001
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,210
tell me,

1002
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,320
why are you picking on Nan Chu and Xi Gu?

1003
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,460
Picking on them?

1004
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,520
Director Lin,

1005
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,460
I was trying to ease the tension

1006
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,350
between Xi Gu and Yan Dai.

1007
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,710
Nan Chu misunderstood me.

1008
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,100
The words I'm going to say to you now,

1009
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,160
you can pass them on
to the rest of you guys.

1010
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,180
There is only one theme

1011
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,650
at my special division station,

1012
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,370
and that is fire safety.

1013
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,430
Put away all those tricks and ploys

1014
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,520
of yours.

1015
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,160
If I ever

1016
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,050
hear of or see

1017
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,150
anyone trying to make mischief
between people

1018
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,000
at my station,

1019
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,730
I'll kick her out immediately.

1020
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,240
I won't be lenient.

1021
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,460
Understand?

1022
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,970
Director Lin,

1023
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,190
what are you talking about?

1024
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,070
If you don't understand,

1025
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,540
take your time and think about it.

1026
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,250
Director...

1027
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,690
Director!

1028
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,610
Xu Zhiyi,

1029
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,710
what did Director Lin say to you?

1030
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,660
He said I've been doing very well lately,

1031
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,340
and that I should keep it up.

1032
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:34,890
Director Lin

1033
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:35,940
is such a nice person.

1034
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,420
I'm feeling so full of energy now!

1035
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,060
Thank you,

1036
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,690
Assistant Liu.

1037
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,250
I'll go in now.

1038
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,530
Doc...

1039
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,620
Dr. Xia,

1040
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,720
can I treat you to a meal today?

1041
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,930
What am I doing?

1042
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,270
Assistant Liu,

1043
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,420
do you like me?

1044
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,660
Well, I just wanted to check with you.

1045
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,470
There's a new gym not far from here.

1046
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,400
I believe you work out regularly too.

1047
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,000
Let's work out together.

1048
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:36,800
Sure!

1049
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:37,970
Sure!

1050
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,810
Deal.

1051
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,320
Deal.

1052
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,920
She likes...

1053
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,660
She...

1054
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,550
She asked me if I like her.

1055
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,540
Assistant Liu is back.

1056
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,930
How did it go, Assistant Liu?

1057
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,020
How did it go?

1058
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,740
Did everything go smoothly?

1059
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,710
Assistant Liu?

1060
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,060
N-N-No...

1061
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,110
D-D-Don't bother me.

1062
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:12,830
Assistant Liu,

1063
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,140
whatever it is,

1064
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,650
we can help you analyze it.

1065
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,910
Yes, we'll help you analyze it.

1066
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:17,540
That way you'll...

1067
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,590
Don't bother me.

1068
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,520
I'm not in the mood.

1069
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,210
You two should leave him alone.

1070
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,610
He's mentally unavailable at the moment.

1071
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,830
His single-core processor is overheating

1072
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,720
and can't support any additional program.

1073
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,960
Assistant Liu,

1074
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,050
where are you going?

1075
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,850
Assistant Liu?

1076
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,480
Going for a workout.

1077
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,490
I need some peace and quiet.

1078
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:46,430
Director,

1079
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,990
what's wrong with Assistant Liu?

1080
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:48,950
What happened?

1081
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,040
You two

1082
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,520
should enjoy your present life.

1083
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,130
Cherish the present?

1084
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,060
Now I'm even more confused.

1085
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,580
Yijiu.

1086
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,820
"Thank you."

1087
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,920
"Do you like me?"

1088
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,260
"Well,

1089
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,350
I'm just checking with you."

1090
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,660
That's what he wrote.

1091
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,760
I'm not gossipy.

1092
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,440
Let me see.

1093
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,490
"I believe you work out regularly.

1094
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,090
There happens to be new a gym nearby.

1095
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,150
Teach me when you have time."

1096
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,540
He's obsessed.

1097
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,330
[Tips for Fire Safety]

1098
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,970
Hello, students.

1099
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,350
Be sure to abide by the safety regulations

1100
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,160
when you're in the dorm.

1101
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,340
Avoid using high-wattage appliances

1102
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,020
or plugging too many appliances

1103
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,670
into one power strip.

1104
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,400
Do not place flammable items nearby.

1105
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,000
While using a lamp

1106
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,890
or a charger,

1107
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,690
if there is a smell of burning,

1108
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,430
or if there is smoke,

1109
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,600
be sure to stop using it immediately

1110
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,360
and turn off the power.

1111
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,840
Fire safety is everyone's responsibility.
