I know

378
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,980
I made a mistake this time.

379
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,400
Can you help me plead for forgiveness with the brigade?

380
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,230
I don't want to leave the Special Division Station.

381
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,900
I'll think of a way.

382
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,050
How do you usually

383
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,980
deal with a matter like that of Dagang?

384
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,170
It depends on the result of Chen Yilong's medical examination.

385
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,310
If there's nothing serious

386
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,700
and Chen Yilong

387
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,550
is willing to accept the compensation,

388
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,810
we'll usually end the case.

389
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,960
If Chen Yilong refuses to accept compensation,

390
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,010
he'll be detained.

391
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:43,990

392
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,310
Give me a little more time.

393
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:48,660
Okay?

394
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,510
I'll try my best.

395
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,200

401
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,730
We want to talk to you.

402
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,710
I have nothing to talk to you about.

403

404
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,490
We're here

405
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,210
for Dagang.

406
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,220
You two are childhood friends.

407
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,690
All these years,

408
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,500
you've always been taking care of each other.

409
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,780
I hope you can spare him.

410
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,000
Whatever requests you have

411
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,890
and compensation you need,

412
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,320
propose them

413
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,870
and we'll pay for it.

414
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,560
Cut it out.

415
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,330
Dagang and I grew up together.

416
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,970
For his child's schooling,

417
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,280
I've contributed a lot of money and effort.

418
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,970
We don't owe each other anything, you know?

419
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,150
And that guy of yours.

420
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,140
What does his death have to do with me?

421
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,790
I didn't want the building to collapse either.

422
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,970
Look at me.

423
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,650
Do I look like I wanted the building to collapse?

424

426

With this matter,

427
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,920
it won't be that easy.

428
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,810
I'm sorry.

429
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,140
I apologize on behalf of Lei Dagang.

430
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,660
But you have to tell me

431
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,470
what you want to do.

432
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,270
Why are you staring at me?

433
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,460
Do you want to fight?

434
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,020
Hit me. Come on.

435

00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,010
Why don't you beat me up to death?

438
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,480
If you can't kill me,

439

440
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,670

What are you doing?

449
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,910

Just the two of us.

452

Tell me.

453
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,870
What will it take for you to spare Dagang?

454
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,570
To be honest,

455
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,800
I don't care about money.

456
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:50,640

457

right?

462
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,860
There must be someone you know who you can talk to.

463
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,550
I promise you

464
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,060
that as long as I'm fine,

465
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,950

right?

471
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,020
I can give her some money.

472
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,570
I can give her a lot of money.

I miss you.

570

My good brother.

571
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,630
Qilei.

572
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,480
Although you've passed away,

573
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,660
you don't know

574
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,800
how many people

575
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,700
are using you to get hype and popularity.

576
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,380
Are they still human?

577
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,190
I despise them.

I won't say anything else.

580

Here's to you.

581
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,300
Take care.

Ran Dongyang is so shameless.

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,790
If it weren't for us,

588
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,550
he would have died in the food factory.

589
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,360
He's lying about this incident.

590
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,280
Can't we report him?

591
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,880
He never once mentioned the station,

592
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,270
specific details,

593
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,190
or specific people.

594
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,070
How can we report him?

595
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:48,990
How unlucky.

596
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,120
Bad luck.

598
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,660
Do you know what they're saying

599
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,670
about us online?

600
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,390
They can say whatever they want.

601
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,070
We'll just do what we have to do.

602
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,760
Don't look at the nonsense on the Internet anymore.

603
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,560
All right.

604
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,410
Stop scolding them.

605
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,460
This incident has indeed negatively impacted us.

606
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:14,690
You two, go back now.

607
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,290
Let's see what we can do about Dagang.

608
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,590
Will Unit Leader Lei be able to come back?

609
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,050
Go to training now.

Qi Huo.

611
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,000
Can you think of a way to help Unit Leader Lei?

612
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,230
What else can I do?

613
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:35,820
You can't,

614
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,870
but your dad can.

615
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,250
I think you're thinking too much.

616
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:38,970
How is that possible?

617
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:39,720
But what if...

618
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,480
What if you tell your dad...

619
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,910
Do you think I haven't looked for him?

620
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,340
I looked for him as soon as Unit Leader Lei got into trouble.

621
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,900
But nobody can help us about this.

is a means of transportation for the people in daily life.

627
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,330
But the news of electric bike fires

628
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,350
are frequent too.

629
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,240
Batteries ignite quickly

630
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,180
and the smoke is highly poisonous, so casualties are easily caused.

631
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,650
I believe you all know it.

632
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,170
Let me emphasize on

633
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,520
four key points to prevent electric bike fires.

634
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:20,130
Firstly, do not charge the bike in the household or inside buildings.

635
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,940
Secondly, stay away from flammable and explosive products when charging the bike.

636
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,040
Thirdly, no unauthorized modifications to the bike.

637
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,850
Fourthly, keep up with daily self-inspections.

638
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,950
I hope everyone

639
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,170
can increase your awareness of fire safety

640
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,470
and prevent accidents.
