Okay.

We'll attend it on time.

Everyone.

00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,410
Fire Safety Center is coming here for fire safety training.

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,760
Why do you have to show us something so scary?

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,210
Why do I have to show you these?

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,500
Your company

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,340
has never had any fire safety training, if I may say so.

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,720
What is fire safety training for?

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,940
To enhance your fire safety awareness

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,620
and ensure your personal safety.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,500
So,

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,970
it cannot just focus on theory.

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,300
Our team sent me here

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,540
to bring you

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,180
an order list of fire protection products.

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,100
You can order them through internal channels.

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,010
There'll be more discounts for larger quantities.

21
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,370
If there's something you like, put a check mark behind it.

22
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,640
I want to buy this, this, and this.

23
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,260
If you want to purchase like this,

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,490
I suggest you get the 499-yuan package.

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,340
But of course,

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,720
if you have enough budget,

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,540
you can get the combination package for 899 yuan.

28

After all, there are more products included.

29
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,810

and requires your company to pay for training is a scammer.

Anyone who tries to sell products after training

53
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,850
in the guise of Fire Department is also a scammer.

54
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,460
Anyone who requests the fine to be transferred to a personal account

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,600
after an on-site inspection

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,270
is a scammer as well.

57

Those claiming to be plainclothes inspectors who come to threaten you

58
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,710

00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,720
[Lin Luxiao]
-Congratulations.

189
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:01,970
[Lin Luxiao]

190
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,900
-I'll leave you to it.
-acting in TV series?
[Lin Luxiao]

191
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,200
[Lin Luxiao]

192
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,280
-I have something to do at the station.
-You've already got many offers, right?
[Lin Luxiao]

193
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,290
I'll get going.
[Lin Luxiao]

194
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,760
What expectations do you have for the roles you play in the future?
[Lin Luxiao]

195
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,190
I hope I can try playing various roles,
[Lin Luxiao]

196
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,070
I hope I can try playing various roles,

197
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,330
not to be limited to one type.

198
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,970
Did you encounter any difficulties

199
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,190
during filming,

200
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,320
or was there anything unforgettable?

201
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,000
It was okay.

202
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,510
What's up?

203
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,520
Why are you still up?

204
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,540
I helped them with the shift just now.

205
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,840
What about you?

206
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,560
How did it go?

207
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,280
Coach Lin.

208
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,540
Help me, please.

209
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,850
What do you need my help for?

210
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,910
This feels so strange.

211
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,680
Everyone is staring at me.

212
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,320
I don't know what to do.

213
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,290
It's only because

214
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,010
you've received more attention, right?

215
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,520
It's a good thing.

216
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,320
Isn't it?

217
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,330
Why do you feel tired?

218
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,430
You should get back in there

219
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,770
and celebrate, right?

220
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,580
Today is your big day.

221
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,180
I'd rather be with you.

222
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,530
All right.

223
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,870
I'll chat with you for a while.

224
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,970
Let me ask you a question.

225
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,420
When we went camping last time,

226
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,100
you even had a command for taking photos.

227
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,280
Do you have any command for dating?

228
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,100
There's no command

229
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,780
for dating.

230
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,630
You are an instructor.

231
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,640
Think of something.

232
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,520
Implement fire safety regulations,

233
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,790
and carry out fire protection responsibilities.

234
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,630
What do you think?

235
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,310
What is this?

236
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,150
Another one.

237
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,400
Let me think.

238
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,180
Dating command...

239
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,750
There's no command.

240
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,520
We only have promises.

241
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,880
My life belongs to our country,

242
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,600
but my heart belongs to you.

243
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,750
Got it.

244
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,510
Keep it well.

245
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,010
Let's switch to another camera and continue.

246
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,400
Help her adjust.

247
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,540
Okay.

248
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,590
Get ready.

249
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,890
Right. Smile.

250
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,690
Smile.

251
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,780
Switch to this angle.

252
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,380
Come on.

253
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,820
Put your arm on the sofa, okay?

254
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,400
Come on.

255
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,080
Right.

256
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,920
Good.

257
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,880
Good.

258
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,680
Go on.

259
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,390
You can change a few positions.

260
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,940
Move a bit.

261
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,650
The hand.

262
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,620
Yes.

263
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,130
Right.

264
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,530
Xi Gu.

265
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,130
Dancing is better.

266
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,060
Being an artist, I have no personal space at all.

267
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,300
Come on, my beauty.

268
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,510
Stop humblebragging.

269
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,900
We'll be right there.

270
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,320
Be right there.

271
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,870
Okay.

272
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,230
What are you dawdling about?

273
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,070
Lucky Livestream is about to start at 4:30.

274
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,750
Hurry up.

275
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:48,840
Zong.

276
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,640
Can I rest in a few days?

277
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,400
Rest?

278
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,080
Your schedule is full

279
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,920
for the next two weeks.

280
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,890
Still thinking about resting?

281
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,690
Then when can I see Lin Luxiao?

282
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,290
My goodness.

283
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,590
My dear.

284
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,270
Why are you still thinking about this?

285
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,650
Do you know

286
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,500
how important it is to you

287
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,220
that your career is taking off?

288
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,160
Can't you think about it a while later?

289
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,120
Hurry up.

290
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,180
I'm not going then.

291
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,130
Nan Chu.

292
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,940
Do you know

293
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,410
what the most important thing

294
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,500
to an artist is?

295
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,020
Reputation.

296
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,250
The audience may praise you today,

297
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:30,920
saying you did a good job.

298
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,810
But they can also criticize you tomorrow,

299
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,240
saying how terrible your acting is.

300
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,510
This is called "The water that bears the boat is the same that swallows it up."

301
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,130
Since the day you chose this career,

302
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,130
your life has been settled.

303
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,490
You can't just do whatever you want.

304
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,380
Is the lesson you learned

305
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,800
from the reality show last time

306
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,270
not painful enough?

307
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,890
All right.

308
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,990
Don't be love-struck.

309
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,130
Work comes first.

310
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,290
Nan Chu.

311
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,020
Actually, I think Zong is right.

312
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,040
I can't take your side this time.

313
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,160
All right, I got it.

314
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,630
That's more like it.

315
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,560
Hurry up.

316
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,400
Let's continue.

317
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,530
[Lin Luxiao]

318
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,630
I'm free today.
[Lin Luxiao]

319
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,420
[Lin Luxiao]

320
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,060
[Lin Luxiao: I'm free today.]

321
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,560
My commercial performance today is cancelled.

322
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,650
Are you free?

323
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,290
I'm going on a mission.

324
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,170
Talk to you later.

325
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,010
Hello?

326
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,050
What took you so long?

327
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,430
Someone was following me on my way here.

328
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,900
I just got rid of them.

329
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,500
Did anyone follow you on your way here?

330
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,780
It's so hard for us to see each other.

331
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,920
But at least we're together now.

332
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,500
Is it good?

333
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,020
It just started.

334
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:16,900
Hello?

335
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,350
Now?

336
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,250
I have to go and record some lines for a movie.

337
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,140
I'll be right back.

338
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,020
Let's have dinner together.

339
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,170
Okay.

340
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,690
I'm leaving.

341
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,050
Bye.

342
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:57,640
What?

343
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,410
Have you finished writing

344
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,160
the summary report of the last competition?

345
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,760
Captain Meng is asking about it.

346
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,770
Shouldn't you be the one to write it?

347
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,150
Isn't it the instructor's job to write it?

348
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,770
Hey.

349
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,530
What a pleasant surprise.

350
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,170
Please come in.

351
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,170
Hello.

352
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,520
You're here too.

353
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,190
Come on.

354
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,780
This way, please.

355
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,770
Sorry to keep you waiting.

356
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,200
Thank you for making time to come.

357
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,700
Of course I have to come

358
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,290
and support you.

359
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:42,880
Come on.

360
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,760
This way, please.

361
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,640
Thanks.

362
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,400
Please.

363
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,520
Ms. Nan Chu.

364
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:56,990
Excuse me.

365
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,000
Excuse me.

366
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,130
Excuse me.

367
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,780
We can communicate more

368
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,790
if there's any problem about the script.

369
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,820
Nan Chu.

370
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,910
Not bad.

371
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,800
You're a superstar now. You're indeed different.

372
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,720
Am I not welcome?

373
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,520
Of course you are.

374
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,570
How can you not be?

375
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,160
Stop it.

376
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,500
I feel so uncomfortable.

377
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,510
Is anyone else here?

378
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,440
Zheng Ping is studying for his postgraduate degree.

379
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,530
Liu Xiahan

380
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,300
had a lot of fun in the crew last time, but he felt it wasn't enough.

381
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,930
So he took on a few more roles as a firefighter.

382
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:27,980
He's still on the set.

383
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,780
Oh right.

384
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,250
Yan Dai should be on her way here.

385
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,180
And...

386
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,010
She's still the same.

387
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,170
Ms. Xu.

388
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,810
Do you have any works

389
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,490
that you're about to show us?

390
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,260
I'm going to release a new single very soon.

391
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,070
I hope you can support it.

392
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,700
Hello.

393
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,690
Long time no see.

394
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,070
Why is he here?

395
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,660
Hello.

396
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,980
[Fude Group's 40th Anniversary Celebration]

397
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,770
Mr. Jiang.

398
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,530
Congratulations.

399
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,760
Long time no see. I missed you a lot.

400
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,160
Mr. Jiang, what a coincidence.

401
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,670
It seems our story isn't over yet.

402
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,060
Who asked you to come?

403
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,610
Mr. Jiang.

404
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,000
You misunderstood.

405
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,510
Just for the record,

406
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,990
I have no bad intentions.

407
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,880
It was your partner

408
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,310
who invited me here.

409
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,920
I said I don't want to come.

410
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,310
After what happened last time,

411
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,810
right?

412
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,910
Me being here

413
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,550
is a disgrace to you,

414
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,810
right, Mr. Jiang?

415
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,410
But I have no choice.

416
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,050
He invited me over and over again.

417
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,780
I couldn't turn it down.

418
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,750
Nan Chu.

419
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,180
You're very popular now.

420
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,360
Your movie was a box-office hit.

421
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,540
You became famous overnight.

422
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,590
You're a superstar now.

423
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,060
Come on.

424
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,110
Congratulations.

425
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,050
I'm your senior. You should at least greet me.

426
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,240
With so many friends and reporters from the media here...

427
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,780
Nan Chu.

428
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,710
Let's go upstairs.

429
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:22,850
Xu.

430
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,400
Xu.

431
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,580
Ran, you're here too.

432
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,470
Long time no see.

433
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,100
What?

434
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,780
Didn't you recognize me?

435
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,420
I've been saying hello to you.

436
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,850
How could that be?

437
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,360
I didn't hear you just now.

438
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,660
You called me?

439
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,720
Maybe I haven't rested well recently,

440
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,940
so my ears aren't sharp.

441
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,410
Although your ears aren't sharp,

442
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,550
it seems you're living

443
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,190
a great life.

444
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,780
If there's any chance in the future,

445
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,420
don't forget about me.

446
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,650
Ran, you can't say that.

447
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,540
With your resources in the industry,

448
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,890
you can make a comeback anytime you want.

449
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,080
Xu.

450
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,420
Have you ever thought

451
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,780
you should be the one standing there?

452
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,180
There are things

453
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,730
I don't want to point out,

454
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,660
but I really

455
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,470
can't stand it anymore.

456
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,400
I always think

457
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,460
this opportunity should have been yours.

458
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,350
You went on the show together.

459
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,570
Your performance

460
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,510
wasn't much worse than hers.

461
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,030
But why did she get to star in Director He's movie?

462
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,880
Why is she the one that gets

463
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,230
all the attention?

464
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,540
Xu.

465
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,850
If you get any chance in the future,

466
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,650
don't forget about me.

467
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,470
Yan Dai is here.

468
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,270
-Come on.
-Yan Dai.

470
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,080

471
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,780
Thank you all

472
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,620
for making time

473
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,190
to attend the 40th anniversary

474
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,870
of Fude Group.

475
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,690
Our group has been through a lot.

476
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,910
Our journey

477
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,500
hasn't been easy.

It's all thanks to your support.

481
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,170
I can say that

482
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,360
without your support,

483
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,920
Fude wouldn't be where we are today.

484
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,390
I want to take this opportunity

485
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,150
to express our sincere gratitude

486
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,870

It's also a moment for us

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,330
Now, please raise your glasses

495
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,630
to Fude Group's birthday.

496

Congratulations.

498
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,930
Make sure to watch it.

499
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,150
Pardon me.

500
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,840
Okay.

501
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,470
You've done socializing?

502
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,610
I really don't know how to socialize anymore.

503

Humblebragging again.

507
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,550
By the way,

508
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,730
when do you have time to come to my house

509
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,400
and meet my dad?

510
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,660
Meet your dad?

511
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,170
What's wrong?

512
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,140
Are you scared?

513
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,540
Don't worry.

514
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,760
My dad is always like that.

515
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,310
Besides, since my mom passed away,

516
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,150
I've been abroad,

517
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,580
and my brother has been very busy with his work.

518
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,510
My dad is just a lonely old man with no one to rely on.

519
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,860
It's understandable that he got more and more eccentric.

520
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,200
But to be honest,

521
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,590
my dad is still

522
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,850
pretty good at cooking.

523
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,320
Sure.

524
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,160
I'll go meet him.

525
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,460
I'll take that as a yes.

526
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,620
Fire!

527
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,300
Fire!

528
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,600
Fire! Run!

529
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
Fire!

530
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,510
Don't panic!

531
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,100
Run!

532
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,070
This way!

533
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,740
That way!

534
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,500
Follow the staff!

535
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,880
Take the fire exit!

536
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,350
Cover your mouth and nose!

537
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,650
Follow the staff!

538
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,250
Be careful!

539
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,420
Don't push! Be careful!

540
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,610
Hurry up!

541
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,150
Don't push!

542
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,460
Run!

543
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,400
Hurry up!

544
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,070
Director Lou.

545
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,330
Is the spot on fire confirmed?

546
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,250
Not yet.

547
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,850
We sent three teams for tackling.

548
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,280
But since the building is too old,

549
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,750
the fire facilities and guiding signs inside

550
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,670
haven't been confirmed yet.

551
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,860
We received their message, saying they're still investigating and troubleshooting.

552
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,490
It won't do.

553
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,830
The aerial ladder isn't high enough.

554
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,340
How about this?

555
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,560
I'll cooperate with Qi Huo.

556
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,530
Before the safety passages are completely blocked,

557
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,750
we'll take Yijiu up

558
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,970
and evacuate the crowd first.

559
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:51,850
Okay.

560
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,910
Report the situation at the fire scene at any time.

561
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,710
Yes.

562
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,020
An Weiren. An Weimin.

563
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,520
Here.

564
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,150
Assemble manpower

565
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,080
to evacuate the crowd.

00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,580
Yes.

567
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,550
Lei Dagang. Yu Qilei.

568
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,260
Here.

569
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,350
You two, get the fire hoses ready

570
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,610
for rescue and forcible entry at any time.

571
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,160
Yes.

572
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,540
Shiquan.

573
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,960
Get ready to tackle it from the inside at any time.

574
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,590
Yes.

575
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,660
Given the situation, we need to make more rescue plans.

576
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,810
Boss!

577
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,390
Where's Jiang Ge?

578
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:23,980
Be careful.

579
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,330
Jiang Ge!

580
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,190
Run!

581
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,850
Hurry!

582
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,450
Hurry!

583
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,060
Get the high-pressure water mist ready.

584
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,030

around 12 p.m.
[A fire broke out on the top floor of Huanyu Building. On-site rescue and fire-fighting work is in progress.]

586
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,020

589
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:04,640
We will continue to follow up and report.

590
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,540
When you have time,

591
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,220
attend more exchange meetings like this.

592
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,270
It's for your own good.

593
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,240
Captain Meng.

594
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,290
I just hate meetings.

595
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,380
You know that.

596
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,400
You are an instructor now.

597
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,780
This is your job.

598
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,330
Yes.

599
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,770
Hello?

600
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,440
Where are you?

601
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,450
Is the meeting over yet?

602
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,760
I just got off the meeting. What's wrong?

603
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,440
There's a major fire in Huanyu Building.

604
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,410
Huanyu Building?

605
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,340
Got it.

606
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,820
Those in front, be careful!

607
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,960
Those in the back, keep up!

608
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,880
Keep up!

609
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,560
Don't panic.

610
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,310
Lower your head.

611
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,360
Huang Huai.

612
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,620
Take my dad downstairs first.

613
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:01,920
Jiang Ge.

614
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,310
Where are you going at a time like this?

615
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,070
It's too dangerous.

616
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,780
I've learned fire protection knowledge,

617
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,000
so I have to stay and help them.

618
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,500
Come on.

619
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,730
Don't worry about me.

620
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,950
It's too dangerous. He's risking his life!

621
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,880
I'll send you out first.

622
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,510
What are you doing?

623
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,390
You can't be like this.

624
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,260
Keep up.

625
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,220
Those in the back, keep up!

626
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,170
Are you okay?

627
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,540
It's going to collapse.

628
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,730
Is everyone okay?

629
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,820
Are you okay?

630
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,660
Are you okay, Yijiu?

631
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:51,880
I'm okay.

632
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,260
Keep going up.

633
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,940
Those in the back, come on!

634
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:24,130
Help!

635
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,970
Get the fire hydrants connected.

636
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,840
Hold on tight.

637
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,500
Yijiu.

638
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,420
Go up and put out the open flame with me.

639
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,680
Yu. Shiquan.

640
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,490
Go search and rescue the trapped people.

641
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,040
Yes.

642
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,050
Shiquan, come search and rescue people with me.

643
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,720
Yes.

644
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:41,980
Yijiu.

645
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,080
Discharge water.

646
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,790
Okay.

647
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,070
Come on, keep up.

648
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,870
Lower your body.

649
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,630
Yan Dai, come and help.

650
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,100
Come on.

651
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,820
Nan Chu!

652
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,390
Nan Chu!

653
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,230
Okay.

654
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,450
Kick in my direction.

655
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,060
No.

656
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,690
Can't do.

657
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,150
Again.

658
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,790
One, two, three.

659
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,960
Nan Chu!

660
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,310
Nan Chu!

661
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,030
Nan Chu!

662
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,620
Over here!

663
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,580
Jiang Ge.

664
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,470
Are you okay?

665
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,650
We're okay.

666
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,670
Lin Qi got trapped and he's injured.

667
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,170
Wait for me.

668
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:21,760
Don't move.

669
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,470
Don't worry about us.

670
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,190
You go first.

671
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,330
Hurry up and leave!

672
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,170
Save people first.

673
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,800
Jiang Ge, save them.

674
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:40,910
Don't panic.

675
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,040
I know where the safety exit is.

676
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,930
Follow me.

677
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,530
Just follow me.

678
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,710
Lower your body.

679
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,630
Follow me. Keep up.

680
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,540
Hurry. This way.

681
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,580
Mr. Jiang.

682
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,760
Mr. Jiang, you can't go.

683
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,310
You can't leave us behind.

684
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,660
Nan Chu.

685
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,760
There's a hidden door behind you.

686
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,180
There is also a safe exit.

687
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,780
I'll go out and find someone to save you.

688
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,370
Okay.

689
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,210
Let's go.

690
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:09,640
The door.

691
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,430
The door.

692
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,610
Come here.

693
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,460
Lin Qi.

694
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,210
Can you move your legs?

695
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:14,630
Yes.

696
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,050
Hang in there.

697
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,270
Kick in my direction.

698
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:16,730
Come on.

699
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,740
One.

700
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,030
Xu Zhiyi!

701
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,870
Come and help.

702
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,550
Can't you tell what the priority is here?

703
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,640
I'm looking for the door.

704
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,070
Come on. Listen to Nan Chu.

705
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,290
Don't make me scold you.

706
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,050
Hurry up.

707
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:35,930
Come here already.

708
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,560
One, two, three.

709
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,450
Why do we have to listen to Nan Chu in everything?

710
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,380
If we can't find the door,

711
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,650
we'll all die here.

712
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,690
Are you okay?

713
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,570
-Let's go.
-I'm okay.

714
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,160
Let's go.

715
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,460
Let's go.

716
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,050
Go!

717
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,940
Hello, Lin Luxiao.

718
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,440
Nan Chu.

719
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,450
How is it with you?

720
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,540
What's the situation like now?

721
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,510
We're okay.

722
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,770
What do you mean we're okay?

723
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,450
We're dying. How could you say we are okay?

724
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,460
Calm down.

725
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,800
There are collapses around us,

726
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,770
and explosions.

727
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,940
The open flame is still burning.

728
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,330
Where are you now?

729
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,550
We're in the banquet hall.

730
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,480
Lin Qi's legs are injured.

731
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,200
I'm okay, Luxiao.

732
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,870
I'm okay.

733
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,050
I'll be right there.

734
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:28,720
Okay.

735
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,800
Help me find a rope.

736
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,930
I'm going down from here.

737
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,610
Xu Zhiyi, are you out of your mind?

738
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,490
Hurry up.

739
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,450
We escaped like this last time, didn't we?

740
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,080
Calm down.

741
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,620
Zhiyi.

742
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,850
We all took

743
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,030
the test of real fire, didn't we?

744
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,870
Take this as a group assessment.

745
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,800
Find the exit door first.

746
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,060
Let's go.

747
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,150
Let's go, Yan Dai.

748
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,080
Director Lou.

749
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,470
The water flow of the indoor fire hydrants

750
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,980
can't meet the fire-fighting needs.

751
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,570
Okay. You and Unit Leader Fang,

752
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,130
use the water supply from the firetrucks directly,

753
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,020
-and connect to the municipal fire pipe network.
-Keep up.

754
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,860
Keep the water supply coming.

755
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,410
Make sure there's sufficient water.

756
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,340
Got it.

757
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,160
Hurry up!

758
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,040
Come in.

759
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,850
Close the door.

760
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,530
Lower your body.

761
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,070
Hurry.

762
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:26,980
Go!

763
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,690
Hurry up!

764
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,320
Go!

765
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,070
Report, Director lou.

766
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,540
The fire suddenly got stronger.

767
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,550
The tackling is hindered.

768
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,100
We're running out of breathing apparatuses as well.

769
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,150
Copy that.

770
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,450
You two, come down first

771
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,460
and change your breathing apparatuses.

772
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,510
An Weiren. An Weimin.

773
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,600
You two, take their places

774
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,740
and keep tackling.

775
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,100
If we still can't figure out the situation of the fire scene

776
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,650
and the location of the trapped people,

777
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,670
we'll miss the golden window of rescue.

778
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,510
Keep extracting smoke.

779
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,690
Bring in more smoke extractors.

780
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,910
Use water spray to dilute heavy smoke.

781
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,170
Director Lou.

782
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,550
Director Lou.

783
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,530
The burned area in the banquet hall is too large.

784
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,790
And there are people trapped inside.

785
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,130
I'll take the internal attack team up.

786
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,640
Let's go.

787
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,190
Come with me.

788
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:26,950
Director Lin.

789
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,040
Director Lin.

790
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:28,800
I told Nan Chu

791
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,140
there's a hidden door on the 22nd floor.

792
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,490
They should be looking for it now.

793
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,240
I have a High-altitude Rescue Training certificate.

794
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,210
I'll go up with you.

795
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,050
You're not a firefighter.

796
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,180
Don't go.

797
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,610
-I can do it.
-Here.

798
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,880
You can show Lin Luxiao the way.

799
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,870
The property management of the building just brought us a map.

800
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,460
They said there's another passage on the other side

801
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,600
which isn't connected to the banquet hall.

802
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,690
Let's go up from there.

803
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,750
I'll take them to tackle from the inside.

804
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,180
Prepare a backup plan as soon as possible.

805
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,810
Check the breathing apparatuses.

806
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,160
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

807
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,630
Go!

808
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,820
Help us!

809
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,130
We're in here.

810
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,690
I can't open it from the inside either!

811
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,830
One of us is dying!

812
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,930
Hurry up!

813
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,490
I can't open it!

814
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,000
Calm down.

815
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,050
Come on, let's knock the door open.

816
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,180
One, two, three.

817
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,510
It can't be opened.

818
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,200
-Calm down.
-I can't open it from the inside either.

819
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,160
Calm down.

820
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,260
It's not opening at all.

821
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,370
Hurry!

822
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,720
What are you doing?

823
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,180
Come here.

824
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,560
I can't open it by myself.

825
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,950
But we can't leave them behind.

826
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,130
Come here and help us.

827
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,090
Nan Chu.

828
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,560
You can't even save yourself.

829
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,820
Why are you still trying to be a hero?

830
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,640
Hang in there.

831
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,400
I'm helping myself,

832
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,490
not helping you.

833
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,120
Come on.

834
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,230
One, two, three.

835
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,990
I have an idea.

836
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:58,970
Move!

837
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,740
-Step back.
-Nan Chu.

838
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,370
Gosh.

839
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,800
Come on. Are you okay?

840
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:09,930
Go!

841
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,400
Let's go!

842
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,980
Be careful.

843
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,740
Find another exit.

844
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,380
Go!

845
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,610
Up!

846
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,620
Nan Chu.

847
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,730
Nan Chu!

848
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,070
Xu Zhiyi!

849
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,810
Go!

850
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,530
Jiang Ge, where is the hidden door?

851
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,450
In a corner of the room.

852
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,540
If they aren't there,

853
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,680
they must have left.

854
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,560
Roger that.

855
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,070
Come with me.

856
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,660
Are you okay?

857
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,150
Are you okay?

858
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,910
Push!

859
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,340
You two, go out first.

860
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,690
-I never thought
-Go find someone.

861
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,080
the last person I see in my life would be you.

862
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,470
Stop talking.

863
00:36:59,470 --> 00:36:59,970
I hate it.

864
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,940
Save some energy.

865
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,600
This way.

866
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,150
Hurry.

867
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,340
[A fire broke out on the top floor of Huanyu Building. On-site rescue and fire-fighting work is in progress.]
As of now,

868
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,600
the fire in Huanyu Building is basically under control now.
[A fire broke out on the top floor of Huanyu Building. On-site rescue and fire-fighting work is in progress.]

869
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,570
The firefighters
[A fire broke out on the top floor of Huanyu Building. On-site rescue and fire-fighting work is in progress.]

870
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,500
are conducting their final search and rescue operations now.
[A fire broke out on the top floor of Huanyu Building. On-site rescue and fire-fighting work is in progress.]

871
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:19,590
are conducting their final search and rescue operations now.

872
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,750
Nan Chu.

873
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,070
Lower your head and get out.

874
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,210
Lower your body. Get out. Hurry.

875
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,480
Are you hurt?

876
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,230
I'm okay.

877
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,070
Nan Chu is inside.

878
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,010
Evacuate now.

879
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,430
Hurry!

880
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,460
Split up and search.

881
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,100
Move the things in front. Go!

882
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,540
Lin Luxiao.

883
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,150
Nan Chu.

884
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,870
Where are you pressed?

885
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,580
Legs.

886
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,220
Can you move your legs?

887
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,620
I can't hold on any longer.

888
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,720
Can you move your hands?

889
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,270
No.

890
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,700
You can't move them at all, right?

891
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,130
Yu.

892
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,900
Take a look.

893
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,030
Which side should we tear down first?

894
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,970
From here.

895
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,150
Help me down.

896
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,410
Yijiu.

897
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:47,950
Here.

898
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,260
Hold it up with a stay bar.

899
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:50,810
Yes.

900
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,190
How is it?

901
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm observing the structure below.

902
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,810
Be quick.

903
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,490
Remove the rubble.

904
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,340
Use the stay bar for support.

905
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,600
Save Nan Chu first.

906
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,620
The structure of the main body won't change much.

907
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,720
Save Nan Chu first.

908
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,470
Hurry.

909
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,030
Why do you save Nan Chu first?

910
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,290
Save me first.

911
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,180
I'm about to be squashed.

912
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,690
The rescue here is difficult.

913
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,070
If we make a mistake in the rescue,

914
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,330
we will all fall down.

915
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,130
You have no conscience.

916
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:21,640
Calm down.

917
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,180
Save me!

918
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,240
Our decision is based on the current structure.

919
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,170
This is the safest way, okay?

920
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,020
Keep the stay bar steady.

921
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,170
Lin Luxiao.

922
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,980
You're a hypocrite who pretends to serve the public for your own ends.

923
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,250
Just because she's your girlfriend?

924
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,030
Others' lives just don't matter, right?

925
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,170
Hurry up, Lin.

926
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,180
We can drag Nan Chu out now.

927
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,320
Can you do it or not?

928
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,750
Save me!

929
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,050
I can't hold on any longer.

930
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,620
Save me!

931
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,750
Lin Luxiao.

932
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,460
Don't move.

933
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,990
Please, Lin Luxiao.

934
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,800
I can't hold on any longer.

935
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,550
Lin!

936
00:39:58,810 --> 00:39:59,600
Hurry up!

937
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,650
She can't hold on.

938
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,330
One, two, three.

939
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,210
Go.

940
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:03,510
