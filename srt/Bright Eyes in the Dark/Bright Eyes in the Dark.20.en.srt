00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,750
Put it out.

192
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:37,900

193
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,410
You've passed through the obstacle area.

194
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,170
Our search area

195
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,470
is about 10 meters from front to back.

196
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,940
Search on both sides.

197
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,540
Change the water hose.

198
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,540
Our speed today is good.

199
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,880
It's a competitive speed.

200
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,190
Lou Mingye.

201
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,150
With this level of difficulty,

202
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,870
I can complete the mission even with my eyes closed.

203
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:56,880
Assistant Liu.

204
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,020
You're amazing.

205
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,910
You're undoubtedly our No. 1 fighter in our station.

206
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,040
Your spot in the special division unit is solidified.

207
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,260
Don't talk nonsense.

208
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,900
Assistant Liu is different from us amateurs.

209
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,240
Even if Director Lou invites him to join the special division unit,

210
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,000
he wouldn't want to join.

211
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,630
You're right.

212
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,150
I won't join the special division unit.

213
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,290
But I must win the first place today

214
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,470
and slap him in the face.

215
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,530
Dagang, are you ready?

216
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,580
Yes.

217
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,420
Okay.

218
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,900
Move forward.

219
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,660
Someone's injured!

220
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,800
Stand aside.

221
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,890
What do you think of their performance?

222
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,280
I think

223
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,500
they're not bad.

224
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,040
Next, I’ll announce

225
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,350
the evaluation of everyone's performance

226
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,780
in this simulated dark smoke-laden environment training.

228
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,590
Yes.

229
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,760
Outstanding performance.

230
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,780
You must be familiar with the operations

231
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,130
and kept in mind all the safety regulations.

232
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,060
It means you were fully prepared.

233
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,290
You're allowed to join the special division unit.

-Yes.
-Yes.

237
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,370
When you two were connecting the secondary search rope

238
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,880
and the main search rope,

239
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,150
why didn't the search rope stay tense?

240
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,660
Report!

241
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:20,630
Director.

242
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,180
Maybe it's because

243
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,690
the rope was entangled with the obstacles

244
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,410
and we didn't have time to sort it out.

245
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,540
That's not the reason.

246
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,310
It's a huge mistake

247
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,690
to lose orientation in a fire scene.

248
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,530

Yes.

251
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,030
You're not familiar with the operations

252
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,540
and lack awareness of the safety regulations.

253
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,920
You'll stay in Combat Unit 1.

254
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,930

Besides, Lei Dagang,

262
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,050
as the leader of Unit 2,

263
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,780
you shouldn't make such a stupid mistake.

264
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,040
I'll give you another chance.

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,300
If it happens again,

266
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,820
I'll make a request to my superior

267

What did I do wrong?

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,690
As the director's assistant

278
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,870
and the leader of Combat Unit 1,

279
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,770
do you think you did well enough?

280
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,370
I did everything according to the requirements.

281
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,840
Then why didn't you immediately

282
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,520
take the initiative to build the smoke passage?

283
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,290
This was a dark smoke-laden environment.

284
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,270
From the first moment you arrived at the scene, you should have already

285
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,410
determined from which location

286
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,540
and through which way

287
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,390
the smoke should be ejected out of the fire scene.

288
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,370
The smoke will lower the visibility,

289
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,430
generate high temperature poisonous gases,

290
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,770
and accelerate the spread of the fire.

291
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,870
The correct procedure should be to eject the smoke,

292
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:00,670
enter,

293
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,380
and then search and rescue.

294
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,020

If you make the same mistake again,

297
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,670
I will also make a request to my superior

298
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,270
to cancel all your duties.

299
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,420
At the same time, as the No. 1 combat member,

306
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,480
did okay in today’s training,

Today's mission

310
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,180
exposed many problems of our station.

311
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,870
The biggest problem

312
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,600
is that the basic theoretical understanding is not solid.

313
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,110
For this matter,

314
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,050

00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,780
Didn't I just say it?

380
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,000
It's Director Lou's order.

381
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,430
Don't you think this is too...

382
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,520
too much?

383
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,290
Is that too much?

384
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,690
I think it's fair to be promoted

385
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,750
based on one's capability.

386
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,020
I've been memorizing the map of Binxi

387
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,750
that I'm almost a human map.

388
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,060
But I know I'm inexperienced

389
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,950
so I wouldn't be prioritized.

390
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,000
Isn't this my chance now?

391
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,170
I also want to seize it.

392
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,270
I asked Director Lou.

393
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,290
Members from the driving unit

394
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,510
are also eligible to join the special division unit.

395
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,640
But there's only one spot.

396
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,770
Unit Leader Fang.

397
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,910
To be honest,

398
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,920
I want to surpass you this time.

399
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,820
It's good for young people to be enthusiastic.

400
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,910
But don't

401
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,000
be too ambitious.

402
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,600
Drive the car

403
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,650
well first.

404
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,620
Got it.

405
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,610
Mom.

406
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,280
Which hospital?

407
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,630
Okay, I'll be right there.

408
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,050
What...

409
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,020
What's wrong?

410
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,240
My mom

411
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,300
said my grandpa fell and was sent to the hospital.

412
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,770
Go now.

413
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,310
Later, I'll...

414
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,400
I'll help you...

415
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,540
Apply for a leave for me.

416
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,800
Yes.

417
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,270
Be careful.

418
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,570
Assistant Liu, what's wrong?

419
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,620
I'm so annoyed.

420
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,050
I'm going to explode.

421
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,310
In the activity room,

422
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,110
everyone's studying.

423
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,820
In the dormitory,

424
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,790
everyone's studying.

425
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,010
Everyone's studying everywhere.

426
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,280
I'm so annoyed.

427
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,910
Don't stop me.

428
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,170
Today, I'm going to speak my mind.

429
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,180
I'm not even allowed to rest during my break.

430
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,820
What's the use of just memorizing this?

431
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,240
Lou Mingye.

432
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,540
As our leader today...

433
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,180
Stop talking so much.

434
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,090
I'll shut up just for you.

435
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:55,970
Calm down.

436
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,920
I think this is good.

437
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,150
I've watched some firefighting training abroad.

438
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,370
This is how they do it.

439
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,540
That's abroad.

440
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,380
Can they compare to us?

441
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,220
Are their performance records better than ours?

442
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,360
Stop talking so much.

443
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,320
Assistant Liu.

444
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,630
I also think it's quite interesting.

445
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,730
The changes that Director Lou are implementing is beneficial

446
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,730
to our station.

447
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,000
Updating the equipment is helpful for our rescue work.

448
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,560
It can reduce casualties.

449
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,460
You didn't sleep either?

450
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,470
Were you busy memorizing?

451
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,870
I've been memorizing all night.

452
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,170
I was memorizing.

453
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,600
Have you memorized everything?

454
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,710
I'm a gone case.

455
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,840
More or less.

456
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,730
How about I sit next to you later?

457
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,870
Screw you.

You have 30 minutes left.

H-How was it?

464
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,850
Did you answer everything?

465
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,770
Yes.

466
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,400
It wasn't difficult.

467
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,300
I heard you on the phone yesterday.

468
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,260
Is the elder okay?

469
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,690
Yes.

470
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,400
Everything is settled.

00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,460
Then, Qi Huo...

Well,

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,320
do you have

474
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,240
some spare money?

475
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,630
What's wrong?

476
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,520
Something happened at home.

477
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,120
Didn't I invest all my money in wealth management products?

478
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,180
I can't withdraw that.

479
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,150
Sure.

480
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,940
Let me check.

481
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,190
How much do you need?

482
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,950
5,000 is enough.

483
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,180
Sure.

484
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,630
I've transferred it.

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,560
It's fine.

490

There's no need for that.

Move forward a little more.

494
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,760
Isn't there a marking on the floor?

495
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,640
Get to the position.

496
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,480
That's it.

497
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,450
Let's have another take.

498
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,480
Three, two, one, action.

499
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,590
Cut.

500
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,610
Actress, pay attention to your positioning

501
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,030
and your emotions.

502
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,970

505
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,550
You never get to the right position every time.

506
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,150
Look at where the male actor is.

507
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,790
Sorry, director.

Sorry.

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,960
Sorry.

511
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,330
Her image is ruined.

512
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,050
To think I used to like her so much.

513
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,070
Does she think she can act just because she's done a variety show?

514
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,750
She's worse than my dog.

515
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,130
Look at her acting.

I have to show you a video.

529
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,150
Are you referring to this?

530
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,080
You've already watched it?

531
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,870
Director Lu scolded me viciously.

532
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,380
I didn't expect

533
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,650
that this leaked news would spread online so quickly.

534
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,300
Nan Chu is a rookie after all.

00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,390
What everyone's saying

536
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,520
is too harsh.

If you want to wear a crown,

538
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,670
you must bear its weight.

539
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,900
The audience doesn't think like us.

540
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,830
Maybe their expectations were too high.

541
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,020
Do you think

542
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,540
we rushed into it?

543
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,730
Well,

544
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,650
what should we do now?

545
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,090
Let's suspend all her future work for now.

546
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,690
Okay.

549
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,080
No, I just got off work.

550
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,180

No.

00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,320
Okay.

567
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,800
I'll order them for you.

568
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,660
After this meal,

569
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,880
we don't have to eat for the rest of the week.

570
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,150
Okay.

571
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,370
Why are you looking at me like that?

572
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:50,920
I like you.

573
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,220
Do I look like I'm in a bad state?

574
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,730
You look good.

575
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,110
You're still a pretty lady.

576
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,440
You've watched that video too?

577
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,460
I've watched it.

578
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,770
Isn't it embarrassing?

579
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:19,770
I think it's normal.

580
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,360
I'm not embarrassed.

581
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,760
I think I really don't know how to act.

582
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,610
I have no talent for acting at all.

583
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,130
When I stand in front of the camera,

584
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,060
I don't know where to look

585
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,700
and I don’t know where to put my hands.

586
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,940
Coach Lin.

587
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,410
I think what I’m doing now

588
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,880
is meaningless.

589
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,030
You want to give up so soon?

590
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,200
This is just the first time.

591
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,340
It's just the beginning.

592
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,810
It's always the hardest in the beginning.

593
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,210
When I was doing interviews

594
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,520
for your show at my station,

595
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,860
I was always at a loss.

596
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,160
It's the same for everyone.

597
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,680
Everyone has to go through this process.

598
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,060
Right?

599
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,250
Don't think too much.

600
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,720
Today,

601
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,400
let's eat happily.

602
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,070
Okay?

603
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,740
Thank you.

604
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,180
I wish that you'll get better and better.

605
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,910
This place

606
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,610
is like me and my brother's kindergarten.

607
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,950
Kindergarten?

608
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,640
When we were little, we used to hang out

609
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,190
and play here every day.

610
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,500
Back then, I was afraid of the evening.

611
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,140
Because every evening,

612
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,860
other kids' moms would call them

613
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,870
to go home for dinner.

614
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,260
We

615
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,150
were like two wild kids

616
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,660
who had to continue playing here.

617
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,640
There weren't these floors paved here then.

618
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,570
My brother and I were barefoot

619
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,750
with just slippers

620
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,760
and played by stepping in the water

621
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,180
and would end up with mud all over.

622
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,700
We'd get beaten up when we got home.

623
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,750
After I got beat up,

624
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,560
I had to take the beating for my brother.

625
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,160
So righteous.

626
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,710
As an older brother,

627
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,550
I have no choice.

628
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,150
This slide...

629
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,220
Guess how old it is.

630
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,400
Compared to me?

631
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,370
It's older than you.

632
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:06,920
Really?

633
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,930
It used to be an important tool for me then.

634
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,610
We used it

635
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,920
to simulate a fire station every day.

636
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,360
We act like firefighters dispatching every day

637
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,530
and slid down from above.

638
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,250
One day, Lin Qi said

639
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,140
that we should act out a sacrifice

640
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,570
and my mom heard it.

641
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,830
So I got beat up again.

642
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,630
Because she said it was unlucky.

643
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,940
Why do you always talk about your mom

644
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,160
but not your dad?

645
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,340
I don't have

646
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,270
much of an impression of my dad when I was a kid.

647
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,490
Because he was a firefighter,

648
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,130
I hardly got to see him.

649
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,190
He always made appointments with me

650
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,570
but then always stood me up.

651
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,610
This area

652
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,710
used to be a firefighters' family home.

653
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,340
The biggest feature

654
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,150
is that the children are all closer to their mothers.

655
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,630
Because they don't see their dads much in a year.

656
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,350
One Spring Festival,

657
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,420
my mom asked me to deliver dumplings to my dad.

658
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,310
I was afraid that the dumplings would get cold,

659
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,690
so I ran all the way

660
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,460
to my dad's fire station.

661
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,390
Once I got to the entrance,

662
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,900
I saw my dad

663
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,200
leading others on a mission.

664
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,890
I remember back then, my dad

665
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,320
just took a glance at me

666
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,660
and didn't say anything.

667
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,900
I was calling out for him at the side,

668
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,410
but I think he didn't hear me.

669
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,770
Then I chased after them

670
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,490
and kept running

671
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,830
until I reached a community.

672
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,640
I heard someone crying from afar.

673
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,360
It was until I got close that I saw

674
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,080
two kids

675
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,850
who crawled up the roof and couldn't get down.

676
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,910
That was when I understood

677
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,220
that it wasn't that my dad didn't want to be with me.

678
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,650
Whenever he stood me up,

679
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,340
he was accompanying those who needed him more.

680
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,330
At that time, I thought my dad was a hero.

681
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,970
So from then on,

682
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,230
I decided that I wanted to become a firefighter

683
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,040
when I grow up.

684
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,640
Isn't it silly?

685
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,120
No.

686
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,420
I think it's very cute.

687
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,150
Then why do you like dancing?

688
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,190
Me?

689
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,300
When I was young,

690
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,400
I practically lived in the Children's Palace.

691
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,180
Other kids had parents taking care of them,

692
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:16,810
but I didn't.

693
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,500
So I felt especially inferior.

694
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,360
At that time, a new dance teacher came.

695
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,340
I think the music she played was especially good

696
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,900
and her dancing was beautiful.

697
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,630
But my mom didn't allow me to dance.

698
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,060
So I had to watch secretly.

699
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,340
Once, after dance class was over,

700
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,940
the teacher forgot to lock the door,

701
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,530
so I sneaked in.

702
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,790
Because no one was there,

703
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,770
I blasted the music

704
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,700
and danced crazily.

705
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,800
Actually, I couldn't dance at all.

706
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,350
But when the music is on,

707
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,240
my mind went blank.

708
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,760
I just danced however I wanted,

709
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,400
until I couldn't dance anymore.

710
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,370
Then, I'd lie down on the floor and rest.

711
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,220
Although I was very tired,

712
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,650
I was very happy.

713
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,170
When I dance,

714
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,850
the surroundings become blur

715
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,160
and all my energy is focused on dancing.

716
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,140
It's like I'm the only one left in the world.

717
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,870
I'm always right no matter how I dance.

718
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,210
Only when I dance

719
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,200
do I feel like I'm shining.

720
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,660
You're shining now too.

721
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,470
Thank you.

722
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,220
Coach Lin.

723
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,210
Do you know

724
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,310
that today, when you told me

725
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,670
what you're doing feels meaningless,

726
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,400
I was really afraid.

727
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,670
Because if you

728
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,730
lose interest

729
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,170
in something that you like,

730
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,810
the future will be very hard to endure.

731
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,630
People say that you're bad at acting,

732
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:00,980
so you feel sad

733
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,110
and you take it to heart.

734
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,920
What if they say you're bad at dancing?

735
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,720
What will happen then?

736
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,240
Don't you think they are too ignorant

737
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,130
and ridiculous?

738
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,180
Right?

739
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,790
Everything starts from scratch.

740
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,800
It's normal to be bad at first.

741
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,530
Work hard consistently

742
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,370
and develop gradually.

743
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,260
If you do well from the beginning,

744
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,620
then wouldn't those who have been working hard in the industry

745
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,640
become fools?

746
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,800
Just work hard.

747
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,220
You'll get better.

748
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,870
Don't lose hope in the direction you chose.

749
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,050
As long as you have expectations for it,

750
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,900
it will reward you.

751
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,590
You can listen to the voices outside,

752
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,860
but in the end,

753
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,240
you have to walk your own path.

754
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,300
Hang in there.

755
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,370
If you are afraid of walking alone,

756
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,590
I’ll go with you.

757
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:58,850
Coach Lin.

758
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,420
I think you are like a volcano.

759
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,490
You look tall and insurmountable.

760
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,720
But in fact, there is a little sun in your heart.

761
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,240
By your side,

762
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,460
the whole world will be bright.

763
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,420
I've suffered a lot before.

764
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,100
But you

765
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,410
are like a piece of candy bestowed upon me from the world.

766
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,890
Is it sweet?

767
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,180
This is good.

768
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,870
I like this one.

769
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,590
What is it called in Southeast Asia?

770
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,400
It's called Sawadikap.

771
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,740
Nan Chu.

772
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,080
[Nan Chu]
Nan Chu.

773
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,250
[Nan Chu]

774
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,050
What's up?
[Nan Chu]

775
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:37,210
[Nan Chu]

776
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,100
Hello, Mr. Han.
[Nan Chu]

777
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,680
[Nan Chu]

778
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,400
I heard that the company
[Nan Chu]

779
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,240
canceled my work for the next two weeks.
[Nan Chu]

780
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,830
canceled my work for the next two weeks.

781
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,560
Can I discuss about

782
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:44,730
not having any work arranged for me

783
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,160
for the next few months?

784
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,250
Nan Chu.

785
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,470
Don't be spiteful.

786
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,770
I'm not.

787
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,740
Nan Chu.

788
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,380
The company has signed you on.

789
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,060
If you can't bring business value to the company,

790
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,240
why would we sign you on?

791
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,870
Well,

792
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,540
I mean...

793
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,510
Let me tell you.

794
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,700
I personally think that you have great potential.

795
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:03,460
Well,

796
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,270
Flaming Youth

797
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,450
proved that I'm right.

798
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,850
You have a lot of room to improve in the future.

799
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,790
I know that you might not

800
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,350
want to be an actor.

801
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,770
Right?

802
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,740
But think about it.

803
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,750
With your current income,

804
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,100
you can't support

805
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,780
the expenses of Dream Dance Club.

806
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,040
Just think of it as making money,

807
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,900
and doing what you don't like for your dream.

808
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,450
I think it's worth it.

809
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,720
Yeah, it’s not shameful to make money.

810
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,070
Mr. Han.

811
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,870
Zong.

812
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:34,920
Don't tell me you think

813
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,690
I'm just going to quit?

814
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:37,900
Is that not it?

815
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,880
Of course not.

816
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:40,420
I know that my acting

817
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,520
[Nan Chu]
I know that my acting

818
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,110
requires a lot of improvement.
[Nan Chu]

819
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,870
So
[Nan Chu]

820
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,540
I signed up for Professor Jin Kexi's
[Nan Chu]

821
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,210
I signed up for Professor Jin Kexi's

822
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,390
acting training course.

823
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,480
But this class

824
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,540
will take at least two months to finish.

825
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,220
So I want to ask for a leave from the company.

826
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,890
Can I?

827
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,320
Sure.

828
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,410
Of course.

829
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,050
You want to improve yourself?

830
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,220
That's great.

831
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,200
The company will fully support you.

832
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,710
Let me tell you.

833
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,690
Mr. Jin is very famous in the industry.

834
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,130
You must seize this opportunity.

835
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,390
Thank you, Mr. Han.

836
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,230
I will work hard.

837
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,150
Okay.

838
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,260
Do you know why I like this kid?

839
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,100
Why?

840
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,620
I like this kid's spirit.

841
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,840
She never gives up.

842
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,160
These two

843
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,300
have really similar tempers.

844
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,780
Who?

845
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,490
I meant that Mr. Jin has a bad temper.

846
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,210
I wonder if Nan Chu can handle it.

847
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,140
Yes.

848
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:39,850
All right.

849
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,480
Okay.

850
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,240
We'll take her.

851
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,780
Okay.

852
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,000
Sawadikap.

853
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,590
We'll take her.

854
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,600
Okay.

855
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,440
She's good.

856
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:45,730
Okay.

857
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,150
Nan Chu is going to

858
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,320
attend Jin Kexi's acting class.

859
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,460
[Han Beiyao]
attend Jin Kexi's acting class.

860
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,870
[Han Beiyao]

861
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:07,950
[Nan Yueru: You signed her up?]

862
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,710
[Han Beiyao]

863
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,010
She signed up for it herself.
[Han Beiyao]

864
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,280
[Han Beiyao]

865
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,860
[Nan Yueru: Haha]

866
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,370
[Blessing]

867
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,380
Yang.
[Blessing]

868
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,190
[Blessing]

869
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,950
Yang!
[Blessing]

870
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,240
[Blessing]

871
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,560
Director Lin.

872
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,490
You're here?

873
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,710
You're here.

874
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,470
Come in.

875
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,600
I bought some things for you from downstairs

876
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,360
and I'm bringing them to you.

877
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,450
I'll leave them here and go back to the station.

878
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,080
Why are you going back?

879
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,500
It's just right.

880
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,210
The rice is just done.

881
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:46,760
Hurry up.

882
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,720
Come on, let's eat.

883
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:48,940
Try it.

884
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,660
It's all her cooking.

885
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,130
Not bad.

886
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,440
Enjoy your meal.

887
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,360
I have to go to work.

888
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,660
You haven't finished yet.

889
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:56,840
It's too late.

890
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,640
I can't be late.

891
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,160
A few more bites won't make a difference.

892
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,120
Well...

893
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,360
I'll put the medicine here.

894
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,830
Take it half an hour after dinner.

895
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,500
Don't forget.

896
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,590
Okay.

897
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,390
After eating,

898
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,140
leave the bowl there.

899
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,320
I'll come back to wash it tonight.

900
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,170
I'm leaving. Have a good chat.

901
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:12,840
Don't worry.

902
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,640
I'm here.

903
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,490
I heard from the weather forecast that it'll get cold tonight.

904
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,630
Wear more layers.

905
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:18,930
Got it.

906
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,700
Bye.

907
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,130
Bye.

908
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:30,310
Wait.

909
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,960
Don't think too much.

910
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,260
It's not what you think.

911
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,390
Look at my state.

912
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,020
How can I...

913
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,910
She means well.

914
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:38,800
She...

915
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,200
She's good at cooking.

916
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:42,740
Yes.

917
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:43,960
It's nice.

918
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,090
This road

919
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,940
will only get smoother in the future.

920
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:50,510
You...

921
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,030
Can you stop bringing the topic to me?

922
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,700
Lin Luxiao.

923
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,340
What about you?

924
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,770
How have you been lately?

925
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,780
Me?

926
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,170
I'm very happy for you lately.

927
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,120
I'm at the Fire Investigation Department every day.

928
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,050
I've gotten used to it.

929
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,200
You...

930
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,010
Don't think I know nothing.

931
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,650
I heard everything.

932
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,800
Lou Mingye set up some special division unit, right?

933
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,430
Only excellent people

934
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,780
can join.

935
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,130
Those who don't perform well will be punished.

936
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,270
Everyone is in panic now.

937
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,500
Besides,

938
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,480
he came to me.

939
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,910
What do you think?

940
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,560
It doesn't matter what I think.

941
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,870
You two...

942
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,470
There's really nothing between us.

943
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,650
We just

944
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,920
have some different opinions.

945
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,990
Then do you really have no opinions about this?

946
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,110
Actually, I can understand him.

947
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,080
You understand?

948
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:51,710
Yes.

949
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,180
Just like us, Lou Mingye

950
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,490
has also been through a lot.

951
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,500
There were people he couldn't save

952
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,560
and lost comrades who were close to him.

953
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,080
Sometimes, it's not enough

954
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,940
to give your all based on human capability.

955
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,280
He thinks

956
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,170
that only with new technology,

957
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,220
new equipment.

958
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,140
new concepts,

959
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,500
and strict daily training

960
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,100
can the risks be minimized.

961
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,440
But he's not wrong either.

962
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,930
As long as it's for the good of the Heping Road Special Division Station,

963
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,110
I'll agree with it.

964
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,960
What do you think about it,

965
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:24,800
Instructor Yang?

966
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,860
What else can I think?

967
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,800
I have similar opinions as you.

968
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,820
But

969
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,240
I still think

970
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,500
something is off.

971
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,100
But I don't know what exactly.

972
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,960
Actually, I think

973
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,950
Heping Road Special Division Station

974
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,050
still needs you.

975
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,200
All right.

976
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,290
Let's not worry about it.

977
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,180
Have you finished?

978
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:51,810
Yes.

979
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,070
I'll get you some water for you to take the medicine.

00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,520
Where am I?

982
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,660
Take a look by yourself.

983
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,350
Qi-Qi Huo is really something.

[Basic fire rescue theoretical knowledge mock exam paper results]

987
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,340
He's in the first place.

988
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,640
He's impressive.

989
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,700
Shiquan did well too.

990
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,170
And Zheng Yang.

991
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:16,540
Where?

992
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,850
Zheng Yang did well too.

993
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,980
Here.

994
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,320
82 points?

995
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,330
You got 82 points?

996
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,840
I still need to work harder.

997
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:23,810
All right.

998
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,400
Don't be modest.

999
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,700
Although I passed the exam,

1000
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,460
what's the use?

1001
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,090
I'm in the second last place.

1002
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,500
Liu.

1003
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,930
How can you be in the last place?

1004
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,580
Didn't we agree that at least one of us unit leaders will do well?

1005
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,210
We're screwed.

1006
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,300
We were both wiped out.

1007
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,580
I'm too lazy to memorize for that.

1008
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,840
What special division unit?

1009
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,180
I don't care.

1010
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,070
Whoever wants to go can just go.

1011
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,830
I'll give up my place to them.

1012
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,550
How noble of you,

1013
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,470
Assistant Liu.

1014
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,190
Of course.

1015
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,820
If Assistant Liu memorized it,

1016
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,420
he'd have gotten the first place.

1017
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,810
How could it have gotten to our turn?

1018
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,350
Right?

1019
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,150
Yes.

1020
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,550
Yes.

1021
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,620
You're the only unit leader left.

1022
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,210
You are the hope of our village.

1023
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,950
Where is he going?

1024
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:08,580
He went out?

1025
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,170
I don't know.

1026
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:09,840
Is he angry?

1027
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,670
Okay.

1028
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,230
Go on.

1029
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,790
Okay, stop here, Qi Huo.

1030
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:21,980
Is the position okay?

1031
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,570
Yes.

1032
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,370
Come down.

1033
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,150
I'll start filming.

1034
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,800
Look, aren't I handsome?

1035
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,140
Hurry up.

1036
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,190
No matter how handsome you are, you're nothing compared to the truck.

1037
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,160
Come over here.

1038
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,630
I'll start filming.

1039
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,940
Now, let's welcome

1040
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,250
Heping Road Special Division Station's firefighter Shao Yijiu

1041
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,550
to explain

1042
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,600
how we usually

1043
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,690
operate our firetrucks.

1044
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,180
I believe that in the movies...

1045
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,230
Louder. I can't hear you.

1046
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,050
I believe that in the movies, you've seen

1047
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,980
this type of firetruck before.

1048
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,460
Its full name is the 101-meters

1049
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,640
aerial ladder firetruck.

1050
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,740
It can lift firefighters up really high.

1051
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,220
Especially when you're in a rescue at a higher building,

1052
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,780
it's even more useful.

1053
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,740
Qi Huo.

1054
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,460
Show us the elevated platform.

1055
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,240
What are you doing?

1056
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,910
I'm not finished.

1057
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,500
Why did you stop filming?

1058
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,590
Who allowed you

1059
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,220
to drive the firetruck out without permission?

1060
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,240
Reporting to Director Lou.

1061
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,550
We wanted to film some publicity materials

1062
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,940
and contribute to the brigade's official Douyin account

1063
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,580
so that the people can better understand

1064
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,720
our new fire equipment

1065
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,140
and have more faith in our rescue work.

1066
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,750
Consolidating your technical and professional capabilities

1067
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,850
is what you should be doing now.

1068
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,670
Why are you doing all this fancy nonsense?

1069
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,010
Director Lou.

1070
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,440
This isn't fancy nonsense.

1071
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,530
When Director Lin was at the helm,

1072
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,580
-he encouraged us to film these.
-Reporting to Director Lou.

1073
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,720
We won't do it again.

1074
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,400
Wait, why not?

1075
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,660
Why are you giving up just like that?

1076
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,000
We're filming these videos

1077
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,930
to showcase

1078
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,440
the spirit of firefighters.

1079
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,030
We're finally getting some viewership.

1080
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,170
Why are we giving up now?

1081
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,930
At this stage, at Heping Road Special Division Station,

1082
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,240
besides training and studying,

1083
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,510
I don't want to see anything else.

1084
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:07,940
Director Lou.

1085
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:09,920
Young people

1086
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,050
have their own ideas.

1087
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:11,980
It's a good thing.

1088
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,110
You were like this back then too.

1089
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,450
Besides,

1090
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,250
this is also

1091
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,350
to promote firefighting.

1092
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:18,700
Not to mention Director Lin,

1093
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,750
but even Captain Meng also supported it.

1094
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,640
I'm fine with firefighting promotional work.

1095
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,200
But as a firefighter,

1096
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,580
professional capability is the most important.

1097
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,600
When you're dispatched, you've to be capable enough

1098
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,150
to let the general public trust you

1099
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,630
and entrust their lives to you without worries.

1100
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,700
Especially you, Shao Yijiu.

1101
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,970
After the last simulated dark smoke-laden environment training,

1102
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,360
you should be reflecting

1103
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,370
and figuring out your problems,

1104
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,220
instead of filming videos.

1105
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,840
Lou Mingye.

1106
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,150
Lin Luxiao has already left.

1107
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,420
You just want to erase all traces of him

1108
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,970
in this station,

1109
00:42:59,230 --> 00:42:59,770
right?

we need to understand what kind of behaviors

[Fire Rescue

The second kind of behavior

is the indiscriminate pulling and connecting of wires and fuses,

and resulting in a fire.

1123
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,960
The third kind of behavior is misusing electrical appliances.

1124
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,560
We need to purchase electrical and other products

1125
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,700
through legitimate channels

1126
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,050
and prioritizing maintenance and repair.

1127
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:35,680
The fourth kind of behavior

1128
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,440
is the illegal use of high-power appliances

1129
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,630
in places such as high school dormitories,

1130
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,640
where the circuits are designed according to daily lighting systems.

1131
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,710
Hence, high-power appliances can overheat the electrical wires

1132
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,930
and result in fires.
