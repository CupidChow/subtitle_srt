00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,020
was a big blow to him.

193
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,540
You can even say

194
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,660
that it completely changed his life.

195
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,380
After that earthquake,

196
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,180
there was a long period of time when he couldn't get back to his usual self.

197
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,700
You two...

198
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,180
reminded him of it again today.

199
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
You two are still young.

200
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,380
You have the spirit and desire to be a hero.

201
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,700
It's commendable.

202
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,660
But when I look back,

203
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,980
being a hero

204
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,100
is definitely not about individualism.

205
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,060
Don't forget

206
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,860
that you two are firefighters first.

207
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,660
You must follow the discipline

208
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,460
and complete your assigned job.

209
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,660
That's the most important thing.

210
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,050
As for the rest,

211
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,060
don't think about them first.

212
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,580
Thank you, instructor.

213
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,300
I get it now.

214
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,100
What about you?

215
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,740
I get it now.

216
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:28,780
All right.

217
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,060
Go on with the copying.

218
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,940
-Yes.
-Yes.

What time is it?
[Supply Depot of Blue Friends]

223
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,620
What time is it?

224
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,580
What time is it?

225
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,420
You're eating so much cold food in the middle of the night.

226
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,780
Aren't you afraid of diarrhea?

227
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,890
Zheng Yang told me that it's about to expire and he couldn't finish it,
so he asked me to come...

228
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,940
You have to eat everything that's about to expire?

229
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,610
That entire cabinet is filled with foods that are about to be expired.
Will you finish them all?

230
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,260
Director. Why don't you have a taste too?

231
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,020
Take it away.

232
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,180
Hurry up.

233
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,980
Go back to sleep.

234
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,540
Stop eating.

235
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,220
Stop eating. Throw it away.

236
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,420
Enough.

237
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,460
Stop eating.

238
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,140
By the way, director,

239
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,860
the instructor left something for you in the fridge.

240
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,620
Remember to take a look.

241
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,060
You're back.

242
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,940
Is it good?

243
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,060
This restaurant is average.

244
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,650
It's not as good as

245
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,180
the one at the intersection.

246
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,140
You're really something.

247
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,220
You got free food and you're complaining about the taste?

248
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,300
You should be thankful you get to eat it.

249
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,100
Have a bite.

250
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,860
No.

251
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,180
I don't like sweet food.

252
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,900
Let me tell you.

253
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,580
I bought this for you with my own money.

254
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,940
You'd better finish it.

255
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,020
Don't worry.

256
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,650
Whenever I eat this,

257
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,780
have I ever not finished it?

258
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,780
Going back to the topic at hand,

259
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,180
I need to talk to you

260
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,820
about Yijiu and Shiquan.

261
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,100
Yijiu is interesting.

262
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,100
He reminds me of you when you were younger.

263
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,020
As for Shiquan,

264
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:29,980
he's smart

265
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,940
and insightful.

266
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,700
I think he has the potential

267
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,260
to be a commander in the future.

268
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,460
They're still kids.

269
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,060
They're good kids.

270
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:39,930
Right?

271
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,580
They're eager to join the firefighting field.

272
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,020
Don't you agree

273
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,900
that it's normal

274
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,300
for them to be impulsive

275
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,700
sometimes?

276
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,580
Right? You have to understand their perspectives.

277
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,300
These two kids

278
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,100
were saved by firefighters.

279
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,620
So, they always feel like they owe their lives to firefighters.

280
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,420
That's a scary way to think, you know?

281
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,020
Yes.

282
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,220
Speaking of which,

283
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,340
I think it's necessary to find them a master

284
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,020
who can guide them well.

285
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,100
How about

286
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,260
you step up to the job?

287
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,100
I have to take care of the two of them alone?

288
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,060
The greater the capability, the greater the responsibility.

289
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,540
Do you think I'm very idle every day?

290
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,490
No.

291
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,940
Even if they have to be taken care of,

292
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,340
it has to at least be one for each of us.

293
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,700
That won't do.

294
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,900
They need you as a guide for professional matters.

295
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,500
Besides,

296
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,370
they may not

297
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,940
want to be instructors in the future.

298
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,380
Also, what can I teach them?

299
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,660
Right?

300
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,260
Besides, you've already eaten the cake.

301
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,180
You can't turn me down

302
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,700
for such a small matter.

303
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,220
The thing is, I have other concerns.

304
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,460
I'm not in the mood for this.

305
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,700
Let's keep them here first and talk about it next time.

306
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,820
What do you mean by keeping them?

307
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,900
Aren't they already staying in the station?

308
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,260
Forget it. The conversation's over.

309
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,620
What's wrong?

310
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,140
Is something bothering you?

311
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,300
Talk to me.

312
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,060
Lin Luxiao.

313
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,530
The relationship of a director and an instructor

314
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,340
is like a married couple.

315
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,940
There shouldn't be any secrets between them.

316
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,860
Enough. Stop nagging.

317
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,780
Hurry and go to sleep.

318
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,340
You're always acting like an old lady.

319
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,820
Wait...

320
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,610
Just tell me what's wrong.

321
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:35,940
Where are you going?

322
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:36,980
To take a walk.

323
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,820
What for?

324
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,980
What time is it already?

325
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,740
I'll take it that you've agreed to the matter about the two kids.

326
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,620
Halt.

327
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,170
-Director.
-Director.

328
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:54,700
You're here.

329
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,250
I called you here

330
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:56,940
to...

331
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,700
Director, we were wrong.

332
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,700
Yes, director.

333
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,500
We were really wrong.

334
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,460
When I was copying the manual,

335
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,660
I discussed it with Shiquan.

336
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,020
I think you're right.

337
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,180
Luckily, nothing happened this time.

338
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,380
Otherwise, not only would we not be able to save them,

339
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,580
but we would also be in danger

340
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,100
and even become a burden to others.

341
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,500
Director.

342
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,100
I was reckless in this mission

343
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,900
and even implicated Yijiu.

344
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,700
I realized my mistake.

345
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,100
It's good

346
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,700
to acknowledge your faults.

347
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,300
I called you here to tell you something.

348
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,380
There is a tradition

349
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,740
at our Special Division Station.

350
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,020
The experienced members guide the rookies.

351
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,580
Generally,

352
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,020
an old team member will guide a new team member.

353
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,860
But considering

354
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,620
that you two are in a special situation,

355
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,300
I’ve discussed it with the instructor.

356
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,730
So I've decided to personally guide you two.

357
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,380
From now on, if you have any questions,

358
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,820
just ask me directly.

359
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,180
It's the same when you're on a mission.

360
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,420
Follow me closely

361
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,020
and do as I say.

362
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:51,980
Understand?

363
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,140
Yes, Director.

364
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,340
Yes, Master.

365
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,980
Thank you, Master.

366
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,460
Thank you, Master.

367
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,420
Alright.

368
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,500
Go back.

369
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,300
Yes.

373
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,580

374
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,220
Sorry I'm late.

Mr. Jiang.

376
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,580
Welcome home.

377
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,370
It's good to be home.

It's good to be home.

379
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,540
What's so good about it?

380
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,500
I'm not happy at all.

381
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,820
Whatever. I've returned anyway.

382
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,060
Why did it take you so long?

383
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,620
Where's the car?

384
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,940
There's no car.

385
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,500
I came by subway.

386
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,900
What do you mean?

387
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,740
Mr. Jiang.

388
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,740
After your incident in Milan,

389
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,500
the chairman was very angry.

390
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,460
He thinks you need to hone

391
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,700
the way you do things.

392
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,820
Mr. Jiang.

393
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,140
What happened to you in Milan?

394
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,540
I've told you a million times.

395
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,020
I was just drunk.

396
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,900
The police took me to the police station.

397
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,180
After I sobered up from a night's worth of alcohol,

398
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,300
I was released the next day.

399
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:05,940
Nothing else happened.

400
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,700
It's that simple.

401
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:07,940
All right.

402
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,020
Stop lying to me.

403
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,340
They're all saying online

404
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,380
that when you were in Milan,

405
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,260
you were gambling,

406
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,010
involved in fraud,

407
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,420
and even used your looks for gains.

408
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,500
Who told you that?

409
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,900
That's what they say online now.

410
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,740
Find out

411
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,060
who was the one to spread those rumors.

412
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,730
Find them.

413
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,340
Okay.

414
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,730
Get a taxi.

415
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,540
Mr. Jiang.

416
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,060
I...

417
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,100
I need to take this call first.

418
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,940
Hello.

419
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,460
Mr. Ma.

420
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,580
I've checked out your artists.

421
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,700
It's...

422
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,340
too complicated.

423
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,260
Well,

424
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,220
you can learn more about our business first

425
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,820
and organize your artists.

426
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,220
That's it.

427
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,340
Bye.

428
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,100
Mr. Ma is really hard to deal with.

429
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,060
He doesn't understand what others are saying.

430
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,370
I'll call a taxi.

431
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,380
I've already done it.

432
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,820
Why is our company hiring artists?

433
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,770
It is for an event?

434
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,780
Mr. Jiang.

435
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,300
The traditional industry is not doing well now.

436
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,900
The chairman wants to transform the company

437
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,940
and enter the integrated entertainment business.

438
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,650
He even started a company for this.

439
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,820
Now that you're back this time,

440
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,340
I'm sure he wants you to take over.

441
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,780
What's integrated entertainment?

442
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,100
It sounds boring.

443
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,300
I won't do it.

444
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,730
Wait, Mr. Jiang,

445
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,340
you have no idea.

446
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,420
The company is really different now.

447
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,620
Two days ago,

448
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,860
they've just finished laying people off,

449
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,490
and now we're getting a pay cut.

450
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,500
We're just taking it a day at a time.

451
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,220
Let me see.

452
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,820
One really can't avoid one's enemies.

453
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,100
[Genius violinist, Lin Qi]

454
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,780
So your name is Lin Qi.
[Genius violinist, Lin Qi]

455
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,480
[Genius violinist, Lin Qi]

456
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,060
Nan Chu.

457
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,730
The rehearsal ended so early today?

458
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,300
Yes.

459
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,740
My friend found a good place.

460
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,660
It's an open-air stage.

461
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,500
Let's go practice dancing together.

462
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,900
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

463
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,060
Let's go.

464
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,300
Sorry, we're closed.

465
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,700
The door is still open.

466
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:28,820
Are you Chinese?

467
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,940
I'm sorry.

468
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,900
We're closed.

469
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,180
I just want a Laobing.

470
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,100
I'm sorry.

471
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,940
We're an Italian restaurant. We don't have Laobing.

472
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,620
Don't lie to me.

473
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
Don't you think I know

474
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,300
that Laobing is just the Chinese pizza?

475
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:45,970
Right?

476
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,940
Sorry, I can't make it.

477
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,620
If you don't make it for me,

478
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,140
you're looking down on me too.

479
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,340
Just like my dad.

480
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,530
You all look down on me.

481
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,370
It's fine.

482
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,740
I don't need you.

483
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,020
I can make the Laobing myself.

484
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,490
-We really can't make it.
-You can't go in.

485
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,260
We really can't make it.

486
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,260
We really can't make it.

487
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,460
I just want a Laobing.

488
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,090
Auntie, you're so mean.

489
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,620
I just want a Laobing.

490
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,660
Do you know him?

491
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,820
I don't just know him.

492
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,980
If you find him,

493
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,860
tell him

494
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,260
that we have a cooperation to discuss with him.

495
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,620
Okay, no problem.

496
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:44,810
[Fude Group]

497
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,820
What do you think of this form?

498
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,300
Look at this part.

499
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:48,980
Mr. Jiang.

500
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,180
By next week,

501
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,980
if the performance figures does not improve,

502
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,140
you can all get lost.

503
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,260
You're here doing the bare minimum every day

504
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,810
and dozing off at work.

505
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,260
The performance figures are bad.

506
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,660
What do I still need you for?

507
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:08,860
Dad.

508
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,620
You've only been abroad for a few years

509
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,620
and you already forgot that you have to knock before entering.

510
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,580
Why did you insist that I come back?

511
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,340
You can eat prison food anywhere.

512
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,380
It's the same if you have it here.

513
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,100
Don't listen to the nonsense.

514
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,180
I did nothing wrong outside.

515
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,140
I slept in the police station for a night and they let me go.

516
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,050
Really?

517
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,060
Then why don't you think about

518
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,570
why they only made up stories about you?

519
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,500
Why didn't they make up stories about others?

520
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,540
What happened to your hand?

521
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,100
Explain yourself.

522
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,780
I fell when I was canyoning.

523
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,620
I'm almost recovered.

524
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,340
Just keep wasting your time.

525
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,220
Don't always look down on me for canyoning.

526
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,580
In order to play well,

527
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,900
I even studied geography

528
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,820
and vegetation-hydrology interactions,

529
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,420
and learned how to survive in the wild.

530
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,180
I've won two swimming championships and three rock-climbing championships,

531
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,260
and even got the High-altitude Rescue Training certificate.

532
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,220
Really?

533
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,380
Then you can totally support yourself.

534
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,900
Put your feet down.

535
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,220
Put them down.

536
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,700
When I was your age,

537
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,660
I would rather go to the factory to twist screws

538
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,940
than ask for a penny from my parents.

539
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,420
It's boring if you keep saying the same thing.

540
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,260
Times are different now.

541
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,220
There are many people of your age

542
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,820
staying up to work late,

543
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,500
renting houses, and supporting their families.

544
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,330
Why don't you ask them

545
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,380
how the times are different?

546
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,340
Let me ask you.

547
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,770
Back then, why did you work so hard

548
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,340
and start such a big company?

549
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,860
I'm well-off enough

550
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,860
to choose to live in the way I like.

551
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,460
I'm not in the way of others either. Am I doing anything wrong?

552
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,810
Fine, even if I don't have money,

553
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,780
can't I pursue

554
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,860
my hobbies and dreams?

555
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,460
You...

556
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,340
Only those who are incompetent

557
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,980
speak with grandiose words.

558
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,050
Come over here.

559
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:13,980
Come over here!

560
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,290
You win.

561
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,860
Let me tell you.

562
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,140
The company is in its transformation phase.

563
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
I called you back

564
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,060
to let you take over a project.

565
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,220
Take a good look.

566
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,140
[Flaming Youth]

567
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,180
You'll be in charge of this project from now on.
[Flaming Youth]

568
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,620
[Flaming Youth]

569
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,820
The arrangements with the fire department
[Flaming Youth]

570
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,060
[Flaming Youth]

571
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,490
and the partner company
[Flaming Youth]

572
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:40,980
and the partner company

573
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,620
have been made for you.

574
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,500
A fire prevention educational special program?

575
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,220
I won't do it.

576
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,420
Even ten years ago, no one watched something like this.

577
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,220
Jiang Ge.

578
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,780
If you can't even do such a small task,

579
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,220
then you don't deserve my investment anymore.

580
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,220
Leave.

581
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,860
Leave!

582
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,730
Fine.

583
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,340
I'll do it.

584
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,330
But let me say this.

585
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,580
I'll do as I please

586
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,860
and approach it differently.

587
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:28,730
Say it.

588
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,370
Mr. Jiang.

589
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,220
I've made an appointment for you

590
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:31,940
with the violinist that you asked me to find.

591
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,060
Send me the address right now.

592
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,620
I'll be right there.

593
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,980
We've settled the rent for this year.

594
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,820
So we don't have to worry about money anymore.

595
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,900
Next, we'll focus on the preparation for the modern dance competition.

596
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,860
But we need to decide on the costumes for the competition.

597
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,330
Does anyone have any thoughts?

598
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,020
Why are you all silent?

599
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,340
What's wrong?

600
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,090
Nan Chu.

601
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,420
Are you

602
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,860
unable to dance with us from now on?

603
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,100
Of course not.

604
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,580
I'll come back whenever I'm free.

605
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,420
Nan Chu.

606
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,900
Remember us when you become famous.

607
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,220
About that, I can't promise you.

608
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,500
Look, she's already being obnoxious.

609
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,420
She's already being obnoxious.

610
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,300
How am I acting like a big shot?

611
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,500
-You are!
-You are!

612
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,900
It can be considered that you've stepped into the entertainment industry.

613
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,660
You need to give me plenty of autographed photos.

614
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,380
Your celebrity crush changes every time you watch a different drama.

615
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,940
How do I know who you want to marry the most?

616
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,810
What I want is yours.

617
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,740
Your autographed photos.

618
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,060
I can sign it for you now.

619
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:31,820
Sign it.

620
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,300
Sign my shoes.

621
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,100
Then I will never wash my shoes again.

622
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,700
Sign it.

623
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,220
I want to take a photo with the future star.

624
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:42,980
Me too.

625
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,580
Me too.

626
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,300
Hang on!

627
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,700
Nan Chu.

628
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,540
All right.

629
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,780
Remember to send it to me.

630
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,300
Okay.

631
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,490
I'll edit it for you.

632
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,140
I know you can't bear for me to leave,

633
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,980
but you know how resilient we dancers are.

634
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,060
Don't think of me signing on to a company

635
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,540
as suffering a huge injustice.

636
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,140
It's just a few years. It's decent.

637
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,140
Dancing will be my main job.

638
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,260
I won't give up.

639
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,220
Besides,

640
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,450
I have you guys

641
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,460
and Dream Dance Club,

642
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,740
so I feel very at ease.

643
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,340
We'll treat you to a meal then,

644
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,340
to celebrate you finding a side job.

645
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,940
What does everyone think?

646
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,220
That's good.

647
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,900
What do you want to eat?

648
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,780
I want to eat hot pot.

649
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,820
Hot pot again?

650
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,940
Me too.

651
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,140
You forgot to ask Nan Chu what she wants to eat.

652
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,740
I know, right?

653
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,380
Skewers.

654
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,580
That's good. We can have some beer with skewers.

655
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,330
Pick a restaurant.

656
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,260
Let's go to the place we went last time.

657
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:44,980
Let's have a look.

658
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,940
Here?

659
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,060
Is it this restaurant?

660
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,580
No, not this one.

661
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,670
I have to take this call. Carry on and pick a place.

662
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,380
This restaurant must be delicious.

663
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,180
Its rating is 5.0.

664
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
Hello, beauty.

665
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,460
I'm back.

666
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,780
Who are you?

667
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,180
Have you already forgotten about me?

668
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,060
Who treated you to Iberian ham?

669
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,380
Who taught you how to make Italian risotto?

670
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,250
Have you already forgotten about me?

671
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,420
Lin Qi?

672
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,810
You've come back to work in China?

673
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:09,980
Yes.

674
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,500
I happen to be at Jiangse Bar to discuss something.

675
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,540
I'll also be having a meal.

676
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,180
Why don't you join me?

677
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,660
Think of it as a welcome party for me.

678
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,460
Okay.

679
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:21,850
Come on.

680
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,460
This seat is taken.

681
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,300
I was the one who asked you out.

682
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:39,900
You may leave.

683
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,340
Don't you recognize me?

684
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,060
You are...

685
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,140
Let me help you recall it.

686
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,900
I asked you for Laobing in Milan

687
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,210
and you called the police.

688
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,290
I'm here

689
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,420
to have a chat with you.

690
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,820
What's wrong with wanting some Laobing?

691
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:56,780
Why did you make me

692
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,460
take the blame for those unfounded charges?

693
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,460
Back then, the police were just doing their job. We had no other choice.

694
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,460
That's it?

695
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,580
I... I have to get going.

696
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,180
W-What do you want?

697
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,020
I'm warning you.

698
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,700
There are surveillance cameras here. Don't act recklessly.

699
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,900
So what?

700
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,530
Is it illegal for us to talk?

701
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,980
Get out of the way.

702
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,380
This is a public place. Don't act recklessly.

703
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,380
It's been a long time since we've met.

704
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,980
I'll buy you a drink to catch up.

705
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,140
Look, how nice is this?

706
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,500
Have a drink and make Laobing for me.

707
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,060
What a great ambience,

708
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:45,780
right?

709
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,020
L-Laobing?

710
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,500
Do you know how to make Laobing?

711
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:50,980
No.

712
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,860
If you don't know how to make it,

713
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,740
-why are you opening...
-Stop it!

714
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,490
Everyone is here.

715
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,620
You can make Laobing together.

716
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,980
I've called the police.

717
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,060
Called...

718
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,620
Called the police?

719
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,180
I'm speechless.

720
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,580
I just want to eat Laobing.

721
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,500
Why do you keep calling the police?

722
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,340
Are you kidding me?

723
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,380
I'm wronged. It's just a misunderstanding.

724
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,570
I just wanted some Laobing,

725
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,180
but he insists that I'm from the mafia.

726
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,500
You don't have to explain it to me.

727
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:29,860
Just wait.

728
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,540
I'll let you know when the result is out.

729
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,340
W-When will you get the result?

730
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,500
What's going on?

731
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,980
They almost got into a fight because of Laobing.

732
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,180
Okay.

733
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,770
Lin Qi.

734
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,700
Lin Qi, when did you come back?

735
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,580
I didn't hear anything from your brother.

736
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,570
Sun.

737
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,060
You even know each other? Is that how it is?

738
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,810
I called your brother.

739
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,780
He'll pick you up in a while.

740
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,330
Thank you, Sun.

741
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,260
Just wait for a while.

742
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,500
Is it the especially handsome firefighter brother

743
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,780
whom you've mentioned?

744
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,180
Wait.

745
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,020
How are you talking about whether he's handsome or not at this time?

746
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,380
This is the police station.

747
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:17,580
So what?

748
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,700
We're the ones who're in the right anyway.

749
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,620
You have no idea how strict my brother is.

750
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,220
If he knows I came to the police station as soon as I came back,

751
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,540
how would I explain it to him?

752
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,380
You're right.

753
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,450
If I had known this would happen,

754
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,380
I should have just accepted to settle at the scene.

755
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,300
You finally understand what I meant.

756
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,300
Didn't I tell you

757
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,060
to just apologize to each other and end this matter?

758
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,860
Why did you have to blow things up and call the police?

759
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,540
Now you know to turn after you hit a car.

760
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340
You should have just done that earlier.

761
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:42,940
Why should he apologize?

762
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,770
Why are you pointing your nose at us?

763
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,860
If it weren't for your attitude,

764
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,890
we wouldn't have come all the way here.

765
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,460
Listen up, auntie, you should shut up right now.

766
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,300
You won't understand even if I explain it to you.

767
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,460
-Mingyang.
-Look who's here?

768
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,300
If Lin Qi weren't here,

769
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,260
you would have forgotten about me,

770
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,100
your old classmate.

771
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,300
What are you talking about?

772
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,420
You should know it even if others don't.

773
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,220
I'm a firefighter. We're no better than the police.

774
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,340
Of course I know that.

775
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:09,940
I'm just kidding.

776
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,900
Don't always be so serious.

777
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,140
How is that brat?

778
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,660
He's fine.

779
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,020
It's just young people

780
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:15,980
getting into a conflict.

781
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,780
They had a quarrel.

782
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,260
I asked them to come to the station to calm down.

783
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,820
Did he fight with anyone?

784
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,620
No.

785
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,340
Just sign him out

786
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,060
and he can leave with you.

787
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,660
I have something to attend to.

788
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,330
Let's eat together later.

789
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,100
Okay.

790
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:26,980
Thank you for going through all the trouble.

791
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,780
It's nothing.

792
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,700
Oh no.

793
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,380
He looks angry.

794
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:38,900
What should I do?

795
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,140
What should I do?

796
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:41,700
What should I do?

797
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,580
Is he your brother?

798
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,020
Yes, who else could it be?

799
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,660
Brother.

800
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,340
Impressive.

801
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,220
You just came back

802
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,980
and you want me to meet you at a place like this?

803
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,500
Brother, you misunderstood.

804
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,500
It's all their fault...

805
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,060
Shut up.

806
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,810
I can testify for him.

807
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,980
We didn't do anything.

808
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,260
He bullied us.

809
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,380
Exactly, it was all..

810
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,820
Don't talk nonsense.

811
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,020
Who bullied you?

812
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,060
Talk to the police if you need to.

813
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,220
Don't point your finger at us.

814
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,220
Who the heck are you?

815
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:15,860
Officer.

816
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,620
Jiang Ge.

817
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,100
Be good and sit down here.

818
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,180
Listen up.

819
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,820
I'll let you off just this once.

820
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,540
Officer.

821
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,460
I'm here to pick Lin Qi up.

822
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:35,940
Brother.

823
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,740
Sign here.

824
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,180
Brother.

825
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,740
And her.

826
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,060
And Nan Chu.

827
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,660
How do you know each other?

828
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,420
He saved me...

829
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,460
twice.

830
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,100
Twice?

831
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,420
[Police]

832
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,740
Are you crazy?
[Police]

833
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:53,980
[Police]

834
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,960
How can you go in there?
[Police]

835
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,300
How can you go in there?

836
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,980
It's fine. I'm already out.

837
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,700
Don't come out.

838
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,130
The paparazzi are waiting outside.

839
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,260
Why would there be paparazzi waiting for me?

840
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,540
You're thinking too much.

841
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,330
They

842
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,900
are targeting Mr. Jiang.

843
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
Mr. Jiang?

844
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,940
Jiang Ge?

845
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,740
Forget it.

846
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,250
I can't explain everything on the phone.

847
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,860
Anyway, remember this. Jiang Ge

848
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,860
likes thrills and pursuing extreme sports,

849
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,980
and his family runs a business that's involved in the entertainment industry.

850
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,980
He's sort of like an Internet celebrity.

851
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,820
He's being watched by the marketing accounts every day.

852
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,010
You just signed the contract.

853
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,340
At this critical moment,

854
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,260
you must not cause any trouble.

855
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,180
Understand?

856
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,620
Yes.

857
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,140
Nan Chu.

858
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,300
Rush back to Dream Dance Club now.

859
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,620
The pipeline next door is leaking.

860
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,660
If you don't come back soon,

861
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,060
the place will be ruined.

862
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,020
Do you want me to take you home?

863
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,060
No.

864
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:45,900
Well,

865
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,580
do me a favor.

866
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,340
There are paparazzi outside. I can't be photographed.

867
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,460
You're even being watched by paparazzi?

868
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,060
No, I'll explain it to you next time.

869
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,460
Brother.

870
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,860
Come on.

871
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,700
Thank you for today.

872
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,420
Since it's fate,

873
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,660
treat me and my brother to some supper.

874
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,180
I have something to do today. I really can't.

875
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,020
Next time.

876
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,420
Brother, please treat me then.

877
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,020
Brother.

878
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,820
Is it this one?

879
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,460
No. Jiang Ge isn't there.

880
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,100
Why isn't he coming out?

881
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,580
Let's wait a bit more.

882
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,300
What are you doing here?

883
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,860
That's Jiang Ge, right?

884
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,780
Yes, it's him.

885
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,980
Take more photos.

886
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,460
Y-You two can go back first.

887
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,500
Okay.

888
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,140
Bye.

889
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,580
How could you do this?

890
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,330
Stop taking photos.

891
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,500
Stop taking photos.

892
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,380
Let's go.

893
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,580
You like taking photos, right?

894
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,500
Get out of the car and take the photos.

895
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,380
-Mr. Jiang.
-Come on. Take the photos to my face.

896
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,740
What are you doing?

897
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,260
What are you doing?

898
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,140
Are you taking photos secretly?

899
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,220
Are you filming videos for a marketing account?

900
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,380
Come on. Film me.

901
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,100
I'm right here. Film me.

902
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,060
Are you crazy?

903
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,980
Who are you calling crazy?

904
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,540
Forget it.

905
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,460
Who are you calling crazy?

906
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,780
Forget it.

907
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:04,980
Don't run away if you're not crazy.

908
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,860
Forget it.

909
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,460
Calm down.

910
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,420
I'm crazy.

911
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,260
Do you have medicine?

912
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,060
Calm down.

913
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,580
Forget it.

914
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,060
Forget it.

915
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,540
Calm down.

916
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,420
We're in front of the police station.

917
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,060
Your shoes.

918
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,420
You're really something, Jiang Ge.

919
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:30,620
Dad.

920
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,580
You're so capable now, aren't you?

921
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,420
You played your way to the police station.

922
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,060
Is the police station fun?

923
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,700
Wait...

924
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,170
How is it?

925
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,900
It's really a misunderstanding. Let me explain.

926
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,180
Was it the chairman?

927
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,140
I'm speechless...

928
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,020
Forget it.

929
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,660
Let's go.

930
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,220
We're in front of the police station.

931
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,380
Let's go.

932
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,700
The car is over there.

933
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
Eat something, brother.

934
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,380
It was really a misunderstanding

935
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,300
that your brother ended up in the police station.

936
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,380
How could someone like me

937
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,740

How could he be distracted by romance?

956
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:36,980
Okay.

If you don't visit home,

you should at least call him.

967
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,900
I call him every week.

968

Every time,

969
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,220
he just nags.

970
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,140
You know Dad's temper.

971
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,660
Although he nags at you every day,

972
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,140
you are still the most important to him.

973
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,460

If you want to be scolded,

976
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,980
go and stay with him for three days.

977
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,900
See if he scolds you then.

978
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,580
No way.

979
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,260
Three days will be a disaster.

980
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,340
There are three men in our family and two of them are firefighters.

981
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,380
It's too intense.

I'll take a few days off work.

Of course.

Didn't I tell you?

996
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,660

the Best New Artist Award abroad?

1004
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,660
Now you're having a solo concert right after coming back.

Is that one okay?

What are the precautions for campus fire safety?

1192
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,580
Do not randomly connect wires indoors.

1193
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:46,250
Don't use high-voltage electrical appliances like electrical rice cookers or immersion heaters.

1194
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,460
Turn off the switches when there's no one in the room.

1195
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:55,420
In classrooms and laboratories, please strictly comply with all safety management regulations,

1196
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:59,300
safety operation regulations and other relevant regulations.

1197
