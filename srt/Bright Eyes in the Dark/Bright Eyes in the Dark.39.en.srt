00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,100
I knew it.

194
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,340
When Lou Mingye

195
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,780
got the shovel,

196
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,900
he pretended not to be impressed.

197
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,380
He was acting cold and serious.

198
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:52,900
In the end,

199
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,900
oh, so embarrassing.

200
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,380
I saw him

201
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,580
in his room that night,

202
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,660
secretly studying the shovel.

203
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,580
He even left the door open.

204
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,460
He's crazy about equipment.

205
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,700
He couldn't have resisted this.

206
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,820
Lin,

207
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,700
give this shovel a name.

208
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,340
Let's call it the Xuejun shovel.

209
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Xuejun shovel.

210
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,140
Good.

211
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,580
Good name.

212
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,740

213
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,020
We've been in Lushan for so long.

214
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,780
But we haven't taken

215
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,780
a proper group photo yet.

216
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,220
Why don't we take a photo together?

217
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,690
Okay.

218
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,580
Tell them to come out.

219
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,340
Let me help you.

220
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,460

Let's go.

222

Get to know each other, Assistant Liu.

223
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,620
Okay.

224

Look how you starved the kids.

225
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,820
They've lost weight!

226
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,420
What about me?

227
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,300
I don't care about you.

228
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,290
Do you know what this shovel is for?

229
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,340

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,740
But I fought

382
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,480
alongside the heroes.

383
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,730
Like!

384
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,820
This quote must not be considered tacky, right?

385
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,700
It's simple and profound.

386
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,210
It's good.

387
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,020
[Don't forget, don't miss, January 11, 1996]

388
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,820
Jun.
[Don't forget, don't miss, January 11, 1996]

389
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,420
[Don't forget, don't miss, January 11, 1996]

390
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,050
Someone has inherited your shovel.
[Don't forget, don't miss, January 11, 1996]

391
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,090
[Don't forget, don't miss, January 11, 1996]

392
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,340
Your will

393
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,580
has been inherited too.

394
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,180
Don't worry.

395
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,910
We're fine.

396
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,420
Farewell.

397
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:36,700
[Don't forget, don't miss, January 11, 1996]

398
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,940
My friends.

399
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,810
Farewell.

400
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,250
[I'm not a hero. But I fought alongside the heroes. September 9, 2022]

401
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,540
[Don't forget, don't miss, January 11, 1996]

402
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,940
Captain.

403
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,940
What are you doing?

404
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,420
I'm just going home.

405
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,450
Go back.

406
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,460
Go back.

407
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,700
Don't make it so grand.

408
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,100
I'm embarrassed to leave.

409
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,340
That means we're doing it right.

410
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,820
If you are really embarrassed,

411
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,220
you might stay.

412
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,180
Yes, Captain.

413
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,580
Why don't you think about it?

414
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,820
Stay in Lushan for another two years?

415
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,410
My heart wants to stay.

416
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,090
But my body

417
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,460
can't keep up with young people like you.

418
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,700
What are you talking about?

419
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,420
You're old and strong.

420
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,180
Oh, save it.

421
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,860
I'm only old now.

422
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,740
It's getting late.

423
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,100
If I don't leave now, I'll miss my ride.

424
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,100
Where is Wang Ben?

425
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,580
Ben left early in the morning to buy something.

426
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,100
He hasn’t come back?

427
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,300
No.

428
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:23,740
Buy something?

429
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,580
Buy what?

430
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,460
I don’t know.

431
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,220
Captain!

432
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
Where did you go?

433
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,580
What is this?

434
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,340
Captain,

435
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,980
you're leaving,

436
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,700
but I have nothing to give you.

437
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,460
These are freshly ground homegrown sweet potato flour

438
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,300
from Lushan.

439
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:44,940
It's not expensive.

440
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,700
But if you want to eat it again after leaving Lushan,

441
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,060
it'll be hard.

442
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,460
I appreciate the sentiment.

443
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,740
But I'll leave

444
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,620
the flour for everyone here.

445
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,660
We're not eating it.

446
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,380
Take it with you.

447
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,780
Why are you thinking about us?

448
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,660
We can buy them anytime we want.

449
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,380
Look at these bags.

450
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,060
They are all from my buddies.

451
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,220
I can't

452
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,740
carry the flour with me.

453
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,060
Captain,

454
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,980
what are you talking about?

455
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,420
Whatever you want to do,

456
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,220
I'll drive you there.

457
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,460
There's nothing you can't carry with you.

458
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,140
My dear mother.

459
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,900
You're breaking my heart.

460
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,700
Well said.

461
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,500
You're right!

462
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,300
You have me too.

463
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:26,900
When we get to the station,

464
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,420
Baohua and I

465
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,980
will carry these things in for you.

466
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,220
Alright, Captain.

467
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,420
Don’t hesitate.

468
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,220
Take them back.

469
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,220
Put it in the car.

470
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:43,900
Okay.

471
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,220
I'll take it.

472
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,140
Thank you.

473
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,660
Lushan

474
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,700
is in your care

475
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,700
from now on.

476
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,120
Let's go.

477
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,940
Drive.

478
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,020
Back to the station!

479
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,230
-Go!
-Hurry!

480
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,660
The mountain fire is around the Yangjiao Ridge area.

481
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,170
It's spreading southwest.

482
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,420
The wind is blowing south.

483
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,180
The nearest village in the south of Yangjiao Ridge

484
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,210
is Nongxin Village.

485
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,860
We need to dig a firebreak

486
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,460
before the fire reaches the village.

487
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,940
Then let's dig a fire canal here

488
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,660
and build a firebreak.

489
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,980
According to the villagers,

490
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,260
the fire is not very strong right now.

491
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,940
The wind is not very strong either.

492
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,180
We should be able to control the fire here.

493
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:58,700
Okay.

494
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,900
After building a firebreak here,

495
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,700
even if the fire isn't extinguished,

496
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,690
we can retreat here

497
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,180
and dig the second fire canal

498
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,660
to ascertain everyone's safety.

499
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,380
Okay.

500
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,740
Let's split up.

501
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,220
You lead the team to dig the fire canal.

502
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,900
I'll go to the watchtower to check the fire.

503
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,420
Zhao.

504
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,060
Don't say it.

505
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,980
I know what you want to say.

506
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,700
Just let me stay on this last duty.

507
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,290
Let's go.

508
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,260
Zhao!

509
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,740
Where are you?

510
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,780
I'm halfway there.

511
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,260
When I climbed the watchtower in the past,

512
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,180
it only took half an hour.

513
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,540
Now,

514
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,780
I have to accept that I've grown old.

515
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,220
How is the temperature over there?

516
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,300
It's fine for now.

517
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,300
43 degrees Celsius.

518
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:14,980
Okay.

519
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,220
If something happens,

520
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,700
contact me anytime.

521
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,420
Got it.

522
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,260
I'm going up the mountain.

523
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,210
Guys!

524
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,140
Climb the mountain.

525
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,460
Get to work.

526
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:25,860
Master.

527
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,900
It's not ten o'clock yet

528
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,740
but it's already so hot.

529
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,980
If you have time to complain,

530
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,420
dig faster.

531
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,300
Put out the fire and take a shower later.

532
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:32,700
Okay.

533
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,220
Hurry.

534
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,660
Okay.

535
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,020
Alright.

536
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,460
Pour oil.

537
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,740
Prepare to ignite.

538
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,500
Stop.

539
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,940
Very good.

540
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,620
Nan Chu is done.

541
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,980
-Attention all departments.
-Good work.

542
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,210
Get ready for the next scene.

543
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:16,700
Have some water.

544
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,220
Thank you.

545
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,860
Why is it so hot today?

546
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:20,740
Yes.

547
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,700
I saw the weather forecast yesterday.

548
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,380
It shouldn't have been hotter than 31 degrees Celsius today.

549
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,660
It's not noon yet.

550
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,450
Why is it so hot?

551
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,900
By the way, Nan Chu,

552
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,900
have you seen Yijiu and Shiquan's public Weixin account?

553
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,180
They have to walk

554
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,380
for dozens of kilometers every day.

555
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,860
Do you think Sergeant Lin

556
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,420
was here?

557
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,460
Nan Chu.

558
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,180
Since we have

559
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,660
finished the shooting in Lushan,

560
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,420
there won't be any plans tomorrow.

561
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:44,860
How about

562
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,020
we go around here tomorrow

563
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,900
and relax.

564
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,220
Right?

565
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:48,980
Sure.

566
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,780
Why do I smell smoke here?

567
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,420
Is there?

568
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,140
I think someone is smoking

569
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,220
Zong.

570
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,780
Tell the producer on set.

571
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,780
Fires start easily in the mountains.

572
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,740
Don't smoke no matter what.

573
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,140
Okay.

574
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,740
Let's get changed.

575
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,850
Okay, let's go.

576
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,260
Alright.

577
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:21,740
Jiu.

578
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,020
Take two people to check the fire spot.

579
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,080
Yes.

580
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,610
Everyone else, take a rest on the spot.

581
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,300
Zhao,

582
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,700
your career

583
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,660
has temporarily come to a perfect end.

584
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,180
Is the fire under control?

585
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,450
Yes.

586
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,700
It should be extinguished soon.

587
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,460
Don't worry.

588
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,980
Check carefully after it's out

589
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,700
and see if there are any smoldering spots.

590
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,620
I'm almost at the watchtower.

591
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,020
Keep in touch.

592
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,980
Got it.

593
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,980
Don't worry.

594
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,380
Okay.

595
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,130
Take a break, everyone.

596
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,460
When the fire goes out,

597
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,380
we'll extinguish any smoldering spots

598
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,540
and then go home for lunch.

599
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,620
Captain,

600
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,700
we gave you a perfect retirement operation.

601
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,770
Aren't you going to reward us?

602
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,180
You little brat.

603
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,960
Do you need a reward for doing your job?

604
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,500
Since you're not leaving,

605
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,460
Just be our chef again.

606
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,610
What do you want to eat?

607
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,450
Tell me.

608
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,780
Captain Zhao.

609
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,700
I want to eat stir-fried bamboo shoots.

610
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,130
I want braised pork.

611
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,980
Okay.

612
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,980
Braised pork.

613
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,860
Stir-fried bamboo shoots.

614
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,500
Consider it done.

615
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:42,980
What's wrong, Lin?

616
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,660
You don't want to leave Zhao?

617
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,500
He doesn't miss Zhao.

618
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,660
He misses his girlfriend.

619
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,860
His girlfriend is filming in Lushan these days.

620
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:53,770
Master.

621
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,460
I saw Nan Chu's WeChat Moments when I left.

622
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,500
Although they are

623
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,540
filming in Yangjiao Ridge,

624
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,940
it's in the northwest area.

625
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,020
It's a good distance away from here.

626
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,660
Don't worry.

627
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:02,940
That's right.

628
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,540
The fire is dying out.

629
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,700
Don't worry.

630
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,700
I just feel uneasy somehow.

631
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,740
Wait.

632
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,450
I think the wind direction has changed.

633
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,220
Oh no.

634
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,140
The wind direction has changed.

635
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,900
Zhao! Zhao!

636
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,540
Zhao.

637
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,220
What's going on?

638
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,500
The thermometer shows

639
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,460
there's a reignition in the north of Yangjiao Ridge.

640
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,740
And the wind direction has changed.

641
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,620
The fire is going north.

642
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,380
If the wind direction and speed persist,

643
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,700
the villages in the north of Yangjiao Ridge are in danger.

644
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,460
The wind is getting stronger.

645
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,620
The fire will probably grow stronger.

646
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,730
Hurry up

647
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,180
to the north of Yangjiao Ridge.

648
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,500
I'll be right there.

649
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,300
Copy that.

650
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,700
Let's go to the north of Yangjiao Ridge immediately.

651
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,300
Extinguish the smoldering spots

652
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:16,860
and let's go.

653
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,430
Yes.

654
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,460
Fire!

655
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,980
Come and have a look.

656
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,740
Director.

657
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,300
Oh no, it's a mountain fire!

658
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,420
What?

659
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,700
Director.

660
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,380
There's a mountain fire nearby.

661
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,020
We need to go now.

662
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,220
It's not necessarily a fire, right?

663
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,420
The temperature is so high now

664
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,220
and there is smoke everywhere.

665
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,660
By the time we see fire, we'll be trapped here.

666
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,060
Hurry up.

667
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,700
Pack your things.

668
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,300
Hurry up.

669
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:48,940

670
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,740

671

Okay.

673
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,780
Let's go.

674
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,220
Everyone, move.

675
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,780
Leave your things behind.

676
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,420
Run!

677
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:57,900
Go!

678

679
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,260
We're not shooting anymore today.

680
00:27:59,300 --> 00:27:59,980
Stop shooting.

681
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,780
Wrap up, wrap up!

682
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:12,740

683
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,260
Get in.

684
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:13,700
Hurry!

685
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:16,660
Let's go.

686
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,420
How is it?

687
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,220
Almost 70 degrees Celsius.

688
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,780
What should we do?

689
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,220
The wind

690
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,980
is getting stronger.

691
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,980
The fire might get bigger.

692

Let's go up

693
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,860
and see if we can control it.

694
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:55,860
Let's go.

695
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:56,980

698
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,460
We can't go any further.

00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,460
Get in.

760
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,830
Sorry.

761
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,710
The number you have dialed is not available.

762
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,300
Please try again later.

763
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,140
Nan Chu.

764
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,220
Have you contacted Sergeant Lin?

765
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,220
Still no signal.

766
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,780
Sorry.

767
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,640
The number you have dialed is not available.

768
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,990
Please try again later.

769
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:30,700
Zong.

770
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,980
Give me the walkie-talkie.

771
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,940
Tune in to the public channel and seek help.

772
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,220
Can anyone hear me?

773
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:38,980
We've encountered a mountain fire.

774
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,220
Can anyone hear us?

775
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,260
We've encountered a mountain fire.

776
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,460
We're near Yangjiao Ridge.

777
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,620
Answer if you hear me.

778
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,170
Please try again later.

779
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:50,740
What's wrong?

780
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,300
I have a friend working in Lushan.

781
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,980
I can't get in touch with her. I'm worried.

782
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,860
That's not a friend.

783
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,300
She's Master's girlfriend.

784
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,140
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

785
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,450
I should have asked you to leave first.

786
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,220
The scenery area

787
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,940
is in the northwest of Yangjiao Ridge.

788
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,700
You could have found her along the way.

789
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,300
There's a fire canal we dug in the west.

790
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,980
Besides, there is a firebreak

791
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,220
outside the scenery area.

792
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,740
There are cement roads inside.

793
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,380
You can come out if you're driving.

794
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,940
Our priority now

795
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,180
is to find Zhang's family.

796
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,940
Can anyone hear me?

797
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,020
We've encountered a mountain fire.

798
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,980
We're near Yangjiao Ridge.

799
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,140
Can anyone hear me?

800
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,680
Hello, is anyone there?

801
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,020
It's too late.

802
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:07,940
Put on your equipment.

803
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,620
Get off.

804
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,460
Notify everyone.

805
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,620
There's a stream here.

806
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,620
The fire can't go through.

807
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,420
Let's open a way.

808
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,420
We'll get to Longtan Ravine if we follow the stream.

809
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,600
Let's go.

810
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,700
Yes.

811
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,380
Let's go.

812
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,780
Hello?

813
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,180
Can anyone hear me?

814
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,460
Hello? Hello?

815
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,500
Can anyone hear me?

816
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,820
There's a mountain fire here.

817
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,740
Hello.

818
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,620
Hello, is anyone there?

819
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,620
Help!

820
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,100
Is anyone there?

821
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:05,860
Help!

822
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,820
Help!

823
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,540
It seems to be over there.

824
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,460
Is anyone there?

825
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,260
Help!

826
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,060
Go!

827
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,540
Hurry!

828
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,940
Help!

829
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,780
Over there!

830
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,020
-Hold tight. Be careful.
-Help us!

831
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,460
Go up and save them.

832
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,860
Help us!

833
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,460
Hold on tight.

834
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,170
Hold it. How are you?

835
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,980
Are you hurt?

836
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,820
Treat the wound.

837
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,900
Check the equipment carefully.

838
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,340
Be careful.

839
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,540
Watch out for each other.

840
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,660
Remember our firefighting principles.

841
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:22,980
Captain Meng,

842
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,580
Three vehicles and 20 officers from

843
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,140
Heping Road Special Division Station are here.

844
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,660
Please give your order.

845
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,620
The mountain fire has ignited a large area.

846
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,460
The situation can be out of control anytime.

847
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,890
The Command Centre

848
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,340
planned three firebreaks.

849
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,980
Your mission

850
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,420
is to guard the first firebreak.

851
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,180
Yes.

852
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,420
Everyone.

853
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,300
Be careful.

854
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,100
Come back safely.

855
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,340
Go into the mountains.

856
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,540
Yes.

857
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,340
Everyone!

858
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,140
Target, mountain fire frontline.

859
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,660
Turn right.

860
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:54,900
Go!

861
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:58,660
Captain Meng.

862
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,300
We're going.

863
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,620
Be careful.

864
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:12,980
Put it on.

865
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,020
Sir.

866
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,900
We are from the Lushan Fire Brigade.

867
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,820
Why are you here?

868
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,940
We went fishing

869
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,580
and encountered the mountain fire.

870
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,260
Our way out was blocked.

871
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,260
Hello?

872
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,260
Can anyone hear me?

873
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,780
Please answer.

874
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,540
I'm Lin Luxiao from the Lushan Fire Brigade.

875
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,540
What's going on?

876
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,020
Nan Chu.

877
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,460
It's Sergeant Lin!

878
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,860
Do you copy?

879
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,540
Lin Luxiao.

880
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,460
I'm Nan Chu.

881
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,420
Do you copy?

882
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:40,820
Nan Chu.

883
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:41,740
Where are you?

884
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,940
We've encountered a mountain fire.

885
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,860
We're in the car now.

886
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,180
We're evacuating from Lushan.

887
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,460
Okay.

888
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,620
For now,

889
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,140
keep driving along the road.

890
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,140
Don't stop.

891
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,180
Okay.

892
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,460
But the fire is spreading.

893
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,100
We...

894
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,870
[04:30 PM]

895
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,460
Nan Chu. Nan Chu. Can you hear me?

896
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,460
Nan Chu.

897
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,380
Do you copy?

898
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,460
Nan Chu.

899
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,420
What happened?

900
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,720
Nan Chu.

901
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:20,900
Nan Chu.

902
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,540
What happened?

903
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,660
Nan Chu.

904
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,380
Can you hear me?

905
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,260
Nan Chu.

906
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,100
Do you copy?

907
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,100
Nan Chu. Nan Chu. Can you hear me?

908
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,100
Yes.

909
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,340
I'm fine.

910
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,580
We had a car accident.

911
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,060
Did anyone get hurt?

912
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,140
Can the car still move?

913
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,660
I'm fine.

914
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,860
Zong, are you alright?

915
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:47,820
I'm fine.

916
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,460
Xi Gu!

917
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:50,980
No.

918
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,460
I can't move my legs.

919
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,060
It hurts.

920
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,500
Xi Gu!

921
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,020
Xi Gu!

922
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,820
How are you?

923
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,100
I can't move my legs.

924
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,780
Slow down.

925
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,500
I can't move.

926
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:07,820
Okay?

927
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,580
No, I can't move.

928
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,780
No! Leave me alone!

929
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,620
You guys go first.

930
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,930
What are you talking about?

931
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,420
How could we leave you behind?

932
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,660
Let me carry you.

933
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,100
Hurry.

934
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,420
Slow down.

935
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,100
Is anyone hurt?

936
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,780
-Xi Gu is hurt.
-Slowly.

937
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,340
The car is out of order.

938
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,620
We can only walk now.

939
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,100
Tell me your exact location.

940
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,940
Zong.

941
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,380
We are...

942
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,140
We're on the highway of the scenery area,

943
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,780
ten kilometers away from leaving the scenery area.

944
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,780
Nan Chu, listen to me.

945
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,580
The wind is blowing north.

946
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,420
You can't take the highway.

947
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,620
Go down the mountain.

948
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,420
Go west along the path down the mountain.

949
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,620
You'll find the fire canal we dug.

950
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,620
You'll be safe after you cross the fire canal.

951
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,580
Understand?

952
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,980
Wet your clothes and

953
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,940
use them to cover your mouth and nose.

954
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,380
-Nan Chu.
-Bring more water.

955
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,620
Pour water on your body to cool down when necessary.

956
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,420
Don't run with the wind.

957
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,900
Don't go up the mountain.

958
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:06,660
Understand?

959
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,540
Do you copy?

960
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,970
Don't go up the mountain.

961
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,460
Run down the mountain.

962
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,860
The fire spread faster than we could run.

963
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,170
If we can't avoid it in time,

964
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,860
we need to find a flat ground without flammable items to hide from the smoke.

965
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,300
Don't choose low-lying areas

966
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:24,980
or holes

967
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,340
because those will pile up dust.

968
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,410
I know.

969
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,180
I know all of that.

970
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,420
I've read a lot of books

971
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,820
about the forest fire these two years.

972
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,940
Lin Luxiao, where are you now?

973
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:35,940
I'm

974
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,780
walking into the mountains.

975
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,900
We need to find some lost villagers.

976
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:41,980
Promise me

977
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,580
you will come back safely.

978
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,460
I promise you.

979
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,340
I'll wait for you at a safe place.

980
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,500
You promise?

981
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,210
I promise.

982
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,460
We have to go.

983
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,980
Be careful.

984
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,580
Keep in touch.

985
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,100
Instructor,

986
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,140
take these two comrades back

987
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,380
and pick up your girlfriend.

988
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,060
Zhao,

989
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,300
you take them out.

990
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,980
I'll go in and find the missing members.

991
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,740
Stop talking.

992
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,500
Zhao,

993
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,340
With the fire going, you're the only one

994
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,860
who knows your way in Lushan.

995
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,860
Only you can take them out.

996
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,820
Listen to me.

997
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,460
Zhao.

998
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,780
The more we can save, the better.

999
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,140
Okay.

1000
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,100
Promise me.

1001
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,300
You will come back safely.

1002
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,900
We leave no man behind.

1003
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,740
I'll come back safely.

1004
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,460
Off you go.

1005
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,180
Go.

1006
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:45,860
Hurry!

1007
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:48,620
Go!

1008
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:53,970
Ben.

1009
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,940
Let’s go in and save them.

1010
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:56,810
Let's go.

1011
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,430
[05:23 PM]

1012
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,300
Unit 1, hold on!

1013
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,540
Unit 2, come and help!

1014
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,780
Bad news!

1015
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,900
There's a new fire behind us.

1016
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,100
The first line of defense can't hold on anymore.

1017
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,500
The Command Centre wants us to evacuate immediately.

1018
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,340
Attention, everyone.

1019
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,460
Evacuate immediately.

1020
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,540
Hurry up!

1021
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,620
Retreat!

1022
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,460
Let's go.

When a fire breaks out in a high-rise building,

[Johnny Huang as Lin Luxiao]
When a fire breaks out in a high-rise building,

1026
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,850
first, call 119 to call the police.
[Johnny Huang as Lin Luxiao]

1027
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:39,660
first, call 119 to call the police.

1028
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,530
When we evacuate the room,

1029
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,460
if the knob is very hot to the touch

1030
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,740
and the flame is coming inward,

1031
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,660
it means there's a big fire outside.

1032
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,820
Don't open the door.

1033
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,100
Cover your mouth and nose with wet towels.

1034
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,300
Block the gaps in the door with wet clothing

1035
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,740
to prevent the smoke and fire from infiltrating.

1036
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,900
When you escape, take the evacuation passageway.

1037
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,420
Escape from the safe exit.

1038
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,260
If the lower floors are on fire

1039
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,130
and you can't pass through the smoke,

1040
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,980
you should quickly escape upwards.

1041
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,420
Enter the refuge floor

1042
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,100
or the rooftop open area.

1043
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,620
Don't jump off the building blindly.

1044
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,180
When it comes to high-rise building fires,

1045
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,420
precaution is the most important.

1046
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,980
So you should pay more attention to the escape routes.

1047
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,740
With fire safety in your heart,

1048
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,580
you will not fear escaping from a high-rise building.
