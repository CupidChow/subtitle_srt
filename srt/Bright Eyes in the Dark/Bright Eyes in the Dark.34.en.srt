00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,820
I’ve talked to Mr. Han

194
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,740
of your company.

195

200

You don't need to bring too much.

201
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,500
You came all the way here

202
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,740
just to tell me this?

203
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,820
You haven't changed at all.

204
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,700
You've always made the decisions

205
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,740
my entire life.

206
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,740
What right do you have

207
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,740
to decide for me?

208
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,340
I'm doing this for your own good.

209
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,980
With your current ability,

210
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,460
you can't protect yourself

211
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,980
nor the person you want to protect.

212
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,940
I don't need it.

213
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,460
I don't need your protection

214
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,940
and I don't need your concern.

215
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,500
Why are you here now?

216
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,860
Where were you

217
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,580
when I needed support and encouragement?

218
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,340
You only put me down,

219
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,220
mock me,

220
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,100
and hurt me.

221
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,820
Why do I have a mother like you?

222
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,460
Do you think

223
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,060
I never regretted giving birth to you?

224
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,740
Then you shouldn't have given birth to me!

225
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,340
What do I have to do to make you satisfied?

226
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,580
Do I have to be like you?

227
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,180
But do you know

228
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,420
that you're a failure in my heart?

229
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:38,980
Yes.

230
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,500
I'm a failure.

231
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,330
So,

232
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,460
I don't want you to follow my footsteps.

233
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,610
When you were a kid,

234
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,100
I told you

235
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,580
Your father Li Xuejun

236
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,220
was a worker

237
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,820
and died in a car accident.

238
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,420
That was a lie.

239
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,820
He was also a firefighter.

240
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,940
That year you were born,

241
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,220
he died in a forest fire.

242
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
At that time,

243
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,180
I'd just won an award.

244
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,490
As a woman, I lost my husband

245
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,820
and had to raise a child.

246
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,100
For my career,

247
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,210
I had to hide everything cautiously

248
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,220
and grit my teeth.

249
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,220
That was my hardest time.

250
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,340
I wanted to give up countless times,

I'm Nan Chu.

291
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,500
Recently, there are many comments about me online.

which led to everyone's speculation.

294
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,220

295
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,060
about my personal matters,

296
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,740
because I don't care about the online comments.

297
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,220
However, the online discussions now involve

298
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,460
the Heping Road Special Division Station.

299
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,180
If I keep silent,

300
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,740
I will feel guilty toward them.

301
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,980
The firefighters I know

302
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,300

They bring hope to those in despair.

309
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,060
They are also friends.

310
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,540
They always show up immediately

311
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,500
at places that need them the most.

312
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,460
They seem to be all-powerful

313
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,620
and omnipresent,

314
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,460
but when their families need them,

315
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,700
they're powerless too.

316
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,720
In order to save more people,

317
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,440
they can only choose

318
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,500
to ignore their loved ones.

319
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,860
Every firefighter on the frontlines

320
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,460
has a family quietly devoting for them in the background.

321
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,820
They also worry about life

322
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,380
and face everyday struggles.

323
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,440
They also complain

324
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,450
and feel helpless,

325
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,440
but whenever the alarm rings,

326
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,550
they will still risk their lives.

327

00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,310
and just danced at Dream Dance,

383
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,340
these things wouldn't have happened.

384
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,960
I burdened you all.

385
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,440
Don't say that.

386
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,930
There's nothing wrong

387
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,690
with chasing your dream.

388
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,740
Nan Chu,

389
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,390
keep going forward.

390
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,580
Don't listen to the other voices.

391
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,730
We have to look to the future.

392
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,200
Don't look back.

393
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,750
But you don't have to.

394
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,150
You don't have to bear this kind of pressure.

395
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,790
Everyone

396
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,990
has to bear what he should,

397
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,210
right?

398
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,780
If I'm not a firefighter,

399
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,050
if I just had an ordinary job,

400
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,780
you wouldn't have to suffer like this either.

401
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,470
If you're not a firefighter,

402
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,000
we wouldn’t have met.

403
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,540
Coach Lin,

404
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,320
if you were given another chance,

405
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,590
would you have made the same choice?

406
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:01,760
Why do you ask?

407
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,730
I've been thinking a lot these days.

408
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,740
I

409
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,560
always want to lead everyone forward

410
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,870
with impulsive courage,

411
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,810
but I often crash and burn.

412
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,080
With dance,

413
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,520
there are more than enough better dancers.

414
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,450
Acting?

415
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,060
If it weren't for my mom,

416
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,060
Han Beiyao,

417
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,820
and Zong,

418
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,710
no one would know who I am.

419
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,200
I always thought I was helping everyone,

420
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,320
but actually, everyone is helping me

421
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,970
and I was ignorant about it.

422
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,500
You can't think like that.

423
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,530
Don't make it sound like you're nothing.

424
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,330
You have your charm.

425
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,890
Like me, I was deeply attracted

426
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,950
by your charm.

427
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,760
No matter what happens in the future,

428
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,560
no matter how far we go,

429
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,980
no matter what happens,

430
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,970
even if you get to the lowest point of your life,

431
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,310
you have to believe in your charm.

432
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,960
Many people will be attracted to you in the future.

433
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,780
This is how you are.

434
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,260
Coach Lin,

435
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,290
is your dream

436
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,440
still to be the best firefighter?

437
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,590
It's never changed.

438
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,780
Neither have I.

439
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,560
But what is the best?

440
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,290
The best?

441
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,370
The best

442
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,760
is being better than everyone else.

443
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,290
You're even dumber than me.

444
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,520
Then, tell me what the best is.

445
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,590
The best?

446
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,750
The best

447
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,280
is always being better than how I was a second ago.

448
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,310
Better than how I was a second ago.

449
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,360
I don't think I'm talking to you right now.

450
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,580
Then who are you talking to?

451
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,570
I feel like you've grown a lot

452
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,760
in the past few days.

453
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,710
People never grow slowly.

454
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,560
It happens in an instant.

455
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,680
That's right.

456
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,580
But if you keep going

457
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,770
at this rate,

458
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,340
I'll call you coach the next time we meet.

459
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,060
No way.

460
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,750
You will always be Coach Lin.

461
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,810
But I have already taught you

462
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,210
everything I can teach you.

463
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,090
You should...

464
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,520
You should go and see

465
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,740
wider horizons

466
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,940
and a bigger world.

467
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,720
I will.

468
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,250
I'll go check out every place.

469
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,850
I'll try out every chance.

470
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,000
Every day,

471
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,850
I will be better than before.

472
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,230
I really don't know

473
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,490
how you'll transform the next time I see you.

474
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,850
I'm curious too.

475
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,450
I don't know how you'll be

476
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,710
when I see you next time.

477
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,700
I will definitely be better than now.

478
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,770
I will, too.

479
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,520
You always copy my words.

480
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,950
That's because you're the coach.

503
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,680
You've worked hard

504
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,810
for Nan Chu's matter.

505
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,280
Cheers to you.

506
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,760
We've known each other for years.

507
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,030
This is the first time

508
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,790
you asked me to help you,

509
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,690
so I would definitely help with Nan Chu's matter.

510
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,540
Anyway,

511
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,250
thank you, Han.

512
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,560
Actually,

513
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,580
I should be the one thanking you.

514
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,100
When I arrived in the US,

515
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,040
everything was unfamiliar.

516
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,130
It was you

517
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,110
who gave me so many work opportunities.

518
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,630
That's how I got to my current position.

519
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,280
What you just said

520
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,870
reminded me.

521
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:56,930
Back then,

522
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,160
the way you mixed

523
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,750
English with Chinese

524
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,490
sounded quite nice.

525
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,210
Don't mention it.

526
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,260
It's embarrassing.

527
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,070
But thanks to you,

528
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,590
you always made time to help me study.

529
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,390
That's why my English

530
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,290
improved a little.

531
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,060
Of course.

532
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,950
In return,

533
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,930
you even cooked me pork ribs,

534
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,280
even though it was burnt.

535
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,290
That was

536
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,920
to give you a taste of your hometown.

537
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,040
I'm very confident in cooking.

538
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:38,930
By the way,

539
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,110
how is

540
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,300
the bakery

541
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,510
we often went to?

542
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,940
It closed down

543
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,290
and was changed into a bar.

544
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,140
I miss that smell.

545
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,620
Yes.

546
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,300
Back then,

547
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,990
we hadn't become old yet.

548
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,510
Do you remember

549
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,790
the night before I left America,

550
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,550
I went to see you?

551
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,370
Actually, I had something to tell you.

552
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:16,980
I wanted to say...

553
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,940
Nothing.

554
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,840
I know.

555
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,120
During that time,

556
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,760
I was alone in the US.

557
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,050
They called me a superstar,

558
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,030
but I felt horrible inside,

559
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,840
yet I couldn't talk about it.

560
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,080
You were the only person

561
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,220
that I could talk to.

562
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,150
Han,

563
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,540
thank you.

564
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,530
Your favorite movie

565
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,540
was Notting Hill.

566
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,060
I asked you

567
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,200
why you watched it endlessly.

568
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,880
You told me

569
