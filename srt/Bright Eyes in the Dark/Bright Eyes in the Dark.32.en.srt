Please answer the following questions one by one.

8
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,940
When a fire happens,

9
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,940
how should we escape and save ourselves?

10
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,340
Attention, this is a multiple-choice question.

11
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,300
A. Search for your belongings and take the elevator downstairs.

12
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,780
B. Measure the temperature of the door with your hands.

13
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,300
If the temperature is not that high, open the door quickly to escape.

14
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,060
C. Cover your mouth and nose with a wet towel.

15
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,620
Lower your body and escape in the opposite direction of fire and smoke.

16
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,620
D. When the floor is too high,

17
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,540
retreat to a room with a lower fire intensity.

18
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,580
Block the gaps around the door with wet clothing,

19
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,820
and wet the door with water

20
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,340

Dear audience.

22

Please choose the right answer.

23
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,260
When faced with a fire,

24
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,610
first, stay calm

25
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,340
and measure the temperature of the door.

26
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,100
If the temperature is very high,

27
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,980
it means the fire outside the door is very strong.

28
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,620
If you open the door rashly,

29
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,980
it may cause a flashover.

30
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,180
If the temperature of the door is not that high,

31
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,100
you can open the door and check the severity of fire and smoke.

32
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,260
Conditions permitting,

33
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,820

lower your body and escape quickly.

When the fire is too strong for you to escape,

36
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:16,820
remember,

37
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,380

Deputy Director of Heping Road Special Division Station, Beixun Brigade.

77
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,340
There is a saying in Beixun's firefighting community.

78
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,380
It's said that Deputy Director Yu

79
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,060
never removes a wrong brick.

80
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,980

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,340
Let's go.

184
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:37,820
Yes.

185
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,460
Be careful.

186
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,580
Okay.

187
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,460
How could they leave?

188
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,900
The press conference isn't over yet.

189
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,340
You shouldn't avoid it,

190
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:45,980
right?

191
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,330
Yes.

192
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,540
You can't just avoid it.

193
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,340
Give us an explanation.

194
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:52,900
Wait.

195
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,220
It's Lin Luxiao.

196
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,820
Come on, photograph him.

197
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,450
It's Lin Luxiao.

198
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,460
Photograph him.

199
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,700
Photograph him.

200
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,780
Photograph Lin Luxiao.

201
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,460
Come on.

202
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,020
Dear reporters.

203
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Come here.

204
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,220
Come on.

205
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,340
You all saw that, right?

206
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,580
That was Lin Luxiao, right?

207
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,700
Why did he run away in a truck?

208
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,220
Why didn't he attend the press conference?

209
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,900
He's trying to cover up the truth.

210
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,540
Right?

211
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,780
It shows us the truth instead,

212
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,020
right?

213
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,540
He...

214
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,900
He feels guilty.

215
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,460
Mr. Jiang.

216
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,220
The press conference has just ended.

217
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,340
Who would have expected that

218
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,380
Ran Dongyang

219
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,660
would suddenly show up?

220
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,660
He even made a public statement

221
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,260
to support Xu Zhiyi

222
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,380
as a person who experienced the fire himself.

223
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,580
Why is Ran Dongyang everywhere?

224
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,340
He's willing to do anything to boost his popularity,

225
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:50,970
isn't he?

226
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,460
How about this?

227
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,020
Make use of Zhige's resources.

228
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,340
Go to the media we are most familiar with,

229
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,540
and try our best to put in a good word for Nan Chu.

230
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,340
Also, get in contact with Han Beiyao.

231
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,820
He should also be trying to pull strings now.

232
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:01,900
Okay.

233
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,700
I'm on it.

234
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,460
Instructor Lin.

235
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,820
Don't you think this place

236
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,700
is a bit familiar?

237
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,100
Yijiu.

238
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,580
This isn't the community where that auntie lives, is it?

239
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,940
What auntie?

240
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,100
A warm-hearted auntie lives in this community.

241
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,420
She's very interested in Instructor Lin.

242
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,620
She's eager to let Instructor Lin solve her problem.

243
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,500
What problem?

244
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,300
Let me tell you.

245
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,860
It's...

246
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,820
Have you got a clear understanding of the situation at the scene?

247
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,820
According to the latest information sent by the fire control operator,

248
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,820
the electric moped's fire

249
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,460
has been put out by nearby residents.

250
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,460
No casualties at the moment.

251
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,940
It really is this community.

252
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,700
What's the gossip?

253
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,940
She's determined to set Instructor Lin up with someone.

254
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,820
Mr. Firefighter.

255
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,210
You're finally here.

256
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,100
I was almost scared to death just now.

257
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,100
The fire was over a meter high.

258
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,860
How is it now?

259
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,100
It's been put out.

260
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,060
Lin.

261
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,860
I heard that you and that actress...

262
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,700
What's her name again?

263
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,500
It's this building, right?

264
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,220
Is it here?

265
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,980
It's that building in front.

266
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,500
That one in front.

267
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,340
Hurry up.

268
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,340
Let's go.

269
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,820
Go up and check if the open flame has been put out.

270
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,980
Lin.

271
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,940
Since you came here last time,

272
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,100
I've been watching fire safety shows every day.

273
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,860
Do you think there are any fire hazards

274
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,100
in this building?

275
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,730
Auntie.

276
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,580
These boxes are all flammable.

277
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,860
With them piled up here,

278
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,580
when there's a fire, they may hinder your escape.

279
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,100
After studying, I've found it inappropriate.

280
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,340
Yes.

281
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,060
Clean them up.

282
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,100
Okay.

283
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,620
Okay, I'll go up for a check.

284
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,460
Report, Instructor Lin. Check completed.

285
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,460
The open flame is confirmed to have been put out.

286
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,980
The wires installed later

287
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,340
are all here.

288
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,180
Help them check

289
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,340
if there're any safety hazards.

290
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,060
Yes.

291
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,060
The jump wires here are too messy.

292
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,820
Inform them to make corrections later.

293
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,820
Cut them from the root.

294
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,300
What are you doing?

295
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,300
Why are you tearing my stuff down without my permission?

296
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,580
No, that's not the case.

297
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,980
We are firefighters.

298
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,860
We're eliminating safety hazards.

299
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,420
Even though

300
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,180
you are firefighters,

301
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,180
you can't just remove others' stuff at will.

302
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,700
Come down.

303
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,860
Why are you yelling?

304
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,420
That's my stuff.

305
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,740
Calm down.

306
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,420
Sir.

307
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,580
There are many hazards

308
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,700
in your usage of electricity.

309
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,820
I have to troubleshoot them for you one by one.

310
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,460
Besides, you shouldn't charge your moped battery

311
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,740
in your room.

312
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,580
You have to take it down.

313
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,580
You have to take it downstairs.

314
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,460
Where can I charge it if not in my room?

315
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,500
Should I charge it in your place?

316
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,100
This moped battery is worth over 1,000 yuan.

317
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,420
If I lose it since I left it downstairs,

318
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,700
my salary for a month would be gone.

319
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,460
What?

320
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:20,980
What are you arguing about?

321
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,220
The house owner is back.

322
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,220
The wires were installed by him.

323
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,610
You installed the wires yourself, right?

324
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,100
First, this is illegal usage of electricity.

325
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,060
Besides, the moped battery can't be charged indoors.

326
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,340
If you charge your moped battery indoors,

327
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,740
once there's a fire, it'll be extremely dangerous.

328
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,500
There are countless fires

329
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,340
caused by moped batteries every year.

330
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,340
Which is more important, your life or...

331
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,060
Stop.

332
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,740
Who are you to lecture me?

333
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,300
You just can't take it that

334
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,500
others don't take you seriously, right?

335
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,220
I think I know you.

336
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,220
Aren't you the firefighter that went viral

337
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,820
on the internet a few days ago?

338
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,640
You're that actress's boyfriend, right?

339
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,500
You saved your girlfriend

340
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,340
over others

341
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,220
in that fire.

342
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,860
You didn't care about others' lives.

343
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,460
Yet you're lecturing me now?

344
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,180
Maybe you should lecture yourself first.

345
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,220
Can't you talk nicely?

346
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,100
Don't.

347
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,700
What's not nice about what I said?

348
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,460
He started it.

349
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,210
What are you talking about?

350
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,220
Young man.

351
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,100
Can't you tell right from wrong?

352
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,220
Do you know fire safety knowledge at all?

353
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,700
You.

354
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,980
How can you make judgements about others

355
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,820
simply based on the rumors online?

356
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,460
It's about professional ethics.

357
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,580
You can't just make things up.

358
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,420
No, Auntie.

359
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,500
I wasn't making it up.

360
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,180
Didn't you hear that?

361
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,460
They talked to me like that.

362
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,340
It's my moped battery.

363
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,060
What are you doing?

364
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,580
Stop arguing.

365
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,060
Take it downstairs.

366
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,820
Listen.

367
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,820
Go downstairs with me.

368
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,460
Didn't you read the community announcement?

369
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,460
Moped batteries can't be taken upstairs.

370
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,860
If you keep being so unreasonable

371

and refusing to cooperate with the firefighters,

372
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,220
I'll report you.

373
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,180
I...

374
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,340
I'll carry my moped battery myself.

375
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,620
Give it to me.

376
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,220

378
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,940
You've violated the fire safety administration regulations.

379
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,100
Besides, moped batteries can't be

380
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,220
charged indoors. That's unquestionable.

394
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,180
I shouldn't have brought the moped battery upstairs.

395
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,580
I should have charged it downstairs.

396
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,980
It's my own responsibility

397

Yes.

Don't worry.

The thing I talked to you about last time,

418

about my bestie's daughter,

419
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
after thinking about it, it's inappropriate indeed.

420
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,060

421
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,940

Whose daughter?

429

You always get so hyped up about gossips.

430
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,980
Hurry up and remove the wires.

Why are you sighing?

438
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,340
Isn't it good that she became popular?

439
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,460
Of course I want her to do better and better.

440

After all, Nan Chu's occupation is special.

444
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,500
In such a public opinion environment,

445
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,060
you'd better be prepared.

00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,060
Have a seat.

557
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,220
Instructor Lin.

558
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,060
You know what?

559
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,220
There are all kinds of people online nowadays.

560
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,500
Many of them

561
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,460
don't know the truth at all.

562
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,860
They don't want to know either.

563
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,420
They just lie on the sofa

564
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,940
and send the messages out by clicking on the screen.

565
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,420
It's just a way of letting out

566
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,740
their personal emotions.

567
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,220
They just vent their dissatisfactions

568
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,020
and malice in life

569
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,060
on others without thinking.

570
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,980
If you take those comments to heart,

571
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,980
you lose.

572
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,690
I understand.

573
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,980
You don't have to soothe me.

574
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,020
I don't care about that.

575
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,620
You understand?

576
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,460
We've been friends for years.

577
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,940
I know you well, okay?

578
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,380
Actually, those comments and opinions about me

579
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,970
really don't bother me.

580
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,020
But what I hate is that

581
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,460
it's affecting the station

582
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,180
and all our teammates.

583
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,740
I...

584
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,660
Stop it.

585
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,500
You think too much.

586
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,700
Why are you misled

587
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,500
by the gossips online as well?

588
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,140
Look.

589
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,770
Is anyone in the team blaming you?

590
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,450
No.

591
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,980
It's because everyone knows

592
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,860
there was no problem with the rescue at Huanyu Building.

593
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,220
Well.

594
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,420
Speaking of which,

595
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,180
don't blame me for nagging.

596
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,460
You and Nan Chu.

597
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,220
One is a firefighter,

598
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,220
and the other is a celebrity.

599
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,300
Right?

600
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,220
Your identities are special in the first place.

601
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,700
Your occupations are special as well.

602
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,980
So it's natural that it causes some hindrance.

603
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,980
Besides, Nan Chu

604
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,180
normally lives under the spotlight.

605
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,300
There are a lot of things she can't control herself.

606
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,020
So those who are close to her

607
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,300
will feel like they are being magnified

608
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,860
under the microscope.

609
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,980
There's no place to hide.

610
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Indeed.

611
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,220
There's no place to hide.

612
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,780
But given this situation,

613
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,700
I really don't know

614
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,220
how I can help her.

615
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,860
This incident

616
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,980
is just a beginning.

617
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,620
There will be more incidents like this in the future.

618
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
But I think,

619
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,180
if you want to get over this,

620
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,220
you have to

621
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,700
make yourselves strong enough.

622
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:34,940
Got it.

623
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,900
Let's eat.

624
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,860
However, come to think of it,

625
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,140
we are not even afraid of fire.

626
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,940
You can't be afraid of a little starlight, right?

627
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,940
Yu, you are really

628
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,900
eloquent now.

629
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,350
Emergency rescue!

630
00:22:59,450 --> 00:22:59,860
Emergency rescue!

631
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,300
Let's go.

632
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:00,780
Hurry up!

633
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,500
Emergency rescue!

634
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,300
-Hurry up.
-Let me.

635
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,060
Okay.

636
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,690
Zhongnan Fire Station

637
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,700
is dealing with it at the scene.

638
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,500
They need backup.

639
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:20,810
[Yu's Sichuan Restaurant]

640
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,460
I'm Lou Mingye from Heping Road Station.

641
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,180
Hello.

642
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,180
I'm Xiao Qiang, Director of Zhongnan Station.

643
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,740
-I'm in charge for now.
-Hello.

644
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,980
How's the on-site

645
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,460
temporary command work progressing now?

646
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,130
This place was originally a two-story building.

647
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:42,780
First, they

648
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,780
added a story

649
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,980
to the original building illegally.

650
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,300
And last year,

651
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,420
they added one more story to that.

652
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,860
So it became

653
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,660
a four-story building as it is now.

654
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,220
How did they pass the safety check?

655
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,140
The cause of this accident is that

656
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,380
the foundation of the original two-story building

657
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,980
couldn't withstand the pressure of the expansion.

658
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,540
Besides,

659
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,700
in the rescue,

660
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,500
we found that the cement and steel

661
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,740
they used for the illegal construction of this building

662
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,020
are not in line with the requirements at all,

663
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,660
which also led to the collapse.

664
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,420
We've rescued over ten injured people.

665
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,500
Most of them are students nearby.

666
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,460
Are they even human?

667
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,460
Isn't constructing like that disregarding human lives?

668
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,620
Where is the person in charge of this collapsed building?

669
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,940
Is there an architectural drawing of the building?

670
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,060
The police officers

671
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,300
found that this building

672
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,780
belongs to a man called Chen Yilong.

673
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,540
But they couldn't reach him.

674
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,220
What's his name?

675
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,700
Chen Yilong?

676
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,460
Right.

677
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,700
Currently, firefighters from three stations

678
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,420
have arrived

679
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,690
in this area

680
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,460
and this area.

681
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,500
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed cannot be connected at the moment.

682
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,220
Dagang.

683
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,220
Did you reach him?

684
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,380
No.

685
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,020
Forget it.

686
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,460
Our rescue area has been decided.

687
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:54,860
Let's go first.

688
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,220
Let's go.

689
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,460
Liu.

690
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,660
Director Xiao gave me this

691
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,700
floor plan of our rescue area.

692
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,620
All right. Yu.

693
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,180
Go to Zone A with Dagang,

694
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,620
and check the load-bearing situation.

695
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,900
Set up fixed-point support

696
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,700
and build a safe passage.

697
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:09,860
Liu.

698
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,020
You and Yijiu.

699
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,700
Help dispose of the ruins of the collapse on the roof

700
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,930
to prevent them from falling and hurting people.

701
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,700
Shiquan.

702
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,220
Here.

703
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,220
Come with me to Zone B to check the situation.

704
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:18,540
Yes.

705
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,380
The information on this map is not completely accurate.

706
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,980
The cement used and the steel structure constructed

707
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,700
were both illegal.

708
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,220
So when we go in there,

709
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,940
make sure you make judgments according to the on-site situation.

710
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,500
Yes.

711
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,020
Be careful, everyone.

712
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,380
Call me whenever you need backup.

713
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:31,700
Okay.

714
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,410
Get moving.

715
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:32,740
Yes.

716
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,220
Get moving.

717
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,860
Be ready to provide reinforcements at any time.

718
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,220
Yes.

719
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,860
Be careful, Dagang.

720
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,420
This part is a bit unstable.

721
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,500
Let's go.

722
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,380
Is anyone in there?

723
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,500
Is anyone in there?

724
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,700
Is anyone in there?

725
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,780
Don't move.

726
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,740
This part.

727
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,300
This part can't be removed.

728
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,460
It's too dangerous.

729
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,220
We can only go through it from below.

730
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,290
I'll do it.

731
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,780
Be careful.

732
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,380
Be careful, everyone.

733
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,220
Don't touch the collapsed structure.

734
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,260
This way.

735
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,140
Give me a hand. Quick.

736
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
Move it to the safe area.

737
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,860
Is anyone in there?

738
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,220
Is anyone in there?

739
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,940
Help!

740
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,860
Help!

741
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,460
Help!

742
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,140
Yu.

743
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,900
Yu.

744
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,460
Someone is inside.

745
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,660
I heard it.

746
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,700
Help!

747
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,940
Hang in there.

748
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,260
We're coming in.

749
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,060
We can't change the structure.

750
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,740
We can only remove the rubble

751
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:15,780
and crawl over.

752
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,300
Hang in there.

753
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,220
We're coming.

754
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,700
Be careful.

755
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,260
I'm okay.

756
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,740
Yu.

757
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,060
Help!

758
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,180
He's right down there.

759
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:44,980
Move it.

760
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,540
Okay.

761
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,460
Be careful, Yu.

762
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,220
Help!

763
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,940
Careful.

764
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,980
Help me.

765
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,060
Chen Yilong.

766
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,740
Is that you, Chen Yilong?

767
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,740
It's me.

768
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,740
Are you Dagang?

769
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:06,980
You bastard!

770
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,180
What's wrong with you?

771
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,220
Do you know

772
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,980
how many deaths you are responsible for?

773
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:10,980
Stop scolding me.

774
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,260
Help me!

775
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,220
Help me out!

776
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,460
Come on.

777
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:16,890
Dagang.

778
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,140
How is it?

779
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,540
How are you now?

780
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,700
I'm pressed.

781
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,380
I can't move.

782
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:29,980
What should we do?

783
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,700
Please, get me out of here.

784
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,180
Hello?

785
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,260
What are you doing?

786
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,740
How can you do the rescue like this?

787
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,380
Hang in there a little longer.

788
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,300
We're trying to find a way.

789
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,980
What way?

790
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,260
Why should I hang in there?

791
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,460
Chen Yilong, shut up!

792
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,940
If you hadn't violated the rules and added more stories to the building,

793
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,140
and used steel of poor quality,

794
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,220
this building couldn't have collapsed, okay?

795
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:54,980
Enough, Dagang.

796
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,300
Stop talking.

797
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,220
I'm guilty. I deserve to die, okay?

798
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,980
Dagang, we've been friends for so many years.

799
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,380
I'm begging you.

800
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,740
Save me.

801
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:03,860
Enough.

802
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,460
Stop yelling.

803
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,660
Try move your legs.

804
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,700
Can you do that?

805
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,180
I...

806
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,490
I'm pressed and stuck.

807
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,420
I can't move.

808
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,540
Chen Yilong, listen to me.

809
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,380
How do your legs feel now?

810
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:24,700
They're numb.

811
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,980
They're getting number and number.

812
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,180
Dagang!

813
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,500
Help!

814
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,260
Yu.

815
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,380
It's not looking good.

816
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:37,740
Yes.

817
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,980
I can only make judgments after I see the structure clearly.

818
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,740
All right.

819
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,540
Wait for me here.

820
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,020
I'll see if I can go around back.

821
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,500
Okay.

822
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,460
Give it to me.

823
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,420
Hurry!

824
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:45,980
Dagang!

825
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,420
You have to save me.

826
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,940
Hang in there a little longer.

827
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:51,860
Yu.

828
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,540
Be careful.

829
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,220
Don't worry.

830
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,220
Chen Yilong.

831
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,940
Dagang.

832
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,260
Listen to me.

833
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,500
Stop talking for now.

834
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,380
Save your energy.

835
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,220
I'll ask and you'll answer.

836
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,940
Step back, everyone.

837
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,620
Is anyone hurt?

838
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,010
Anyone?

839
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,980
Yu.

840
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,460
Yu.

841
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,700
Yu Qilei.

842
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,780
Yu Qilei.

843
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,900
Reply if you hear me.

844
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:14,860
Dagang.

845
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,860
What's going on with you?

846
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,300
Dagang.

847
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,500
We... Director.

848
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,780
There's a collapse over here.

849
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,700
Are you and Yu okay?

850
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,980
Yu!

851
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,220
Yu!

852
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,900
Dagang.

853
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
You have to save me.

854
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,460
Dagang.

855
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,220
Yu.

856
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,460
Reply if you hear me.

857
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,930
Reply. Come on.

858
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,220
Director.

859
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,220
Yu's situation is unknown.

860
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,940
I'm trying to save the trapped.

861
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,860
We need backup.

862
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,260
We'll come down right away.

863
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,460
Hold on.

864
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,020
Don't move!

865
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,260
The collapse just now

866
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,500
has made the structure here very unstable.

867
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,180
There may be danger at any time.

868
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,980
Don't move, everyone.

869
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:53,860
Yu! Yu!

870
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:54,700
Are you okay?

871
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,180
I'm okay.

872
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,300
Director.

873
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,500
I'll go down and check.

874
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:10,940
You stay up there.

875
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,700
Keep investigating.

876
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,220
I'll go.

877
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,020
Be careful.

878
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,060
Is there anyone else?

879
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,740
Be careful.

880
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,860
Make sure the stay bars are stable.

881
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,220
Over there as well.

882
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,140
Dagang.

883
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,300
Director Lou.

884
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
Yu went around back.

885
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,460
Go and check on Yu.

886
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,260
Leave here to me.

887
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:37,740
Okay.

888
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,220
Dagang.

889
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,500
Dagang!

890
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,020
Talk less if you want to live.

891
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,300
Help me!

892
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,020
Brother, don't worry.

893
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,380
We're trying to find a way.

894
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:49,700
Yu.

895
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,220
Yu!

896
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,460
Yu!

897
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,660
Yu, are you okay?

898
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,540
I'm okay.

899
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,980
Dagang.

900
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,420
Don't move.

901
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,220
The structure in here is very unstable.

902
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,500
It may collapse anytime.

903
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,380
How should you get out?

904
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:15,980
I'm okay.

905
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,500
I have a bar to hold onto here.

906
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,700
It's safe for now.

907
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:24,980
The situation is that

908
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,300
the slab pressing Chen Yilong,

909
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,740
the wall it's against,

910
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,180
and the slab over my head

911
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,460
has formed a triangle.

912
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,740
If I pull the bar out now,

913
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,700
the wall supported by the slab may collapse.

914
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,260
Then,

915
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,740
Chen Yilong and I

916
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,740
will both get trapped down here.

917
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,660
Neither of us will be able to get out.

918
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,140
The only way is

919
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,180
to forcibly break the slab over my head.

920
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,020
And then,

921
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,340
when Chen Yilong gets out,

922
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,660
I'll be able to get out as well.

923
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,060
Okay.

924
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,580
I'll break it.

925
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,780
No.

926
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,820
Go help Director Lou.

927
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,060
Can you do it alone?

928
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,100
Don't worry about me.

929
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,660
What's there to worry about,

930
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,580
letting me handle this?

931
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,300
Go.

932
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,780
Stop nagging.

933
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,660
Wait, Dagang.

934
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:34,980
What?

935
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,460
You may only have a few seconds.

936
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,060
You must hurry up.

937
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,020
Later,

938
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,460
when I count to three,

939
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,460
