Shiquan.

192
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,460
How many times has it been?

193
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,340
Let me use it.

194
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,220
It's just two shirts.

195
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,930
I won't use that much.

196
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,190
You're so stingy.

197
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,790
Unit Leader Lei,

198
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,720
you dropped something.

199
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,820
I almost lost the IOU.

200
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,970
It's Fang.

201
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,980
Something happened to him recently.

202
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,280
He borrowed 5,000 yuan from me.

203
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,540
I asked him to write an IOU.

204
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,190
Don't tell anyone.

205
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,540
Unit Leader Lei,

206
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,190
Unit Leader Fang also borrowed money from me recently.

207
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,950
He also borrowed money from you?

208
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,670
He also borrowed money from me.

209
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,520
Wait.

210
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,070
How much did he borrow?

211
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,830
Five thousand.

212
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,590
Five thousand?

213
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,930
What did he say?

214
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,940
Something happened in his family.

215
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,580
Did you ask him to pay you back?

216
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,710
It doesn't matter.

217
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,680
Whatever.

218
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,600
How much did he borrow from you?

219
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,700
How much?

220
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,330
Three thousand.

221
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,420
Three thousand.

222
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,140
What did he tell you?

223
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,700
Something urgent came up at home.

224
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,590
He couldn't withdraw funds,

225
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,430
so he needed some cash.

226
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:06,850
You know what?

227
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,160
Something is definitely wrong.

228
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,950
Oh my.

229
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,890
Liu, Liu, Liu!

230
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:10,930
[Men's bathroom]
Liu, Liu, Liu!

231
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,480
[Men's bathroom]

232
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,780
Slow down.

233
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,390
Let me ask you.

234
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,720
Did Fang borrow money from you?

235
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,520
Yes.

236
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,910
How much?

237
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,800
Here and there, about 20-30 thousand.

238
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,390
Here and there, about 20-30 thousand?

239
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,580
See? I knew something was wrong.

240
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,430
What's wrong?

241
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,110
Fang borrowed money from us all.

242
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,700
He's borrowing from everyone!

243
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,340
He spent his money on wealth management products

244
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,470
and they can't be withdrawn quickly.

245
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,450
It's not about wealth management.

246
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,080
Look.

247
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,210
He borrowed 5,000 from me.

248
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,970
He borrowed 3,000 from Shiquan,

249
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:37,560
5,000 from Qi Huo,

250
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,070
and more than 20,000 from you.

251
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,700
In total...

252
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,830
Anyway, it's a lot of money.

253
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,710
There might be more that we don't know about.

254
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,340
What's he doing

255
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,100
with all this money?

256
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,070
Okay, bro.

257
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,070
Don't worry.

258
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,750
Fang

259
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,050
will pay you back in a few days.

260
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,690
Our station isn't that big.

261
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,480
He has nowhere to run to.

262
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,330
I'm not worried about him running off.

263
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:51,920
The main thing is

264
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,310
his house just has a leak,

265
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,310
but he borrowed all this money.

266
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,910
I'm worried he got scammed.

267
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,720
Are you done?

268
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,470
Either don't lend him money

269
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,400
or don't complain about it.

270
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,200
Worst case, you can ask him yourself.

271
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,590
I would ask if I could.

272
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,970
Gather at the training ground.

273
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,570
Training!

274
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,580
So annoying.

275
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,590
What's wrong with you?

276
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,560
You don't let me eat

277
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,150
and now, I can't even go to the bathroom.

278
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,170
Let me explain today's training.

279
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,720
Our recent training

280
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,080
focuses on fitness and rescue abilities.

281
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,300
We haven't practiced self-rescue in a long time.

282
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,900
We're doing high-altitude crossing today.

283
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,030
Pair up.

284
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,040
Find a partner yourself.

285
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,930
You must finish in two minutes.

286
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,570
Those who fail

287
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,620
will do the usual.

288
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,510
Whoever fails

289
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,730
will be on night duty.

290
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,570
Start.

291
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,440
Lin.

292
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,080
I'll team up with you.

293
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,230
Deputy Director Yu,

294
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,610
I'll be a team with you.

295
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,790
Find a partner and go.

296
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,430
Look.

297
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,570
Look at this mess.

298
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,580
It's okay.

299
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:49,800
Come on.

300
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,710
Instructor Lin,

301
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,810
one minute 45 seconds.

302
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,920
Liu Ruyi, 1 minute 47 seconds.

303
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,180
Yu Qilei,

304
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,160
one minute 55 seconds.

305
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,380
Shao Yijiu, 1 minute 56 seconds.

306
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,940
Qin Shiquan, 1 minute 57 seconds.

307
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,580
Lei Dagang,

308
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,390
two minutes 32 seconds.

309
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,560
Lei Dagang,

310
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,200
what's with you?

311
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,540
How many years have you been here for?

312
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,740
You failed the most basic training.

313
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,080
How are you training usually?

314
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,800
You'll be on duty tonight.

315
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,680
Everyone is dismissed.

316
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,080
Unit leaders, take them back.

317
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,610
Director Lou.

318
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,090
I have something to say.

319
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,150
The training is too intense recently.

320
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,080
Everyone is exhausted.

321
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,230
Training like this won't achieve anything.

322
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,790
You should give them some rest at times.

323
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,060
I know you are a dedicated instructor,

324
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,090
but there's a strict division between us.

325
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,470
You're in charge of their philosophy,

326
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,440
while I'm in charge of training.

327
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,410
You shouldn't interfere

328
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,340
with my training arrangement as the director, right?

329
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,640
Yes.

330
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,780
I’m the instructor

331
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,550
and that's why I have to say this.

332
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,940
If you keep training them like this,

333
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,740
there will be problems.

334
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,090
There won't be problems if you train hard usually.

335
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,850
Look at him.

336
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,240
Two minutes and 32 seconds.

337
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,020
Lou Mingye,

338
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,080
I have one more thing to say.

339
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,350
No matter how advanced the equipment is,

340
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,490
it's people who operate it in the end.

341
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,420
The humans are the foundation.

342
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,640
Lin Luxiao,

343
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,230
you're wrong.

344
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,130
Humans are the ones who are most likely to make mistakes.

345
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,520
Have you forgotten

346
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,780
what we were like before?

347
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,790
You couldn't have pulled that boy up

348
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,350
just by talking.

349
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,950
Instructor Lin.

350
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:34,600
What is it?

351
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,370
What's wrong?

352
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,730
Here's the thing.

353
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,750
I know I didn't train well.

354
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,810
My shoulder injury acted up.

355
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,030
When I came up,

356
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,080
I couldn't take it.

357
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,550
Yes, I know.

358
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,810
It's not an excuse,

359
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,710
but it's my son's birthday today.

360
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,300
Director Lou,

361
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,360
can I be on duty next time?

362
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,370
Sorry.

363
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,960
I won't allow it.

364
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,820
I know it's hard for you every day,

365
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,880
but as the director,

366
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,560
I have to be fair and just.

367
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,150
It's the same for myself.

368
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,790
Back down if you can't do it.

369
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,850
Director Lou,

370
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,030
how about this?

371
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,580
I'll be back a bit later.

372
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:20,760
Two hours.

373
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,810
Just give me two hours.

374
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,190
I didn't accompany my son

375
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,120
for his last birthday.

376
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,880
I don't spend much time with him usually.

377
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,760
The kid—

378
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,520
Okay.

379
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,530
I can approve it,

380
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,550
but if your physical condition

381
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,640
and your personal issues

382
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,070
seriously affect your work,

383
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,960
I'll request the Deputy Captain

384
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,360
to re-evaluate whether you're suitable to stay at the fire station's frontline.

385
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,000
My body is fine,

386
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,590
Director Lou.

387
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,910
That's not what I meant. I...

388
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,920
I've been working at the special division unit for more than ten years.

389
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,470
I can't do anything

390
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,810
other than firefighting.

391
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,150
I promised my wife

392
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,500
through video call last night

393
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,510
that I'll definitely go home today.

394
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,090
I said

395
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,060
I won't allow it.

396
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,660
Director Lou.

397
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:56,870
Director Lou.

398
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,880
Lei Dagang,

399
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,570
you have to get yourself together with training.

400
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,090
Don't mess up during exams.

401
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,810
Go back today.

402
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,410
I'll take your shift.

403
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,680
Make it up as soon as you're back.

404
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,470
I won't allow it again.

405
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,310
Do you hear me?

406
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,580
Coordinate amongst yourselves.

407
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,890
As long as you don't break the rules,

408
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,980
I don't care.

409
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,310
Lin,

410
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,780
it's been a long time since you took a break.

411
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,760
You finally got a break.

412
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,560
Go accompany your girlfriend.

413
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,740
I'm fine.

414
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,260
You're fine?

415
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,540
You're about to cry.

416
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,330
Thank you.

417
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,110

Miss Dou,

426
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,190
you didn't even say you're coming.

427
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,030
I could've gone to pick you up.

428
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,910
This way.

429
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,300
We can go in directly.

You go in first.

What's the situation?

531
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,350
Have the drone drop the bomb.

how could you miss?

540
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,650
This is an emergency

541
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,790
and you're still spacing out.

542
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,460
Can't you predict the trajectory in advance?

543
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,810
Forget it.

544
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,770
Use the thermal imaging.

545
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,830
You're in the way. What is all this?

546
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,090
What are you talking about?

547
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,440
I don't have time to mess with you now.

548
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,650
Focus.

Look at the plot.

559

You'll go and try the scene later.

560
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,780
Are there no lines?

561
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,090
You can't act without lines?

562
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,930
Ying.

563
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:14,980

I'm really sorry.

568
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,090
We were stuck in traffic,

569
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,050
so we got here late.

570
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:29,890
You haven't gone yet?

571
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,240
It's almost my turn.

572
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,240
I'll take a look.

573
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,000
Okay.

574
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,060
Don't be nervous, Nan Chu.

575
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,230
We'll accompany you.

576
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,080
Let me take a look for you.

577
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,850
Give me more water pressure.

578
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,900
More water pressure.

579
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,230
You've worked hard.

580
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,190
You've worked hard.

581
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,790
With the fire today...

582
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,630
Director Lou.

583
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,680
The drone's extinguisher bomb was very critical.

584
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,940
Which one of you did it?

585
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,710
Director Lou,

586
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,300
it was me.

587
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,700
You dropped it precisely despite the complex situation.

588
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,290
You must have worked hard during training.

589
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,310
It's nothing.

590
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,460
Attention, everyone.

591
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,140
Check in detail again

592
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,690
and eliminate all signs of reigniting.

593
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,790
Be sure to check carefully.

594
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,740
Check carefully.

595
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,230
Attention, everyone.

596
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,660
The prefab house is distorted from the fire.

597
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,180
We must inspect the safety outside

598
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,910
before doing internal inspections.

599
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,000
Be careful.

600
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,310
It needs to be extinguished here.

601
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,620
Yijiu, Shiquan,

602
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,710
how is it going?

603
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,350
Instructor Lin,

604
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,570
we have no further issues.

605
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,420
We're ready to enter and check the fire spots.

606
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,770
Instructor Lin.

607
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,030
I need to check again.

608
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,960
What exactly is the situation?

609
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,680
Are you done?

610
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,810
It's been a long night.

611
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,110
I said there are no problems inside.

612
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,250
Why are you purposely going against me?

613
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,590
You're so good at the procedures

614
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,220
and so talented.

615
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,070
I wouldn't dare to go against you.

616
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,450
Instructor Lin asked me to check carefully.

617
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,630
I'm just following orders.

618
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,600
What's going on?

619
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,560
Make it clear.

620
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,400
I got it, Shao Yijiu.

621
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,800
You’ve been acting weird all night

622
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,100
just because you think I'm better than you

623
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,810
and you're not convinced.

624
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,740
You think it's embarrassing.

625
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,790
No.

626
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,630
Do you really think

627
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,770
you're better than me because you got praised?

628
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,620
Let me tell you, Shao Yijiu.

629
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,180
Since we were kids,

630
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,610
I've always been better than you.

631
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,160
Yeah right.

632
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,960
Qin Shiquan,

633
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,810
I've known you for years.

634
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,360
You've only won this one time.

635
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:37,990
What can you do

636
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,250
without me?

637
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,430
Fine, Shao Yijiu,

638
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,430
I'll tell you now

639
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,820
what I can do by myself.

640
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,750
I said there's no problem inside and that's that!

641
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,930
Wait here right now.

642
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,230
Stop getting in my way.

643
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,120
Don't rush in impulsively.

644
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,300
We don't know the situation yet.

645
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:50,800
Come back!

646
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,470
Shiquan.

647
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:52,770
Shiquan.

648
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,240
Shiquan.

649
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,300
Where are the problems?

650
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,070
Where are the problems?

651
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,380
Shiquan,

652
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,130
get out of here.

653
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:01,640
No, Master.

654
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,600
He's being stubborn with me.

655
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,190
Come out with me.

656
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,450
Have you checked everything?

657
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,250
Go.

658
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,400
Watch out!

659
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,000
Master.

660
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,040
[Outpatient]

661
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,880
[Emergency Room]

662
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,510
Yu.
[Emergency Room]

663
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:22,800
[Emergency Room]

664
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,310
Director Lou,
[Emergency Room]

665
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:23,640
[Emergency Room]

666
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:23,810
where's Lin?
[Emergency Room]

667
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,440
where's Lin?

668
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,620
He's getting patched up inside.

669
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,670
He was smashed by a steel plate.

670
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,510
What happened?

671
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,610
It's all my fault.

672
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,700
Why did I switch shifts with him?

673
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,200
Enough.

674
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,410
Director Lou.

675
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,000
It has nothing to do with you.

676
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,550
Yijiu is having an emotional breakdown.

677
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,350
Hurry and take a look.

678
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,110
Where?

679
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,700
The stairwell.

680
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,120
What a nuisance.

681
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,550
Didn't you say there's no problem?

682
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,220
And then?

683
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,110
If anything happens to Master,

684
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,670
I'll make you pay for it now!

685
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,150
Look at the situation.

686
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,720
It's not the time to talk about who's right or wrong.

687
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,130
Didn't Deputy Yu mention

688
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,390
to report to me if there are any problems?

689
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,580
What are you thinking of instead?

690
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,430
All you think about is showing off, right?

691
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,110
This is a disaster scene.

692
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,370
People can die.

693
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,010
Does someone like you who made such a stupid mistake

694
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,480
deserve to stay in the special division unit?

695
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:08,960
And you,

696
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,560
what are you doing?

697
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,360
What happened to all the teamwork exercises?

698
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,790
Can you be more professional?

699
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,130
If you can't, leave.

700
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,810
This job is not for you.

701
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,380
It's not their fault.

702
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,570
Speak louder.

703
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,930
It's not their fault.

704
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,400
Of course, it's not just the two of them.

705
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,780
You're included too.

706
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,340
You're the leader of Combat Unit 1.

707
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,470
What kind of leader are you?

708
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,480
Everyone, go back and write an apology letter,

709
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,780
get points deducted,

710
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,580
and reflect on yourselves.

711
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,100
Wait.

712
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,240
Director Lou,

713
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,260
since something like this happened today,

714
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,020
I must make it clear.

715
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,160
If still you insist on your own way,

716
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,970
I'll report to Captain Meng

717
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,150
that if we have to follow someone like you

718
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,080
and go into battle,

719
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,300
I'm sorry.

720
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,510
We can't do it.

721
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,560
Liu.

722
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,580
You can ask everyone.

723
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,140
Ever since you set up the competition system,

724
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,700
no one

725
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,960
can take it anymore.

726
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,010
Just ask around.

727
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,060
Okay.

728
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,110
No problem.

729
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,870
If you all really think

730
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,050
that my method is wrong,

731
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,320
you can report to the superiors anytime.

732
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,500
This is your right.

733
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,650
What are you doing?

734
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,080
Luckily,

735
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,300
you're in one piece.

736
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,350
One piece.

737
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,090
I took an anesthetic and napped.

738
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,350
Why did you wake me up?

739
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,090
Are Yijiu and Shiquan okay?

740
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,230
That...

741
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,820
Did anyone else get hurt?

742
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,970
You still have the energy to worry about them?

743
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,610
They're all fine.

744
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,550
We can't let this go.

745
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,820
I'm going to see Captain Meng.

746
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,160
Either I leave,

747
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,140
or Lou Mingye leaves.

748
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,190
I can't stand it anymore.

749
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,640
Come back! Come back!

750
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,990
You can't go.

751
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,250
You can't go.

752
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,610
My best friend is injured like this.

753
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,210
If I don't do anything,

754
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,590
I won't be myself.

755
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:44,900
Come back!

756
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,660
Come back.

757
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,070
Look at me.

758
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,500
Look at my injury.

759
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,090
Look.

760
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,840
My spine is broken.

761
00:34:59,010 --> 00:34:59,770
Liu,

762
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,420
I really

763
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,020
did hurt my bones this time.

764
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,620
I won't be able to pass the physical now.

765
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,940
I don't even know if I can stay

766
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,040
in the fire station.

767
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,110
Don't be like this, Lin.

768
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,450
If you can't keep working,

769
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,460
what will happen to the special division unit?

770
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,720
What will we do?

771
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,060
I've worked for so many years.

772
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,460
I'll just retire,

773
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,940
but there's one thing I can't let go of.

774
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,470
I can't let go of our special division unit.

775
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,530
We're a team, you know?

776
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,020
Our line of work needs unity the most.

777
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,080
In this station,

778
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,980
whether it's Lou Mingye

779
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,620
or the others,

780
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,070
they need to stop causing trouble.

781
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,920
We can't take it anymore,

782
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,180
understand?

783
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,090
We must be united

784
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,780
and tightknit.

785
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,830
Liu,

786
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,230
in the future,

787
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,580
if I'm not in the station,

788
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,640
promise me...

789
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,360
I promise you.

790
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,090
You must take good care of everyone.

791
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,470
I'm still not assured.

792
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,570
Liu,

793
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:28,930
make a vow.

794
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,370
You can't cause trouble anymore.

795
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,430
I swear.

796
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,820
If I, Liu Ruyi, can't do it,

797
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,590
then I'll never get a girlfriend.

798
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,860
You're my good bro.

799
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,010
Bed 9.

800
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,480
Nothing serious.

801
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,410
You're just slightly swollen.

802
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,540
Take this prescription to get the medicine.

803
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,550
You'll be fine after a few days of rest.

804
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,080
I'm okay?

805
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,600
Look at the X-ray.

806
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Make sure they didn't misdiagnose me.

807
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,910
Look.

808
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,700
Are my bones okay?

809
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,170
Lin Luxiao,

810
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,050
are you playing with me?

811
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,400
You're dating Nan Chu and now, you're an actor too?

812
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,490
I'm going to strangle you.

813
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,370
It hurts.

814
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,130
It still hurts.

815
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,600
Be gentle.

816
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,640
You swore earlier.

817
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,110
Don't go back on your word.

818
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,140
Are you just going to let Lou Mingye

819
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,060
do what he wants?

820
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,590
I'll take care of it.

821
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,820
Sit down.

822
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,660
Stop squatting.

823
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,070
How are you?

824
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,370
He's fine.

825
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,550
He's fine.

826
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,690
The order is here.

827
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,990
I'm okay.

828
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,290
It's just a scratch.

829
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,380
What do you mean you're fine?

830
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,480
You bled so much.

831
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,160
Well,

832
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,970
we organized your clothes

833
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,190
at the station.

834
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,570
and bought you some food.

835
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,460
Take some time to rest up.

836
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,510
Don't worry about other things.

837
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,310
We can handle it.

838
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:48,610
Yes.

839
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,740
Take a few days off.

840
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,570
You're back?

841
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,210
What time is it?

842
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:57,640
What time is it?

843
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,040
Almost 11.

844
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,580
Oh no.

845
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,730
It's okay.

846
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,570
Help me up. Hurry.

847
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,120
Okay.

848
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,510
[Merry Mutian]

849
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,930
Wait, guys.
[Merry Mutian]

850
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,440
[Merry Mutian]

851
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,030
Since it's such a good day,
[Merry Mutian]

852
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,660
shouldn't we go celebrate?
[Merry Mutian]

853
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,550
Of course.
[Merry Mutian]

854
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:12,590
Of course.

855
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,260
What do you want to eat?

856
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,760
Tell me.

857
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,480
Let me think about it.

858
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:14,980
[Lin Luxiao]
Let me think about it.

859
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,490
Nan Chu, where are you?
[Lin Luxiao]

860
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,380
[Lin Luxiao]

861
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,180
I have something else, so I'll pass.
[Lin Luxiao]

862
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,390
I have something else, so I'll pass.

863
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,210
Coach Lin?

864
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,380
Then, go ahead.

865
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,350
Wait.

866
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,230
Nan Chu.

867
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:26,820
I'm not—

868
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,080
I'm not trying to interfere,

869
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,900
but you're about to start filming.

870
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,070
Shouldn't you and Coach Lin

871
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,420
keep a low profile?

872
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,060
There's nothing shameful between us.

873
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,490
I know, I know.

874
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,750
But I've been in this industry for so long.

875
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,260
Listen to me. Keep a low profile.

876
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,310
You nag too much.

877
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:41,990
I'm leaving.

878
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,330
Go ahead.

879
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:43,790
You're so naggy.

880
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,880
Nan Chu, keep it in mind.

881
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,020
Go ahead.

882
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,120
Oh, you.

883
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,840
Sorry.

884
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,190
I'm late.

885
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:13,990
What's wrong?

886
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,390
Don't break your promise again,

887
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,060
got it?

888
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,870
I won't.

889
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,620
If I knew you were such a good actor,

890
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,090
I should have let you audition.

891
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,080
Really.

892
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
It really hurts.

893
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:32,810
What's wrong?

894
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,190
I got hurt on duty.

895
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,460
Are you dumb?

896
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,850
Why did you pick me up when you hurt your back?

897
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,060
Of course I have to pick you up.

898
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:40,410
Let's go home.

899
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,730
What? You want to drive?

900
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,000
Aren't you all

901
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,030
giving Instructor Lin a harder time?

902
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,540
Actually,

903
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,940
it's not entirely your fault.

904
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,700
I don't know

905
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,380
what's wrong with us all.

906
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,420
Shiquan,

907
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:17,930
what's with your attitude now?

908
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:18,560
What are your thoughts?

909
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,410
I hurt Instructor Lin

910
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,050
and everyone.

911
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,190
It's my fault.

912
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,290
Okay.

913
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,840
It already happened

914
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,680
and we don't blame you.

915
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,280
Let me ask you.

916
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,460
Do you dare to write a joint letter with us

917
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,590
to replace Lou Mingye?

918
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:34,390
Liu,

919
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,700
let Shiquan wash up first.

920
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,730
Yu, stop being so wishy-washy all the time.

921
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,870
It always ends in a mess.

922
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,550
What do you mean?

923
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,720
Everyone is tired today.

924
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,610
We've had a hard day.

925
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,450
Tired?

926
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,370
You know it's tiring?

927
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,760
It's tiring because of Lou Mingye.

928
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:49,640
Have you forgotten

929
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,350
how he treated you?

930
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,240
Ever since Lou Mingye came

931
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,750
and made Unit 1 and Unit 2,

932
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,640
we haven't had a single good day.

933
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:56,990
Let me ask you.

934
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,460
Will you write the joint letter or not?

935
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,630
Of course not.

936
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,070
The thing is, this won't solve the problem.

937
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,040
Okay.

938
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,720
Then let's wait for Lou Mingye

939
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,510
to ruin us all.

940
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,560
That'll solve the problem.

941
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,450
Let's be more understanding of each other.

942
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,600
Besides, Lou Mingye

943
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,490
doesn't have any bad intentions.

944
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:16,770
You protect him.

945
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,990
