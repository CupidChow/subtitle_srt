Let me clarify.

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,350
Once you enter the building,

54
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,410
turn on the PASS device on your right shoulder.

55
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,460
When you press the button

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,060
and stay still

57
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,320

tell your coach immediately.

Now, Instructor Yang

68
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,030
will further elaborate on the drill.

69
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,600
We discussed it and decided

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,400
to use a set of criteria

71
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,660
that are more suitable for you

72
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,460
to assess your ability.

73
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,440
If you pass the test successfully,

74
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,200
you'll be able to

75
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,670
go on missions with our firefighters

76
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,100
as trainees.

77
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,120
If you fail the test,

78
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,960
you won't be given a second chance.

79
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,100
Therefore,

80
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,110
the test

81
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,170
won't be too hard.

82
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:18,840
In other words,

83
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,620
you just need to walk out of the fire.

84
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,960
You don't need to rescue the trapped people.

85
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,760
Report.

Please don't lower the bar.

89

I think I can meet the standards

90
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,400
that real firefighters can.

91
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,870
No.

92
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,430
From now on,

93
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,480
no one

94
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,990
is allowed to make any requests.

95
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,630
Go on, Instructor Yang.

96
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,300
Next,

98
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,410

107
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,370
I want to partner up with Director Lin.

108
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,900
Do as you're told.

109
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,670
If anyone

110
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,380
wants to quit,

111
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,480
raise your hand now.

112
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,710
If no one wants out,

113
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,310
I'll emphasize the disciplines again.

114
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,750
Under any circumstances,

115
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,090
you should follow orders

116
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,560
and do as you're told.

117
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,990
Without my permission,

118
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,680
no one is allowed to act alone.

119
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,230
Understand?

120
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,240
Yes.

121
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,540
You have five minutes to get prepared.

122
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:26,800
Starting now.

123
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,750
You're panting so heavily.

124
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,790
Listen.

125
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,840
When we're up there,

126
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,360
tell me immediately if you feel uncomfortable.

127
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,670
It's fine to be weaker than others. Okay?

128
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,230
Weak is not the word for me.

129
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,430
The situation up there is different from what you think.

130
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,350

131
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,530
Say no more.

132
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,870
I won't slow you down later.

133
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,300

134
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,770
don't help me.

135
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,290

136

Are you sure you can do it?

138
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,220
It won't be easy.

139
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,280
I can do it.

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,100
Go in if you're ready.

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,980
Okay.

143
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,440
Come with me.

144
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,560

145

Don't be nervous. Relax.

Keep breathing.

Don't be nervous.

Relax.

Relax.

151
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,780

Let's go.

Are you okay?

159
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,630
Give up if you can't hold on.

160

Wait.

161
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,310
I can do it.

162
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,290
Are you sure?

163
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,720
Go on.

164
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,740

Keep breathing.

Don't be afraid.

Relax.

174
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,060
Relax.

175
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,160
Can you do it?

176
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,000
Shall we continue?

177
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,650
Do this if you can.

178
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:00,910
Okay.

179
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go.

180
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,000
Let me help you up.

181
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,170
I can get up myself.

182
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,490
She's good.

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,010
She's good.

184
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,660
Breathe.

185

How do you feel?

186
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,910
Breathe.

187
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,670
You'll be fine soon.

188
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,240
Let's go get you some water.

189
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,120
Come.

190
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,510
Great!

191
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,600
Great!

192
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,900
Awesome!

193
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,040
Few girls can make it.

194
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,890
Take a break.

195
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,160
Lin is taking off the breathing apparatus for her.

196
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,290
He's never done that for anyone before.

197
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,200
Can you do it for me too?

198
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,800
You know what?

199
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,560
What you did…

200
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,400
Well done.

201
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,280
We'll be relieved.

202
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,050
Lin, you're already 30.

203
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,440
You can do it.

204
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,070
Wait.

205
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,420
Hurry.

206
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,640
What are you doing?

207
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,320
Why are you all so excited?

208
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,660
The second group.

209
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,550
Jiang Ge, Liu Ruyi.

210
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,640
Get ready.

211
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,010
Come on.

212
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,270
Keep up.

213
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,130
Hurry.

214
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,690
You look tall and strong.

215
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,420
Why are you so slow?

216
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,650
Can you do it?

217
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,370
You can't save anyone if you move so slowly.

218
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,250
Come on.

219
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,020
It's too hot.

220
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,660
So hot.

221
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,800
You said you can meet the standards

222
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,930
that firefighters can.

223
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,490
Now you should know

224
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,120
how weak you are

225
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,310
compared to real firefighters.

226
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,400
Hurry up.

227
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,120
We can't stay here. Let's go.

228
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,680
Stop dawdling.

229
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,520
Keep up.

230
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,600
Look at this screen.

231
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,190
Anyway, the damage

232
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
the fire caused to this part

233
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,800
and the third and fourth floors…

234
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,030
Hurry up.

235
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,760
My goodness.

236
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,570
Can you do it, big guy?

237
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,910
Come on.

238
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,430
Tell me if you can't hold on anymore.

239
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,770
I'll carry you out.

240
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,910
Let me show you

241
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,170
what a real firefighter can do.

242
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:11,880
I got it.

243
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,770
So stubborn.

244
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,160
My mission is to get you out safely.

245
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,550
This way.

246
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,250
Are you okay?

247
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,150
Hurry.

248
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,280
This way.

249
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,140
Here it is.

250
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,420
Come out and it's over.

251
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,290
Where are you going?

252
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:48,880
Come back.

253
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,180
Where are you going?

254
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,410
The people we need to save are over there!

255
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,010
Rescuing trapped people

256
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,570
is the training for firefighters.

257
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,910
You just need

258
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,760
to walk out of that door.

259
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,680
I told you.

260
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,250
I can do what firefighters can.

261
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,400
You're already stumbling. Just go out.

262
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,130
Are you crazy?

263
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,300
Why are you so stubborn?

264
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,520
I am crazy!

265
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,530
I insist!

266
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,050
No one can look down on me!

267
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,780
Big guy.

268
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,420
Come back.

269
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,270
Fine.

270
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,660
I'll wait for you here

271
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,420
and see how you can get it out.

272
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:25,930
Make it fast!

273
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,030
Big guy.

274
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,500
Are you all right?

275
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,440
Just tap out and come out!

276
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,280
It's not embarrassing.

277
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,950
What's going on?

278
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,920
What is Liu doing?

279
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,880
Oh, no.

280
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,190
Big guy.

281
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,370
Big guy.

282
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,670
Oh my god.

283
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,760
You can't be serious.

284
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,400
What's going on?

285
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,030
What's that sound?

286
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:17,940
What's going on?

287
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,880
Hold on, you brat!

288
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,040
How is he?

289
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,680
I got him.

290
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,480
He's awake.

291
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,660
Are you okay?

292
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,540
Are you okay?

293
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,050
Wake up.

294
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,220
-Wake up.
-Water.

295
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,410
Take him to drink water.

296
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:43,920
Yes.

297
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,030
The drill is over.

298
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,080
Liu Ruyi, come with me.

299
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:48,790
Yes.

300
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,070
One, two, three, up.

301
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,320
Are you out of your mind?

302
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,790
You're a firefighter. Why didn't you stop him?

303
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,180
Are you out of your mind?

304
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,200
Mr. Jiang.

305
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,160
Come on.

306
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,670
-I don't get it.
-Stand up.

307
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,310
You know

308
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,950
that training in real fire is dangerous.

309
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,010
If anything happened to them here,

310
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,070
it'd be gross negligence on our part.

311
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,950
Don't you know that?

312
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,710
You're an old firefighter.

313
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,020
I'll say no more.

314
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,280
After this ends,

315
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,250
you'll be punished according to the rules.

316
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,510
Any problem?

317
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,540
Director Lin.

318
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,430
Sorry.

319
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,280
I wanted to play hero.

320
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,170
It had nothing to do with Assistant Liu.

321
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,140
Are you hurt?

322
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,050
Listen.

323
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,820
All the training

324
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,040
for the artist group

325
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,300
stops now.

326
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,200
You can't do that.

327
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,540
We haven't gone in there yet.

328
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,010
Yes. Give us a chance.

329
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,640
Let us try.

330
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,150
I've been training for so long.

331
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,670
I want to go in too.

332
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,720
Dismissed.

333
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,300
Director Lin.

334
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,190
It's all my fault.

335
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,790
I'll take the responsibility.

336
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,430
You can punish me however you want.

337
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,940
It has nothing to do with them.

338
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,160
They're innocent.

339
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,380
Yes, Director Lin.

340
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,340
We didn't do anything wrong, right?

341
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:16,900
Give us a chance.

342
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,000
Director Lin, we'll do our best.

343
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,720
Please give us a chance.

344
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,180
Yes.

345
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,890
Director Lin.

346
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,700
First of all, you're a team.

347
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,010
Secondly,

348
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,650
in fire and rescue,

349
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,920
such a mistake is unforgivable.

350
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,270
Because your mistake

351
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,820
will affect your teammates.

352
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,790
They may get injured,

353
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:34,800
faint,

354
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,430
or even lose their lives.

355
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,790
So I don't think it's a small mistake.

356
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,560
Firefighters

357
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,530
can't make such a mistake.

358
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,140
Director Lin.

359
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,780
Everyone makes mistakes.

360
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,380
Even a firefighter like you

361
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,760
who has been trained hundreds of times

362
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,690
makes mistakes too.

363
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,280
At times like this,

364
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,210
anyone would wish

365
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,640
to have a chance to correct their mistakes.

366
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,790
That mistake could've been avoided.

367
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,980
If you guys

368
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,530
were not so eager to prove yourself

369
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,010
and had considered the consequences,

370
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,610
that mistake wouldn't have been made.

371
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,470
If we can learn from our mistakes,

372
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,150
mistakes can be a kind of education too.

373
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,090
I believe that's how every firefighter

374
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,680
improves himself.

375
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,530
Please trust us.

376
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,040
Please give us another chance.

377
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,300
-Give us one more chance.
-Yes.

378
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,270
Yes, Director Lin.

379
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,780
-Please give us one more chance.
-Please.

380
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,330
Director Lin.

381
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,800
I promise.

382
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,310
I won't do it again.

383
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,740
I'll put safety first.

384
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,280
This training is not optional.

385
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,390
But it's too hard for you

386
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,080
to put out fires now

387
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,010
and I don't want you to take the risk.

388
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,280
There are other simple real-fire drills

389
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,260
that you can have.

390
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,040
I can arrange them for you later.

391
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,350
Thank you, Director Lin.

392
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,530

398

Be careful after you go in.

399
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,590
If anything goes wrong,

400
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,020
I'll rush up.

401
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,860
Just stick to the plan.

402
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,210
Save the one you should save.

403
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,930
Pull them out.

404
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,610
Stay safe.

405
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,040
Safety comes first.

406
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:25,800
Come on.

407
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,380
One, two, three. We can do it!

408
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,440
Later,

409
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,540
we'll do it as we did in the training.

410
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,840
You'll break the door down.

411
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,270
I'll pour water three times

412
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,280
before we rush in.

413
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,540
When we're in there,

414
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,050
help me hold the hose.

415
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,620

416
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:52,970
Are you okay?

417
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,850
I'm fine.

418
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,500
Quit if it's too much for you.

419
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,140
I'm worried about your safety.

420
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,070
It's not like you.

421
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,790
The normal you would want the drill harder.

422
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,490
Now I think safety is the most important.

423
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,840
Don't worry.

424
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,140
I know what I'm doing.

425
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,320
Really?

426
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,010
Mr. Jiang.

427
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,990
I need to talk to you about the shooting.

428
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,230
Are you done?

429
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,830
You asked me

430
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,590
how firefighters overcome fear.

431
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,570
I'll answer you now.

432
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,710
No one can completely overcome fear.

433
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,810
We're all scared more or less.

434
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,450
So am I.

435
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,630
Sometimes, I'm afraid too.

436
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,710
I was once on a rescue mission

437
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,180
in which

438
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,160
the father smoked in bed and lit the covers.

439
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,220
The door was blocked

440
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,780
so the kid couldn't get out.

441
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,170
When I arrived,

442
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,060
the kid was already burnt

443
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,120
beyond recognition.

444
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,860
Was I scared?

445
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,710
I couldn't be scared.

446
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,520
Because I couldn't hesitate.

447
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,450
If I did,

448
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,210
more lives would be lost.

449
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,240
So it's fine.

450
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,500
We all get afraid.

451
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,180
When you're afraid,

452
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,740
yell inside

453
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,170
to brace yourself up.

454
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,520
Yell?

455
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,190
Yes.

456
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,200

00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,130
Be my guest.

764
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:18,930
Let's eat.

765
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,380
The live comments of the show

766
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,600
are all about

767
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,960
how great you and Director Lin look together.

768
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,100
How about we ship you two together?

769
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,910
Please don't.

770
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,920
It's not like he and I are really a thing.

771
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,060
Besides,

772
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,740
we are not doing a dating show.

773
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,080
Don’t mislead the audience.

774
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,560
I agree.

775
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,370
Otherwise, your boyfriend Lin Qi

776
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,590
would be upset, right?

777
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,940
I don't want to do that either.

778
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,620
This show is about firefighting.

779
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,010
Lin Qi?

780
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,070
He's just my friend.

781
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,370
I don't have a boyfriend.

782
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,210
So you're single?

783
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,070
Me too.

784
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,020
What kind of guy do you like?

785
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,150
I mean…

786
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,340
Does he have to be good-looking?

787
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,230
Or considerate?

788
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,410
Or

789
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,680
talented?

790
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,420
You're not my type.

791
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,130
Wait.

792
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,100
What's wrong with me?

793
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,620
Don't be biased against me.

794
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,020
I'm not a playboy.

795
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,440
I'm serious about relationships.

796
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,050
I once suffered a lot in love.

797
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,740
You don't believe me?

798
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,050
I do.

799
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,150
You're a great man.

800
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,500
Or you wouldn't have made such a great show.

801
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:41,960
Right?

802
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,870
Thank you for buying me lunch today.

803
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,390
This restaurant is quite good.

804
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,860
Bring everyone here next time.

805
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,530
I'll pay the bill.

806
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,550
I don't mind paying the bill.

807
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,470
But honestly,

808
00:35:59,050 --> 00:35:59,940
I'm curious.

809
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,950
What kind of guy do you like?

810
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,000
I don't think there's a standard.

811
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,430
It's all about feelings.

812
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,960
Then have you ever had feelings for anyone?

813
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,740
Yes.

814
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,560
What kind of person is he?

815
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,950
He's a hero.

Isn't it obvious?

930
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,490
Then they fell out

931
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,410
and threw alcohol

932
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,470
at each other.

933
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,560

I just checked.

944
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,520

945
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,530
and their wounds didn't get treated properly in time.

946
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,050

00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,140
What's all this about?

952
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,570
Don't touch the ground.

953
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,580
Hold him.

954
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,760
Hold him. Don't let him touch the ground.

955
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,060
Go inside to check on the son.

956
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,870
Help him up. Help him up.

957
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,590
Can you see it clearly?

958
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,380
No.

959
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,150
You two go out.

960
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,370
I'll talk to him.

961
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,880
Don't touch the wounds.

962
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,760
Close the door.

963
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,520
Old sod.

964
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,200
Bro.

965
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,540
Who are you?

966
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,630
It doesn't matter.

967
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,600
I'll make it short.

968
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,070
Your vision is blurred

969
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,950
due to minor burns.

970
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,330
But your father has got serious

971
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,010
extensive burns.

972
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,100
What you should do now

973
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,200
is go out and talk to him.

974
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,160
Both of you need to calm down.

975
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:34,630
Okay?

976
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,260
I…

977
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,170
This is the situation.

978
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,600
If

979
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,610
you want your dad to recover,

980
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,630
go out and talk to him.

981
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,180
Both of you need to calm down

982
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,280
and go to the hospital.

983
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,540
Your burns are very severe.

984
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,150
Okay.

985
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,670
Come on.

986
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,040
Give me your hand.

987
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:08,940
How about this?

[Tips for Fire Safety]

989
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,100
If you catch on fire,

990
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,480
don't run around.

991
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,370
The flow of air will make the fire spread.

992
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,840
The faster you run, the bigger the fire.

993
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,520
Don't shout either,

994
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,960
because you'll inhale hot air and smoke.

995
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,270
Burns in the airway are fatal.

996
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,700
Your head and face are the most vulnerable.

997
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,390
Use your hands to put out the fire on your face first.

998
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,110
Then lie on your stomach

999
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,330
to extinguish the fire on your chest.

1000
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,050
At last, roll left and right

1001
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,480
to put out the fire on your back.
