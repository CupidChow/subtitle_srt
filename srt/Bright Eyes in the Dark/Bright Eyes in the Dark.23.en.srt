the instructor helped me out a lot.

22

My mom wanted to treat him to a meal

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,370
but he kept refusing it.

24
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,770

I always think

46
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,080
that the competitive system is an opportunity.

47
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,890
If we seize this opportunity,

Since Director Lou proposed a competitive system,

57
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,560
we should seize this opportunity

188
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,090
This time,

189
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,570
it wasn't a major mistake.

190
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,050
The punishment is too serious.

191
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,280
Qi Huo does have the map memorized well,

192
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,520
but he lacks experience.

193
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,290
Transfer Fang back to the duty of driving Truck 1.

194
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,720
I think the personnel transfer this time is fine.

195
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,690
The rules have been set.

196
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,080
I have to stick to my principles.

197
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,560
What rules?

198
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,800
I know what I'm doing

199
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,560
is selfish.

I can't let the people in the station gossip.

204
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,060
I can't let the people in the station gossip.

205
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,720
Understand?

206
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,920
Leave this to me.

207
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,040
Okay?

208
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,450
Sure.

209
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,680
As long as you understand what I mean.

210
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,450
I understand.

211
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,320
Why?

212
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,680
Just because I'm your son,

213
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,530
my efforts have to go in vain?

214
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,320
Just because I'm your son,

215
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,340
if I make any achievement,

216
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,220
it's because of nepotism

217
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,320
and because of my father's backing?

218
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,620
Do you know

219
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,840
what I've done all these years?

220
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,460
I've travelled throughout the whole district,

221
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,180
the whole of Binxi

222
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,170
and the whole of Beixun.

223
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,100
I like this job

224
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,680
and I can do it well.

225
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,860
But why?

226
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,730
Because of your pride,

227
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,160
I mustn't accomplish anything!

228
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,040
[Fire Rescue
Deputy Captain]

229
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,320
Watch your language.

230
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,930
You're at the brigade,

231
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,330
not at home.

232
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:13,850
Fine.

233
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,170
Then may I ask

234
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,220
if you're holding me accountable

235
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,460
from the position of a superior

236
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,690
or a father?

237
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,970
If it's as a superior,

238
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,720
then it's fine.

239
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,330
Deputy Captain Meng.

240
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,740
Please give me a logical reason.

241
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,580
Tell me

242
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,330
why I can't drive Truck 1.

243
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,450
If Detective Lou agrees,

244
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,040
then I'll do as I'm ordered to.

245
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,450
But if you're doing this as my father,

246
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,970
then I have a question for you.

247
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,800
What right do you think you have to do this?

248
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,600
[Fire Rescue
Deputy Captain]

249
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:05,840
All right.

250
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,330
Don't blame me for lecturing you.

251
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,800
You didn't handle this appropriately indeedly.

252
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,740
You think so too?

253
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,570
Of course.

254
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,700
This kid worked so hard

255
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,680
to become a firefighter.

256
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,320
How great is that?

257
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,200
I've heard from Luxiao

258
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,500
that Qi Huo

259
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,620
is like a human map.

260
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,330
He's quite like you.

261
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,960
You were the same back then.

262
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,560
If you didn't remember one route,

263
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,500
after the lights are out every night,

264
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,800
you'd report to me to ask to head out to do the Six Familiarities.

265
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,560
You were even memorizing the map in your dreams.

266
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,050
I think Qi Huo chose this profession

267
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,170
because of your influence.

268
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,340
But look at you.

269
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,800
Not only did you not praise him,

270
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,850
but you even beat him down.

271
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,450
Well.

272
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,570
Sir.

273
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,400
There's already a discussion within the station.

274
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,720
I don't think it's good.

275
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,440
I'm just trying to avoid suspicion.

276
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,980
Ever since he joined the station,

277
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,580
have you helped him out

278
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,160
or has he relied on you for anything?

279
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:10,930
No.

280
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,810
Then what suspicion is there?

281
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,560
What are you avoiding?

282
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,320
You're right.

283
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,200
Look.

284
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,680
I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't.

285
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,200
Of course.

286
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,280
Listen to my advice.

287
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,440
Make it clear to your kid when you have time.

288
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,090
Don't be such a dad

289
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,620
by dispelling his enthusiasm

290
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,180
to be a firefighter.

291
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,680
Yes.

292
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,560
What did you just say?

293
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,160
I'm such a dad?

294
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,400
And you're not like that?

295
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,810
Sir.

296
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,440
Whenever you see Luxiao,

297
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,030
why does your face become...

298
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,450
Fine.

299
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,930
I'll stop.

300
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,840
Let me tell you the truth.

301
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,620
I

302
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,400
don't know how to talk to my kids either.

303
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,080
I always want to sit down and talk to them properly.

304
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,320
I was always mentally prepared

305
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,560
to not lose my temper this time

306
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,320
and to not blame them.

307
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,200
But whenever we met,

308
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,080
I couldn't help but lose my temper.

309
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,530
I couldn't help but act like a dad.

310
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,600
It's because of my idol baggage.

311
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,080
It's because of my idol baggage.

312
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,680
Yes.

313
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,960
What do you mean by yes?

314
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,400
Meng, it's the same for you too.

315
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,970
You have idol baggage.

316
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,730
Me?

317
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,050
Yes.

318
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,690
-Yes.
-Come on.

319
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,330
Have a drink.

320
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,450
Thank you.

321
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,460
Have some food.

322
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,040
Here.

323
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,840
Report.

324
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,520
Come in.

325
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,570
What is it?

326
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,280
Director Lou.

327
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,160
What's the matter?

328
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,800
Are you going to transfer me away from Truck 1?

329
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,440
Why?

330
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,170
You got the job with your own capability.

331
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,210
But

332
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,930
there are many rumors in the station recently.

333
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,320
Are they rumors about your identity

334
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,680
or about your capability?

335
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,440
Maybe...

336
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,210
both.

337
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,050
But, Director Lou,

338
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,860
I've never once

339
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,120
been proud of my identity.

340
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,380
I've also never once obtained any advantages

341
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,720
because of this identity.

342
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,010
On the contrary,

343
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,090
I think this identity has always been a burden to me.

344
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,620
Every step I take

345
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,770
gets heavier.

346
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,740
Every step I take

347
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,800
gets heavier.

348
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,650
Sometimes I think...

349
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,570
I think I have to put in more effort

350
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,060
and energy

351
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,970
to get the same thing like them.

352
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,290
Why?

353
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,530
If you're confused because of your identity,

354
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,080
then I can tell you directly

355
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,040
that it can't be changed.

356
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,160
Even if you drive Truck 2 now,

357
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,610
you'll still be Captain Meng's son.

358
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,400
If you're confused because of your capability,

359
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,480
then you've already proved yourself previously.

360
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,220
My competitive system

361
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,720
is fair to everyone.

362
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,800
If someone does his job better than you,

363
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,280
I will naturally replace you with him.

364
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,880
But I don't want them to talk about me anymore.

365
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,250
Raise your head.

366
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,080
Raise your head.

367
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,280
I understand how you feel.

368
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,890
So what if they're talking about you?

369
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,370
Do we have to change our principles and ways of doing things

370
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,080
just because people are talking about us?

371
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,760
People have been talking about me the whole time.

372
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,520
So what?

373
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,090
I'm still me.

374
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,850
I want to fight for every chance.

375
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,240
Instead of giving it to others,

376
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,810
why don't you seize it?

377
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,880
Someone can always do better.

378
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,890
Then why can't that someone be me?

379
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,800
Just like you.

380
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,560
Truck 1 is parked there.

381
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,570
Someone has to drive it.

382
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,010
Tell me.

383
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,170
Do you want to drive it?

384
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,380
Yes.

385
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,260
Louder.

386
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,940
Yes.

387
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,480
Okay.

388
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,490
Then the station's decision stays valid.

389
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,010
Before a more capable person shows up,

390
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,330
you'll still be the driver of Truck 1.

391
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,090
Yes.

392
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,400
Many firefighting organizations abroad

393
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,250
have already started using thermal drones

394
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,530
for crisis situations

395
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,280
like search and rescue missions,

396
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,640
forest fires, and city fires.

397
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,480
Thermal drones

398
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,770
can conduct remote command

399
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,560
and send back a high resolution image in real time.

400
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,620
I believe that in the future,

401
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,880
it will become a very important part

402
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,000
in the emergency rescue process.

403
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,530
So I hope that everyone

404
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,720
in our station

405
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,360
can master this technique.

406
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,810
It will also be included in your daily training assessment.

407
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,630
So from today onwards,

408
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,370
I’ll increase the training in this area.

409
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,810
Are there any questions?

410
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,240
Reporting to Director Lou.

411
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,170
I have a question.

412
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,740
What is the principle

413
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,880
behind the rescue by thermal drones?

414
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,360
Shiquan, this is a great question.

415
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,610
The drones can provide us with the bird's-eye view

416
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,060
so that we can see

417
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,860
the area of land out of our vision

418
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,410
and the areas we might have missed.

419
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,880
It can also draw the map of the fire scene

420
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,160
and locate the missing persons.

421
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,610
I hope everyone can work hard to learn it

422
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,090
and train hard.

423
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,640
To be honest,

424
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,700
the brigade has always wanted to transfer a few people

425
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,810
from the station to the Logistics Department.

426
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,080
If anyone can't adapt

427
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,320
or reach the training requirements,

428
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
no matter who he is

429
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,640
or what position he is in,

430
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,250
he won't make it.

431
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,570
You'll all be removed from the front line.

432
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,360
Understand?

433
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,530
Yes.

434
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,490
Dad.

435
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,380
We've taken care of

436
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,500
Lin Qi's termination agreement.

437
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,780
And he promised

438
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,380
to join our communication platform

439
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,600
and become the first regular user.

440
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,800
By the way,

441
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,320
I've contacted Deng Yi

442
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,530
for your dancer friend.

443
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,080
This is his name card.

444
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,580
You can ask her to give Deng Yi a call first.

449
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,800
Whether they'll make a deal

450
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,480
will depend on their own capability.

451
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,850
That's great, Dad.

452
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,130
I'll tell Nan Chu now.

453
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,810
Thank you, Dad.

454
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,520
Look at you.

455
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,610
Looks like Instructor Yang has been recovering well.

456
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,800
How long are you going to be at the Motian Peak?

457
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,130
We'll be back this weekend.

458
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,810
Nan Chu.

459
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,570
I have good news for you.

460
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,900
My dad has contacted

461
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,560
the director of Beixun Theater for you.

462
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,810
I’ll send you his WeChat business card right now.

463
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,160
Add him and contact him.

00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:06,760

466
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,090
It's really Deng Yi.

467
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,650
Thank you.

468
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,170
Coach Lin.

469
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,360
I have good news for you when you come back.

470

Xi Gu.

471
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,460
How's it going with the house

472
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,640
that I asked you to look for?

473
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,860
Didn't I tell you?

474
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,380
Don't worry about the cost.

475
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,570
The company will pay for it.

476
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,000
The most important thing for a house

477
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,060
that two girls are living in is the safety,

478
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,610
right?

479
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,650
Yes.

480
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,460
Check out Sunshine Garden City Community.

481
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,560
I think it's decent.

482
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,330
Yes.

483
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,020
Check out the houses over...

484
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,000
over there...

485
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,720
I have to go.

486
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,980
W-Why are you here?

487
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,220
What are you busy with?

488
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,810
Nothing.

489
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,530
I was contacting a talent agent.

490
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,740
Isn't Nan Chu's course over?

491
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,080
I want to see if there's any job suitable for her.

492
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,300
I heard you talking about housing

493
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,940
and Sunshine Garden City.

494
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,540
I thought you were looking for a house.

495
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,090
No.

496
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,810
Don't you live in Sunshine Garden City?

497
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,520
You have a good memory.

498
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,490
Don't be so nervous.

499
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,660
As long as nothing goes wrong at work,

500
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,800
I won't ask about your private life.

501
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,970
I just want to ask you

502
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,130
what Nan Chu is busy with lately.

503
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,080
Nan Chu is conducting the dance rehearsals with Dream Dance Club.

504
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,020
I heard that Jiang Ge's company

505
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,120
contacted the director of Beixun Theater.

506
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,300
If things go well,

507
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,650
they may perform there.

508
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,420
She'll be performing too?

509
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,220
No.

510
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,060
Don't worry.

511
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,300
She told me

512
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,700
that she would never break the company's contract rules.

513
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,020
She just wants to promote the Dream Dance Club.

514
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,080
She will never personally participate in the performance.

515
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,760
Okay.

516
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,620
Go ahead with your work.

517
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,120
Okay.

[Heping Road Fire and Rescue Special Division Station, Binxi District, Beixun City]

519
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,810
Director Lou.

520
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,560
You're still up?

521
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,080
What's up?

522
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,460
Are you studying

523
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,570
new drone functions?

524
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,090
There was a lecture two days ago

525
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,410
about how drones help in rescue

526
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,000
and it left me with a deep impression.

527
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,600
I'll practice it first

528
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,360
and promote it to everyone later.

Director Lou.

530
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,540
I think your drones

531
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,800
and canyoning skills are very impressive.

532
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,810
I want to learn from you.

533
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,560
Where's Shiquan?

534
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,500
He probably went to the activity room.

535
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,840
They said they were going to revise on what they learnt about the new technology.

Don't be afraid of that paper tiger.

didn't we still rescue people all the same?

Remember.

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,380
This is the Special Division Station,

Machines are not omnipotent when it comes to rescue.

In the end,

553
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,000
you'll still have to rely on the people doing the job.

554
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:14,780
All right, Liu.

555
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,970
Stop talking.

556
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,490
Have you forgotten who you are?

557
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,840
It's inappropriate to say that.

As the director's assistant,

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,330
it's my duty to understand

562
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,880
how everyone thinks and help them solve

563
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,300
their practical problems.

564
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,940
Let's go, Yijiu.

565
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,490
Let's go take a look.

566
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,400
Okay.

567
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,410
This turned really quickly.

568
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,090
When will he accept it?

569
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,760
Turn on the drone, enter the center

570
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,250
and return to the flight interface.

571
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,220
It’s hard for me even to play with remote control cars.

572
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,810
How can I control drones?

573
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,220
Assistant Liu is here to learn with us.

574
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,690
I don't care about

575
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,720
his fancy tricks.

576
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,380
Assistant Liu.

577
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,330
You don't say.

578
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,560
Drones are really hard to understand.

579
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,880
The studying is giving me headaches.

580
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,140
Where's Shiquan?

581
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,020
Why don't I see him here?

582
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,330
I think he went to the garage.

583
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,490
Director Lou.

584
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,370
Since you came,

585
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,980
you've brought in these new technology

586
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,640
and new equipment.

587
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,850
I also gained a new understanding of fire rescue.

588
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,300
I never thought that drones

589
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,530
could participate in the rescue.

590
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,780
Even more so, I never thought

591
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,420
that high-altitude rescue

592
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,960
could be linked to canyoning.

593
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:33,840
Director Lou.

594
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,080
I know.

595
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,160
that since you came to the Special Division Station,

596
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,220
many people have disagreed with your training method

597
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,520
and rescue philosophy.

598
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,220
But I don't think it's a problem.

599
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,850
I think you've given young people like us

600
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,330
greater room for development.

601
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,650
It's good that you think so.

602
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,770
Your drone training today was also good.

603
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,890
Go back and work harder.

604
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:54,570
Keep up the good work.

605
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,120
Thank you, Director Lou.

606
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,160
But I

607
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,640
don't think I'm good enough yet.

608
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
I want to be like you

609
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,160
and become the most outstanding firefighter,

610
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,220
and use the most scientific

611
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,720
and best methods to conduct rescues.

612
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,620
But

613
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,970
only by your teaching can I achieve it.

614
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,560
So, Director Lou,

615
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,130
can you be my teacher?

616
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,760
My requirements are very strict.

617
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,080
Will you be able to take it?

618
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,320
No problem.

619
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,970
Come on, let me explain it to you.

620
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:28,530
Yes.

621
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:48,060
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

622
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:54,300
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

623
00:27:54,300 --> 00:28:00,330
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

624
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,870
Nan Chu.

625
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,410
What do you think of our dancing today?

626
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,020
What do you think?

627
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,160
I think it was especially great.

628
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,980
When Mr. Zhao gives us a new choreography,

629
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,780
we will definitely make a great leap of improvement.

630
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,090
Even I want to join you in the dance.

631
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,780
Nan Chu.

632
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,460
Are you really not going to dance with us?

633
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,140
It's the Beixun Theater.

634
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,180
Yes, Nan Chu.

635
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,700
Do you want to discuss with your company

636
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,880
and ask them to make an exception?

637
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,460
This is a rare opportunity.

638
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,850
Maybe it's our only opportunity in this lifetime.

639
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,290
Don't underestimate us.

640
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,160
Who says this is our only opportunity in this lifetime?

641
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,260
I can't join this time.

642
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,420
But next time,

643
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,140
I most definitely

644
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,330
will join you to perform on stage.

645
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,080
We'll wait for you.

646
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,880
Consider this as our warmup performance.

647
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,980
Come on.

648
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,760
Okay. Come on.

649
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,740
One, two, three.

650
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,170
Come on.

651
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,260
All right.

652
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,220
Go back and rest early.

653
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,440
You still have to practice tomorrow.

654
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,170
Okay.

655
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:48,780
We'll get going then.

656
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,740
We'll get going.

657
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,700
Bye.

658
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,890
Take care.

659
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,720
Bye.

660
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,970
Take care.

661
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,520
You've been rehearsing this dance for so long.

662
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,460
You must be disappointed

663
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,570
that you can't perform on stage.

664
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,980
Yes.

665
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,330
I'm even thinking about it in my dreams.

666
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,330
Then aren't you going to try harder?

667
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,420
Since I've signed the contract,

668
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,080
I have to follow the company's arrangement.

669
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,080
I've to follow their rules and be grateful.

670
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,320
Why are you looking at me like that?

671
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,080
I'm glad you think that way.

672
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,330
You take everything into account objectively.

673
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,400
This quality is very rare.

674
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,170
Do you mean it?

675
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,290
I'll never lie to you.

676
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,370
But there are advantages to not going on stage too.

677
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,220
I can figure out more objectively

678
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,130
what the problems of Dream Dance Club are.

679
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,720
Professor Jin once said

680
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,570
that emotions are the essence of acting.

681
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,480
Actually, it's the same for dancing too.

682
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,080
Dream Dance Club doesn't lack skills,

683
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,320
but emotions.

684
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,290
In other words,

685
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,610
it's weak in conveying the emotions.

686
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,970
The choreographer told us

687
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,560
to first delineate the theme and background of the dance.

688
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,420
But we have too many choices,

689
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,760
so we can't decide.

690
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,570
Do you remember

691
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,460
when I previously asked you

692
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,880
why you like dancing?

693
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,920
You told me

694
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,660
that you like how you feel on stage.

695
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,520
When you're dancing on stage,

696
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,040
you feel like you're shining.

697
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,960
So all these years,

698
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,370
no matter what difficulties you faced, you always persisted.

699
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,770
Then isn't your theme persistence?

700
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,000
I think you especially know how to be persistent.

701
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,560
And if the story has to be

702
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,000
based on reality,

703
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,940
then I think it'd be better if you can try to express

704
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,290
you can try to express the experiences

705
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,810
that you've been

706
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,360
deeply affected by.

707
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,570
Persistence?

708
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,000
Yes.

709
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,560
I think I know the direction now.

710
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,360
Maybe

711
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,760
it's been too long since I've been back.

712
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,080
I didn't pay the electricity bill.

713
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,130
I'll go check.

714
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,650
♫Are we destined to meet?♫

715
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,800
♫Will we miss each other, we're not sure yet♫

716
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,950
♫The vague memory becomes clear again♫

717
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,540
♫I accidentally realized that♫

718
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,240
♫We never brought it up♫

719
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:28,500
♫Touching your warm palm for the first time♫

720
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:35,870
♫It's your back that illuminates the jam-packed crowd♫

721
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,480
Fly it more steadily.

722
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,250
Okay.

723
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,570
Almost.

724
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,300
Fly it m-more steadily.

725
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:55,900
Be quiet.

726
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,760
Just remember what you're supposed to do.

727
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,380
How was it, Yijiu?

728
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,330
Did you fly it well?

729
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,440
What's wrong?

730
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,560
I was just a few seconds faster than you.

731
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,600
You don't have to pull a long face.

732
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,880
Just focus on your practice.

733
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,180
Yijiu.

734
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:28,780
Sorry.

735
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,460
Yijiu.

736
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,740
What's wrong with him? Why is he angry?

737
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,840
I don't know. Let's go.

738
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,330
Qin Shiquan's operation was very professional.

739
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,050
Qi Huo has improved a lot too.

740
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,970
I also have to remind some comrades

741
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,080
to adapt quickly.

742
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,330
We have a competitive system.

743
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,320
I'm not joking about it.

744
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,290
If you don't meet the standards of a front line operator,

745
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,090
you'll have to step out of the front line of fire extinguishing.

746
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,640
The competition is about to begin.

747
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,890
The upcoming training will be stricter.

748
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,650
The meeting this afternoon has been rescheduled to be an hour earlier.

749
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,090
You're dismissed.

750
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,850
Why didn't he just call me out by name?

751
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,970
Why did he have to talk about it in a roundabout way?

752
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,600
[Dorm]

753
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,480
Where are you going?

754
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,650
Reporting.

755
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,490
Come in.

756
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,640
Dagang.

757
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,200
What's wrong?

758
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,560
I...

759
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,770
just want to talk to you.

760
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,140
Here.

761
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,530
Bring over a chair.

762
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,420
What's wrong with you?

763
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,560
You look beat up

764
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,060
and listless.

765
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,880
Where did your usual vigor go?

766
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,890
Deputy Yu.

767
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,080
Do you know

768
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,280
that I joined the army right after I graduated from high school,

769
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,040
and after that, I was assigned to the Armed Forces Fire Brigade

770
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,250
and have been at this fire station since then?

771
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,050
I'm not educated.

772
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,440
I'm just a boor.

773
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,420
I can understand Director Lou's reform.

774
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,210
He's doing this for good of the Special Division Station.

775
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,090
If you're talking about

776
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,920
climbing

777
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,880
ladders

778
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,690
and walls,

779
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,570
although I'm not the strongest in our station,

780
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,960
I'm not bad at them either.

781
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,890
But now there are simulated trainings

782
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,170
and drones to deal with.

783
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,900
In terms of these skills, I'm really no match for

784
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,190
the younger kids like

785
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,690
Yijiu, Shiquan, and Qi Huo.

786
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,740
I'm no match for them.

787
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,820
Enough.

788
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,440
Dagang.

789
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,080
Don't be too anxious.

790
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,620
We are still young,

791
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,580
right?

792
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,680
We're not old yet.

793
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,130
Besides, studying

794
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,770
takes time.

795
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
The leaders

796
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,180
also wouldn't expect us

797
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,580
to master everything instantly.

798
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,120
Yes.

799
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,540
Deputy Yu.

800
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,780
I understand what you've just said.

801
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,280
But

802
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,770
you know about my family sitaution.

803
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,120
My wife

804
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,200
is just an ordinary office worker.

805
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,560
Her monthly salary isn't much.

806
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,280
My kid's in school now

807
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,170
and my parents are not healthy.

808
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,760
I can earn more in the front line.

809
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,570
But once I leave the front line,

810
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,000
I won't have a chance to be promoted.

811
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,410
Yu.

812
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,580
After so many years,

813
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,770
do you still not know me?

814
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,560
I really like working at the front line.

815
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:58,970
How about...

816
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,040
How about you...

817
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,360
talk to Director Lou for me?

818
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,700
Previously, I heard Zheng Yang

819
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,100
and An Weiren say

820
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,370
that they've been wanting to go to Logistics.

821
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,180
Why don't you just tell Director Lou

822
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,460
to stop with the competition

823
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,880
and just assign the duties based on personal preference?

824
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,000
Well,

825
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,090
how about this?

826
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,560
You go back first

827
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,930
and don't be anxious.

828
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,620
As for your situation,

829
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,380
I will discuss it with the director.

830
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,090
Yu.

831
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,140
Thank you so much.

832
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,040
Thank you so much, really.

833
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,120
For what?

834
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,530
Go back first.

835
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,730
Go back and wait for the news.

836
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,360
Don't worry.

837
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,580
Go on with your work.

838
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,340
I'll get going then.

839
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,010
Okay.

840
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,490
Where did you go?

841
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,500
Lei Dagang.

842
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,480
What are you trying to do?

843
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,930
What do you mean?

844
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,890
What did you say to the leader today?

845
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,020
Nothing.

846
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,850
Don't go first.

847
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,260
Don't think I don't know

848
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,820
that you went and said to the leader

849
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:41,850
that I want to go to Logistics.

850
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,930
Didn't you say that yourselves?

851
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,560
You said that the front line is too tiring

852
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,560
and that you want to work at Logistics instead?

853
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,480
Aren't you worried that you might be transferred away

854
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,640
because your results wouldn't be good?

855
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,630
Yes, Dagang.

856
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,890
You should compete openly,

857
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,080
fair and square.

858
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,120
Lei Dagang.

859
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,160
I thought you were an upright man.

860
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,580
I didn't expect you to be a tattletale

861
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,580
and talk behind my back.

862
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,560
Watch your mouth.

863
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,500
I'm talking about you.

864
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,180
Say it again.

865
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,100
You're a tattletale who talks behind others' backs.

866
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,760
Didn't you hear it the first time?

867
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,770
Let me tell you again.

868
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,200
You

869
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,900
are a tattletale who talks behind others' backs.

870
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,460
Zheng Yang.

871
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,760
What are you doing?

872
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,250
Why are you so idle?

873
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,680
Don't you know there's an assessment tomorrow?

874
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,570
Go for training now.

875
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,370
All of you.

876
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,760
Look right.

877
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,930
Look forward.

878
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,120
At ease.

879
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:40,840
