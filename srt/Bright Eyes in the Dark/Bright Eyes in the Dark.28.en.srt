192
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,720
Safety comes first.

193
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,800
It's not a big deal

194
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,800
that I got a mild injury.

195
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,450
But I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

196
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,560
I'm sorry, Master.

197
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm sorry, Yijiu.

198
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,920
It's all my fault.

199
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,600
Don't be mad at me.

200
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,960
I'll do my best from now on.

201
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,450
Shiquan.

202
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,570
I'm at fault too.

203
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,690
I shouldn't have talked to you like that.

204
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,330
I was wrong.

205
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,280
Don't be like this.

206
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,690
This is how it should be.

207
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,680
You two are childhood friends.

208
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,840
I saved both of you.

209
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,610
You grew up together

210
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,200
and have been working together as firefighters.

211
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,440
How could you have a conflict?

212
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,330
You two should be best friends.

213
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,290
If you can't even get along

214
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,330
with such a close-knit relationship,

215
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,840
how can others get along?

216
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,290
Be united.

217
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,560
All right.

218
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,440
It's good

219
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,210
how you've admitted to your mistakes quickly.

220
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,530
But we have rules in the station.

221
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,560
If you make a mistake,

222
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,200
you should be punished.

223
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,210
Right?

224
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:19,680
Yes.

225
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,610
Do you admit it?

226
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,450
-Yes.
-Yes.

227
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,560
How about this?

228
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,330
You two

229
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,920
should hold hands for today.

230
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,680
Before dinner,

231
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,920
you can't let go of your hands.

232
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,220
Master.

233
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,680
This punishment is too old-fashioned.

234
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,280
Who are you calling old-fashioned?

235
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,400
Hold hands now.

236
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,930
It's too awkward, Master.

237
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,700
Why don't we forget about it?

238
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,560
It's awkward?

239
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,330
Was it not awkward when you were in a fight?

240
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,920
Hold hands now.

241
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,930
Do you want me to do it for you?

242
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,100
Hold them tight.

243
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,930
Will it burn you?

244
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
We are grown men.

245
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,200
Is this okay?

246
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,450
Closer.

247
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,800
Closer.

248
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,820
Right?

249
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,560
Just like when you were young.

250
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,080
Two good friends

251
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,740
holding hands.

252
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,210
Go.

253
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:14,940
Follow me.

254
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,690
I'll show you around.

255
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,820
Master, please don't do this.

256
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,180
Come with me.

257
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,620
Let's just stop here.

258
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,160
There'll be so many people watching...

259
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,330
It'll be awkward.

260
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,320
You haven't had your afternoon break, have you?

261
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,600
Master.

262
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,040
Come and have a look.

263
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,090
It's our station's two best friends.

264
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:29,730
They're holding hands.

265
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,330
Hold them tight.

266
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,090
Hold them tight.

267
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,570
Hold them tight.

268
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,450
Good.

269
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:34,980
They're holding hands.

270
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,410
Go back.

271
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,740
Hurry up.

272
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,820
Keep close.

273
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,290
Can't we just forget about it?

274
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,170
Hold them tight.

275
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,320
Good, hold them tight.

276
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,690
Keep up.

277
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,570
Keep up.

278
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,600
Hold them tight.

279
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,440
Hold them tight.

280
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,720
-There are so many people.
-Hurry up.

281
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,400
Hurry up. Follow me.

282
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,690
It's all your fault.

284
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,810
Captain Meng.

285
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,680
Director Lou.

286
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,210
Is there anything wrong in the station?

287
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,450
It's time to report.

288
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:36,930
Yes.

289
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,200
Something happened at the station recently

290
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,920
but I can solve it.

291
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,720
Yes.

292
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,560
You can solve it.

293
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,450
But for this big competition,

294
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,680
you must stay focused.

295
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,840
If your team is not chosen,

296
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,210
let me tell you,

297
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,050
all of you will be doomed.

298
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,610
Okay.

299
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,400
We will work hard.

300
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,080
One more thing.

301
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,200
I think there's a good fire rescue exhibition.

302
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,690
I've registered for it for you and Luxiao.

303
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,810
Finish up with your work at hand

304
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,100
and attend it together.

305
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,160
Attend it together

306
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,680
and learn well.

307
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:15,570
Yes.

308
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,570
Okay.

309
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,200
That's it.

310
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:47,970
This is for you.

311
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,290
What do you mean?

312
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,810
It was obviously the boy who gave it to me.

Jiu.

314
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,080
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,210
I was wrong too.

316
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,560
All right.

317
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,570
Don't stare at me like that.

318
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,680
It's so awkward.

319
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,810
When I see this,

320
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,090
I recall the time

321
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,560
when we first came to the Special Division Station.

322
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,520
When we thought about going on missions,

323
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,530
we would be excited for days.

324
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,800
Back then, we were so

325
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,040
simple,

326
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:04,920
naive,

327
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,280
and passionate.

328
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,280
After work,

329
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,460
the director and instructor

330
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,530
even took care of us.

331
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,920
Tell me.

332
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,450
Back then,

333
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,930
why did we decide to become firefighters?

334
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,090
Back then...

335
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,210
Back then...

336
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,080
we didn't think too much.

337
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,130
All we thought about

338
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,650
was how to help more people.

339
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,610
Let's not forget our original intention.

340
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,640

Do you have a problem with me too?

345
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,970
I know...

346
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,290
that no one thinks I deserve to be the director.

347
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,360
And you are their most reliable leader.

348

Nothing I do is right.

A crown fire

351
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,220
is a forest fire that spreads across tree crowns.

352
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,500
The fire is fierce.

353
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,300
On average,

354
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,380
the spreading speed is 5 to 25 kilometers per hour.

355
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,970

what do you think they were thinking?

359
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,370
Major casualties result

360
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,320
because the terrain is dangerous and the huge elevation difference.

361
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,850
You came to our station

362
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,570
with new equipment,

363
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,090
new technology,

364
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,130
and new training methods.

365
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,050
You've made great improvements to the station.

366
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,880
It's a good thing.

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,480
The core of our team

381
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,330
is our people,

382
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,320
every one of us.

383
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,730
Our team spirit

384
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,530
depends on us.

385
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,360
It's comrades holding hands

386
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,800
and fighting side by side

387
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,320
with our lives.

388
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,770
So,

389
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,370
our team

390
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,290
must be united

391
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,840
and trust each other enough

392
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,570
to rush into the fire without hesitation.

393
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,640
What are you trying to say?

394
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,080
Now,

395
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,000
you're the one leading the team

396
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,650
to move forward.

397
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,640
Director Lou.

Come in.

403
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:46,760
What's wrong?

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,480
Lin...

405

Instructor Lin.

407
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,720
I...

408
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,650
Just say it.

409
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,650
I want to take a leave.

410
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,320
Dagang.

411
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,050
Fang.

412
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,320
Where are you going?

413
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,280
I took a leave.

414
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,330
How could you?

415
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,000
My house is a little...

416
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,240
What happened at home?

417
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,740
I'm fine.

418
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,560
Just tell me.

419
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,330
It's nothing.

420
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,850
I see.

421
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,050
Dagang.

422
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,780
About the money,

423
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,290
can you give me more time?

424
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,840
I'll pay you back later.

425
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,520
I was about to talk to you about this.

426
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,300
Hello?

427
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,650
Yes, I am.

428
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,040
Sorry.

429
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,080
Is it not enough?

430
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,800
How much more do you need?

431
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,780
I won't delay any longer.

432
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,480
I promise

433
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,830
I won't delay any longer.

434
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,010
I've accumulated almost the whole sum.

435
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,730
Sorry.

436
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,010
I'm really sorry.

437
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,260
Oh no.

438
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,280
Something happened!

439
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,140
What's wrong?

440
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,900
Did you lose money?

441
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,700
Why are you making a scene?

442
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Wait. What happened to you?

443
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,140
Tell us slowly.

444
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,050
Don't be anxious.

445
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,960
Fang.

446
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,640
Something big happened to Fang.

447
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,770
Fang.

448
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,330
I just heard Fang on the phone

449
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,460
and someone was asking him for money.

450
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,810
He must be in a huge debt.

451
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,900
Impossible.

452
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,900
That's unlike Fang.

453
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,940
You must have heard it wrong.

454
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,780
Impossible.

455
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,560
How can I have misheard something about money?

456
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,080
Also, I ran into Fang just now

457
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,060
and he was carrying a bag.

458
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,190
He said he asked for leave and is going home.

459
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,330
He's on leave at such a time?

460
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,440
Where is he going?

461
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,500
How would I know?

462
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,190
Besides,

463
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,600
look at how busy our station is right now.

464
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,020
If he can take a leave now,

465
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,290
it mustn't be a small matter.

466
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,080
Do you think

467
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,610
F-Fang did that?

468
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,410
Did what?

469
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,760
That.

470
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,040
What?

471
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,360
Extorted for his nudes.

472
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,240
Impossible.

473
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,330
Financial fraud.

474
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,320
That's impossible too.

475
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,130
I've never heard that Fang is involved in financial investments.

476
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,760
Online fraud.

477
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,020
Gambling.

478
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,940
It must be gambling.

479
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,460
No.

480
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,170
Impossible.

481
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,960
Don't you know who Fang is?

482
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,060
He is so honest.

483
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,660
He won't gamble

484
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,610
even if he were given the chance.

485
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,980
We don't know the whole story

486
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,260
so we can't jump to conclusions,

487
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,970
right?

488
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,520
However,

489
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,170
according to what Dagang described,

490
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,330
something must have happened to Fang.

491
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,610
And it's a big deal.

492
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,650
Then, do you think

493
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,170
Fang asked for leave at such a time

494
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,010
to run away?

495
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,360
I just lent him 20,000 yuan.

496
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,980
I lent him 5,000 yuan.

497
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,810
Oh no.

498
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,460
What should I tell my wife?

499
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,620
Why did I act like I could afford it?

500
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,460
Don't be anxious, Dagang.

501
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,620
Let's think of a way.

502
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,330
Enough.

503
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,280
Don't think too much.

504
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,760
Didn't he

505
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,800
ask for leave?

506
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,160
Didn't he have to go to the instructor for that?

507
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,600
Didn't he have to explain his situation to the instructor?

508
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,460
Let’s ask the instructor.

509
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,800
Then everything will be clear.

510
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,320
Let's go.

511
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,730
What is it?

512
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,170
You go.

513
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,010
Instructor Lin.

514
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,240
Fang took a leave today.

515
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,880
What happened to him?

516
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,000
Something happened at home.

517
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,160
-At home...
-Why?

518
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,810
No, that's not right.

519
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,250
Something must have happened to him.

520
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,320
Something happened to him?

521
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,380
He borrowed money from us.

522
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,370
I also overheard Dagang saying

523
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,280
that he borrowed a lot of money from others.

524
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,680
He borrowed money from all of you?

525
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,320
Yes.

526
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,730
Instructor Lin, listen.

527
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,010
Fang is definitely in big trouble.

528
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,220
He can't even speak fluently.

529
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,240
He must have been cheated.

530
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,760
Instructor Lin.

531
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,480
Did he

532
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,050
tell you

533
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,530
about what happened to him?

534
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:18,980
Oh no.

535
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,880
You have no idea either.

536
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,360
He must have been scammed.

537
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,530
This is bad.

538
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,290
What's wrong?

539
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,890
What happened?

540
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,660
Don't...

541
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,540
Don't worry.

542
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,370
There will be a bed soon.

543
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,520
Are you still feeling unwell?

544
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,880
Fang.

545
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,090
What did the doctor say?

546
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,730
The nurse said there's no bed left.

547
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,120
No beds left?

548
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,320
What should we do?

549
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,700
Well, I'll go ask around.

550
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,650
You stay with mom.

551
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,460
Okay.

552
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,400
That's all.

553
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,530
Okay, doctor.

554
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,760
Doctor.

555
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,570
Your mom's surgery is already under arrangement.

556
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,050
It's time for pre-surgery preparations.

557
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,860
The fee you paid in advance before

558
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,730
has been used up.

559
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,760
You transferred a sum of money today.

560
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,000
It's 20,000 yuan, right?

561
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,120
You may need to pay more.

562
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,760
This amount can last for two days

563
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,970
at most.

564
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,960
So short?

565
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,040
The hospital understands your difficulties.

566
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,090
So we will do our best to save the patient.

567
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:34,970
Of course,

568
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,520
we need your cooperation too,

569
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,080
so that the patient can get better soon.

570
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,060
Also,

571
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,980
Doctor,

572
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,780
what's going on

573
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,840
with the allocation of my mom's bed?

574
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,850
Indeed,

575
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,370
the hospital's running short of beds.

576
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,250
Many patients are waiting in line.

577
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,000
How about this?

578
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,220
Wait a little longer.

579
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,060
How long more

580
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,050
do we have to wait?

581
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,260
If that's the case,

582
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,740
why don't you go to the special needs

583
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,730
or international department?

584
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,120
It should be faster that way.

585
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,220
But if that's the case,

586
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,480
it will cost a lot.

587
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,410
and you have to pay for it.

588
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,730
It's not covered by medical insurance.

589
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,640
How much

590
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,480
more expensive is it?

591
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,400
Take a look at this.

592
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,560
If you decide on it,

593
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,400
I can make an application for your mom today

594
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,960
and she can move in directly.

595
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:18,760

How is it?

615
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,640
Is it still not enough?

616
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,060
Hold on.

780

If you want to pay back the money,

800
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,400

you should be punished.
