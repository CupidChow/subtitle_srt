00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,980
Look at what you did today.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,300
Don't you remember the basic safety rules?

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,460
What if something went wrong?

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,460
How many times have I told you?

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,300
You just never remember.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
You're punished to do cleaning by yourself.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,060
You can't take a break until you finish.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,200
Happy birthday to you.

00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,640
Happy birthday to you.

00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,260
Surprised?

Blow it.

Still pointing at us.

Oh great.

Now it's a discipline issue.

I will never celebrate your birthday again.

how could you celebrate my birthday?

48

Why are you talking so much?

Lin Luxiao, have some empathy.

50

I want to kick you right now.

Yeah.

Okay.

I knew you would be the bastard.

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,870

00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,960
This beautiful scene.

196
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,750
I'm really killing the scene.

197
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,990
If Li were here,

198
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,330
would you be happier?

199
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,180
Of course.

200
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,660
Could you go back and pick her up for me?

201
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,420
Go on with your training.

202
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,410
When your legs recover,

203
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,940
you two can come here alone.

204
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,430
Really?

205
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,530
If your legs won't recover,

206
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,960
I'm really worried that

207
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,720
you can't run away

208
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,090
when you get into an argument.

209
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,410
Why should I run?

210
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:21,890
I...

211
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,380
I can just get down on my knees.

212
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,420
You really got an ego.

213
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,180
Of course.

214
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,510
I'm a man.

215
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,260
Let's go.

216
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,650
Nice view.

217
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,170
I didn't waste my time coming here.

218
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,380
Of course.

219
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,900
You certainly didn't come here for nothing.

220
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,170
If it weren't for me,

221
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,770
you wouldn't have this benefit.

222
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,520
Okay.

223
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,890
Thanks to you,

224
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,500
I can enjoy the view here.

225
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,750
Since your accident,

226
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,010
whenever I'm free, I've been thinking.

227
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,610
What kind of job

228
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,680
do we do as firefighters?

229
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,230
One of the most dangerous professions in times of peace.

230
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,670
The greatest heroes in the fire.

231
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,240
That's what outsiders think of us.

232
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,010
What matters is how we think of ourselves.

233
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,240
Why did you become a firefighter?

234
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,150
In the past,

235
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,660
I thought it was an honor

236
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,130
and responsibility.

237
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,400
But later,

238
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,340
it gradually became a habit.

239
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,540
But I think

240
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,370
you are different from me.

241
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,270
How am I different?

242
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,290
Just because I'm the son of a firefighter.

243
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,760
No.

244
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,900
I think

245
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,510
since the first day I saw you,

246
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,900
I thought

247
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,010
you are destined to be a firefighter.

248
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,390
If not,

249
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,700
what else can you do

250
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,870
if you weren't a firefighter?

251
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,760
I've never thought about it.

252
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,770
That's it.

253
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,500
If I ask Liu the same question,

254
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,260
he might say

255
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,250
he wants to find a cooler job.

256
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,510
Because he can meet more girls.

257
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,170
If I ask Qilei,

258
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,180
he may want a job

259
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,880
that can allow him to spend more time

260
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,370
with his family and children.

261
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,230
As for me,

262
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,700
to be honest,

263
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,360
I wasn't like this before.

264
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,380
I've been in fires so many times.

265
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,680
It's alright to go in.

266
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,280
But after I came out,

267
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,420
in hindsight,

268
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,010
I still feel scared.

269
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,780
But I think you are different.

270
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,800
You never thought about these problems.

271
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,990
All you think about is

272
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,650
how to rescue people

273
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,140
out of a fire safely.

274
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,360
Am I right?

275
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,870
Mutou.

276
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,390
I'm not bragging in front of you.

277
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,020
I am the best leader in this area.

278
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,180
Look at these two.

279
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,350
They are experienced outdoor hikers.

280
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,870
With Qianglyu,

281
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,910
we are together.

282
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,800
What else are you worried about?

283
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,410
You are really brave.

284
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,890
As rookies, you dare to climb this mountain.

285
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,240
No.

286
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,500
Even if they want to climb,

287
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,480
the leader won't let them.

288
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,530
Right.

289
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Who dares to risk other people's lives now?

290
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,230
Buckle in five.

291
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,290
Are you two ready?

292
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,670
By the way, Yang.

293
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,650
I'm not as strong as you think.

294
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,250
Next, we will use...

295
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,050
You mean now?

296
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,030
Because Nan Chu...

297
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,170
It is indeed different now.

298
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,520
I used to be alone

299
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,150
and carefree.

300
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,320
No matter how dangerous

301
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,270
and difficult it is, I wasn't afraid.

302
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,530
I'd charge in.

303
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,460
But now,

304
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,820
I have more concerns.

305
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,470
Sometimes I think

306
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,360
if I were on a mission,

307
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,500
and suddenly died,

308
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,180
what would Nan Chu do?

309
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,940
Or,

310
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,410
fortunately,

311
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,140
if I survived,

312
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,650
but got paralyzed,

313
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,420
then how could I face Nan Chu?

314
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,590
I think

315
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,110
Nan Chu might understand you.

316
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,590
Just like Li Lei,

317
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,690
she can understand me.

318
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,180
She does understand me.

319
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,530
Lately, when I'm in the Fire Investigation Department,

320
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,420
I've been thinking

321
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,360
if I should transfer to

322
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,420
a relatively stable

323
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,680
and safer job

324
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,270
that I can work from nine to five.

325
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,420
But Nan Chu talked to me many times.

326
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,150
She said I'm not suitable for this kind of job,

327
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,460
because my heart is on the front line.

328
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,800
It seems that Nan Chu knows you really well.

329
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,780
Because she knows me so well,

330
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
I can't let her down.

331
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,900
Come to think of it.

332
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,870
Lin,

333
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,890
safety comes first.

334
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,890
Only when you ensure your own safety,

335
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,800
can you fulfill your duty.

336
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,150
You always mentioned this.

337
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,160
Don't forget.

338
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,800
The choreographer said our dance skills are good,

339
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,000
but it wasn't touching.

340
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,290
It's because we only have skills.

341
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,050
We didn't express our emotions.

342
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,290
That's why it lacked a soul.

343
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,780
Nan Chu.

344
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,270
Do you have any ideas?

345
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,310
I think we can try to

346
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,050
combine dance and performance.

347
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,650
There are stories and roles.

348
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,760
Nan Chu.

349
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,300
Are you talking about a musical?

350
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,280
But at our current level...

351
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,190
I think it can be our goal.

352
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,360
We can start with dance plays.

353
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
I also told the choreographer about this idea.

354
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,600
She thought it was a good way.

355
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,430
But she advised us

356
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,810
to watch classic dance productions,

357
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,800
and musicals.

358
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,280
Don't be confined by modern dance

359
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
and Chinese dance.

360
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,890
Because there are many types of dance.

361
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,300
We can all give it a try.

362
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,640
Have you seen any classic dance shows before?

363
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,030
-A ballet production. It's classic.
-It was impressive.

364
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,940
"The Red Detachment of Women".

365
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,030
I think the flat that we just saw

366
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,480
is quite good.

367
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,890
The lighting is good.

368
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,660
The location's good as well.

369
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,390
Why are you still not satisfied?

370
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,860
It's good.

371
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,630
But it's too expensive.

372
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,480
But

373
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,310
your salary isn't low either.

374
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,780
You and Nan Chu...

375
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,160
Right?

376
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,040
You can share the rent.

377
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,280
I don't think it's a problem.

378
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:29,890
But...

379
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,670
You know.

380
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,790
Professor Jin's class is so expensive.

381
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,160
Nan Chu has to pay for the dance club's expenses.

382
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,070
I don't want her to

383
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,390
split the rent with me.

571
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,680
It's okay.

572
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,990
You broke your leg.

573
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,670
Let me do first aid treatment for you.

574
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,600
Don't move.

575
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,980
Wait for the firefighters to take you to the hospital.

576
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,990
What's the matter with the firefighters?

577
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,840
It's been almost an hour.

578
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,760
We're in the mountains.

579
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,110
It's hard for the trucks to get in.

580
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,030
Iodophor.

581
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,050
Wait for the firefighters here.

582
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,520
I'll save the others.

583
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,740
Don't move.

584
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,920
Wait for the firefighters.

585
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,550
Okay.

586
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,760
Lin Luxiao!

587
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,770
Hang in there.

588
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,990
How is it?

589
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,250
We're here.

590
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,550
Lou Mingye!

591
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,780
This way!

592
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,080
In the middle of the waterfall,

593
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,510
there are two more wounded.

594
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,350
I saved one.

595
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,400
His leg was broken.

596
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,320
He needs to be sent to the hospital immediately.

597
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,660
Thank you.

598
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,420
Leave the rest to us.

599
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:43,840
Okay.

600
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,930
-Get the rope.
-Hurry.

601
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,520
Let's go up.

602
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,360
Get a stretcher.

603
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,950
Hurry!

604
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,490
Master!

605
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,580
It's okay. Save them first.

606
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,270
Let's go!

607
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,280
Open it.

608
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,250
Here, slowly.

609
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:53,830
Let me help you.

610
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,590
Unfold the stretcher.

611
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:55,510
Slowly.

612
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,310
Let's go.

613
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,540
Okay. Slowly.

614
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,380
Slowly.

615
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,070
Liu.

616
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,630
Why were you so slow?

617
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,340
What happened?

618
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,060
Fang's truck got stuck in the mud.

619
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,740
Fortunately, Qi Huo knew a shortcut.

620
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,790
Why are you here?

621
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,770
Yang and I are on holiday here.

622
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:13,950
Lin,

623
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,300
can you come back?

624
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,220
I can't stand

625
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,440
this Big Buddha anymore.

626
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,320
Stop complaining.

627
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,240
Go now.

628
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,230
Rescue people first.

629
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,550
Hurry!

630
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:20,800
Okay.

631
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:33,860
Luxiao,

632
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,350
let's go back.

633
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,710
Let's go back to the station.

634
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,550
Check up on them.

635
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:42,850
Why?

636
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,560
I'm anxious.

637
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,700
I just talked to Yu on the phone.

638
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,800
Did something happen at the scene?

639
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,190
It's fine.

640
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,000
Fang Xiangqian

641
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,210
got the truck stuck in the mud.

642
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:52,680
It's fine.

643
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,150
Did you see Lou Mingye?

644
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,410
Was he mad?

645
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,720
No.

646
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,020
What do you mean?

647
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,190
I know him well.

648
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,450
With his temper,

649
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,920
he'll be pissed if the rescue is delayed.

650
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,440
Besides, will Liu listen to him?

651
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,040
We're here for holiday.

652
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,480
Just feel assured,

653
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,280
and take good care of yourself.

654
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,420
Lou Mingye is in charge of the station.

655
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:13,970
But

656
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,190
I'm anxious.

657
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,610
You should go back and take a look.

658
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,540
Alright.

659
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,930
The hot spring is nice.

660
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,320
I'll get changed and take you there.

661
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,870
Sit down.

662
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,710
Don't just stand there.

663
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,270
You are so carefree.

664
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,200
Let me tell you.

665
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,210
Unity is the most important thing in a team.

666
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,980
Don't let anything else happen.

669
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,290
the field rescue this afternoon?

670
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,800
No one.

671
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,020
OK.

672
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,740
I'll talk.

[Binxi Fire Department]

678
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,540
The Motian Peak Fall

679
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,760
is 20 minutes away

680
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,610
from the Special Division Station.

681
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,300
When we arrived at the location,

682
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,320
it was 2:25 p.m.

683
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,520
It took us an hour and twelve minutes.

684
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,960
I believe you all understand

685
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,270
what it means

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,960

This mission

689
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,370
is a complete failure.

690
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,770
I don't know what you are thinking.

691
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,500
But for me,

692
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,820
it's a shame.

693
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,050
Why are we called Special Division Station?

694
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,400
Because we are

695
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,250
the best firefighters.

696
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,150
But today's mission...

697
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,050
Tell me.

698
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,520
Do you think

699
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,620
you're worthy of the word best?

700

You don't have to say anything!

702
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,870
I know you're experienced.

703
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,060
You don't have to tell me

704
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,600
the road was blocked.

705
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,740

These are all excuses.

Today's situation

708
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,780
is because of

709
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,120
your negligence of duty!

710
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,220
Go back and reflect on yourself!

711
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,310
Director Lou, I...

712
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,070
What's wrong?

713
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,050
You want to tell me it was an accident?

714
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,360
I'm telling you there's no accident.

715
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,590
All problems can be traced.

716
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,790
Why do we always emphasize

717
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,390
Six Familiarities?

718
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,870
As a firefighter,

719
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,180
you must remember

720
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,450
the locations of every road

721
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,790
and every factory in this area.

722
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,310
If Qi Huo didn't lead the way,

723
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,700
if Lin Luxiao wasn't there today,

724
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,190
if we were only half an hour behind,

725
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,950
something had happened to the trapped hikers.

726
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,560
What would those people in need think of us?

727
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,410
What would the public

728
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,210
think of us firefighters?

729
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,470
But I... I

730
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,480
Enough.

731
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,030
You don't have to explain to me.

732
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,050
I don't need an explanation.

733
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,770
I want your final result.

734
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,780

735
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,470
from now on,

00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,560
Qi Huo

737
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,380
will no longer be the driver of special division unit.

00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,100
He'll drive Truck 1.

739
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,700
Fang, you'll be in Class 2.

741
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,710
Can you let Fang finish his words?

742
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:33,930
Right.

743
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,230
You want us to compete for work.

744
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,990
Well, you can't generalize.

745
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,460
Liu, stop.

746
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,260
Don't stop me.

00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,230
-Watch your attitude.
-Let him talk.

748
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,370
Qi Huo.

749
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,840
I'm not targeting you.

750
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,600
Yes.

751
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,370
He is the living map at our station.

752
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,550
But Fang is more experienced than him.

753
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,520
During the flood rescue,

754
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,080
Fang is a good swimmer.

755
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,180
He worked under the water for 18 hours,

756
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,560
and saved 16 people.

757
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,710
The river was so wide.

758
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,220
And the water was so cold.

759
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,740
When he came up, he was freezing up and stuttering.

760
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,010
He didn't talk like this before.

761
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,060
Yes.

762
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,750
If the situation was more complicated,

763
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,140
I believe Fang

764
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,280
would be more reliable than Qi.

765
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,550
What are firefighters tested on?

766
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,690
We're tested on comprehensive ability,

767
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,710
not doing test papers,

768
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,300
not competing for work.

769
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,490
Assistant Liu,

770
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,960
I made this decision

771
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,570
based on a combination of factors.

772
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,930
Competition is about fairness and justice.

773
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,230
If you're capable, you should take up the duty.

774
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,280
If you're not, then don't do it.

775
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,380
Fang.

776
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,150
To be honest,

777
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,710
Qi Huo did

778
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,310
what you couldn't do today.

779
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,040
I transferred him to Truck 1.

780
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,560
Does it represent justice?

781
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,990
Does it represent fairness?

782
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,740
Tell me!

783
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,300
Bullshit!

784
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,290
How dare you talk about

785
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:58,050
fairness and justice in front of me?

786
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,230
You are a kiss ass.

787
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,330
You just want to flatter Captain Meng.

788
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,680
How could you not know the relationship

789
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,610
between Qi Huo and Captain Meng?

790
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,380
Shut up!

791
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,560
Stop... stop talking.

792
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,360
Tell me.

793
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,040
What's your relationship with Captain Meng?

794
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,300
Is he your father?

795
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,060
Is he?

796
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,070
Fang Xiangqian!

797
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:18,970
Are you done?

798
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,150
Are you done?

799
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,170
I worked hard for

800
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,530
everything I got.

801
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,590
What does it have to do with my dad?

802
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,520
Listen.

803
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,210
Don't accuse others

804
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,690
just because you didn't do well.

805
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,060
Come down.

806
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,620
Come down. Come down.

807
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,050
What do you want?

808
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,600
Did I ask you to talk?

809
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,070
Quiet!

810
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,520
Dad.

811
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,580
Actually, I've been thinking a lot,

812
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,010
while the program is off the air.

813
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,440
I want to build a life-sharing platform.

814
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,790
I want to invite people

815
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,340
who are interested in

816
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,680
music, dance,

817
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,770
outdoor activity,

818
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,620
and even theater

819
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,050
to this platform

820
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,320
so they can showcase their lives here.

821
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,080
You mean

822
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,220
you plan to

823
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,070
create a platform fully for art?

824
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,340
Let them show their talents

825
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,850
and pursue their dreams.

826
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,070
Yes.

827
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,550
But not exactly.

828
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,150
It's not fully an art platform after all.

829
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,830
It's a life-sharing platform.

830
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,060
It's actually quite different.

831
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,530
You

832
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,910
don't know

833
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,130
what young people like

834
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,900
and their lifestyle.

835
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,820
How they live their life.

836
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,300
For example, Lin Qi.

837
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,730
He likes music.

838
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,950
I have a friend, Nan Chu.

839
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,210
She likes dancing.

840
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,110
People like me like outdoor sports.

841
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,760
We have passions for a lot of things.

842
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,020
But there isn't a place

843
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,230
for us to communicate.

844
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,000
But do you know

845
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,270
a platform like this

846
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,040
may be unprofitable,

847
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,820
or even make you lose money?

848
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,140
I knew you would say that.

849
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,310
Yes.

850
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,450
In the past,

851
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,130
you said I had no right to speak

852
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,130
without market research.

853
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,690
But these days,

854
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,830
I've researched the marketing department,

855
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,050
and the factory assembly line.

856
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,450
If we launch this project,

857
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,050
its main business

858
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,520
and merchandise marketing,

859
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,360
will be related to

860
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,000
our current products.

861
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,680
By the way,

862
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,410
this is my analysis report.

863
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,460
Take a look.

864
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,520
It's a lot.

865
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,490
Let me read it.

866
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,730
Did you do this by yourself?

867
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,630
This is version one.

868
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,690
It will iterate.

869
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,010
Dad.

870
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,570
I know.

871
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,550
I used to be a failure in your eyes.

872
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,200
But I really want to try again this time.

873
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,300
If I fail again,

874
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,290
I'll accept your arrangement in the future.

875
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,530
Do you think I'll give you

876
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,800
another chance to fail?

877
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,530
Okay, I got it.

878
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,500
Wait.

879
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,010
What?

880
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,140
Let's go.

881
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:35,820
Come home with me.

882
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,960
You've been back for so long.

883
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,470
You only came home a few times.

884
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,940
Your mother always nags me

885
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,910
to bring you back for dinner.

886
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,830
Let's go home for dinner.

887
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,430
On the way,

888
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,900
you can tell me

889
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,210
about the specific ideas of this platform.

890
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,150
Really?

891
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,360
Of course.

892
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,620
Then let's go home.

893
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,690
What penalty?

894
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,410
No penalty.

895
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:08,910
It's a misunderstanding.

896
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,710
It's all a misunderstanding.

897
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,630
Take a seat.

898
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,450
Look at your termination agreement.

899
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,550
Take a look.

900
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:16,890
[Contract Termination Agreement]

901
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,610
[Artist Contract Termination Agreement]

902
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,290
It's okay.

903
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,060
If you're worried,

904
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,530
you can get a lawyer to have a look.

905
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,790
Then you can sign it.

906
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,280
Lin Qi,

907
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,510
I'll be frank.

908
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,060
I think

909
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,200
you know a key figure out there.

910
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,550
Why didn't you tell me?

911
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,310
Be honest.

912
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,700
Am I the one who discovered your talent?

913
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:41,920
Key figure?

914
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,060
What key figure?

915
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,480
What key figure?

916
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,040
Why are you still playing dumb?

917
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,720
Mr. Jiang from Zhige Entertainment

918
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,780
wants to sign you.

919
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,200
Actually,

920
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,040
if you said so early on,

921
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,690
we wouldn't have to be...

922
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,870
to be like this.

923
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:58,090
This is your brokerage agreement.

924
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,280
[Brokerage Agreement]
This is your brokerage agreement.

925
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,530
[Brokerage Agreement]

926
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,050
From now on,

927
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,820
you're a part of Zhige Entertainment.

928
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,890
But I think that day,

929
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,740
Mr. Jiang was

930
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,130
a little upset.

931
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,600
There must be a misunderstanding.

932
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,400
Look.

933
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,450
Find a chance to clear up

934
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,750
the misunderstanding for me.

935
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,010
It's just doing business.

936
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,890
There's a long way to go.

937
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:20,520
Right?

938
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,490
Maybe we still have a chance to work together.

939
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,430
No need.

940
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,870
You...

941
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:47,990
Where are you going?

942
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,020
How is it?

943
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,920
I did a good job, right?

944
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,840
I'm a man of my word.

945
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,700
Not bad.

946
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,540
But did Mr. Ma

947
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,180
give you a hard time?

948
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,270
Did he dare?

949
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,880
Don't worry about him.

950
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,810
Anyway,

951
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,240
thank you for this.

952
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,080
Mr. Lin,

953
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:19,280
I don't haggle over every penny.

954
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,120
Besides,

955
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,010
you can pay it back over the course of your life.

956
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,530
And from now on, you're mine.

957
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,870
You have to listen to me.

958
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,110
Will you

959
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,130
ask me to be a warmup guest,

960
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,220
and just randomly show up?

961
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,450
How could I?

962
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,480
I've discussed it with my dad.

963
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,230
We can build

964
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,910
a hobby platform.

965
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,850
People like you, Nan Chu and me

966
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,070
who like music, dancing, outdoor sports

967
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,630
can share their lives

968
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,890
on this platform.

969
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,240
We can do whatever we want.

970
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,560
All right.

971
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,450
Nan Chu's class is about to finish.

972
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,870
Let's talk about it after we pick her up.

973
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,380
Get in.

974
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,480
Congratulations.

975
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,610
You finally terminated your contract.

976
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,260
Without Mr. Jiang,

977
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,440
it wouldn't been so smoothly.

978
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,110
Right, Mr. Jiang?

979
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,370
You now know I'm nice, right?

980
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,600
I can't let my own people suffer.

981
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,190
Right?

982
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,570
Anyway,

983
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,460
Lin finally escaped from his misery.

984
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,060
We must celebrate.

985
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,570
This meal is on me.

986
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,590
Let's celebrate Brother Lin's freedom.

987
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,220
That's great.

988
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,070
What did you call me?

989
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,120
Brother Lin.

990
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,800
Is our seniority a bit messed up?

991
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,200
You didn't address me either.

992
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,250
Sister-in-law.

993
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,240
I'm heartbroken.

994
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,260
The more I hear it, the more upset I feel.

995
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,940
Lin,

996
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,050
I need a red packet to feel better.

997
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,390
I didn't ask you to change my title.

998
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,610
Let's get down to business.

999
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,700
Yes.

1000
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,670
Let's get down to business.

1001
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,610
We are planning to build a hobby platform.

1002
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,540
We want to invite the Dream Dance Club.

1003
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,090
Here's the proposal.

1004
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,890
Take a look.

1005
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,950
Your proposal is quite detailed.

1006
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,470
Have you made up your mind?

1007
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,900
Of course I have.

1008
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,070
Besides,

1009
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,580
it's not on a whim.

1010
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,050
I really want to do something.

1011
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,200
I just want to let people like us,

1012
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,740
who have dreams

1013
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,410
and ambitions

1014
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,340
gather together.

1015
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,980
After this contract termination,

1016
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,460
I've thought about something.

1017
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,590
Back then,

1018
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,020
I wanted to learn to play the violin,

1019
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,690
and make music.

1020
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,370
But I never thought

1021
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,970
how I should start.

1022
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,440
After I came back,

1023
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,620
I was fooled

1024
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,460
and scammed.

1025
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,050
I thought about compromising.

1026
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,640
I wanted to give up

1027
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:51,940
and stop trying.

1028
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,630
I wasn't thinking straight before.

1029
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,180
But now I've made up my mind.

1030
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,030
I still have to hang in there

1031
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,540
when I'm still young.

1032
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,150
Even if I fail in the end, I won't regret it.

1033
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,490
Yes.

1034
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,170
I also feel

1035
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,730
a sense of achievement when challenging myself.

1036
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,160
I feel happy too.

1037
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,090
That's great.

1038
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,240
Since both of you agree,

1039
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:14,960
I'm willing

1040
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,480
be your solid backup.

1041
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,820
How?

1042
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,680
Of course,

1043
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,920
my dad is my backup.

1044
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:32,810
Nan Chu.

1045
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,530
What do you think?

1046
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:37,970
Wish us success.

1047
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,530
Success!

1048
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,410
All the best!

1049
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,410
Yes.

1050
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,210
They really look alike.

1051
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,400
Why didn't I notice it earlier?

1052
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,620
No wonder Lou Mingye

1053
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,800
asked us to write tests

1054
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,600
and compete for work.

1055
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,240
That's not reform and innovation.

1056
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,130
He's obviously doing a favor.

1057
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:04,600
Of course.

1058
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,330
Lou Mingye has been with Captain Meng for so long.

1059
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,460
I don't believe

1060
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:08,930
that he doesn't know.

1061
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,680
Neither do I.

1062
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,740
He might really not know about this.

1063
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,760
I guess

1064
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,020
even Luxiao didn't know about this.

1065
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,750
I agree.

1066
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,430
If Director Lou really knew,

1067
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,980
he'd be appointing people by favouritism.

1068
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,330
Let's be objective.

1069
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,850
Qi Huo did a great job

1070
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,900
in the most urgent situation.

1071
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,670
We can't get to the scene without him.

1072
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,720
And he became the driver of Truck 1

1073
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,730
on his own.

1074
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,370
Director Lou made it clear.

1075
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,010
Whoever is capable should take up the duty.

1076
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,140
It's not like Unit Leader Fang

1077
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,440
won't have a chance in the future, right?

1078
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,750
In my opinion,

1079
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,590
we should blame this competition system.

1080
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,730

1081

1082
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,280
Everyone is panicking.

1083
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,670
There is no human touch at all.

1084
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:45,800
See?

1085
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,900

1089
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,270
I don't agree with you. I don't think

1090
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,040
the special division unit should only have human touch.

1091
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,180
Discipline is also a must.

1092
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,360
If there's only human touch,

1093
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,450
why do we need discipline?

1094
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,590
Nothing can be done without rules.

1095
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,480
We really can't confuse human touch

1096

with discipline.
