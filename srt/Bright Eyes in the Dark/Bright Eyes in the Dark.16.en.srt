Do you hear me?

191
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,290
Yes.

192
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,170
Yes.

193
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,280
What are you waiting for?

194
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,370
Go.

198
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,140
This is my first date with Sergeant Lin.

199
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,240
I'm quite nervous.

200
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,460
Don't worry.

201
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,640
No matter how you look,

202
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,280
you are the most beautiful girl in Sergeant Lin's heart.

203
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,160
That's not the case.

204
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,670
I've thought about it.

205
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,730
Sergeant Lin is a firefighter.

206
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,370
We won't have many chances to meet.

207
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,630
So I have to cherish

208
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,770
every date.

209
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,000
This is even sweeter than a romantic drama.

210
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,630
Indeed.

211
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,500
I'm so jealous.

212
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,010
By the way,

213
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,390
fix your lipstick.

214
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,280
Okay.

215
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,000
I found you a beautiful color.

216
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,090
Wait, no.

217
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,570
What if you mess it up

218
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,740
when you kiss?

219
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,630
Stop it.

220
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,000
Let me tell you.

221
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,140
I've pictured it.

222
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,980
On a dark night,

223
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,990
you two

224
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,380
are walking down an alley,

225
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,970
hand in hand.

226
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,580
The breeze gently blows your skirt.

227
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,600
After Sergeant Lin makes sure that no one is around,

228
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,740
he pins you to a wall.

229
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,640
You two just stare at each other affectionately like this.

230
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,990
Suddenly, he closes his eyes.

231
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,350
You two are getting closer,

232
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,860
and closer,

233
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,620
and closer.

234
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,720
You can't hold it back any longer either,

235
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,600
so you pout your lips.

236
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,440
Just like this.

237
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,960
Xi Gu!

238
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,280
Pick a necklace for me.

239
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,850
Come on.

240
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,640
Sergeant Lin.

241
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,270
Sorry I'm late.

242
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,740
It's okay.

243
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,210
I just got here

244
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,630

245
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,650
You're so beautiful.

246
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:21,760
Thank you.

247
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,500
Let's take a walk.

248
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,720
Okay.

249
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,760
Don't touch me.

250
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,470
Isn't that Master?

251
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:09,760
Look.

252
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,780
It's really him.

253
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,800
Isn't that Nan Chu?

254
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,330
Check it out.

255
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,890
Guess who we saw in the square.

256
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,350
Send it to the group chat. Quick!

257
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,850
Okay.

258
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,610
Hurry up. Assistant Liu is asking.

259
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,210
I've sent it.

my daughter is sick,

337
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,500
and I lost the restaurant.

338
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,760
We were short of money.

339
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,440

343
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,360
we could raise money online.

344
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,870
Yes.

345
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,130
I didn't know how to do it.

346
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,390
They gave me hands-on guidance.

347
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,150
And it really worked.

348
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,580
We got through it.

349
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,460
That's great.

350
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,890

No.

374
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,230
I bought two bottles.

00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,780
It's okay.

377
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,130

00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,630
just now

575
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,850
needs to have extra training today.

576
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,200
Extra training?

577
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,540
Extra training.

578
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,850
Since you couldn't even shut up while eating,

579
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,150
get some extra training.

580
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:23,880
Anyway...

581
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:27,870
Wait.

582
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,840
What's that smell?

583
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:30,850
It smells

584
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,150
sour and stinky.

585
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,160
Do you smell it?

586
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,420
Smell it.

587
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,420
Turns out it's the smell of love.

588
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,620
It goes great with the lunch, you know?

589
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,420
You see?

590
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,300
Let's eat.

591
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,330
Do you know

592
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,600
why Liu gets beaten less?

593
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,180
Why?

594
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,060
Because he knows when to run.

596
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:03,900

597
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,340
It's Captain Meng.

598
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,640
Captain Meng.

599
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,160
Okay, I'll be right there.

600
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,620
Be right there.

601
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,420

00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,890
Anyway, you'll be in charge

609
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,610
of all the follow-up work for now.

610
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:27,880
Okay.

611
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,160
Captain Meng.

612
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,550
I want to ask you

613
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,290
how long Luxiao's suspension will last?

614
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,600
There are too many things to do in the station every day.

615
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,200
I can't handle it alone.

616
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,840
I know you're worried about your long-time partner.

617
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,230
But Luxiao has been working

618
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,870
in the front line all these years,

619
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,630
and he never took a break.

620
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,340
This is also

621
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:50,860
a chance

622
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,010
for him to have some own time

623
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,060
and reflect on himself.

624
00:27:59,340 --> 00:27:59,720
It's also a good thing.

625
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,610
During this period,

626
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,910
since he's free,

627
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,350
it'll be more convenient for him time-wise.

628
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,230
Pretty good.

629
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,200
More convenient?

630
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,940
What's he up to recently?

631
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,120
Nothing.

632
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,340
Actually, every day, he...

633
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,350
Yang Zhengang.

634
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,810
Here!

635
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,920
As the instructor,

636
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,610
you should always know about the team members' situation

637
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,670
and make timely and accurate reports to the organization.

638
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,130
Did you forget?

639
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,560
No, I didn't.

640
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,860
Report!

641
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,620
Come in.

642
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,470
Captain Meng.

643
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,240
This is the commemorative model you asked me to repair last time.

644
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,120
It's fixed.

645
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,000
Thank you.

646
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:41,470
You're welcome.

00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,220
-I'm leaving.
-Thank you.

648
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,680
Okay.

649

Captain Meng.

650
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,810
Isn't this the souvenir

651
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,370
we won at the martial arts competition last time?

652
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,210
Yes.

653
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,430
I broke it

654
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,570
by accident.

655
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,580
I specially asked someone

656
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,880
to fix it for me.

657
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,620
That's not right.

658
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,200
Captain Meng.

659
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,130
Why did you

660
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,390
keep it to yourself in secret?

661
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,160
This is a collective honor.

662
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,330
It should be kept in the station.

663
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,760
Keep it to myself?

664
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,620
Why are you trying to

665
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,380
take it away from me?

666
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,360
That was my last time leading the team to participate in the martial arts competition.

667
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,090
I want to keep it as a memento.

668
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,590
Can't I?

669
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,300
But

670
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,160
that was our first time participating in the martial arts competition as well.

671
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,420
Luxiao,

672
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,850

673
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,190
They all participated.

674
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,090
You should at least let us display it for a few days.

675
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,550
Enough.

676
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,660
Your station has won too many awards.

677
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,880
Let's not talk about this.

678
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,350
Let's go back to what you were talking about just now.

679
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,120
Just now...

680
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,680
Actually, his situation is quite simple.

681
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,230
Well,

682
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,120
it's just...

683
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,470
It's actually a private matter.

684
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,900
Private matters have to be reported too.

685
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,700
No.

686
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,420
You don't have to report it if it's personal privacy,

687
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,600
but you can tell me about it roughly.

688
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,640
Tell me already.

689
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,150
He's seeing someone.

690
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,380
Look carefully.

691
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,470
Today,

692
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,150
we'll talk about the usage of

693
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,840
cutting saws at fire scenes.

694
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,520
Before using it, we should check and make sure that

695
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,460
the motor and cables are in normal condition,

696
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,560
the cutting saw is well grounded,

697
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,920
and the protective device is safe and effective.

698
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,470
After it's activated,

699
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,780
we should first let it operate at no load

700
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,590
to make sure that the saw blade's rotation direction is correct...

701
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,310
[Lin]
to make sure that the saw blade's rotation direction is correct...

702
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,320
[Lin]

703
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,390
[Lin]

704
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,830
Dad.

705
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:52,800
Head.

706
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,850
Lower your head.

707
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,160
Eyes.

708
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,950
Look here.

709
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,870
Give me a look.

710
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,340
Show me something, okay?

711
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:05,310
Your eyes.

712
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,070
Look here.

713
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,350
Are you a dummy?

714
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,580
Can't you give me some reaction?

715
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,810
Your eyes.

716
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,240
You must show me something with your eyes.

717
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:20,890
Cut.

718
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,070
Take a break.

719
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,440
What's with this woman Beiyao got us?

720
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,410
She's so glassy in front of the camera.

721
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,880
It feels like she has no story to tell.

722
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,430
There are no layers at all, okay?

723
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,950
This girl

724
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,290
just starred in a show.

725
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,050
She's quite popular now.

726
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,060
It's none of my business whether she's popular or not.

727
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,660
She's absolutely not up to my standards.

728
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,630
It's obvious that she hasn't been trained.

729
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,770
All right.

730
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,030
Let's try again.

731
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,800
If it still doesn't work this time,

732
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,760
contact Shen Guangzong directly.

733
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,230
It's okay.

734
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,410
Come on.

735
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,210
One more time.

736
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,360
Dad.

737
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,330
Come in.

738
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,570
No need to change shoes.

739
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:17,850
You're really something.

740
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,860
You even got yourself suspended.

741
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,870
-Lin Luxiao!
-Here!

742
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,790
Since you're suspended,

743
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,710
you have to follow the arrangement.

744
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,560
What?

745
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,160
Do you feel wronged?

746
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:31,700
Report!

747
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:32,710
I don't feel wronged.

748
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,030
That's good.

749
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,800
Don't waste your time during the suspension.

750
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,070
Reflect on yourself,

751
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,670
and think about how you can do your job better.

752
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,450
Firefighting is to serve the people.

753
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,920
If you want to do it, do it well.

754
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,230
Don't embarrass me.

755
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,150
Yes.

756
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,370
Sit.

757
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,420
Yes.

758
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,130
I heard from Captain Meng that you're seeing someone.

759
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,320
Yes.

760
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,960
And she's an actress?

761
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,390
Yes.

762
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,030
I'm not satisfied.

763
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:19,840
But of course,

764
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,560
this is your personal matter.

765
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,400
Handle it yourself.

766
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,360
Yes.

767
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,850
When will you bring her back to see me?

768
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,580

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,440
It's not the right time yet.

770
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,220
Then don't come back until the time is right.

771
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,690
Go.

772
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,030
Yes.

773
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,620
I'm leaving, Dad.

Hello, who is it?

778
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,550
I'll buy you dinner today.

Who am I?

What kind of person are you?

783
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,050
I'm hanging up.

784
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,660
What audition?

785
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,220
If it weren't for me,

786
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,730
would you have got a chance for the audition?

787
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,160
Hello? The signal is bad.

788
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:38,840

in my WeChat contact.

795
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,160
They used to follow me around

796
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,130
when everything was okay.

797
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,610

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,190
no one is available.

Let's get loaded.

Whoever stops drinking first

809
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,200
is the coward.

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,790
Do you dare?

00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,050
Why are you drinking during the day?

812
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,140

Isn't the timing great?

Since you are free,

837
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,610
you should spend more time with Nan Chu.

838
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,950
When this passes,

839
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,000
you'll be busy again.

840
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,300

No matter she's free or not,

844
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,640
you have to go see her since you have time.

was this music bar.

to cheer me up.

888

It's Nan Chu.

00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,240
When did you get together with Nan Chu?

890
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,640
It's your brother who's together with Nan Chu.

891
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,290
Don't you know that?

892
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,600
Good boy.

893
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,000
Lin Luxiao really keeps his secret well.

894
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,560
How could I not know?

895

No.

899
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,400
Wait.

have to do with you?

902
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,700
Yeah.

903
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,630

Jiang Ge.

905
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,520
I was wondering why you wanted to drink with me out of the blue.

906
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,320
But I have to make it clear beforehand.

907
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,460
I won't help you steal her from him.

908
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,520
I'm 100% on my brother's side in this matter.

909
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,450
Stop.

910
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,870
Who asked you to steal her for me?

911
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,860
It's just I feel upset,

912
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,420
so I wanted to talk to you, who know nothing about love, about it.

913
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
You're a trust fund baby,

914
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,920
and you're telling me how depressed you are.

915
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,800
Do you think it's appropriate?

916
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,080
Do you think it's easy for me to be a trust fund baby?

917
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,680
My dad

918
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,910
won't allow anything.

919
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,180
When I talk to him

920
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,650
about something I want to do,

921
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,540
he always thinks

922
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,690
I want to get his money

923
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,620
into my pocket

924
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,560
and then waste it all.

925
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,830
So everything I do

926
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,670
is worthless to him.

[Tips for Fire Safety]

929
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,080
An ignited cigarette butt can easily cause a fire,

930
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,230
because the temperature of it is much higher

931
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,080
than the fire point of inflammable objects, like paper, cotton,

932
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,260
and wood.

933
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,200
According to the survey conducted by the fire department,

934
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,270
the common reasons for fires caused by smoking

935
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:36,530
are as follows:

936
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,880
One,

937
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,810
smoking in bed.

938
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,080
Some people already fall asleep

939
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,260
before they finish smoking their cigarette.

940
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,030
The burning cigarette butt

941
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,340
may fall on the bedding and mosquito net.

942
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,060
Two,

943
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,590
illegal smoking in non-smoking working areas

944
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,360
may cause major or catastrophic fires.

945

Three,

946
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,060
littering cigarette butts around.

947
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:05,090
Some smokers have a bad habit,

948
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,540
that is to litter cigarette butts around.

949
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,440
This is also a common reason

950
