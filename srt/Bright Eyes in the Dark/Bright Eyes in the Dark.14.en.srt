00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,940
My impressions...

8
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,940
I think this job

9
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,300
is different from how I imagined it before.

10
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,260
They're not heroes who can do anything.

11
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,180
They are also flesh and blood.

12
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,420
They face more challenges than we do,

13
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,620
but with their bravery
they still try to save everyone

14
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,380
and never give up on anyone.

15
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,660
What's left the biggest impression on you?

16
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,580
What's left the biggest impression...

17
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,980
Probably this group of lovely people

18
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,980
that I've become friends with.

19
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,580
I don't care what anyone else

20
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,180
came here for.

21
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,620
Some may want this to be a springboard.

22
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,300
Some may want to start a fauxmance

23
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,980
and gain publicity.

24
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,900
But I came here

25
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,500
and saw the hard work

26
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,580
that firefighters do on a daily basis,

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,980
and their courage to sacrifice themselves

28
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,740
for others

29
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,460
in emergency situations.

30
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,260
I think they're extremely noble

31
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,380
and selfless.

32
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,100
Maybe...

33
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,660
this is what I came here for.

34
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,620
Here, Ms. Xu.

35
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,980

Be quick. You'll be scolded again.

What is this place?

42
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,260
What did I say?

43
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,260
There must be something wrong.

Well,

45
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,380
Chen Yilong actually tried
to act in front of me.

46
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,260
A bit naive, isn't he?

47
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,260
You're so impressive, Ran.

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,700
Nothing gets past you.

49
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,540
Look.

50
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,380
He was in denial because he was afraid
of being found out.

But...

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,700
don't you think the temperature in here

56
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,200
is a bit too high?

57
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,140

Yeah.

Over there.

Stand over there.

Now, you're going to film me.

67
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,940
Find an ideal angle and film me.

Hello, everyone.

86
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,660
I'm Fire Safety Inspector Ran Dongyang.

87
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,340
Today, we're conducting
a fire safety inspection

88
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,220

89
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
But just now,

90
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,810
I came across a safety hazard.

91
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,780
But don't worry,

92
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,220
I've put out the fire.

93
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,010
That's right.

94
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,530
I would like to remind everyone

95
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,820
that fire safety
is everyone's responsibility.

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,700

Or you'll get scolded again.

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,900
I just saw Ran Dongyang and the other two

102
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,660
go that way.

104
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,780

Let's go.

106
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,380

Come on.

111
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,580
One more.

112
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,660
Come on, burn up.

113
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,700
Why is there another...

114
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,450
Ran Dongyang!

115
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,540

116
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,340

117
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,700
What are you doing?

118
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,380
Nan Chu, what are you doing?

119
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,260
What are you doing?

120
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,700
Honestly, Yang,

121
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,020
what an eventful life you're trying to live.

122
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,580
What do you mean?

123
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,660
Go back now.

124
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:37,780
I'm not leaving.

125
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,890
Leave if you want.

126
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,100
Just ignore her, Ran.

127
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,140
Let's go.

128
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,700
Stop!

129
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,980
Get out of my way.

130
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,780
No.

131
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,700
Are you going to tell on us?

132
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,220
Go away.

133
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,900
No.

134
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,340
Nan Chu, watch your attitude!

135
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,780
All right. Calm down, everyone.

136
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,780
Mr. Jiang, you are a pro.

00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,020
Isn't dramatic effect
the most important thing to a show?

138
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,700
If Lin Luxiao comes,

139
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,140
I...

140
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,460
I'll have done all this for nothing.

141
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,220
Yeah.

142
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,700
We're doing this
for the show's dramatic effect.

143
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,140
Yeah.

144
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,570
But that's not the way to do it.

145
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,980
Have you got no safety awareness?

146
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,220
Go away now!

147
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,700
Wait.

148
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,020
Why is there smoke under this door?

149
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,340
Go!

150
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,780
What is that place?

151
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,140
It's a w-warehouse.

152
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,900
Is there anyone inside?

153
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,380
I think there's a renovation team.

154
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,820
Zheng Yang.

155
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,340
Yes.

156
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,980
Contact Command Center.

157
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,220
Yes.

158
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,260
Where are the others?

I don't know either.

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,660
Nan Chu.

169

Are you all right, Nan Chu?

170
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,820
I'm fine.

171
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,580

Help!

173
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,140
The door won't open.

174
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,460
What happened?

175
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,580
Why is it locked?

176
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,260
The door won't open!

177
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,260

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,780
Open the door!

180
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,700
Open the door!

181
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Come and help! Open the door!

182
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,020
It's going to hurt a little.

183
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,900
Open the door!

184
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,780
Open the door! Is anyone there?

185
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,700
Is anyone there?

186
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,220
Hurry up!

187
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,540
Get the fire hoses ready,

188
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,340
and the rescue kit.

189
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:52,900
Yes!

190
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,540
Get the fire hoses. Let's go!

191
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,660
Where are the other few of you guys?

192
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,260
Requesting permission to rescue.

193
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,020
There's a fire at Yilong
Food Processing Factory.

194
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,460
The number of people trapped
is not yet known.

195
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,540
Heping Road Special Division Station
has dispatched a truck.

196
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,460
Firefighting is underway.

197
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,140
Requesting backup.

198
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,810
Hello?

199
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,540
Director Lin,

200
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,580
we're in the disused warehouse
behind the toilet.

201
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,700
Behind the toilet?

202
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,570
What's going on in there?

203
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,540
There's a big fire here,

204
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,900
and there are many combustible items.

205
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,700
OK, got it.

206
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,260
I'll be right there.

207
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,220
Remove the door!

208
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,700
Yes!

209
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,340
Hurry up!

210
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:28,940
Cool it down!

211
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,820
Hurry up!

212
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,340
Make it higher!

213
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,340
The fire is getting bigger.

214
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,980
Don't panic.

215
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,220
We've learned how to save ourselves.

216
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,340
Lower your body and wait for help.

217
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,620
Hurry up!

218
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,420
Help!

219
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,980
Hurry up!

220
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,820
Come on!

221
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,940
Come on! Over there!

222
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,620
Keep going!

223
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,980
Help!

224
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,580
Where is he?

225
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,820
-Where are you?
-Over here!

226
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,820
Over here!

227
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,420
Over there!

228
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,460
Hurry up!

229
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,820
Are you all right?

230
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Come on.

231
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,820
Why are the firefighters still not here yet?

232
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,060
Are we going to die here?

233
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,940
I'm so scared!

234
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,060
I have an idea!

235
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,420
Find something to knock the wall.

236
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,580
This wall is soft.

237
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,980
We can make holes on it and climb out.

238
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,460
Find something.

239
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,980
Over there!

240
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,860
There's a stick here.

241
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,100
There's another one on the ground.

242
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,530
[Rescue]

243
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,940
Reinforcements in place.

244
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,820
About to enter the fire scene.

245
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,100
Hurry up!

246
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,580
Come on!

247
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,740
Get the equipment ready!

248
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,580
Hurry!

249
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:25,820
Hurry up!

250
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,420
Make it higher!

251
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,300
Higher!

252
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,340
Mr. Ran,

253
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,060
get up here!

254
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,860
What for?

255
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,220
You'll shoulder me and get me up there.

256
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,340
Why isn't it the other way around?

257
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,340
You know how good he is at climbing.

258
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,460
Yes.

259
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,820
He's even better than Director Lin
at climbing.

260
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,460
Hurry up.

261
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,220
Come on. Hurry up.

262
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,410
Give me a hand.

263
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,980
Up there!

264
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,820
Hurry up!

265
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,420
Hurry up!

266
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:58,980
Over there!

267
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,170
Let's go!

268
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,420
These two are wounded. Hurry up!

269
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,940
Let's go!

270
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,580
Come on!

271
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,980
Hurry!

272
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,940
You're safe now.

273
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,180
Follow me!

274
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,220
Keep going.

275
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,460
Hurry!

276
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,340
That way!

277
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,130
Higher!

278
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,700
One, two, three!

279
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,700
Be careful!

280
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,980
Hurry up! I can't hold on much longer!

281
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,980
Almost there!

282
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,940
A little higher.

283
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,980
Hurry up! The fire is getting closer!

284
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,100
Stand still!

285
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,300
Hurry up!

286
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,420
The fire is getting bigger.

287
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,610
Be careful!

288
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,420
Come on, Mr. Jiang!

289
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,410
He did it!

290
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,300
Great!

291
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,100
The rope!

292
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,460
W-Why are you going up first?

293
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,340
I'll climb up first

294
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,700
and then pull you guys up.

295
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,820
Be quick then.

296
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,700
Hurry up!

297
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,740
Oh my god.

298
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,860
We're running out of time.

299
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,500
Don't panic.

300
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,700
Hurry up.

301
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,940
There won't be enough time

302
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,860
for us to climb up.

303
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,820
My footage!

304
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,060
Just go!

305
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,820
Are you kidding me?

306
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,620
You want to die?

307
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,860
Come up now!

308
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,220
Throw down the rope!

309
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,700
Are you all right?

310
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,100
The rope!

311
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,580
M-Mr. Jiang.

312
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,620
I have a suggestion.

313
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,740
I'll go look for a way out of here.

314
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,820
Y-You stay here and get them out.

315
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,700
Don't be scared.

316
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,420
I'm scared!

317
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,620
Don't be scared. Come on.

318
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,500
Come on, put one foot in there.

319
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,060
Be careful.

320
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,340
Pull the rope tight!

321
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
Give her a pull!

322
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,700
Find a foothold!

323
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,340
I...

324
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,860
I'll go first?

325
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,580
You go first.

326
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,220
Come on!

327
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,460
Give her a pull!

328
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,460
Go and see if anyone is injured.

329
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,220
Push it up!

330
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,580
Go higher!

331
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,820
Come on!

332
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,500
Push it up!

333
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,500
Nan Chu!

334
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,220
Here.

335
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,500
Come on, Yan Dai.

336
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,980
There's a route here!

337
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,620
We'll be safe down there!

338
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,220
Hurry!

339
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,700
Come on!

340
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,980
Come and help!

341
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,460
Dai.

342
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:01,940
What?

343
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,740
What are you doing?

344
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,340
Xu Zhiyi!

345
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,220
Hurry up, Dai!

346
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,580
Hurry up!

347
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,820
Come back here!

348
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,100
Nan Chu is still down there!

349
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,580
What are you looking at?

350
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,340
Pull!

351
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,500
Nan Chu!

352
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,180
Nan Chu!

353
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:10,820
Nan Chu!

354
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,740
Are you all right?

355
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,580
Hurry up and go!

356
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,100
Go find Sergeant Lin!

357
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,220
I'll be right back!

358
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,820
Let's go.

359
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,690
Director Lin.

360
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,220
Where are they?

361
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,220
Nan Chu is in there.

362
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,980
The door won't open.

363
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,340
She's in there alone.

364
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,700
Let's force it!

365
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,940
Bring the entry tools!

366
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
Don't be scared!

367
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,900
I'll take you out!

368
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,700
Hold onto my shoulder strap.

369
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,300
Lin Luxiao.

370
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,980
Lin Luxiao.

371
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,420
What's wrong?

372
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,300
Lin Luxiao.

373
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,540
Dr. Xia.

374
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,940
She's been talking in her sleep.

375
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,220
Why is that?

376
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,220
Don't worry.

377
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,060
It's probably a stress reaction

378
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,180
from being frightened earlier.

379
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,380
She'll be fine after some more sleep.

380
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,500
I'm here.

381
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,020
[China Fire and Rescue]

382
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,300
From the Fire Investigation Department.
[China Fire and Rescue]

383
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,180
They found it at the scene.

384
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,980
You know whose it is?

385
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,940
It belongs to that bastard Ran Dongyang.

386
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,420
Director Lin,

387
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,420
this wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for him.

388
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,900
So it was completely his fault.

389
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,180
The investigation results are out.

390
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,900
Ran Dongyang didn't have much to do with it.

391
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,980
But still,

392
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
one of you got injured.

393
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,460
Your show may be affected.

394
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,700
I know.

395
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,260
I'll go and deal with it now.

396
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:00,940
OK.

397
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,460
Instructor Yang,

398
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,260
I'm off.

399
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,180
Take care.

400
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,380
Sir!

401
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,660
Come in.

402
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,420
What is it?

403
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,060
Director Lin.

404
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,940
Instructor Yang.

405
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,140
I'm not without fault

406
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,460
in this Chen Yilong case.

407
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,380
But I didn't make any major mistake.

408
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,900
I had dinner with him once

409
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,180
and took some water he gave me.

410
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,620
I didn't help him with anything else.

411
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,420
Dagang,

412
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,300
the investigation results are out.

413
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,740
It wasn't exactly Chen Yilong's fault.

414
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:51,980
The construction team

415
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,300
didn't follow the rules

416
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,220
and caused the fire.

417
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,620
Dagang.

418
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,980
That friend of yours

419
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,460
has several other dealings

420
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,500
in our district.

421
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,940
Learn from this incident

422
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,540
and set your boundaries with him.

423
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,700
For your own good.

424
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,860
Understood.

425
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:12,620
[Beiyao Entertainment]

426
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,240
Mr. Han,
[Beiyao Entertainment]

427
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,940
[Beiyao Entertainment]

428
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,780
while the fire
[Beiyao Entertainment]

429
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:14,850
[Beiyao Entertainment]

430
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,460
was not directly caused by Ran Dongyang,
[Beiyao Entertainment]

431
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,060
[Beiyao Entertainment]

432
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,500
I did see him do all kinds of absurd things
[Beiyao Entertainment]

433
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,620
at the scene.
[Beiyao Entertainment]

434

[Beiyao Entertainment]

435
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,780
Frankly,
[Beiyao Entertainment]

436
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,140
[Beiyao Entertainment]

437
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:22,530
I can't work with him anymore.
[Beiyao Entertainment]

438
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,860
I can't work with him anymore.

439
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,610
Mr. Jiang,

440
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,140
how about

441
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,020
leaving Ran Dongyang

442
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,500
to me?

443
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,660
If you ask me, we should just expose him.

444
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,980
What the heck?

445
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,060
Please calm down.

446
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,940
I know people of this sort well.

447
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,690
Rest assured,

448
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,700
I will not let you down.

449
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,730
Fine.

450
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,460
I'll wait for your update.

451
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,700
Have a good night.

452
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,740
Mr. Jiang, I'll show you out.

453
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,260
Come on.

454
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,060
See you.

455
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,460
Mr. Han,

456
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,860
are you planning to help Ran Dongyang

457
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,860
get away with it?

458
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,210
But Ran Dongyang is a real plague!

459
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,300
He's only just joined the show

460
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,740
and yet has caused so much trouble.

461
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,940
Yan Dai got injured.

462
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,780
Nan Chu almost lost her life.

463
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,660
I think

464
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,260
we should consider Mr. Jiang's suggestion

465
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,900
and just expose him.

466
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,860
I know Ran Dongyang.

467
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,700
He's a veteran,

468
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,980
and very difficult to deal with.

469
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,740
What worries me now is that

470
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,620
if he takes this opportunity
to create a scandal,

471
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,980
Nan Chu

472
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,060
might be affected as well.

473
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,500
I see.

474
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,930
He's quite capable
of doing something like that.

475
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,500
Was it you?

476
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,260
Why did they lie to me

477
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,940
and say you were dead?

478
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,060
Was it really you?

479
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,300
Lin Luxiao.

480
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,860
Nan Chu.

481
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,980
You're finally awake.

482
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,500
You really scared me.

483
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,380
You were in a coma for a day and a night.

484
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,540
I'm fine now, aren't I?

485
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,540
You were here and up all night last night?

486
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,220
No.

487
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,540
I slept for a while.

488
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,980
Director Lin came

489
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,980
and took my place.

490
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,180
He stayed until very late last night.

491
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,300
All right now.

492
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,220
Don't worry.

493
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,980
Didn't Zong say

494
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,020
"A disaster survived
is a blessing in store"?

495
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,020
But this is your second time.

496
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,220
Why is it always happening to you?

497
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,220
Probably so that

498
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,900
I can meet him.

499
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,020
By the way, Nan Chu,

500
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,780
do you know that

501
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,660
Director Lin was really worried
about you last night?

502
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,900
You have no idea.

503
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,180
He was so anxious that...

504
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:23,900
Nan Chu.

505
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,770
You're awake.

506
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,860
Why did you buy a fruit basket?

507
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,060
That's too much for me to eat.

508
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,900
I was too lazy to pick.

509
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:32,980
It's got everything in there.

510
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,900
Eat whatever you want.

511
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,180
What happened to your hand?

512
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,940
I'm fine.

513
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,700
It's just a minor injury.

514
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,700
How about you?

515
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,370
Are you feeling better?

516
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,540
Yes.

517
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,730
What about everyone else?

518
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,460
Are they all right?

519
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,020
They can't be any better.

520
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,900
Worry about yourself instead.

521
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,260
I dread to think what could've happened

522
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,700
if Director Lin hadn't been able
to save you.

523
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,420
By the way,

524
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,260
take care of yourself.

525
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,540
Use the most expensive medicine.

526
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,260
I'll pay for it.

527
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,380
But now that this has happened,

528
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,260
will the show be halted?

529
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,460
Don't worry about that.

530
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,180
Leave it to us in the leadership.

531
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,460
But I'll tell you this.

532
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,540
Whether or not

533
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,860
this fire was caused by Ran Dongyang,

534
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,660
I won't let him stay on the show.

535
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,740
What are you doing?

536
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,060
I'm leaving.

537
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,020
Ran,

538
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,620
has the camera really been destroyed?

539
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,780
Don't worry.

540
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,980
It was probably burnt to ashes.

541
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,260
Besides,

542
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,020
the Six Familiarities,

543
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,700
the fire safety inspection,

544
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,660
well,

545
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,980
wasn't it all

546
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,220
under the order of Lin Luxiao?

547
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,460
If we're talking about responsibility,

548
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,860
it should be
the fire station's responsibility.

549
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,500
We are the victims.

550
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,380
A victim!

551
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,660
The face is so important to an actor!

552
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:09,940
Really?

553
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,420
What about Dai?

554
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,140
Will Dai go and tell people about it?

555
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,030
[Ran Dongyang]

556
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,540
She didn't pick up?

557
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,260
She's not picking up.
What kind of attitude is that?

558
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,740
Having no attitude

559
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,220
is also a kind of attitude.

560
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,220
Look at Yan Dai.

561
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
Bad at accomplishing things,

562
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,860
but great at dodging them.

563
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,020
Zhiyi.

564
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,460
You are different from her.

565
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,260
She wants to make it in this industry?

566
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,420
Forget it.

567
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,620
I've seen too many like her.

568
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,020
With your ability,

569
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,660
I think

570
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,220
you'll definitely make it in the future.

571
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,220
Also,

572
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,540
you and I, we are united, right?

573
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,980
As long as you follow me,

574
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,020
I guarantee that your life is going to be

575
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,620
absolutely glamorous.

576

Thank you, Ran.

577
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,460
I hope it's really going to be OK.

578
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,700
You're here.

Dad.

581
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,300
Is the company facing difficulties?

582
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,140
It's just the macro-environment.

583
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,780
It's something that every company
has to go through

584
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,500
in a period of transition.

585
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,780
Why don't we have a chat
about these difficulties?

586
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,980
You want a chat?

587
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,460
Let's start with you then.

588
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,900
Tell me,

589
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,260
what exactly happened

590
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,540
on the show?

591
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,300
I knew this is why you asked me to come.

592
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,690
This fire was really an accident.

593
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,370
We just happened to be there.

594
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,660
But there's a lot of talk on the Internet.

595
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,740
People are saying all kinds of things.

596
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:23,980
Let's just say

597
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,140
everyone else is fine,

598
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,380
but the only problem is Ran Dongyang.

599
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,860
I will definitely get rid of him.

600
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,260
Don't worry, Dad.

601
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,540
I'm discussing this with Han Beiyao.

602
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,420
And I also told Huang Huai

603
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,260
to prepare for crisis management.

604
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,900
If I remember correctly,

605
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,180
it was Han Beiyao

606
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,060
who got Ran Dongyang on the show, right?

607
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,220
So will he

608
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,060
agree with you?

609
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,460
He's probably planning to hush it all up

610
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,620
and minimize the impact.

611
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,460
All right.

612
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,540
Leave the rest to me.

613
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,460
I'll take it from here.

614
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,220
I'll talk to Han Beiyao.

615
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,140
Dad,

616
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,540
this is my show.

617
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,180
Your show?

618
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,260
Don't forget

619
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,700
that even your company is mine.

620
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,700
It's not very nice of you to keep
holding me down with this.

621
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,500
Am I holding you down?

622
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,140
It's only the truth!

623
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,380
Now remember, the truth never sounds nice.

624
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,980
You asked me

625
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,460
to do this show, right?

626
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,220
Yes.

627
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,500
You asked me to prove myself to you

628
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,700
with this show,

629
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,700
and I gave it 100 percent.

630
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,700
Flaming Youth was doing great prior to this,

631
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,850
and you never texted me.

632
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,220
Now I'm in trouble,

633
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
and you're here to laugh at me?

634
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,460
Am I laughing at you?

635
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,980
I'm cleaning up your mess

636
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,060
and helping you!

637
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,660
I can handle it myself!

638
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,420
Why can't you just trust me once?

639
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,540
Haven't I done that plenty of times?

640
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,420
I've given you chances.

641
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,060
And more than once!

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,740

Mr. Jiang,

I'll be honest with you
about the matter of Ran Dongyang.

651
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,060
It can be a major or minor thing.

00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,580
Captain Wu,

765
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,500
I was wondering, generally speaking,

766
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,380
can firefighters from Nanbin

767
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,020
join an operation in Beixun?

768
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,260
Not usually.

769
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,260
Unless under special circumstances.

770
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,980
Then why was I saved

771
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,260
by Xu Jianfei in Beixun
five years ago?

772
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,020
Five years ago?

773
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,420
Don't get me wrong.

774
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,500
I'm not trying to stop you.

775
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,460
I just think that

776
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,900
Nan Chu is a good girl.

777
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,020
And you're my older brother.

778
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,420
If you two are together,

779
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,180
because of your professions,

780
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,860
neither of you will have much time
for your family.

781
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,170
I really don't want to see

782
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,660
any of you get hurt.

783
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,420
Brother,

784
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,460
have you really thought it through?

785
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,710
[Captain Wu Zhibo]

786
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,090
Go ahead and eat.

787
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,860
Hello, Captain Wu.

788
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:34,820
Director Lin.

789
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:35,860
Are you occupied at the moment?

790
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,300
I'm not.

791
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,340
What is it? Please go on.

792
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,580
Do you remember handling a fire

793
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,020
and saving a girl

794
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,020
five years ago,

795
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,660
before the earthquake?

796
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,660
Was there something like that?

797
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,180
Five years ago?

798
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,540
I don't remember.

799
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:52,860
Well,

800
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,030
this girl has come and asked me
about it several times.

801
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,380
I thought about it.

802
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,380
Five years ago, I went to your station
with Xu Jianfei

803
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,580
to compare notes with you guys.

804
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,670
It happened that you had to
respond to an emergency call.

805
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,660
You were in a hurry

806
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,860
and put on his uniform.

807
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:06,980
Later,

808
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,460
you came over

809
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,370
to return the uniform.

810
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,660
Am I right?

811
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,460
This girl...

812
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,620
What's her name?

813
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,340
Nan Chu.

814
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,580
You remember it now?

815
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,580
Yes.

816
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,420
What's going on?

817
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,980
I have to go.

818
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:31,580
Help yourself.

819
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,060
I'm off.

820
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,860
Where are you going?

821
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,530
You haven't even eaten yet.

822
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,820
What were you asking me just now?

823
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,460
I was just asking,

824
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,380
have you thought it through?

825
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,460
I have.

826
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,090
I like her.

827
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,900
But that doesn't mean
you don't need to pay the bill!

828
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,650

[Tips for Fire Safety]

886
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,330
Factories are densely populated places

887
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,100
with many flammable
and combustible items.

888
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,650
How should we save ourselves

889
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,260
in the unfortunate event of a fire?

890
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,840
First of all,

891
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,470
stay calm.

892
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,290
All factories are equipped
with firefighting facilities.

893
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,180
Make initial firefighting attempts
immediately

894
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,860
and call 119 to report the fire.

895
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,180
Stay calm during the evacuation process.

896
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,900
Follow the instructions

897
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,860
and evacuate in an orderly manner.

898
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,060
In your daily life,

899
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,180
familiarize yourself with the locations
of fire exits and evacuation routes,

900
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,860
so that you can easily find them
in an emergency.

901
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,900
When there is smoke,

902
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,860
cover your mouth and nose with a wet towel

903
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,340
and bend over as you walk towards the exit.

904
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,100
If you have to wait for rescue,

905
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,620
make sure

906
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,860
that you stand on a terrace
or at a window

907
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,980
and signal for help.
