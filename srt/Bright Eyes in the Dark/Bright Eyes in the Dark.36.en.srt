So, tell me.

You said you can't talk about it over the phone.

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,300
I have sort of guessed it already,

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,980
and have mentally prepared myself.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,820
I'm sorry.

The organization

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,180
knows about the both of us.

11
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,180
It's against the rules.

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,620
Actually, since the day we got together,

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,980
I knew this would happen.

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,300
It's all my fault.

15
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,900
As a soldier,

16
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,380
I failed to protect you,

17
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,980
and I can't give you happiness.

18
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,380
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,980
I've been reading a book recently.

20
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,980
It is written in the book that

21
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,300
it's because I hold onto the hope of meeting you,

22
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,260
that I believe

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,580
the toughest path is the best path.

24
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,300
Miss Yueru,

25
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,260
please wait for me.

26
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,820
Please wait for me until I become more outstanding,

27
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,900
until I become a better firefighter,

28
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,020
until I can give you the best possible future.

29
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,180
Does that count as your promise?

30
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,380
Yes.

31
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:05,900
Alright.

32
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,180
Then, let's make a promise.

00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,100
Let's stop seeing each other for now.

34
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,450
Let's meet again only when

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,740
we become better

36
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,300
and more outstanding people.

37
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:18,660
Okay.

38
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:19,980

I'm so tired.

44
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,500
How is it that you have so many things as a girl?

45
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,340
Which girl only has a few things?

46
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,060
Haven't you helped a girl move?

47
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,260
Why would I help a girl move?

48
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,540
What did you say?

49
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,060
Nothing.

50
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,210
You have so many things.

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,260
Have you found a place?

52
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,540
Where are you moving to?

53
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,140
I don't have time to find a place.

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,980
I...

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,860
I'll go to Dream Dance Club and stay for a bit first.

Dream Dance Club?

57
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,500
Dream Dance Club won't do.

58
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,140
Look.

59
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,500
You have so many things.

60
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,100
Dream Dance Club has rehearsals during the day.

61

when it's late at night,

64
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,500
Dream Dance Club is really dark.

65
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,260
It's not safe for you to stay alone as a girl.

66
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,060
No, no,

67
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,140
Dream Dance Club won't do.

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,540

What should we do?

70
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,260
This is a problem.

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,100

You...

76
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,940
should just move in.

77
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,420
Right?

78
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,060
It's easier for us to communicate

79
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
when it comes to work too.

80
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,580
We can help each other in our daily lives too.

81
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,060

Isn't this great?

85
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,780
Do you think

86
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,100
should we hold an online concert?

87
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,660
Maybe...

88
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,660
we can attract many new users.

89
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,780
Sure.

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:31,980
Do whatever you want.

91
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,700
I'll get an invitation then.

92
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,340
Can you help me tell the Planning Department?

93
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,130
No problem.

94
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,140
Wait, no.

95
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,380
In the future, you have to contact the Planning Department yourself.

96
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,900
What do you mean?

97
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,460
You're not attending this event?

98
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,460
Of course not.

A present?

101
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,140
I want to give you the platform.

102
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,340
You will be the person-in-charge in the future.

103
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,340
So, don't you think you should

104
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,660
plan the activity yourself?

105
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,900
Stop kidding,

106
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,340

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,700
what else are you going to do?

109
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,340
Actually, I've been rewatching

110
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,980

111
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,900
And every time after I watch it, I always feel really excited.

112
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,380
In the past,

113
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,660
I only managed to find this feeling

114
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,780
when I was playing extreme sports.

115
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,140
So I think

116
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,460
this is my true passion.

117
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,700
I found the direction of my life.

118
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,540
You want to

119
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,140
to be a firefighter?

120
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,780
With Deputy Director Yu's sacrifice

121
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,780
and Nan Chu going to America,

122
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,140
I am more than determined about this.

123
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,900
I think we should pursue

124
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,380
what we are passionate about for our careers.

125
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,340
That's what makes life worthwhile.

126
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,140
Same goes for you.

127
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
Since you like art so much,

128
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,020
you should do it well.

129
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,700
I trust you.

130
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,340

what this decision means to you?

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,340
Yes, I do.

Dad,

158
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,700
what was your purpose

159
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,460
when you established Fude Group back then?

160
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,100
Why do you suddenly ask?

161
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,700
Back then, my thought was very simple.

162
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,620
It was to allow our family

163
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,220
to live a good life,

164
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,220
and when I get old,

165
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,060
I get to enjoy myself.

166
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,100
Hasn't it already come true?

167

Why are you still working so hard?

168
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,730
Actually,

169
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,700
it's easy to build up the empire,

170
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,580
but it's difficult to protect it.

171
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,580
Think about it. There are so many people in the company

172
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,700
who are relying on us for survival.

173
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,220
How can I quit?

174
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,300
And you!

175
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,220
You always make me worry.

176
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,460
If you are doing this for me,

177
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,220
then please do not worry.

178
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,580
You were right before.

179

181
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,460
But I found it now.

182
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,700
And it's even thanks to you.

183
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,580

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,820
do the show, Flaming Youth,

185
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,300
maybe I would have stayed confused even up till now.

186

But I never thought why was there a need for me to prove myself.

192
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,490
So what

193
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,340
if I got recognition from you?

194
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,100
There are so many people in this world.

195
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,300
If I prove to them one by one,

196
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,100
just how tired will I be?

197
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,580
Actually, the only thing I have to face

198
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,410
is myself.

199
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,580
I had to ask myself honestly.

200
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
What I want is a sense of accomplishment

201
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,740
and presence.

202
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,420
And these two feelings

203
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,300
can be found on firefighters.

204
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,580
Being a firefighter

205
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,340
is the value of life that I have been seeking.

206
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,690
Fine.

207
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,700
If you think so,

208
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,580
it means you've grown up.

209
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,860
I support you.

210
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,060
What about you, Dad?

211
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,820
I...

212
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:45,940
Look.

213
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,580
You are getting old,

214
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,580
and it's impossible for the company to expand further.

215
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,860
Also, our family is doing well now.

216
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,700
It's time to enjoy life.

217
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,730
Enjoy life?

218
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,820
What about the company?

219
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,740
Leave it to a professional management team.

220
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,820
Times are moving so fast these days.

221
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,980
It's no longer the time to be fighting all by yourself.

222
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,580
Think about how old you are now.

223
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,580
No matter how hard you work,

224
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,460
how many more years can you go?

225
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,580
Dad.

226
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,980
Actually, work is not the only thing in life.

227
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,300
You've already done up to 90 points.

228
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,500
Save ten points for yourself.

229
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,220
Take my mom out

230
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,820
and enjoy life.

231
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,820
Enjoy life?

232
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
It's not that easy.

233
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,700
That's enough.

234
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,420
Let's go home.

235
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
I have to finish my work.

236
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,340
Please listen to me for once.

237
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,460
You want to kidnap me?

238
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,500
Yes, I want to kidnap you.

239
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,100
You...

240
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,700
Let's go.

241
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:03,940
Coming.

242
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,100
How is it?

243
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,690
It looks good.

244
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,940
Of course.

245
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,860
Not bad.

246
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,980
It's fresh.

247
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,930
Let me tell you.

248
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,460
It's been cooked for hours.

249
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,220
Besides,

250
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,100
the ingredients we bought were also good.

251
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,220
I said you were fat,

252
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,500
and you don't seem to mind it at all, do you?

253
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,100
Let me tell you.

254
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,300
I can cook a wide variety of dishes.

255
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,860
Hey,

256
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,220
since Nan Chu has left,

257
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,220
are we really unemployed now?

258
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
What are you talking about?

259
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,620
There are so many artists in the company.

260
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,980
You're still afraid of being unemployed?

261
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,580
I've made up my mind.

262
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,820
In this period of time, I'll take care of the other artists,

263
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,300
and help them get more opportunities.

264
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,740
When Nan Chu is back,

265
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,060
I'll still be her manager.

266
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,860
I'll try my best to learn makeup

267
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,820
and become a famous makeup artist too.

268
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
When Nan Chu comes back,

269
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,820
let's continue to work with her.

270
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,460
Okay.

271
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,460
Let's wish Nan Chu all the best.

272
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,820
Wait.

273
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,100
And also Coach Lin.

274
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,060
Right.

275
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,100
Let's wish all of us good luck then.

276
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,180
May we all get better.

277
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,460
Okay.

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,980
Look at this shabby car.

281
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,100
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,980
Are you Lin Luxiao, who was transferred from Beixun?

283
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,220
You are?

00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,220
I'm Zhao Guo from Lushan Fire Brigade.

285
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:02,930
Hello, Captain Zhao.

286
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,940
I'm Lin Luxiao, who was transferred here from Beixun.

287
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,820
I am here report to you.

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,340
Get in.

290
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,100
Okay.

291
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,100

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,820
No, let me do it myself.

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,860
You are going to farm?

Brother.

305
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,740

Yes.

308
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,100
It’s been hard to recruit people for our brigade.

309
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,580
We can only recruit among the locals.

310
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,970
You are back?

00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,420

are from this village.

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,580
It's not easy to get the team up.

The cabbage looks so tender.

315
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,620

316
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,340
come and take a look

317
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,580
at my television.

318
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,580
Television?

319
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,220
What's wrong?

320
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,340
It's broken.

321
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,740
It's because of the bad signal, no?

322
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:47,940

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,500

- This one?
- This cap is so pretty.

352
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,860
is our car not safe?

353
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,580
There are only four cars in our station.

354
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,180
I'm worried there's a mission anytime,

355
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,500
so we don't use them easily.

356
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,820
If you want to go anywhere,

357
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,700
you have to ride this stupid electric bike.

358
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,700
Although it's broken,

359
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,300
it's really resistant.

360
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,140
We're here.

361
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,460
Here we are.

362
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,380

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:07,900
Harder!

00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,700

366
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,170
Push it.

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300

00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,500
You don't have to worry.

570
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,780
Just rest here.

571
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,740
It's just peeling garlic, no big deal.

572
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,380
I'll go.

573
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,260
Get me a pair of chopsticks.

574
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,260
I'll go.

575
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,660
Wait a minute.

576
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,660
Captain Zhao,

577
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,460
if you need help,

578
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,220
just tell me.

579
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,060
No, nothing for now.

580
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,220
Have a rest.

581
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,220
Have a seat.

582
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,460
Are we mincing or slicing the garlic?

583
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,220
Hurry up and peel.

584
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,620
Come on, try it.

585
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,300
How is it?

586
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,260
Dinner is ready.

587
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,540
Let's eat.

588
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,180
I'm afraid you're not used to it,

589
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,380
so I specially made you Western food.

590
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,660
Pizza.

591
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:03,700
Pizza?

592
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,980
Pizza.

593
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:06,980
Let me try.

594
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,860
What is this?

595
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,700
Why does it taste so bland?

596
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,260
Get me some soy sauce.

597
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,260
Get me some vinegar.

598
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,020
So many requests.

599
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,500
Instructor,

600
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,300
why did you transfer to Lushan?

601
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,220
There's nothing a big city lacks.

602
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,980
Why did you come all the way to the villages here?

603
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,660
Cut the crap.

604
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,300
Soy sauce.

605
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,260
Vinegar.

606
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,220
How was the patrol?

607
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,260
It was pretty good.

608
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,460
Just as usual.

609
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,980
Remember to write your report.

610
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,220
Okay.

611
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,300
Next time when you go on patrol,

612
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,220
you have to write a report too.

613
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,020
Okay.

614
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,260
When is your next patrol?

615
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,970
Normally,

616
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,700
it's five days later.

617
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,460
Well then, I'll go with you all the next time.

618
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,460
You don't have to.

619
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,900
You stay at the station.

620
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,420
Why?

621
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,500
The mountainous roads are hard to walk.

622
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,140
It's just some dirty and tiring work.

623
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,460
You just came.

624
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,980
Let's talk about it later.

625
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,700
Captain Zhao,

626
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,460
this won't do.

627
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,220
I'm here to learn from all of you.

628
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,620
You can't stop me from going.

629
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,460
Learn?

630
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:25,620
Yes.

631
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:28,900
Okay.

632
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,180
This afternoon,

633
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,620
we have a field training.

634
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,900
I was thinking since you are new here,

635
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,180
you should take a rest first.

636
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,540
If you're not tired,

637
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,980
then let's go together.

638
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,020
I'm not tired.

639
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:42,700
Let's go together.

640
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,420
It's a deal.

641
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,020
I will join the training in the afternoon.

642
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,620
Let's go together.

643
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,180
Eat.

644
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,500
It's good. I’m eating.

645
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,140
Instructor,

646
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,460
let me introduce.

647
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,890
There are

648
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,780
27 Firefighting Key Monitoring Areas in Lushan.

649
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,140
19 of which are easily flammable areas,

650
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,700
which must all be checked.

651
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,380
You are going to be tired today.

652
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,540
Do we have to finish checking all areas every time?

653
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,220
This forest

654
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,620
has its life.

655
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,140
It's constantly changing throughout the year.

656
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,180
We might tackle this area today,

657
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,300
but the next time we come,

658
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,660
there will be another pile of flammable areas.

659
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,700
There's always something being left out.

660
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,540
There will always be hidden dangers.

661
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,980
We have no choice.

662
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,180
We can only check them one by one.

663
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,300
A little defense is better than none.

664
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,700
What choice do we have as

665
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,780
firefighters who are always on our feet?

666
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,780
Indeed.

667
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,620
We are walking wherever we go.

668
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,700
Watch your step.

669
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,380
Be careful.

670
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,140
Don't sprain your ankle.

671
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,420
Guys,

672
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,420
get to work.

673
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,460
Clean it up.

674
00:30:59,460 --> 00:30:59,940
Instructor,

675
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,460
look.

676
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,220
When we go to the scene of a fire,

677
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,940
or when we are patrolling,

678
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,660
such a tree blocks our way.

679
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,180
It must be sawed.

680
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,220
If you don't saw it,

681
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,660
can't we just go around it?

682
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,220
If there's a fire,

683
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,500
or when we retreat,

684
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,740
it will block our way every time.

685
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,220
So,

686
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,620
we must saw it away,

687
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,460
so that we can solve future pitfalls

688
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,620
once and for all.

689
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,460
It's all about experience.

690
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:30,900
Learn well.

691
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,420
Okay.

692
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,500
Guys.

693
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,140
Let's go.

694
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,860
Watch your step.

695
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:00,780
Be careful.

696
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,460
Don't sprain your ankle.

697
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,460
What are you doing?

698
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,420
What's wrong?

699
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,380
There's a tick.

700
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,700
Are you trying to kill it,

701
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,300
or are you trying to kill me?

702
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,550
It's okay.

703
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,700
You're not considered from Lushan

704
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,900
if you have not been bitten by a tick.

705
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,620
Guys,

706
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,460
let's get the spirits up by singing a song.

707
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,980
Okay.

708
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,020
Unity is strength.

709
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,940
Ready, sing!

710
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,460
Unity is strength.

711
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,970
Unity is strength.

712
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,900
This power is iron,

713
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,980
this power is steel.

714
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,180
What’s wrong?

715
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,380
Are you okay, Instructor?

716
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
What’s going on?

717
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,220
Nothing.

718
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,860
I got a little dizzy when I started to sing.

719
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,940
What kind of body is this?

720
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,780
It's not high altitude sickness, is it?

721
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,700
You are a big guy,

722
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,180
so your oxygen consumption is higher.

723
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,620
Baohua,

724
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,460
carry his backpack.

725
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,780
Give me this.

726
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,500
Give me your bag.

727
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,460
I'm fine.

728
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,980
Slow down.

729
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,700
Give me your bag.

730
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,420
No need.

731
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,420
I can walk by myself.

732
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:31,900
No need.

733
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,620
Slowly.

734
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,020
Let's go.

735
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,300
Let's go.

736
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:34,700
I don't care.

737
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:34,980
Go!

738
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,220
Go!

739
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,010
Let's go.

740
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,220
Unity is strength.

741
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,340
How are you?

742
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:58,740
Captain Zhao.

743
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,660
I made you some ginger soup

744
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,340
and added a piece of lean meat.

745
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,540
Drink it

746
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,580
and you will feel better.

747
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,340
Captain Zhao,

748
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,530
I have held up the rest of the team.

749
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,380
What are you talking about?

750
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,820
We are all a team.

751
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,300
Have some soup.

752
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,500
I can't.

753
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,460
I feel nauseous.

754
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,540
Let me see.

755
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,140
You are running a fever.

756
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,340
Come on.

757
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:48,580
Get up.

758
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,620
Take some medicine.

759
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,580
Take some medicine.

760
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,460
Thank you, Captain Zhao.

767
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,340
is out of his mind?

768
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,100
Yes.

769
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,580
Why would he choose to come here,

770
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,540
instead of staying in a big city?

771
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,260
He knows nothing.

772
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,900
Why did the higher-ups send such a person here?

773
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,180
It's to experience life.

774
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,780
Is this experiencing life?

775
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,980
I have told you before.

776
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,940
He's here to build up his resume.

777
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,900
He'll leave after he's done.

778
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,460

It's not that we don't believe you.

Even if we don't,

781
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,500
you can't just transfer him away.

782

Zhao,

783
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,300
I say you don't arrange anymore work for him.

784
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,900
Just let him stay here.

785
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,620

786

788
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,260
He's the youngest director in Beixun.

789
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,180
He must be something.

790
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,140
What's the use?

791
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,140
We don't have tall buildings here.

792
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:08,940
Do we?

00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,180

Let me ask you.

798
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,620
When you first came here,

799
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,500
didn't you also have high altitude sickness?

800
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,980
No,

801
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,060
but I'm afraid something might happen to him.

802
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,780
What are you afraid of?

803
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,140
He just needs a few days off.

804
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,260
No, no.

805
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:33,860
you really can't.

806
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,420
Zhao,

807
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,980
I have to watch him at night.

808
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,020
Look how weak he is.

809
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,020
If he feels unwell at night,

810
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,580
I'll have to make him some ginger soup.

811
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,460
If it doesn't work,

812
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,300
I'll drive him to the hospital.

813
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,340
Right?

814
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,020
Look at you.

815
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,340
If you care about him,

816
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,620
why don't you just say it.

Guys,

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,570
grab your weapons.

00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,200

00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,570
Have you brought all the equipment?

00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,250

Where are you going?

990
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,200
You have a fever.

991
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,250
You shouldn't go.

992
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,090

Do not panic.

1009
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,500
If the fire is small,

1010
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,520
you can use water or soil to bury it,

1011
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,870
or use branches and hit against to try and put out the fire.

1012
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,390
If the fire is out of control,

1013
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,900
evacuate immediately to avoid danger,

1014
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,750
and call the forest fire and rescue

1015
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,840
at 12119.

1016
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,860
When we're evacuating,

1017
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,750
you must first assess the direction of the wind.

1018
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,890
Escape against the direction of the wind and run down the mountain.

1019
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,860
When we evacuate,

1020
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,460
if there is a water source around you,

1021
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,190
you can cover your mouth and nose with wet clothes.

1022
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,460
When you escape through the fire line,

1023
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,220
use wet clothes to protect your head.

1024
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,330
To avoid danger, stay away from the dense bushes

1025
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,260
and look for an empty, safe zone.

1026
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,820
Clear any easily flammable items in the surrounding quickly,

1027
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,210
in order to remove the hidden danger.
