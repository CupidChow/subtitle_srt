When the fire broke out, the fire department

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,340
immediately arranged firefighters to rush to the scene.

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,180
Up until now,

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,300
the fire is under control.

The firefighters are putting out the residual fire.

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,020
No casualties at the moment.

00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,380

Hurry up.

00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,260
Go back.

32
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,310

00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,380

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,500
Thank you.

35

the cause of the fire has been identified.

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,420
A resident on the fifth floor

39
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,100
illegally charged an electric motorbike.

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,060
The explosion was caused by lithium batteries.

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,220
How many times have we publicized?

42
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,100
How could they still charge inside a building?

43
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,780
Does Lin know?

44
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,660
Yes.

45
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,940
He's coordinating.

46
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,260
But fortunately,

47
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,580
the evacuation was in time,

48
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,100
so there were no casualties.

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,940
Thank goodness.

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,540
There were no casualties in today's accident.

51
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,220
I think firefighters

52
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,100
are really heroes.

53
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,140
Their profession is really meaningful.

54
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,660

I don't need to

repeat the whole incident again.

63
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,580
You were the leader this time.

64
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,100
You should be responsible for

65
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,460
what had happened.

66
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,140
Any objections?

67
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,100
No.

68
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,340
I admit it's all my fault.

69
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,130
I will cooperate to accept

70
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,460
any penalty at the station,

71
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,220
including compensating.

72
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,140
OK.

73
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,100
I hope you can not only admit mistakes,

00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,900
but also solve problems efficiently.

Inspector Lou.

76
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,340
We did make a mistake

77
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,340
during this mission.

78
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,580
But it's inevitable that

79
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,340
we will encounter difficulties and troubles

80
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,780
in missions on the front line.

81
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,700
As Inspectors,

82
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,700
you should supervise us

83
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,540
and also understand us.

84
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,700
If every time

85
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,380
we have to compensate or be punished,

86
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,140
how can I lead my team?

87
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,220

88
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,580
and run into the same problem,

89
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,220
should they rescue or not?

90
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,980
If they cause economic loss to the general public

91
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,980
due to their inaction,

92
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,260
will they be held accountable in the end?

93
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,580
We're here to solve the problem together.

We'll later visit and apologize.

102
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,700
We'll definite compensate for the loss.

103
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,340
Yes.

104
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,340
No need.

105
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,820
The Brigade has heard about the situation.

106

This incident is

107
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,660
not only because of us,

108
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,580
it was the drunk man's fault too.

109
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,220
We'll discuss the details with

110
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,340
the relevant person and property management.

111
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,580
Director Lin,

112
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,540
I said a lot.

113
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,980
It's because I want you to know

114
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,580
we'll do what we have to do.

115
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,340
But as the Director,

116
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,900
I don't want to judge

117
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,580
whether you are qualified.

118
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,580
You can report to your superiors,

119
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,220
if you have doubts about my qualification.

120
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,780
What do you mean by that?

121
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,900
It means there's a serious problem in your station.

122
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,340
As the Director,

123
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,460
don't always defend your team when problems occur.

124
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,140
The two rookies

125
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,220
came to your station not long ago.

126
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,340
It's already their second time making a mistake.

127
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,460
I'm here to remind you.

128
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,130
You have to manage more strictly.

129
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,580
Don't let things go wrong again.

130
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,340
Inspector Lou, this way.

131
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,140
It's all my fault.

132
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,580
This has nothing to do with you.

133
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,780

134
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,780
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,980
It's all my fault.

136
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,660
I got you involved

137
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,460
to compensate together.

138
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
Do you have the money?

139
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,780
Why are you giving me so much money?

140
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,980
Take it.

141
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,220
I'm also responsible for this.

142
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,580
I've asked.

143
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,380
That door is worth this price.

144
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,540
Give the 6,000 yuan

145
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,260
to the resident.

146
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,140
Where did you get so much money?

147
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,020
I saved it.

148
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,460
Unlike you,

149
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,020
I didn't start buying things when I got here.

150
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,780
You didn't learn from Assistant Liu's strengths.

151
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,220
You learned to be a big spender like him.

152
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,780
Be more like Unit Leader Lei.

153
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,340
Be stingy.

154
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,260
Okay.

155
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,220
I'll pay you back when I get my salary.

156
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,700
Don't worry about it.

157
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,220
Think about what the station will do with us.

158
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,020
I knew it.

159
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,140
You're good.

160
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,700
Are you two okay?

161
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,940
I don't think it's your fault.

162
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,100
They can't blame you.

163
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,460
Mr. Jiang,

164
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,220
I don't agree with you.

165
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,580
Think about it. In the middle of the night,

166
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,420
someone suddenly popped out of the door.

167
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,580
The girl must be scared to death.

168
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,980
How scary.

169
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,700
They're too young.

170
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,980
In my opinion,

171
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,300
rookies lack experiences.

172
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,860
But it's not your fault.

173
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,980
It will be fine

174
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,820
when you have more experiences.

175
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,940
Mr. Qi is right.

176
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,820
Rookies need to experience it more.

177
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:52,980
Let me tell you about the heroic story

178
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,220

180
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,980
don't mention it. Lots of people are here.

181
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,300
The crew is still recording.

182
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,220
Save me some face.

183
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,340
Why?

184
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,340
He already told the story.

185
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,180
But I think you're right.

186
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,100
You need to gain more experiences.

187
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,460
It'll be fine after gaining much experience.

188
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:10,980
Right?

189
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,090

190
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,220
We're sorry.

191
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,340
It won't happen again.

192
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:14,740
Yes.

193
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,820
Instructor Yang.

194
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,810
Shiquan and I have prepared some money.

195
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,820
I transferred it to you.

196
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,980
Give it to the resident.

197
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,860
Forget it.

198
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,820
The crew will pay for it.

199
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,620
No, Mr. Jiang.

200
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,820
That's a different matter.

201
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,580
After all, this is a matter in our station.

202
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,860
So I think

203
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,500
we all should raise the money together.

204
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,220
No problem.

205
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,340
Let me tell you.

206
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,420
If you make such a mistake again,

207
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,580
I'll bring along my child

208
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,460
and stay at your place.

209
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,180
Thank you, Unit Leader Lei.

210
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,820
Thank you, everyone.

211
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,500
I transferred it.

213
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,180

Here.

You two follow me to the honor room.

216
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,820
Yes, sir.

217
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,710
If any of you are interested,

218
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,140
come with me.

[Honor Room]

220
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,150
Master.

221
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,120
We know we were wrong.

222
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,890
What did you do wrong?

223
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,870
We should've followed the rules,

224
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,270
and took action after investigating the case.

225
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,740
We shouldn't be impulsive.

226
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,870
Master,

227
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,260
I admit I didn't handle it well this time.

228
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,320
But I don't think I did anything wrong.

229
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,880
I've asked what happened at that time,

230
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,350
and explained everything.

231
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,780
That person didn't make it clear.

232
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,870
Do you think

233
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,850
you feel wronged?

234
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,480
Come and have a look.

242
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,620
and diligent.

243
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,510
One day, a resident

244
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,020
in our district called the fire brigade,

245
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,630
saying there was a hornet nest outside the window.

246
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,260
The resident lived on the 15th floor.

247
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,490
Dayong was the one on duty that day.

248
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,880
From that day onwards,

249
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,370
Dayong never came back.

250
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,400
After that incident, we've been emphasizing

251
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,970
safety ranging from our station to the superiors.

252
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:41,980
Why?

253
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,500
Because Dayong sacrificed his life

254
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,100
for this experience and lesson.

255
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,340

258
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,480
it's not worth it
[Martyr Wu Dayong]

259
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,250
it's not worth it

260
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,480
to sacrifice his life for a hornet nest?

261
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,860
The resident felt very sorry.

262
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,650
He kept apologizing to us at the station.

263
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,250
But could you blame him?

264
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,230
He just came to ask for help.

265
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,000
But on the other hand,

266
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,380
it's not Dayong's fault.

267
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,900
Because Dayong had followed

268
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,250
all the safety measures.

269
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,310
He just wanted to help others solve the problem.

270
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,870
So all these years,

271
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,260
we constantly advanced

272
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,360
our equipment,

273
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,510
and improved training methods.

274
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,070
It is for safety.

275
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,510
It is to protect every one of us.

276
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,260
Many people, including you guys,

277
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,120
think firefighters are heroes in the fire.

278
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,390
But we know

279
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,130
we are not only dealing with fire and explosion.

280
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,150
Most of the time, we have to

281
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,490
get rid of a hornet nest

282
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,960
or remove a ring.

283
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,900
These are all trivial matters in life.

284
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,620
So we must

285
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,260
be more careful

286
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,770
and more careful at work.

287
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,370
That's how you are responsible for yourself.

288
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,980
It's also a responsibility to those in need.

289
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,250
In the end,

290
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,600
there isn't a best way of

291
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,540
firefighting.

292
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,260
You can only do better.

293
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,610
Understand?

294
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,540

I'm sorry.

297
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,740
I was too anxious this time.

298
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,880
It's my fault.

299
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,760
Don't worry.

But I hope

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,220
you can put extra effort

Liu's old injury flared up again.

316
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,630

317
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,980
Didn't Liu always show off his muscle?

318
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,090
He was competing with Jiang Ge
on the bench press in the gym.

00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,520
Yanzi.

382
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,670
Before I find a new finance officer,

383
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,930
can you help with the job?

384
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,440
Sure, no problem.

385
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,420
But we have an empty account now.

386
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,140
Why do we need a finance officer?

387
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,080
This is the salary from my first program.

388
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,430
The company just gave it to me.

389
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,060
But it may not be much,

390
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,950
because I used some to pay for the rent.

391
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,060
But there will be more in the future.

392
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,900
I've

393
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,950
asked someone

394
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,380
to invite a great choreographer.

395
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,100
If he joins,

396
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,200
we'll have a better chance of winning
the contest at the end of the year.

397
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,180
When I get my next salary,

398
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,650
you can pick out clothes for the dance competition.

399
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,800
Nan Chu.

400
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,150
Thank you.

401
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,040
Not at all.

402
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,170
You all worked hard.

403
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,310
But don't slack off while I'm not around.

404
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,290
I'll pop by and check.

405
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,060
I remember Le used to be like this.

406
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,280
Every time he got the money for our studio,

407
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,130
he acted like as if it was a piece of cake.

408
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,400
But only he knew

409
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,160
the hard work behind every penny.

410
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,630
Nan Chu.

411
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,660
I don't want you to be the next Le.

412
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,980
I understand what you mean.

413
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,920
But I will take good care of myself.

414
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,130
Don't worry.

415
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,610
Xi Gu,

416
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,580
do you like this place?

417
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,050
Yes, I love it.

418
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,280
Nan Chu, you know.

419
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,210
I liked dancing and music since I was little.

420
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,310
It's just that I don't have the talent.

421
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,620
But I enjoy watching them.

422
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,680
Dream Dance Club will take part in
a national competition at the end of the year.

423
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,870
Do you want to help with their styling?

424
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,130
Sure.

425
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:51,880
Okay, let's take a break.

426
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,110
But the pay may not be too high.

427
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,290
To be honest,

428
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,460
we've been having a hard time lately.

429
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,350
It's okay, Nan Chu. I won't charge for it.

430
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,670
Nan Chu, you help me every day.

431
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,320
I want to do something for you.

432
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,790
Besides, I like this place.

433
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,380
I'm willing to help you.

434
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,190
How about this?

435
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,200
Let's make a deal.

436
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,550
You do our styling for free.

437
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,070
I'll provide you a free accommodation.

438
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,990
Really?

439
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,890
This place is quite spacious.

440
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,650
It's really artistic too.

441
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,800
But the bed is a bit hard.

442
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,640
It's okay.

443
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,560
I like to sleep on a hard bed.

444
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,070
It's a deal then.

445
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,160
You move in with me.

446
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,170
Then

447
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,390
I've become

448
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,780
a member of Dream Dance Club.

449
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,620
Of course.

450
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,980
Nan Chu, I love you so much.

451
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,130
Nan Chu.

452
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,520
You're here.

453
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,320
Why are we meeting here?

454
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,930
I had a tutoring class nearby.

455
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,940
It's more convenient.

456
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,360
I'm attending a birthday party later.

457
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,170
Our great artist

458
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,600
have ended up in the society like this.

459
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,360
I'm enduring hardships.

460
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,620
But,

461
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,050
as long as I can be successful,

462
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,350
this mess is nothing.

463
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,030
You're ready for the solo concert?

464
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,290
Of course.

465
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,270
I prepared 11 pieces of music

466
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,450
for this solo.

467
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:03,910
I wrote one of the pieces myself.

[Lin Qi Notes Never End Violin Solo Concert]]

473
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,570
You got a style.

474
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,410
You're into rock and roll?

475
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,180
What style?

476
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,770
It just for convenience.

477
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,200
My company thinks it costs too much

478
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,180
to hold a solo concert in the music hall.

479
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,900
They want to try a small one first.

480
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,370
As the old saying goes,

481
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,220
everything is hard at the beginning.

482
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,400
As long as it begins, there will be a chance to succeed.

483
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,520
But

484
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,330
the company didn't agree to hire you as backup dancers.

485
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,220
But we'll have a chance next time.

486
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,400
I'll invite your club next time.

487
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,160
Our dance club is preparing

488
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,090
for a national competition at the end of the year.

489
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,140
If you really need us,

490
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,320
we might not have the time.

491
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,450
Really?

492
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,120
Yes.

493
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,190
Wish Miss Nan Chu and I all the success!

494
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,110
Success!

495
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,670
But will your brother

496
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,190
attend your solo concert?

497
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,700
My brother?

498
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,590
I gave him the ticket,

499
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,680
but don’t know if he's available.

500
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,830
Has your brother been always working in Beixun?

501
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,690
Has he been to a department in other cities?

502
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,710
No, he has been always in Beixun.

503
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,620
What's wrong?

504
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,890
I've been too tired lately.

505
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,820
I can't even remember.

506
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,670
Come to me if you can't remember.

507
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,430
Let's chat more often.

508
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,600
You are so busy.

509
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,370
Handle your work first.

510
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,120
Worker.

511
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,110
That really hit home for me.

512
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,550
I really didn't expect nowadays,

513
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,890
even artists have to work overtime.

514
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,360
It's very competitive.

515
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,390
But you're really different from your brother.

516
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,950
Your brother is always cold.

517
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,590
He seems to have a lot on his mind,

518
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,360
pretending to be deep.

519
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,930
He's not pretending.

520
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,910
A few years ago, during a rescue mission,

521
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,390
he saw a little boy die in front of him.

522
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,980
He wanted but wasn't able to save him.

523
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,080
He has been blaming

524
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,840
himself for that incident.

525
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,400
I guess he was traumatized.

526
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,330
Later, I heard that

527
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,800
in the first few years,

528
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,950
my brother was working his butt off.

529
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,130
He would be the first one to deal with danger.

530
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,270
Otherwise, how could he be a Director

531
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,620
at such a young age?

532
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,800
I see.

533
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,080
But my brother was quite naughty when he was little.

534
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,460
He was beaten up a lot.

535
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,600
And he caused a lot of trouble.

536
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,070
Really?

537
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,370
Of course.

538
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,600
My dad is a veteran officer,

539
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,870
and a good firefighter.

540
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,180
But they haven't seen

541
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,900
each other for a long time.

542
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,380
They're like father and son rivals.

543
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,770
Both of them care about each other,

544
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,620
but they don't say anything.

545
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,100
Don't you feel awkward

546
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,570
in the middle?

547
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,880
Of course. I'm always careful.

548
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,980
If I hadn't use violin as an excuse

549
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,110
to stay at my brother's place,

550
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,080
I'd have been insane for a long time.

551
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,600
Alright, Mr. Lin.

552
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,530
Are you nervous to be on stage soon?

553
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,880
How can you say nervous?

554
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,270
I'm excited.

555
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,400
Excited?

556
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,660
That's right.

557
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,430
I'm always excited before going on stage.

558
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,530
Excited means success.

559
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,200
Of course.

560
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,880
Break a leg!

561
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,850
To the left. To the left.

562
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,520
Right, right.

563
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,290
Mr. Ma,

564
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,850
I have to rehearse for tonight's show.

565
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,900
This is...

566
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:18,580
I see.

567
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,390
This kid's father

568
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,980
provided funding to sponsor our company.

569
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,960
He wanted to fulfill

570
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,340
his son's dream of playing the violin.

571
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,680
So I thought about it.

572
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,530
Both of you are playing the violin.

573
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,790
During this concert,

574
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,980
you'll play the first half.

575
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,150
He'll play the second half.

576
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,920
That means I'll be warming up for him.

577
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,900
This is my solo concert.

578
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,630
I'm not discussing it with you, Lin Qi.

579
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,590
I'm just informing you.

580
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,610
From now on,

581
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,880
it'll be the joint concert for both of you.

582
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,050
Mr. Ma,

583
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,520
the concert has been advertised.

584
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,700
It suddenly become a joint concert.

585
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,920
What should I tell the audience?

586
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,930
How...

587
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,700
Do you know how many tickets

588
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,670
were sold in your concert?

589
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,120
Fifty?

590
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,220
Five.

591
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,900
You bought the other two, right?

592
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,670
Let me tell you.

593
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,700
I'm kind enough to let you play the first half.

594
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,620
You should thank him.

595
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,970
His father gave you an opportunity.

596
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,200
No need.

597
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,880
I don't need this opportunity.

598
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,970
I'm done.

599
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,860
Well said. You have guts.

600
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,870
You don't want us anymore?

601
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,470
You have guts.

602
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,710
Pay back the operation and packaging fee

603
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,430
that the company has spent on you.

604
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,190
I'll play.

605
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,600
Two of you.

606
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Take the chair away.

607
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,580
The screen.

608
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,510
Make the screen brighter.

609
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,040
You're here too?

610
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,420
Yes.

611
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,560
It hasn't started yet?

612
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,830
It should start soon.

613
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,510
Who is this?

614
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,960
It's a warm-up.

615
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,350
Warm-up?

616
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,220
Hurry up.

617
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,280
I need to get to work.

618
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,910
Who is this? How long will it take?

619
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,420
Excuse me.

620
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,980
Please lower your voice.

621
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,820
What?

622
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm not here to see him.

623
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,970
Hurry and play.

624
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,650
Hurry up.

625
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,860
I'm sorry.

626
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,080
Can you lower your voice?

627
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,880
What are you doing?

628
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,800
Let go.

629
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,190
Show some respect.

630
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,320
Respect what?

631
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,380
Respect art.

632
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,150
That's my brother.

633
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,460
Fine.

634
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,550
Thank you.

635
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,380
Okay.

636
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,430
Qiqi.

637
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,590
Qiqi.

638
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,600
Come on, Qiqi.

639
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,930
Come on.

640
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,400
Thank you.

641
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,070
Here you go.

642
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,590
Why are you two here?

643
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,270
We came

644
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,710
to celebrate your successful performance.

645
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,770
Successful?

646
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,400
How is it successful?

647
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,710
I'm just a warm-up.

648
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,600
A solo concert?

649
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,910
No one wanted to listen to me.

650
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,340
Who said no one?

651
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,150
Sergeant Lin and I listened very carefully.

652
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,040
I gave the tickets to you two.

653
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,230
This stage

654
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,330
is meaningless.

655
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,360
Of course not.

656
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,830
When I used to dance,

657
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,220
no one was sitting in the audience.

658
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,350
I thought

659
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,370
that I'd use it as a practice.

660
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,680
When the stage is full of crowd,

661
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,150
I can do better.

662
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,040
So it must be meaningful.

663
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,700
Lin Qi,

664
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,960
this is the first time

665
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,140
I listen to you play the violin on the stage.

666
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,540
I can see that you really like music.

667
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,520
So no matter it's big or small,

668
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,620
I hope you can respect the stage.

669
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,880
Respect art

670
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,890
and your profession.

671
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,870
Don't worry.

672
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,640
I won't give up.

673
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,210
You said you wrote a piece of music last time.

674
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,810
When are you going to play it for us?

675
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,040
I want to see if the dance club can use it.

676
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,520
Let's go now.

677
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,120
There still are lights on the stage.

678
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,870
Let's go.

679
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,320
Sir, I'm sorry.

680
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,630
Can you give us some time?

681
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,380
Hurry up.

682
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,770
Okay.

683
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,700
Nan Chu.

684
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,380
Show me your dance in the competition.

685
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,350
Give me some inspiration.

686
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,570
Forget it.

687
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,290
What are you worried about? There's no outsider here.

688
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,390
Go. Let me hold it for you.

689
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,610
Thank you.

690
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,880
You scared me just now.

691
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,360
I thought you were going to hit him.

692
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,040
How could I?

693
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,690
But I was a bit upset.

694
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,130
Many people are like him.

695
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,860
We also came across them in our performances.

696
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,590
So I understand Lin Qi.

697
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,100
I feel sorry for him.

698
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,380
His performance didn't go well today.

699
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,350
He must be very upset.

700
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,380
He must have regretted inviting me here.

701
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,310
No way.

702
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,540
He values you very much.

703
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,610
So he's happy that you came.

704
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,380
He didn't want you to be disappointed.

705
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,690
He only shares good news with you.

706
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,880
He wouldn't tell you bad news.

707
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,520
I know.

708
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,290
Since we were young,

709
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,630
he wouldn't have to tell me.

710
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,850
I would understand him.

711
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,250
So when he was really upset today,

712
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,380
your encouragement

713
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,230
was very important to him.

714
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,430
Yours too.

715
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,280
As his good friend,

716
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,630
it's very precious

717
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,350
to see you supporting him.

718
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,190
How is your dance club?

719
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,550
To be honest,

720
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,990
it is quite difficult.

721
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,210
We don't have much income.

722
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,110
But I still don't want to give up.

723
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,630
After all, this is what I like to do.

724
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,650
It's good.

725
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,030
Hang in there.

726
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,080
All the best

727
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,370
Sergeant Lin,

728
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,210
do you have books on

729
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,820
psychological counseling for fire rescue?

730
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,620
I want to read it.

731
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:13,750
Yes.

732
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,430
I'll find them for you.

733
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,690
Okay.

734
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,040
Let me tell you.

735
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,510
Captain Meng told me

736
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,330
he would inspect our training results today.

737
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,470
Tell the others.

738
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,950
Pay full attention.

739
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:49,660
Okay, no problem.

740
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,000
You can't make any mistakes in appearances.

741
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,130
[Binjiang Fire Brigade Beixun City Brigade]
You can't make any mistakes in appearances.

742
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:51,760
You know?
[Binjiang Fire Brigade Beixun City Brigade]

743
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,180
[Binjiang Fire Brigade Beixun City Brigade]

744
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,570
When Captain Meng comes today,
[Binjiang Fire Brigade Beixun City Brigade]

745
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,360
we must give him
[Binjiang Fire Brigade Beixun City Brigade]

746
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:54,410
[Binjiang Fire Brigade Beixun City Brigade]

747
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,580
a warm welcome ceremony.
[Binjiang Fire Brigade Beixun City Brigade]

748
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,590
Passion, right?

749
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:56,880
Yes.

750
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,680
Simple.

751
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,690
Set up a water screen,

752
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,490
and some fireworks.

753
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,410
When you pull the banner,

754
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,760
Mr. Meng will feel our enthusiasm.

755
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,020
Don't bother.

756
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,740
Don't spend money on these useless things.

757
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,380
It's not your money.

758
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,350
Listen, you need to improve your thinking.

759
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,030
If we perform well in training,

760
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,950
and get a merit award next year,

761
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,550
we'll get all the bonus and allowance.

762
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,280
There's bonus and allowance?

763
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,660
Of course.

764
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,370
Don't worry.

765
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,090
I'll stay alert today,

766
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,100
and find Captain Meng.

767
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,360
Let him feel our enthusiasm.

768
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,040
Then you have to keep it up.

769
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,300
Report to me when you go to the toilet.

770
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,900
No problem.

771
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,330
Alright.

772
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,670
Don't make any random arrangements.

773
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,060
Captain Meng said he would inspect in secret.

774
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,200
Do you understand?

775
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,160
Gather around.

776
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:32,920
Wait.

777
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,150
Director,

778
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,440
Captain Meng hasn't arrived yet.

779
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,620
It's useless to do the training.

780
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,540
Yes, Director.

781
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,090
We need to save our strength.

782
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,900
Think about our honor.

783
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,590
Is there any useless training?

784
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,730
Do you practice for nothing?

785
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,370
You're behaving worse.

786
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,580
Hurry and gather around.

787
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,230
There's something wrong with your minds.

788
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,700
Are we training for the leaders?

789
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,510
You have no discipline.

790
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,440
Why did you get angry faster than turning a book?

791
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,530
Pull down your pants.

792
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,750
Listen to Instructor Yang.

793
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,880
Learn to improve yourselves.

794
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,440
You have no discipline.

795
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,370
You...

796
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,780
Class 1, assemble.

797
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,850
Today we will have an open training assessment.

798
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,750
All of you will carry out hot smoke rescue

799
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,890
in simulated real-fire training.

800
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:17,980
Of course,

801
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,710
you have to complete the task within the specified time

802
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,310
to pass the assessment.

803
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,910
I hope everyone can get a good result.

804
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,850
Yijiu, Shiquan.

805
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,350
Here.

806
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,240
You two in the first group.

807
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,460
The assessment starts now.

808
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,090
Yes.

809
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,020
Yijiu, Shiquan, go for it!

810
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,570
Think about your regular training.

811
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,420
If you two don't perform well today,

812
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,850
I'll confiscate your snacks tonight.

813
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,980
Practice more in the gym.

814
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,950
Yijiu, Shiquan.

815
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:40,790
Come on.

816
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,850
Honor. Think about the honor.

817
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,860
Are you ready?

818
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,910
Yes, sir. I'm ready.

819
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,460
Set the timer.

820
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,010
The assessment begins.

821
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,020
Yes.

822
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,000
Good luck.

823
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:52,930
Work hard.

824
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,590
Rescue now, Yijiu.

825
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,310
To the right.

826
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,110
Move forward.

827
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,300
It's safe ahead.

828
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,190
Let's go. Move forward.

829
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:03,910
Go.

830
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,080
Go.

831
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,430
Go.

832
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,230
Come on.

833
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,490
Hurry up.

834
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,580
Hurry up.

835
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:11,840
Okay.

836
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:17,770
Let's go.

837
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,160
How do you feel?

838
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,090
You must be tired.

839
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,430
Come on. Take it off.

840
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,310
Take it off.

841
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,910
Not bad.

842
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,970
Not enough practice?

843
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,730
I didn't expect

844
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,540
the dummy was so heavy.

845
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,260
And when I went in,

846
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,900
I felt my mouth was covered.

847
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,370
I can't breathe.

848
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,000
All right.

849
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,670
It's not enough.

850
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,350
We didn't plan the time properly.

851
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,410
We'll do extra training after getting back, Director.

852
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,790
You two can do it yourselves.

853
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,970
Don't wait for me.

854
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:54,940
We're off today.

855
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,900
Get me a set of this equipment.

856
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,320
Okay.

857
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,370
Let's eat more tonight when getting back.

858
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,590
Get me a set of uniform.

859
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,560
I'll try it on too.

860
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,900
What are you doing?

861
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,660
Who asked you to take it?

862
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,870
Director Lin.

863
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,010
I asked him to take it.

864
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,770
What are you doing?

865
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,740
For the assessment.

866
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,200
No.

867
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,710
Why?

868
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:09,760
Only professional firefighters

869
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,860
can attend the assessment.

870
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,040
You can't.

871
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,470
The situation inside

872
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,480
simulates the real fire.

873
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,950
It's a sealed space,

874
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:18,880
with high temperature,

875
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:19,760
and real fire.

876
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:20,770
Lots of difficulties such as lack of oxygen,

877
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,660
and low-level visibility.

878
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,260
We need to learn

879
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,480
and train for a long time

880
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,860
before going in.

881
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,540
You'll be in danger if you go in like this.

882
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,470
Director Lin,

883
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,260
I'm not afraid of difficulties.

884
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,440
There will be challenges when there are difficulties.

885
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,500
Please let me participate in the training assessment.

886
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,180
Director,

887
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,100
I want to try as well.

888
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,490
Yiyi wants to join too.

889
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,370
Director, I want to join too.

890
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,680
Director, I want to join too.

891
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,360
Did I not make

892
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,460
myself clear?

893
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,970
Very clear.

894
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,070
You can't. Do you understand?

895
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,830
We can do it.

896
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,420
You explain.

897
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,000
What do you mean?

898
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,890
Look at them.

899
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,780
They get up at 5 a.m.,

900
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,040
and training starts at 6 a.m.

901
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,470
Physical training.

902
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,860
Drill training and night training.

903
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,840
We have to stand by 365 days a year.

904
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:07,720
That's it.

905
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,850
It's exhausting.

906
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,570
See?

907
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,250
Your stamina can't keep up.

908
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,340
How can you do it?

909
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,890
That's why I want to use this assessment

910
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,030
to show you

911
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,370
our real physical capability.

912
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,670
We can do

913
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:18,890
what firefighters can do.

914
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,450
Didn't I make myself clear enough?

915
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,210
You'll be in danger if you go in.

916
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,110
Enough.

917
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,380
Fine.

918
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,770
Since everyone is so proactive,

919
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,500
I won't discourage you.

920
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,400
Before the training,

921
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,160
let's do a test, OK?

922
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,790
No problem.

923
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:38,670
What about you?

924
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,890
No problem.

925
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,690
Okay.

926
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,950
You're all okay.

927
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,590
How about this?

928
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:46,910
200 push-ups.

929
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,380
3km long-distance running.

930
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,430
In 20 minutes,

931
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,390
Whoever finishes it first

932
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,030
can come and discuss it with me.

933
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,370
Let's begin.

934
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,330
Come on.

935
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:54,930
Come on.

936
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,240
200 push-ups. 3km long-distance running.

937
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,590
This is our basic training.

938
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,030
Do girls also do push-ups?

939
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:02,780
Yes.

940
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,760
You can't go in if you can't finish it.

941
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,350
Keep an eye on each one of them.

942
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,550
The program about your station is

943
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,280
the highlight of the Brigade's publicity.

944
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,750
I was a bit worried,

945
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:15,970
so I came to have a look.

946
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,320
What do you think?

947
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,370
Are you relieved?

948
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,230
Is there any real fire simulation training

949
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,380
in the program proposal?

950
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:26,930
Captain Meng,

951
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,240
Here's the thing.

952
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,760
I've discussed it

953
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,230
with the Deputy Directors.

954
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,880
We think it's too dangerous

955
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,300
to let the guests in the training building.

956
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,650
There are safety risks.

957
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,530
I don't think these guests

958
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,910
are too dramatic.

959
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:46,880
Yes.

960
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,810
They really want to improve themselves.

961
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,760
Look at the training building.

962
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,030
It's quite dangerous for outsiders.

963
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,210
But it's all controlled manually.

964
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,430
The security system is very reliable.

965
00:40:59,270 --> 00:40:59,940
Captain Meng,

966
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,090
you can't

967
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,180
joke about this.

968
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,190
I'm not joking.

969
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,700
I'm telling the truth.

970
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,260
What's the biggest obstacle

971
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,640
in our rescue mission?

972
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,900
Is it the fire?

973
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,540
No.

974
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,900
It's people's fear of fire.

975
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,590
People don't understand our job.

976
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,320
Many times, when people encounter a fire,

977
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,870
they panic.

978
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,230
They don't have

979
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,780
the right reaction in the first place.

980
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,260
So we should try our best

981
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,020
to show people

982
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,160
how our firefighters

983
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,460
handle the situation

984
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,550
when encountering fire.

985
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,190
In addition to educating the public,

986
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,670
it's also a way

987
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,880
to help them overcome

988
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:40,890
their psychological fear.

989
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,460
Yes.

990
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,310
But they...

991
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:46,980
Enough.

992
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,000
I know what you're worried about.

993
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,260
Look.

994
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,560
Back then, you,

995
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,000
Zhengang, Liu and Dagang

996
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,590
all started

997
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,900
from scratch, not knowing anything.

998
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,750
Yes.

999
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,180
This is training.

1000
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:02,820
If training

1001
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,370
is not dangerous,

1002
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,010
Then when you are really in danger,

1003
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,990
you don't know what safety is.

1004
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,550
I understand.

1005
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,230
Captain Meng, how about this?

1006
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,170
They'll be divided into two groups.

1007
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,900
A professional firefighter

1008
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,820
will accompany every group all the way.

1009
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,180
But if anything goes wrong,

1010
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,230
I will end the training.

1011
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:26,880
OK.

1012
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:28,390
Back to work.

1013
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,110
Yes.

1032

Evacuate the corridors and fire engine lanes.

Do not install any obstacles that obstruct

fire engines and fire fighting.
