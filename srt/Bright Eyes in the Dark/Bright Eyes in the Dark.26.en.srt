to when Miaomiao was born,

94
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,690
and when I passed my exams and joined the fire station.

95
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,570
It has been so many years.

96
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,650
I think

97
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,140
the longer I live this life,

98
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,640

00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,770
do I feel like I have a sense of presence

112

and some kind of value.

113
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,450
If I leave our fire station,

114
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,810
I don’t know what would happen to me.

00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,980
Actually, Milan

116
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,640
is already very understanding and compromising.

117
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,640
Maybe she's right.

118
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,480
I'm just a really selfish person.

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,640
No, no.

120
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,010
She was just angry.

121
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,210
Don't take her words to heart.

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,330

All these years,

124
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,000
she has been busy taking care of the family.

125
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,890
Few people in this world

126
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,810
are as considerate as her.

127
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,430

very helpless.

137
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,880
The more I want to change,

138
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,010
the more I can't change.

139
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,380
The more I seek balance,

140
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,320
the harder it is to find it.

141
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,090
The more I feel guilty,

142
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,660
the more I feel conflicted,

143
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,460
and the more I suffer,

144
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,130
the harder it is for me to reconcile with myself.

145
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,560

180
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,170
One taught me the perils of love.

181
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,920
The other taught me that

182
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,080
you need courage to love someone.

I'm afraid of death.

Of course not.

00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,730
with us than with his family.

00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,700

Can we ignore it?

You treat this place as a unit,

353
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,880
but we treat it as our home.

354
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,120
Since we've chosen the firefighting career,

355
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,720
sacrifice is inevitable.

356
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,400
It's normal.

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,500

00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,250
What's wrong with that?

359
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,280
And I think it's worth it.

360
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,720
It's necessary.

361
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,490
How should I put it?

362
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,360
I used to

363
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,530
have the same thought.

364
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,160
Indeed.

365
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,120
But after I became an instructor,

366
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,000
I changed my mind.

367
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,700
You can't hold everyone

368
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,850
up to your own standards.

369
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,770
Fire rescue is an ambition

370
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,850
for you and me.

00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,410
But to many people,

372
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,250
it's just a job.

373
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,180
Maybe some people joined

375
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,530

00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,080
they rush into the fire just like us.

379
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,730
What's wrong with that?

380
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,480
Do you think they're wrong?

381
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,800
Right?

382
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:34,980

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,090
In the next two days,

387
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,880
I plan to hold a Family Open House Day at the station

388
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,570
to bring the family members of our station mates here

389
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,120
and gather together.

390
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,730
I refuse.

391
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,050
I don't have time.

392
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,320
It's never a waste of time to prepare.

393
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't agree.

394
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,800
The firefighting competition hasn't been settled yet.

395
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,420
There are so many problems at the station.

396
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,410
I don't have time for your open house day.

397
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,360
Fine.

398
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,080
You can keep your opinion.

training really hard lately.

415
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,890

Be quiet.

444

I don't agree with this proposal.

445
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,420
So, Instructor Lin, you don't have to win brownie points for me.

446
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,160
Since everyone is so happy,

447
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,390
I'll tell you my condition.

will be responsible for it.

Don't ask me about anything

456
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,960
related to the open house day.

457
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,640
Ask Instructor Lin.

458
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,830
I'm done.

459
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,050
Go back and make your preparations.

460
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,820
As for the specific date,

No.

519
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,770
What should we do now?

520
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,770
Take the medicine.

do you want to try

580
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,250
He's a judge at the International Film Festival.

581
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,430
He is out of our league.

582
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,060
Yes.

Did Zong drink

783
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,090

784
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,410
He didn't exactly plead.
