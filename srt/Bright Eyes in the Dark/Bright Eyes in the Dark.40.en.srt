00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,680
Okay.

183
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,560
When you make it out of that forest,

184
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,600
you'll get to the firebreak we dug.

185
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,320
Lin Luxiao.

186
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,730
Lin Luxiao.

187
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,160
Lin Luxiao.

188
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,200
Nan Chu.

189
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,090
Nan Chu, can you hear me?

190
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,080
Lin Luxiao.

191
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,090
What's wrong?

192
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,960
Lin Luxiao.

193
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,570
Nan Chu.

194
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,680
Let's go.

195
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,810
The walkie-talkie is out of service.

196
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,320
Keep walking.

197
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,050
Let's go.

198
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,340
Lin!

199
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,210
Hurry up!

200
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,090
Let's go!

201
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,400
Hurry! Don't look back! Hurry!

202
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,170
Hurry!

203
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,160
Let's go.

204
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,310
Nan Chu.

205
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,690
The fire is coming our way.

206
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,210
Are we in the right direction?

207
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,460
I'm sure we are.

208
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,160
Let's go!

209
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,450
Hurry up!

210
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,410
Hurry!

211
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,440
Get up.

212
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,740
Let's go.

213
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,410
Hurry!

214
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,050
Xi Gu!

215
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,800
Zong!

216
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,700
Get up.

217
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,570
I can't hold on any longer.

218
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,220
Take Xi Gu with you and leave.

219
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,100
That won't do.

220
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,940
Don't lie here.

221
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,920
Get up.

222
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,170
Xi Gu.

223
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,300
Zong.

224
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:58,820
Get up.

225
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,300
Nan Chu.

226
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,170
You go first.

227
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Find someone to save us.

228
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,300
No.

229
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,620
We must get out together.

230
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,680
Zong, get up.

231
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,160
I really can't hold on any longer.

232
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,200
It's not much further.

233
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,090
Hang in there.

234
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,300
We're almost there.

235
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:10,810
Get up.

236
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:11,930
Xi Gu!

237
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,840
Are you okay?

238
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,810
I'm okay.

239
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,920
Save them.

240
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,520
Get up.

241
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,810
Save them.

242
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,400
It's okay.

243
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,930
Get down!

244
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,340
Save them.

245
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,160
Go save them.

246
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,960
Dad!

247
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,410
Dad!

248
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,680
Dad!

249
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,680
Dad!

250
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,080
Dad!

251
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,660
Is there any working chain saw left?

252
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,840
Mine is broken too.

253
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,610
Director.

254
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,380
The fire is too strong.

255
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,570
The firebreak can't hold on at all.

256
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,080
Never give up

257
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,800
until the last moment.

258
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,330
Yes.

259
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,220
Zong, get up.

260
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,330
We must get out of here.

261
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,570
Zong.

262
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,840
Captain, the fire is blocking our way.

263
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,160
Set up the fire shelter. Make sure the villagers are safe.

264
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,800
How's it going with the firebreak?

265
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,940
Not optimistic.

266
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,040
We're short-handed.

267
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,880
Thank you all.

268
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,560
Thank you.

269
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,370
We'll make arrangements.

270
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,810
Report, Captain Meng.

271
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,840
These are volunteers from all over the country.

272
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,040
Thank you all.

273
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,720
Thank you.

274
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,460
It's great news.

275
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,320
All right. Listen.

276
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,560
Those with maintenance knowledge,

277
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,240
assemble over there later.

278
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,810
Those who work in transportation,

279
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,360
transport the equipment

280
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,330
up the mountain.

281
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,810
Those who have equipment with them,

282
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,840
go up the mountain and support the firefighters.

283
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,850
I hope we

284
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,570
can hold on to

285
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,760
the last line of defense together.

286
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,840
Yes!

287
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,620
Thank you!

288
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,410
Be careful.

289
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,240
Be careful.

290
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,170
Watch out. Be careful.

291
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,630
Come on. Drive forward.

292
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,730
Make way.

293
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,170
Is anyone here?

294
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,530
We're here to save you!

295
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,520
Answer us!

296
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,370
Is anyone there?

297
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,770
-Over here!
-Here!

298
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,460
We're volunteers from the horse ranch.

299
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,720
Is there anyone else trapped here?

300
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,130
We didn't see anyone on our way here.

301
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,200
Come on. Get on the horse.

302
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,080
We'll get you out of here.

303
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,050
Zong.

304
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,640
Come on.

305
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,480
Get on the horse.

306
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:36,980
Where?

307
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,380
They're

308
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:37,960
in front.

309
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,730
Captain Zhao.

310
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,120
Captain Zhao.

311
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,330
Captain Meng.

312
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,610
Hello.

313
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,650
Hello, Meng Guohong.

314
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,850
How's it going with your team?

315
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,800
We're okay.

316
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,280
Captain Meng.

317
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,850
Have you seen Lin Luxiao?

318
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,730
Isn't he with you?

319
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,120
He went to save people again.

320
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,570
Hya!

321
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,800
Doctor! Doctor!

322
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,760
Doctor!

323
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,020
Where are the doctors?

324
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,480
Hurry!

325
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,120
Doctor, her legs are injured.

326
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,700
Take care of Xi Gu.

327
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,280
Don't worry.

328
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,560
Captain Meng.

329
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,090
Why are you here?

330
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,570
I was shooting a film in Lushan.

331
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,140
Report, Captain Meng.

332
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,840
Another few trapped people are found in Pingtou Mountain.

333
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,620
Don't worry.

334
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,480
Leave it to us.

335
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,490
Thank you.

336
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:25,880
Hya!

337
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:26,920
Let's go.

338
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,090
Captain Meng, where is Lin Luxiao?

339
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,280
He's still fighting in the front line.

340
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,080
Captain Meng.

341
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,000
I'll go support Lin Luxiao.

342
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,010
Go.

343
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,610
Yes.

344
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,200
Guys.

345
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,800
Get to work.

346
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,730
Is he okay?

347
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,810
Nan Chu.

348
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,240
You should evacuate immediately to a safe place.

349
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,560
I want to stay here as a volunteer.

350
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,400
I'll wait for Lin Luxiao.

351
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,560
Which is...

352
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,040
Which of you is Director Lou?

353
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,280
I am.

354
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,040
Director Lou.

355
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,720
I'm Zhao Guo from Lushan Squadron.

356
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,940
Have you seen Lin Luxiao,

357
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,000
Yijiu, and Shiquan?

358
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,880
No.

359
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,010
What happened to them?

360
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,330
It's bad.

361
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,570
We've lost contact with them.

362
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,890
Didn't they take walkie-talkies with them?

363
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,700
I called them,

364
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,860
but there was no reply.

365
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,100
I've searched everywhere,

366
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,980
but I couldn't find them.

367
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,000
Wait, slow down.

368
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,460
What exactly happened to Lin Luxiao?

369
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,060
We lost contact with him.

370
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,890
Contact lost.

371
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,010
Lin Luxiao cares about safety the most.

372
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,240
He'll be fine.

373
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,240
What should we do?

374
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,330
What should we do?

375
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,090
