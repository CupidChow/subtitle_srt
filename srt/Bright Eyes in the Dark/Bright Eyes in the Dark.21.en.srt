00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,510
applied for a load of new equipment,

193
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,890
and required them

194
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,320
to focus on high-angle rescue.

195

196
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,570
Many people think I'm unrealistic.

197

But let me tell you.

198
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,810
This is just my first step.

199
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,880
My goal

200
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,540
is to build a cutting-edge

201

202
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,790
high-tech equipment.

203
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,020
And I'm sure

204
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,700
that is the future of firefighting.

Acting

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,440
It's so kind of him.

384
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,700
Thank him for me.

385
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,630
Take a rest.

386
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,640
It's okay.

387
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,460
Careful.

388
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,860
It's tiring.

389
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,970
Captain Meng has told me.

390
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,410
He's arranged rehab for me.

391
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,840
It'll start next week.

392
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,930
And

393
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,150
Li Lei will come to help me.

394
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,910
You don't have to come here every day.

395
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,880
You can't keep bringing your girlfriend

396
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,550
to my ward for dates.

397
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,500
It's weird.

398
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,140
And I feel bad about it.

399
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,150
Besides,

400
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,670
the girl won't be happy about it.

401
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,060
Instructor Yang.

402
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,550
I've found videos in which dancers shared their experiences about rehab.

403
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,460
See if they can help you.

404
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,180
Okay. Thank you.

405
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,480
It's Yanzi.

406
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,110
I need to answer it.

407
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,640
Okay.

408
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,710
Stop looking.

409
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,850
Your eyes are glued to her.

410
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,450
Why don't you follow her out?

411
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,150
I'm just wondering if something has happened in her dance club.

412
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,830
Don't give me that.

413
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,720
Stop pretending.

414
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,130
I know you so well.

415
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:02,630
Don't I?

416
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,130
The way you looked at her…

417
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,850
Enough.

418
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,900
Stop talking about me.

419
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,380
How are things going

420
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,890
between you and Li Lei?

421
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,490
Just the same.

422
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,460
I should focus on the rehab now.

423
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,630
Keep practicing.

424
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,740
I'll take you out

425
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,920
during my vacation.

426
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:20,970
Sure.

427
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,860
Instructor Yang would prefer to go out with someone else.

428
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,420
I know.

429
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,540
We'll bring Li Lei

430
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,320
with us.

431
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,040
Okay.

432
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,940
I can use a trip.

433
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,320
Alright.

434
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,420
Leave now.

435
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,630
Keep practicing.

436
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,640
I'll watch you.

437
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,020
There's nothing to watch.

438
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,630
You…

439
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,770
Go on practicing.

440
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,600
Okay.

441
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,530
Take a seat, Nan Chu.

442
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,460
I got it. Take a seat.

443
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,230
I can do it myself.

444
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,890
Hello, Xi Gu.

445
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,050
Nan Chu.

446
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,010
Sorry.

447
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,530
Zong wants to meet me.

448
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,980
I'm afraid I can't make it tonight.

449
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,870
Okay. I'll find someone else.

450
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:09,980
What's wrong?

451
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,140
The acting teacher

452
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,940
asked us

453
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,560
to bring an audience over tonight.

454
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,150
I invited Xi Gu

455
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,210
but she can't make it tonight.

456
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,140
That's great.

457
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,660
I'll go.

458
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,820
No.

459
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,250
I'm so bad at acting.

460
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,090
I don't want to make a fool of myself in front of you.

461
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,250
You're still learning,

462
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,470
so don't be afraid of making mistakes.

463
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,150
Have some confidence in yourself.

464
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,340
The teacher said that too.

465
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,870
When is it?

466
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,030
Are you really going?

467
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,100
I need to be there for you.

468
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,770
Good evening, Mr. Jin.

469
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,020
Trainees

470
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,510
and the audience,

471
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,220
good evening.

472
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,810
Before we start today's acting session,

473
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,920
let me elaborate on it.

474
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,140
During this session,

475
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,240
the trainees

476
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,460
will act

477
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,750
with the person

478
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,950
they brought here

479
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,100
in a certain scenario.

480
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,490
I'll offer you a random scene

481
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,430
and you can improvise.

482
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,660
The goal

483
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,610
is to help the trainees

484
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,400
overcome embarrassment

485
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,450
and mental barriers

486
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,650
by acting with someone they're familiar with.

487
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,890
It's a very important part

488
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,690
of studying acting.

489
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,210
Liberate your nature.

490
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,110
On behalf of all the trainees,

491
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,090
I'd like to thank everyone

492
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,660
who's been invited here.

493
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,060
I believe

494
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,350
you're the people they trust the most.

495
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,700
I'll give you ten minutes.

496
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,380
We'll begin after you're ready.

497
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,160
Go make preparations.

498
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,250
Does that mean

499
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,210
I have to get on stage too?

500
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,030
Yes.

501
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,020
You have to act with me.

502
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,090
I can't act.

503
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,790
You don't need to lead it.

504
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,390
Just reply to me

505
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,370
when I say something to you.

506
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,890
There are so many people here.

507
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,900
I…

508
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,090
Well,

509
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,640
I'm afraid if I go on stage,

510
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,720
I'll affect your performance.

511
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,730
You won't.

512
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,450
Just stand there

513
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,070
and think of yourself as a log or a tree.

514
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,090
A log?

515
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,310
Or a hydrant.

516
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,180
Please?

517
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,870
Okay. A hydrant.

518
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,230
Don't be nervous.

519
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,340
You're blushing.

520
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,310
The first group.

521
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,440
Nan Chu and her partner.

522
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,110
What's your relationship with him?

523
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,420
He's my boyfriend.

524
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,440
What does your boyfriend do?

525
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,700
I'm a firefighter.

526
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,120
Okay.

527
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,160
The scene you need to play

528
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,360
is that he once saved you

529
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,250
and now you meet him again.

530
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,400
Okay. Start.

531
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,920
Mr. Jin.

532
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,500
Is there a limit to the form of performance?

533
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,020
No.

534
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,180
Just show the right emotions.

535
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,580
Can I play some music?

536
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,710
Sure.

00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,310
and costumes during this time.

752
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,660
Yang did the math.

753
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,380
It's about five million yuan.

754
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,640
Bring the money to me first.

755
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,450
Then we'll move to the next step.

756
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,390
Hello.

757
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,350
Hey.

758
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,330
What are you doing?

759
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,840
What's up?

760
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,050
You miss me?

761
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,330
Drink with me.

762
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,650
Enough.

763
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,370
Don't be so upset.

764
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,390
I think it's a good thing.

765
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,450
You finally stood up for yourself.

766
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,920
You're a free man now.

767
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,210
Don't mention it.

768
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,150
I regret it so much.

769
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,030
Do you want to be a pop star

770
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,180
or play gigs?

771
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,740
You want neither of them

772
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,630
and don't like your company's plan for you.

773
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,710
You have to terminate the contract eventually.

774
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,830
So it's better sooner than later.

775
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,430
I regret listening to you,

776
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,940
of all people.

777
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,580
I was too impulsive.

778
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,610
I have to school you on this one.

779
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,630
What's wrong with being impulsive?

780
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,010
Isn't that what being young

781
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,780
is all about?

782
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:13,740
It's no big deal.

783
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,980
Do you rich kids

784
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,450
always talk like this?

785
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,300
Do you think everyone can do

786
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,060
whatever they please like you?

787
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,680
Now they want to sue me for breaking the contract

788
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,650
and make me pay for their losses.

789
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,640
What should I do?

790
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,490
I don't mean to judge,

791
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,350
but it seems like they offered you a pie and you dug in

792
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,270
without checking if it was cooked or not,

793
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,470
or if it was even edible.

794
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,750
Then they set a trap in the contract

795
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,040
and you walked right into it.

796
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,870
Didn't you read the fine print back then?

797
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,190
Shut up.

798
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,450
At worst,

799
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,470
I'll learn to dance.

800
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,770
Learn dancing?

801
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,450
That's too much.

802
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,490
Where are you going?

803
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,220
I got you.

804
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:53,870
Stop worrying about it.

805
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,650
I'll help you out.

806
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,230
You haven't paid for the drinks.

807
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,090
You pay.

808
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,090
Mr. Jiang, wait.

809
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,180
I'll inform Mr. Ma of your coming.

810
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,010
Mr. Jiang.

811
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,530
Mr. Jiang.

812
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,580
What brings you here?

813
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,980
Mr. Ma.

814
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,350
Have a seat, Mr. Ma.

815
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,100
-Be my guest.
-Sit.

816
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:19,640
Have a seat.

817
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,780
There's something

818
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,210
I need to talk to you about.

819
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,860
[Beixun City Fire and Rescue Brigade]

820
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,840
Luxiao.

821
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,930
Captain Meng.

822
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,750
Nothing serious.

823
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,630
I just want to know

824
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,620
if Zhengang's rehab has been approved?

825
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,970
It just got approved.

826
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,650
You're going with him.

827
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,900
Escort him, look after him, and cheer him up.

828
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,470
Spare no effort.

829
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,090
Okay. Rest assured.

830
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,010
I'll do my best.

831
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:48,620
Captain Meng.

832
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,650
I heard Lou Mingye

833
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,260
is pushing for innovation and reformation at the station.

834
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,180
Yes.

835
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,450
He's proposed a lot of constructive suggestions

836
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,970
and just did a simulation training.

837
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,140
What's wrong?

838
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,050
Are you worried?

839
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,520
No. I'm just asking.

840
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,720
You have his number, don't you?

841
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,570
You can call him.

842
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,230
Who am I to call him?

843
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,100
He has his plans.

844
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,820
He doesn't want me

845
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,120
to tell him what to do.

846
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,730
If you're willing,

847
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,760
I can relay your message to him.

848
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,300
Okay.

849
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,040
That's great.

850
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,940
Thank you, Captain Meng.

851
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,790
Listen.

852
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,320
I hope both of you

853
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,200
can look at the big picture.

854
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,700
You're both devoted to firefighting

855
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,600
and should communicate more with each other.

856
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,000
Understand?

857
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,170
Yes.

858
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,520
Don't worry, Captain Meng.

859
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:40,660
Okay.

860
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,830
Captain Meng.

861
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,520
What brings you here?

862
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,300
Speak of the devil.

863
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,020
What do you mean?

864
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,150
Nothing.

865
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:03,710
Don't bother.

866
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,930
What's up?

867
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,730
Why have so many of my requests

868
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,010
for equipment been denied?

869
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,150
Good equipment is in high demand.

870
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,040
There's the budget to consider.

871
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,540
How many requests have you made

872
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,860
since you became the director?

873
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,250
The last one alone

874
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,220
already exceeded our brigade's annual budget.

875
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,170
But good equipment is essential.

876
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,520
To do a job well, one must have the right tools.

877
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,760
If we want to save lives in emergencies

878
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,250
and reduce firefighter casualties,

879
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,100
we can't cut corners on hardware expenses.

880
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,790
How about this?

881
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,680
After you go back,

882
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,660
list the equipment that is in the most urgent need.

883
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,530
I'll bring it up again

884
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,600
at the brigade meeting.

885
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:42,560
Does that work for you?

886
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,180
Yeah.

887
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,780
Thank you, Captain Meng.

888
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,000
Also,

889
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,620
the National Firefighting Competition is about to kick off.

890
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,030
It's getting a lot of attention from higher-ups.

891
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,360
They've already selected a few teams as candidates.

892
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,590
The provincial authorities will send people

893
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,460
to determine which team

894
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,820
will represent Beixun.

895
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:04,660
Okay.

896
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,630
I'll step up the training after going back.

897
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,810
I'm leaving, Captain Meng.

898
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,350
Starting today,

899
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,200
in addition to emergency responses,

900
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,630
we'll do more training every day.

901
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,360
You guys are either unit leaders or deputy unit leaders,

902
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,790
which means a heavy workload.

903
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:22,930
Do you have any objections?

904
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,550
The National Firefighting Competition for this year

905
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,700
is just around the corner.

906
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,930
Things are different this year.

907
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,620
It's going to be a brand-new multi-skill competition.

908
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,970
I trust you

909
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,660
to excel in the traditional skills.

910
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,690
But my expectations for you

911
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,720
go beyond that.

912
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,790
Heping Road Special Division Station

913
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,350
needs to showcase

914
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,880
our latest training achievements

915
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,370
in terms of the usage of new technology and equipment.

916
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,650
It's not a request,

917
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,670
but a must.

918
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,650
The training for this competition

919
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,240
will focus on Combat Unit 1

920
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,500
and Combat Unit 2.

921
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,040
I'll come up with a specific plan.

922
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,400
During this period,

923
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,970
your performances will be part of the evaluation.

924
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,660
I'm hoping for your full cooperation.

925
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,580
No problem.

926
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,220
We'll cooperate.

927
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,830
Do you have anything to say, Assistant Liu?

928
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,440
No.

929
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,660
You can speak your mind.

930
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:33,900
No.

931
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,380
This is good.

932
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,820
Do you think we drivers can participate in it?

933
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,710
You've never participated in it either?

934
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,180
No.

935
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,530
It wasn't held the year I came here.

936
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,020
You two are lucky.

937
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,840
It's held soon after you came.

938
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,650
The drivers can participate.

939
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,630
But let me remind you.

940
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,770
This competition

941
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,620
is not a walk-in-the-park kind of event.

942
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,710
If you decide to participate in it,

943
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,780
you've got to go all out

944
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,800
and must not be dead weight.

945
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,250
Got it.

946
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,510
Don't worry, Deputy Director Yu.

947
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,060
Jiu and I won't hold the team back.

948
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,630
Yeah.

949
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,000
Don't take what Lou Mingye said

950
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,490
too seriously.

951
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:22,850
It's just a small competition.

952
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,470
Don't stress yourself out.

953
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,650
I'm not stressed out.

954
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,170
We've already got enough training tasks.

955
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,320
I'm afraid I can't handle more.

956
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,950
Qi Huo.

957
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,210
Unit Leader Fang wants to meet you in the garage.

958
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,510
Okay.

959
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,810
[Old Man]

960
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,220
What?

961
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,350
What…

962
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,480
What's taking him so long?

963
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,710
Yu.

964
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,510
Did you see Qi...

965
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,290
Qi Huo?

966
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,800
He's out there.

967
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,200
Okay.

968
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,340
Your mom is on a mission.

969
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,110
I'm going on a trip soon.

970
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,080
Your grandpa arrived today.

971
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,570
Come home

972
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,640
when you're off duty

973
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:34,840
to spend some time

974
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,640
with him.

975
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,330
Do you hear me?

976
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,220
Yeah.

977
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,710
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

978
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,490
Hang on.

979
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,500
I heard

980
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,400
that Director Lou

981
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,210
has rolled out this competition thing

982
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,240
which has high standards.

983
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:47,970
Step up your game.

984
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,330
Why are you so sure that I can't rise to the occasion?

985
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,620
It's an opportunity for me.

986
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,130
I'll give it my all.

987
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,650
Just stay down to earth,

988
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,200
whether it's an opportunity or not.

989
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,380
Enough.

990
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,130
Captain Meng.

991
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,390
We're not in your office.

992
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,010
Can you stop giving me orders?

993
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,710
Go about your business.

994
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,790
I'll go back to see Grandpa in a few days.

995
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,610
Alright.

996
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,510
Keep it in mind.

997
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,230
Don't worry, Dad.

998
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,050
I'm hanging up.

999
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,050
D…

1000
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:15,640

[Li Fei as Jin Kexi]

1005
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,700
I'd like to talk about safety awareness today.

1006
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,410
When you're in a crowded place like a theater,

1007
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,200
you should pay attention to safety exits

1008
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,560
and evacuation signs.

1009
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,620
When there's a fire,

1010
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,120
stay calm

1011
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,810
and head for the exit following those signs

1012
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,720
in an orderly manner.

1013
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,540
If you're in a crowd,

1014
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,240
find a safe way out immediately

1015
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,310
and hold onto something sturdy

1016
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,220
to stay on your feet.

1017
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,920
Don't go against the flow,

1018
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,170
or you may trip up.

1019
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:57,540
If something unusual happens, don't stand around watching.

1020
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,540
Call the police immediately

1021
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,060
and stay away from the scene

1022
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,770
to avoid further harm.
