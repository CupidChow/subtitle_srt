00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,350
Do you know

194
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,870
how hard it is for us to take all your blame?

195
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,550
Who can we turn to...

196
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,760
Don't touch my wife!

197
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,240
Enough!

198
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,410
Fine.

199
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,230
Now that my daughter's gone,

200
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,780
you started

201
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,550
to pretend that you care, right?

202
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,860
We put so much effort

203
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,800
into raising our child.

204
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,900
Where were you during that time?

205
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,740
Did you provide her with any money

206
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,420
or any food?

207
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,060
How could you say that about us?

208
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,330
We're also very sad...

209
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,760
How could you be sad?

210
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,230
It was all because of you.

211
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,210
Go back!

212
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:09,970
Come back!

213
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,850
Go! Go!

214
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,980
Don't go!

215
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,000
Go! Go!

216
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,220
What's there to look at?

217
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,640
Don't cause me any more trouble!

218
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,700
Have a seat first.

219
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,160
Come on.

220
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,380
Have a seat.

221
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,050
Are you okay?

222
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,400
Are you okay, Madam?

223
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,550
Calm down.

224
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,680
Please calm down.

225
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,650
Sir.

226
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,160
Let's sit down and have a talk calmly.

227
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,380
I promise

228
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,770
we will handle this case

229
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,940
seriously.

230
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,780
We'll treat it seriously.

231
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,410
Okay?

232
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,760
Tell us if you have any needs

233
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,520
or requests.

234
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,790
We will try our best to do it.

235
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,670
You must do it!

236
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,130
Yes.

237
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,970
We request that

238
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,760
you make a public apology

239
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,950
and restore my daughter's reputation.

240
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,580
Sun Meng's parents.

241
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:07,800
Hello.

242
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,950
I'm Lin Luxiao,

243
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,420
Director of Heping Road Special Division Station.

244
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:14,900
Previously,

245
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,670
two firefighters from our station

246
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,770
posted some inappropriate opinions

247
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,570
and comments

248
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,670
on your daughter

249
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,400
on a short-video platform

250
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,580
on the internet,

251
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,050
which caused

252
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,160
a certain degree of harm

253
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,430
and problems

254
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,920
to you and your family.

255
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,880
I hereby

256
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,820
extend our sincerest apologies

257
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,510
to you and your family

258
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,190
on behalf of Heping Road Special Division Station.

259
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,500
I'm sorry.

260
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,280
Sir. Madam.

261
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,170
My condolences.

262
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,560
I'm sorry.

263
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,240
Why are you mad?

264
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,160
[Fire Safety Is Everyone's Obligation]
Why are you mad?

265
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,540
[Fire Safety Is Everyone's Obligation]

266
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,800
This is their family issue after all.
[Fire Safety Is Everyone's Obligation]

267
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,430
[Fire Safety Is Everyone's Obligation]

268
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,650
Aren't you adding fuel to the fire
[Fire Safety Is Everyone's Obligation]

269
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:13,950
[Fire Safety Is Everyone's Obligation]

270
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,420
and causing more trouble to Director Lin?
[Fire Safety Is Everyone's Obligation]

271
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,050
[Fire Safety Is Everyone's Obligation]

272
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,420
Exactly.
[Fire Safety Is Everyone's Obligation]

273
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:16,930
Exactly.

274
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,280
I know you want to be filmed more, but the timing wasn't right.

275
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,250
It was too obvious.

276
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,670
Do you think we are blind?

277
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,770
You're still thinking about getting more footage?

278
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,290
Are you even human?

279
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,010
Who do you think you're talking to?

280
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,520
You just want to show off your sympathy,

281
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,490
to make others look small.

282
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,910
Then why are you feeling guilty?

283
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,130
I didn't see you on the mission,

284
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,310
and now you have so much to say.

285
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,320
[Ignite the spirit of youth and keep motivated.]

286
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,410
At least I didn't cause any trouble.
[Ignite the spirit of youth and keep motivated.]

287
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:35,530
[Ignite the spirit of youth and keep motivated.]

288
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,370
Unlike someone,
[Ignite the spirit of youth and keep motivated.]

289
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:36,420
Unlike someone,

290
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,550
who had to validate her existence everywhere.

291
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,600
You two are so boring.

292
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,940
Sis.

293
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,000
She started it.

294
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,070
Nan Chu.

295
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,670
Don't be angry.

296
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,800
I'm not angry.

297
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,290
It's just I understand Sun Meng.

298
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,900
The more I understand her,

299
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,060
the more I know how sad she was.

300
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,780
In fact, they don't understand at all.

301
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,060
Since Sun Meng made that decision,

302
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,880
she wouldn't care what others say anymore.

303
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,280
Actually,

304
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,760
I can feel that.

305
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,690
Nan Chu.

306
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,410
We've known each other for so long.

307
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,640
Although you never said anything,

308
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,320
I know

309
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,800
you must have experienced something like that.

310
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,540
Why didn't you report

311
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,800
such a huge matter?

312
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,180
Why!

313
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,920
Is this how you treat your jobs as director and instructor?

314
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,520
Captain Meng.

315
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,530
It's because we just finished

316
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,720
dealing with this matter.

317
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,400
We didn't have time to report to you.

318
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,910
What do you mean you didn't have time?

319
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,210
How long could it take to make a call?

320
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,140
Why are you...

321
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,380
We don't want to bother you,

322
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
so we decided to deal with it within the station first.

323
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,780
And what's the result?

324
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,370
Where are the two newbies?

325
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,190
You defend them like this.

326
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,700
This is serious!

327
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:58,920
Captain Meng.

328
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,890
Let me report to you.

329
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,280
These two newbies

330
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,040
have been trained by me.

331
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,930
I should take the main responsibility

332
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,910
for the trouble they caused.

333
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,300
I have criticized them seriously.

334
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,060
When we go back,

335
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,150
I'll reflect on myself as well.

336
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,160
I won't condone

337
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,700
their misbehavior.

338
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,880
Don't make empty promises.

339
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,410
Captain Meng.

340
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,300
I don't mean to defend them.

341
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,070
As for this matter,

342
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,290
it's indeed inappropriate for them to record that video.

343
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,890
I've criticized them.

344
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,070
But

345
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,490
no matter how you put it,

346
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,880
this isn't a significant mistake, right?

347
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,320
Besides, Sun Meng's parents have come and made a scene.

348
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,280
We've also apologized.

349
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,540
We've fulfilled

350
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:36,890
their request.

351
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,060
If you still want

352
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,080
to punish those two kids after al this,

353
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,670
I don't think it's appropriate.

354
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,410
You can't just put pressure on the grassroots whenever there's a problem.

355
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,180
If you deal with problems like that,

356
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,320
how can we do our work in the future?

357
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,800
Are you talking back to me?

358
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,900
You think you're fully fledged now, don't you?

359
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,660
It has caused

360
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,670
a sensation in the society.

361
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,810
On my way here,

362
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,120
I saw someone

363
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,510
livestreaming at the gate

364
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:03,890
of your station.

365
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,070
Livestreaming...

366
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,030
How could it be?

367
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:06,920
What...

368
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:07,920
What do you think?

369
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,180
I'll take care of it right away, Captain Meng.

370
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,410
Have some water.

371
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,040
Calm down.

372
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,180
Calm down, please.

373
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,760
The water is scalding hot. How can I drink it?

374
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,060
I'll get you another cup.

375
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,150
Put it down.

376
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,140
Captain Meng.

377
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,910
You came here

378
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,040
specially for this.

379
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:28,880
I know

380
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,690
you are under a lot of pressure.

381
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,290
But we are also under a lot of pressure here.

382
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,760
It's not easy for both of us.

383
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,150
Please calm down.

384
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,080
Everything should comply with rules and regulations.

385
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,390
It's one thing to feel wronged,

386
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,080
but it's quite another to treat it seriously.

387
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,380
Yes.

388
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,270
Submit the punishment decision as soon as possible.

389
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,070
Yes.

390
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,780
The water is scalding hot.

391
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,170
You can keep it.

392
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,770
I'll see you off.

393
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,810
Just this once.

394
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,690
-Yes!
-Yes!

395
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,550
Director Lin.

396
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,290
I suggest you

397
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,310
pay extra attention to Shao Yijiu.

398
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,120
I don't think he's suitable for firefighting.

399
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,480
You can't be soft-hearted on this.

400
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,030
Otherwise, it'll ruin him,

401
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:26,920
and you as well.

407

Listen up.

408
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:48,930
Here's an announcement.

409
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,660
Shao Yijiu

410
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,800
and Qin Shiquan,

411
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,680
firefighters from Heping Road Special Division Station,

412
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,650
illegally filmed a short video,

413
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,420
which caused a splash in the society,

414
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,590
and a negative social impact

415
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,780
on our station.

416
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,500
The station has unanimously decided

417
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,020
to give them each

418
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,160
the punishment of a warning.

419
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,550
Please learn the lesson

420
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,030
and strictly abide by the rules and regulations of the station.

421
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,410
Lunch start!

422
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,620
I really don't understand.

423
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,510
[Spare no effort to serve the people.]
I really don't understand.

424
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:24,550
[Spare no effort to serve the people.]

425
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,650
How could they give us a warning?
[Spare no effort to serve the people.]

426
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,780
Did we do anything wrong?
[Spare no effort to serve the people.]

427
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,410
[Spare no effort to serve the people.]

428
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,170
They make it sound like we got Sun Meng killed.
[Spare no effort to serve the people.]

429
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:30,260
[Spare no effort to serve the people.]

430
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,730
We just told the truth.
[Spare no effort to serve the people.]

431
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:31,810
We just told the truth.

432
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,160
And I thought Master could see things clearly.

433
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,890
I didn't expect he would be forced to apologize in the end.

434
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,400
So now,

435
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,490
whoever makes a scene gets the high ground, right?

436
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,300
Say something.

437
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,900
Don't just stand there.

438
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,180
What do you want me to say?

439
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,280
It's all my fault.

440
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,660
Why?

441
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,060
I shouldn't have asked you to make that video.

442
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,790
It's not about the video now.

443
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,140
The point is, the punishment of a warning

444
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,440
should be convincing.

445
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,540
It should make us feel it's reasonable,

446
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,000
right?

447
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,700
Say something.

448
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,790
Don't you feel wronged?

449
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,480
Do you think

450
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,970
we shouldn't have come here?

451
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,200
What do you mean?

452
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,450
I just feel like

453
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,220
being a firefighter

454
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,450
is different from what we expected.

455
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,000
What did you think being a firefighter would be like?

456
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,520
Going to fire scenes

457
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,750
and saving lives,

458
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,900
like a hero.

459
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,680
But now,

460
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,450
we didn't achieve anything big,

461
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,170
and all we got was being scolded.

462
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:01,980
So,

463
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,170
do you think maybe we shouldn't have come here?

464
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,130
I think...

465
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,980
It's not...

466
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,780
It's not that we shouldn't have come here.

467
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,970
It's just...

468
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,860
Indeed,

469
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,130
it's quite different

470
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,680
from what we expected.

471
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,410
[China Fire and Rescue]

472
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:40,920
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.
[China Fire and Rescue]

473
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,190
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

474
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,430
[Deputy Yu]

475
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,140
Neither of them brought their phones.

476
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,710
One of them turned his phone off, and the other left his in the dorm.

477
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,260
I'm worried

478
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,060
that they may run out of the station

479
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,610
and cause trouble outside.

480
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,520
These kids...

481
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,900
What are you talking about?

482
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,920
Well,

483
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,970
Yijiu and Shiquan

484
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,190
still haven't returned to the dorm.

485
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,530
We searched everywhere but couldn't find them.

486
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,250
They didn't go back to the dorm?

487
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,980
They can get lost if they don't want to work here anymore!

488
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,290
They only know to cause troubles

489
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,420
all day.

490
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,260
Calm down.

491
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,760
It's already...

492
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,310
Report!

493
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,860
Well...

494
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,250
-In... Instructor.
-Where are they?

495
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,430
I checked the CCTV.

496
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,150
They went up to the rooftop.

497
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:36,690
Roof...

498
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,420
How dare them!

499
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,430
Listen.

500
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,190
Don't you intercede for them.

501
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,030
I'll handle this.

502
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,420
It must be dealt with seriously.

503
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,980
This is outrageous!

504
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,640
Director.

505
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,230
Director.

506
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,510
Yu.

507
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,940
Enough.

508
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,150
Get back to work. Don't worry about this.

509
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:15,630
You two!

510
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,180
Stand up!

511
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,450
I'm telling you...

512
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,460
I'm telling you!

513
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,840
This is the fire station,

514
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,980
not your own house!

515
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,950
You have no sense of a team or discipline at all.

516
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,880
You didn't apply for a leave or make a report,

517
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,390
and you stayed out all night!

518
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,610
How serious this is!

519
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,010
Do you still want to work here or not?

520
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,480
If you don't...

521
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,400
If you don't want to work here anymore,

522
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,280
I'm telling you!

523
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,920
I'll teach you a lesson today!

524
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:37,970
Come here!

525
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,620
Hurry up!

526
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,600
Say something nice.

527
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,020
He wouldn't let me talk.

528
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,210
We just don't want you to get mad.

529
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,170
It's bad for your health.

530
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,190
Come in.

531
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,510
Instructor, we...

532
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,680
What about you!

533
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,030
Attention!

534
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,260
You two took a video

535
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,030
against the people.

536
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,790
Is it the right thing to do?

537
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,700
No matter how wrong Sun Meng's parents were,

538
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,420
it's none of your business.

539
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,440
Captain Meng and Lou Mingye were both here today.

540
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:34,960
Do you know

541
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,390
how your master

542
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,610
took the blame

543
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,750
and criticism

544
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,970
for you two because of this?

545
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,860
Yet you're acting like this.

546
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,870
Don't you feel guilty?

547
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,250
Come to think of it,

548
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,390
as the instructor,

549
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,250
I understand how you feel.

550
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,670
Although I understand you,

551
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,440
you still have to choose the right way

552
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,750
to deal with things.

553
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
You can't just do things recklessly.

554
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,230
What did you promise me

555
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,070
when you first came here?

556
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:12,680
Shao Yijiu.

557
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,070
You said you want to be an excellent firefighter.

558
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,250
Qin Shiquan.

559
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,190
You said you want to become a good station director.

560
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,670
Is this how you fulfill your promises?

561
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,290
Yet you feel wronged

562
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,470
and haven't come to your senses.

563
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,770
Let me tell you.

564
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,890
The dead should be prioritized.

565
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,450
She's already gone.

566
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,970
We should absolutely not cause secondary damage

567
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,730

568
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,290
Understand?

569
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,390
Yes.

570
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,950
This is the honor room

571
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,310
of Heping Road Special Division Station.

572
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,870
It's also the reflection room.

573
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,930
There are two chairs

574
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,770
behind you.

575
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,000
You two, sit here

576
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,690
and reflect on yourselves.

577
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,200
Think about the whole thing

578
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,470
from beginning to end.

579
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,430
Think carefully

580
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,620
whether you are wrong or not.

581
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,790
Or rather,

582
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,190
what you did wrong.

583
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:20,670
Understand?

584
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,440
Yes.

585
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,430
Sit!

586
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,270
Let's go.

587
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,740
Let them reflect on themselves.

588
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:52,050
[Heping Road Fire and Rescue Special Division Station, Binxi District, Beixun City]

589
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,950
What are you doing?

590
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,460
Instructor asked us to reflect on ourselves here.

591
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,430
Why are you walking around?

592
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,070
The chair is so uncomfortable.

593
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,540
I'm standing up to relax.

594
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,670
Besides,

595
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,770
Instructor didn't say

596
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,070
we have to keep sitting there when we reflect on ourselves.

597
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,210
It's the same that I reflect on myself standing up.

598
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,510
Sit back.

599
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,140
It's okay.

00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,590
[Fire and Rescue]

601

Shiquan.

602
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,280
Isn't that our school?

603
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,500
It really is.

604
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,630
Right?

605
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,970
[Fire and Rescue]

606
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,230
Do you remember
[Fire and Rescue]

607
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,910
when Master saved us from the earthquake,

608
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,470
I said to him that

609
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,020
when I grow up,

610
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,160
I will become

611
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,880
an excellent firefighter like him?

612
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,880
Back then,

613
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,290
when we decided to become firefighters,

614
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,470
didn't we come here,

615
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,440
ready to take hardships?

616
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,220
So I think

617
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,270
what we are experiencing now

618
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,710
is nothing

619
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,390
compared to what the seniors went through.

620
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,210
Yes.

621

Instructor

622
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,910
made this honor room

623
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,260
a reflection room.

624
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,300
The chair is short and narrow,

625
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,450
so that we can

626
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,390
remember the glorious history

627
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,960
and reflect on ourselves.

628
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,230
To think about why

629
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,620
we became firefighters in the first place.

630
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,250
Never forget our original aspirations.

631
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,780
Never forget our original aspirations.

632
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,230
All right.

633
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,660
Let's sit back down.

634
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,470
Go sit.

635

636
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,450
Okay.

Let's go.

00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,770
A lady...

641
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,740
Instructor didn't let us go.

642
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,870
Her ring fell into the sink.

643
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,420
-Yijiu, Shiquan.
-Dispatch Truck 2.

644
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,230
You two, go on the mission with me.

645
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,240
Yes!

646
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,640
Mr. Firefighter, please come in.

647
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,520
Come in.

648
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,200
What's this about?

649
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:15,950
Hello.

650
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,130
You called the police, right?

651
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,150
Your ring fell into the sewer?

652
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,070
I'm sorry.

653
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,160
It was my kid.

654
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,760
It's just a normal ring,

655
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,140
nothing valuable.

656
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,700
I won't waste your time.

657
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,920
So why did you cry secretly?

658
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,220
I didn't cry.

659
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,440
You were mistaken.

660
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,310
We're already here.

661
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,360
We'll take a look for you. Where did you drop it?

662
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,410
Don't bother.

663
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,670
Uncle, it's over there.

664
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,890
Over there.

665
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:40,860
You dropped it here, right?

666
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,120
It's over there.

667
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,880
Let me see.

668
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,060
It fell from here, right?

669
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,940
Yes.

670
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,990
Let me see.

671
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,970
Hand me the wrench.

672
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:50,430
Okay.

673
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,190
Your pipe is completely blocked by rust.

674
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,770
It's not easy to get it out.

675
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,200
If you want to get it no matter what,

676
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,550
we might have to remove the sink.

677
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:06,980
Don't bother then.

678
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,210
The house is rented.

679
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,140
We'll have to compensate the landlord if we break anything.

680
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,700
I'm really sorry.

681
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,750
You are so busy,

682
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,220
and we added to your trouble.

683
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,900
Mom.

684
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,160
Firefighters.

685
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,130
We won't bother you.

686
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,260
I don't want it.

687
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,610
It's all because of the kid.

688
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,550
Master, how about we give it another try?

689
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:26,970
Yes.

690
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,940
There might be another way.

691
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,450
Maybe we can get the ring out without destroying the pipes.

692
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,960
All right, come and take a look.

693
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,520
You didn't run water after that, right?

694
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,540
No.

695
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,220
It's so tight.

696
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,780
It can't be moved at all.

697
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:45,960
How is it?

698
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,020
It seems the ring fell from here.

699
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,040
How about we confirm the location

700
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,010
with Snake Eye first?

701
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:57,680
Master.

702
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,400
We want to try it with Snake Eye again.

703
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,530
It's your call.

704
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,600
Slowly.

705
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,700
-We hooked it out.
-Mr. Firefighter, you're amazing.

706
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,660
Here.

707
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,220
It's so hard to get.

708
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,690
Thank you so much.

709
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,280
It's okay.

710
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,740
Thank you.

711
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,210
Our pleasure.

712

-Thanks to you.
-Thank you, Mr. Firefighter.

715
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,000
Yes.

716
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,870
Wait, Mr. Firefighter.

717
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,290
What's wrong, kid?

718
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,360
Mr. Firefighter, this is for you.

719
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,170
This is for me?

720
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,640
Bye, Mr. Firefighter.

721
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,780
Take care.

722
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,420
Take it, Yijiu.

723
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,680
It looks quite like you.

724
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,730
Good for you.

725
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,620
Yes.

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,620
Back to the station.

727
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,970
Good job.

728
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,700
You two did pretty well today.

729
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,170
Keep it up.

730
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:26,840
Okay.

731
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,990
You two did a great job.

732
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,000
Get in the truck.

733
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,260
You were pretty good.

734
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:33,480

738
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,520
why Instructor
[China Fire and Rescue]

739
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,030
asked you to reflect on yourselves in the honor room?

741
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,000
Yes.

742
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,390
To let us remember these honors

743
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,240
while reflecting on ourselves.

744
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,670
It's both punishment

745
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,260
and education.

746
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,070
So do you know

747
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,170
how Special Division's Nine Rules came into being?

748
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,270
Assistant Liu once told us about it vaguely.

749
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,250
Assistant Liu only told us

750
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,930
about the sixth rule, which concerns him.

751
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,780
He didn't tell us about the others.

752
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,790
Master,

753
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,170
please tell us.

754
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,240
Let me tell you.

755
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,120

760
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,530
Because he talks too much.

761
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,630
He wants to add a few things all the time.

762
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,980
No one can stand it.

763
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,870
So the first rule was set

764
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,840
to remind him to talk less at the critical moment.

00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,140
was actually set by your instructor for me.

In that earthquake back then,

774
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,760
after I saved you two,

775
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,440
there was actually another boy

776
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,990
who was younger than you.

777
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,060
He was buried under the ruins for two days,

778
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,990
but he was very strong and had been

779
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,920
waiting for us to save him.

780
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,320
Later, I finally found him.

781
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,670
In the process of the rescue, however,

782
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,220
there was an aftershock.

783
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,870
In the end,

784
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,630
I couldn't save him.

785
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,450
I always thought

786
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,970
if I had been given a few more seconds,

787
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,790
I could have saved his life.

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,950
Can you stop?

792
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,680
Enough!

793
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,430
What are you doing?

794
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,750
Are you training or hurting yourself?

795
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,640
Do you think if you train yourself to death,

796
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,900
that kid could come back to life?

797
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,870
It's not because of the kid.

798
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,370
Fine.

799
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,710
You said it.

We won't talk about this today.

Do you remember

803
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,610
when we first arrived here,

804
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,470
you said as long as the recruit wins the veteran on the training ground,

805
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,900
he can set a rule of his own?

806
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,620
I won,

807
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,430
but I didn't set any rule.

808
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,950
I'll set the rule today.

during our casual chats with each other,

829
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,730
which may seem like a joke.

But as long as the rules are set,

831
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,210
we will abide by them.

832
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,030
Because this is our consensus.

834
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,260

and unquestionable.

That's also why I asked you to delete

this time.

842
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,790
It's because all the announcements on social events

843
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,650
must be issued by the brigade.

844
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,000
Otherwise, everyone just post whatever they want,

845
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,720
then who's to decide in the end?

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,190

It's one thing to get to know your mistake.

today is

852
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,480
why you posted that video?

853
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,290
It was me who asked Yijiu to make that video.

854
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,440
Because Yijiu left a comment under Sun Meng's Weibo,

855
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,780
and many people criticized him.

856
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,130
So why did you

857
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,100
leave a comment under her Weibo?

858
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:44,170
I felt like I'm also responsible for Sun Meng's death.

859
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,390
Although we saved her,

860
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,000
we didn't give her hope to live.

861
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,520
I really wanted to say sorry to her.

00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,330
Do you think

saving a person

865
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,160

Remember.

You can't have that mindset.

Or you'll get into a vicious circle.

Saving people

872
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,770
is addictive.

I manage to save someone,

876
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,150
I'd get very excited.

877
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,830

At that moment,

I'd feel like my life is so valuable,

881
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,020
and I'm a hero.

882
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,330
That is an impulse that you can't control.

883

to the people you save.

886
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,090
But this is very dangerous.

887
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,150
If a person

888
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,620
gets addicted to something,

889
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,930
he'll become irrational

890
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,370
and fall into individual heroism.

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,310
Come on.

946
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,870
Lie down. I'll put some ointment on you.

947
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:03,830
Lie down.

948
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,460
No need.

949
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,930
Come on.

950
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:06,770
Lie down.

951
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,250
You're brutal.

952
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,050
Yes.

953
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,350
You don't know when to stop.

954
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,400
Bear with it.

955
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,850
Look at you.

956
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,460
Do you still think you're a young man in your early 20s?

957
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,270
You can't be like this.

958
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,240
If you ruin your health,

959
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,790
how can you lead the team in the future?

960
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,270
You have to do the work

961
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,450
under the premise that you're safe yourself.

962
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,760
You always say that.

963
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,070
If you get injuries all over your body,

964
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,960
they may stay with you forever.

965
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,900
Are you feeling better?

966
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,750
Why is it so hard to find a good piece of music?

967
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,260
There's one more.

968
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:40,980
Try one more.

969
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,860
Listen to it.

970
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,070
This is pretty good.

971
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,590
Who made this?

972
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,460
Lin Qi.

973
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,020
Say it clearly.

974
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,670
It's Lin Qi.

975
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:17,980
Who?

976
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,820
Mr. Ma.

977
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,660
He's here.

978
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,460
Lin Qi.

979
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,010
Come on.

980
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:27,720
Come on in.

981
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,780
Let me introduce.

982
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,790
This is Mr. Huang from Zhige Entertainment.

983
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,570
I know you.

984
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,740
You and Jiang Ge...

985
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,460
Yes, Handsome.

986
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,460
We meet again.

987
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,810
Mr. Jiang

988
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,820
is the chairman of Zhige.

989
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,340
He specially asked me

990
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,810
to come here and discuss our collaboration.

991
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,170
How can we collaborate?

992
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,150
How can you talk like that?

993
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,120
It's our honor

994
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,880
to get to work with Zhige.

995
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,410
You watched Flaming Youth, right?

996
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,290
No.

997
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,460
Isn't your brother in that show?

998
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,390
So what?

999
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,860
I've never seen it.

1000
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,030
I've seen it.

1001
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,910
It really touched me.

1002
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:04,640
You watched it?

1003
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,440
I did.

1004
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:05,940
Okay.

1005
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,330
I'll make it short.

1006
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,960
Mr. Jiang

1007
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,430
is very dissatisfied with the background music in it,

1008
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,490
so he wants him to make a new version.

1009
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,250
Any problem?

1010
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,420
No.

1011
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:14,800
Mr. Ma.

1012
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,980
There's no problem at all.

1013
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:16,480
Mr. Huang.

1014
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,320
Here's the thing.

1015
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,750
Lin Qi

1016
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,600
is a musical genius strongly promoted by our company.

1017
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,530
He has absolutely no problem

1018
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,540
fulfilling your request.

1019
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,630
That's good.

1020
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,400
This is Mr. Jiang's business card.

1021
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,750
Record the demo

1022
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,250
and send it to him.

1023
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:29,800
[Jiang Ge]
and send it to him.

1024
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,380
[Jiang Ge]

1025
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,660
Take it.

1026
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,090
Sorry.

1027
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,600
I can't do this.

1028
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,340
Lin Qi, you know what?

1029
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,470
If you don't do it,

1030
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,070
you won't get any work in the future.

1031
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,430
Director Lin.

1032
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,010
What are you doing?

1033
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,150
I...

1034
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,900
What a coincidence.

1035
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,660
I was going to see you.

1036
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,750
What's up?

1037
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,900
You've met

1038
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:54,990
that childhood friend of mine, right?

1039
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,670
He wants to treat you to dinner.

1040
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,190
Treat me to dinner?

1041
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,530
We don't know each other well.

1042
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,450
Why does he want to buy me dinner?

1043
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,160
He called me and said

1044
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,380
it's been a long time since we last met.

1045
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,430
And it's my birthday.

1046
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,020
So he wants to get together.

1047
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,290
I guess he was worried that you wouldn't approve my application for a leave,

1048
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,630
so he specially asked me

1049
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,520
to ask you to go with us.

1050
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,090
Lei Dagang.

1051
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,300
Here.

1052
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,490
Since when

1053
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,670
did you start to beat around the bush?

1054
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:23,890
No.

1055
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,280
He really said that.

1056
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:27,920
I'll pass.

1057
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,520
You go.

1058
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,650
And

1059
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,340
you don't have to come back tonight.

1060
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,890
You can take the opportunity to go home as well.

1061
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,650
Go.

1062
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,720

1063
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:39,810

All of us should know

1066
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,640
the right way to report a fire.

When there's a fire,

1068
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,910
call 119 immediately.

1069
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,180
Tell them clearly the name and

1070
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:50,940
address of the building,

1071
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,370
what's burning, how strong the fire is,

1072
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,390
and if there's anyone trapped.

1073
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:57,530
Also, make sure to give your name and number

1074
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,830
to the Alarm Center

1075
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,550
so that they can reach you.

1076
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:00,850
After making the call,

1077
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,450
send someone

1078
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,840
to wait for the firetruck on the street immediately,

1079
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,560
and lead the firefighters

1080
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,830
to get to the scene as soon as possible.
