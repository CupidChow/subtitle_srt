No.

Isn't it similar to firefighters?

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,420
Thank you, Teacher Nan Chu

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
for giving me such an interesting lesson.

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,860
I should be the one thanking you.

If you hadn't saved me,

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,180
I wouldn't have become a dancer

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,980
and definitely not an actress.

23
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,540
I wouldn't be like this now either.

Do you think I should worry

25
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,260
that you'll become more popular,

26

What are you worried about?

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,900
So what if I get popular?

I'm still me.

Alright.

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,660

about this carefully

Why do you want to transfer to Lushan Forest Fire Brigade?

47
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,090
Because Lushan is the farthest away

48

54
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,580
With urban firefighting,

55
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,320
I'm familiar with it.

56
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,530
I do this every day.

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,360
But when it comes to forest fires,

58
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,240
I'm still at the theoretical stage.

59
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,050
So,

60
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,820
I feel that I must go to the front line

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,760
to experience

62
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,200

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,810
It depends on the superiors.

70

He'll have to start from scratch.

118

Since he

119
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,210
asked the superiors himself,

120
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,690

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:53,930
right?

195
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:54,810
And me?

196
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,100
Could they have gotten together

197
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,050
if not for Flaming Youth?

198
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,410
I'm like their matchmaker, right?

199
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,700
How can we not do anything

200
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,560
now that they broke up?

201
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,180
Who said they broke up?

202
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,340
Doesn't this count as a breakup?

203
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,450
Of course not.

204
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,330
You know the rest symbol in music?

205
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,220
It doesn't mean to stop.

206
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,160
Instead, it's to wait.

207
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,730
It's a pause in emotion.

208
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,810
The music piece is even better

209
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,440
because of it.

210
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,450
How can you think of it as the end?

211
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,340
No, no, no.

212
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,460
You're wrong.

213
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,960
They just haven't clearly broken up yet,

214
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,200
but think about it.

215
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,040
When Nan Chu goes to the US,

216
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,450
there'll be a time difference.

217
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,460
Lin Luxiao is so busy with work.

218
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,570
The two of them will have less and less contact.

219
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,800
Their feelings will fade.

220
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,170
It's basically a breakup.

221
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,100
This is why you shouldn't do long-distance relationships.

222
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,600
They never end well.

223
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,200
Jiang Ge,

224
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,320
do you speak from experience?

225
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,940
How could I have experience?

226
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,460
It's just a joke I read online.

227
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,050
Don't you know me?

228
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,170
Don't blame me for raining on your parade.

229
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,700
When people are in love,

230
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,040
they'd try to cling together all the time

231
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,570
and see each other every day.

232
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,680
But these two?

233
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,560
If they don't meet

234
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,600
or contact each other,

235
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:01,840
what kind of relationship is that?

236
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,600
Jiang Ge,

237
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,410
you expose yourself whenever you talk.

238
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:07,920
What's wrong?

239
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,930
Do lovers have to be together?

240
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,210
In my opinion,

241
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,850
love is the only thing that can pass through

242
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,800
time and space.

243
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,060
It can even pass through dimensions,

244
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,090
like gravity.

245
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,200
Besides,

246
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,040
my brother and Nan Chu

247
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,180
already considered

248
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,340
the things that you mentioned

249
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,440
when they decided to date.

250
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,810
Since they

251
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,330
chose each other so resolutely,

252
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,610
it means

253
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,320
that even if they're not together,

254
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,440
even without words,

255
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,080
their love

256
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,460
can still be kept in their hearts forever.

257
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,460
Yes.

258
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,460
It would be great

259
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,850
if what you said is true,

260
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,930
but reality is cruel.

261
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,810
Right?

262
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,960
You believe it,

263
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,570
but I don't.

264
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,320
It doesn't matter whether we believe it or not.

265
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,940
What matters is Nan Chu and my brother.

266
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,970
They believe it.

267
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,570
But I still think they broke up.

268
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,300
No, Jiang Ge,

269
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,920
why are you...

270
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,740
This kind of love won't appear in your world,

271
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,720
because you don't believe in these things.

272
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,800
Alright.

273
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:12,680
Get back to work.

274
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,180
We promised Nan Chu

275
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,600
to make this platform a success.

276
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,440
Go to work.

277
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,560
They must have broken up.

278
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,210
Listen to me.

279
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,410
They broke up.

280
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,090
They definitely did.

281
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,610
They definitely did.

00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,800
What should we do?

284
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,440
Master is leaving.

285
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,200
What can we do?

286
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,680
Adjust your attitude and accept it.

287
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,320
Do you know

288
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,530
how I feel now?

289
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,210
How do you feel?

290
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,840
It's like the earthquake when we were young.

291
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,620
It's the feeling I had

292
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,160
when Master saved us from the earthquake,

293
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,840
but when I turned around,

294
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,560
my home was gone.

295
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,560
I feel like that too.

296
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,700
Why don't we think of a way

297

[Xia Wan]

308
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,680
Yes.

309
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,450
I happen to be off today.

310
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,440
Let's eat together.

311
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,560
I heard about your station.

312
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,080
Actually,

313
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,690
I've known you for quite some time now.

314
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,090
I've always admired you all,

315
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,280
but to accept so many changes

316
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,730
in such a short time

317
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,560
is indeed hard to accept.

318
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,280
Actually, I accepted it.

319
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,600
Back then,

320
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,680
no matter how badly I got hurt,

321
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,320
or how sad I was,

322
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,840
everyone would be there

323
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,500
joking

324
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,420
and fooling around,

325
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,810
and I'd move on from the problem.

326
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,400
But now,

327
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,920
maybe I'm not used to it.

328
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,090
Dagang left

329
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,810
and Lin is leaving too.

Yu...

331
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,460
I know I've been forcing myself

332
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,810
to hold up these days.

333
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,810
I feel

334
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,330
that my home is gone.

335
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,920
Now that I think about it,

336
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,450
there are not many people

337
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,560
from my batch who are still here.

338
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,580
People come,

339
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,400
people go.

340
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,920
It's normal.

341
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,440
When I first became an ER doctor,

342
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,700
we tried saving a patient

343
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,800
for two full days.

344
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,690
His vitals finally stabilized,

345
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,570
but then...

346
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,320
Ten minutes.

347
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,040
Only ten minutes later,

348
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,290
he suddenly passed away.

349
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,700
At that time,

350
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,120
there was nothing we could do.

351
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,320
That was probably when

352
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,960
I might have

353
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,160
gradually realized

354
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,720
that faced with life and death,

355
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,760
separations and reunions,

356
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,800
humans are quite powerless against them.

357
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,330
I've known Yu for more than two days.

358
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,640
I get the logic,

359
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,560
but I can't face it as calmly as you.

360
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,640
You all are firefighters.

361
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,810

00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,810
many admirable traits,

including you.

364
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,120
You have something you're good at.

00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,330
Something I'm good at?

366
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,180
Maybe I'm just good at

367
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,560
complaining to you.

368
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,140
Isn't complaining

369
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,000
a normal thing?

if you like me.

384
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,330
Do you still feel that way?

385
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,900
After this period of contact,

386
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,080
I quite like you too.

387
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,000
Let's go to the gym sometime.

388
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,820
[Dream Dance]

389
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,490
[Shao Yijiu]

390
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,300
Nan Chu, Master is transferring to Lushan.
[Shao Yijiu]

391
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,840
Can you talk to him for me?
[Shao Yijiu]

392
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,020
[Shao Yijiu]

393
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,140
Thank you.
[Shao Yijiu]

394
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,570
Thank you.

395
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,970
Did Nan Chu reply to you?

396
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,090
Even the last straw of hope is gone too.

397
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,690
Attention, everyone.

398
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,410
Assemble in the training ground in five minutes.

399
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,560
Hurry up.

400
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,160
Everyone is here.

401
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,010
I have something to say.

402
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,960
As you all know,

403
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,170
tomorrow,

404
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,320
I will be transferring to Lushan.

405
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,280
So today, I will

406
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,600
officially bid farewell to you all here.

407
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,890
Do you know why I chose today?

408
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,570
The Special Division Station

409
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,250
was officially established

410
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,640
thirty years ago today.

411
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,570
I stayed

412
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,240
to celebrate the Special Division Station's birthday.

413
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,160
It's both a farewell

414
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,570
and the welcoming of a new life.

415
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,780
The Special Division Station

416
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,570
has had seven directors

417
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,490
in the past 30 years.

418
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,480
Countless veterans have left.

419
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,280
Batch after batch of new members have come too.

420
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,890
But no matter who comes or goes,

421
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,320
the Special Division Station

422
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,160
will always be the Special Division Station.

423
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,770
This reputable team

424
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,290
has its own spirit.

425
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,720
Our team is as strong as iron.

426
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,800
I want you to remember

427
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,320
that it's not someone who changed the Special Division Station

428
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,530
but that the Special Division Station

429
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,850
changed each one of us.

430
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,810
Don't think that the Special Division Station will fail

431
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,050
because someone left

432
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,120
or someone died on duty.

433
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,800
This veteran warrior of more than 30 years

434
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,800
has experienced more serious injuries than this.

435
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,040
But every time,

436
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,560
it can stand up firmly again.

437
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,080
Those who came from the Special Division Station

438
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,970
will always have the Special Division Station's blood in their veins

439
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,730
and will always be undefeatable.

440
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,640
That's all I want to say.

441
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,010
Today,

442
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,130
accompany me

Go inside to eat.

476
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,090
Go,

477
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,400
get changed

478
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,610
and treat me to a meal.

479
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,090
Treat you to a meal?

480
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,610
You're abandoning me.

481
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,850
You should treat me to a meal.

482
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,530
Okay.

483
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,370
Hurry up.

484
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,320
I'll wait for you at the door.

485
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,370
It seems like you're going to give me a good meal.

486
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,850
You're treating me.

487
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,560
Our Director Lou learned how to drink?

488
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,730
You're leaving.

489
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,970
I'll make an exception this time

490
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,520
to accompany you.

491
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,000
Okay.

492
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,800
Well..

493
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,770
I reported it already.

494
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,610
Great.

495
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,480
You and that...

496
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
that girl,

497
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,240
Nan Chu,

498
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,810
ended just like this?

499
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,970
Is that why

500
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,120
you requested to transfer to Lushan?

501
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,250
I can only say

502
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,040
that this is one part of it

503
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,250
but not entirely.

504
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,090
I think

505
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,960
this is good for both of us.

506
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,120
I understand.

507
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,600
Actually, both of you

508
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,160
are quite brave.

509
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,000
I understand.

510
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,440
You understand?

511
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,890
Why can't I?

512
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,120
Isn't a relationship

513
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,730
based on faith and courage?

514
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,850
Just like us being firefighters,

515
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,330
we also rely on a type of faith

516
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,600
for all these years.

517
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,080
As long as you believe in it,

518
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,800
the spark will never extinguish.

519
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,520
Why are you laughing?

520
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,650
Nothing.

521
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:31,970
Nothing.

522
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,800
I'm just

523
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,040
not used to hearing you

524
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,890
say things like that.

525
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,160
What?

526
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,770
To you,

527
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,570
I'm just an emotionless robot, right?

528
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,620
Aren't you?

529
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,480
Am I?

530
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,050
Let me ask you.

531
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,840
What is your faith?

532
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,370
It's very simple.

533
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,560
It's to be a good firefighter

534
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,640
and do—

535
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,290
Alright,

536
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,850
I'm not asking about your professional motivation.

537
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,660
You don't have to expound on it,

538
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,330
okay?

539
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,570
Let me ask you something else.

540
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,560
Have you ever

541
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,520
felt a spark

542
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,890
in terms of relationships before?

543
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,280
Have you had

544
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,280
little flutters?

545
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,890
No.

546
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,540
I...

547
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,240
I'll let it happen naturally.

548
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,560
I'm not in a hurry.

549
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,410
I just want to get my work done first.

550
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,800
Tell me

551
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,050
when it happens one day.

552
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,490
Okay.

553
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,410
I promise you.

554
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,410
Let's work hard together.

555
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,890
I'll also try to

556
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,370
make a name for myself in Lushan.

557
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,330
I'm telling you, you can do it.

558
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,120
Although we had some disagreements before,

559
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,360
in my heart,

560
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,290
you've always been the best firefighter.

561
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,320
I learned a lot from you.

562
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,970
Really.

563
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,460
No wonder you don't usually drink.

564
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,320
All the truth flows out

565
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,940
after you drink,

566
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,570
right?

567
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,250
I can't reveal it carelessly.

568
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,090
