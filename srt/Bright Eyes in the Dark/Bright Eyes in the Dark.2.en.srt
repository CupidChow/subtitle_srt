Honey.

Who's it?

10

Lei.

12
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,920
It's hard to find this place, isn't it?

13
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,820
-Yeah.
-You guys talk.

14
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,780
I'm going to the gym.

15
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,020
Why did you come to me

16
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,020
all of a sudden?

17
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,420
I'm here for training sessions.

18
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,300
You did me a favor a while ago.

19
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,420
So I came to thank you.

20
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,180
Don't mention it.

21
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,860
I think it's meaningful

22
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,820
that I could help you.

23
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,020
Lei.

24
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,990
I'll be frank with you.

25
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,700
I came to pay you a visit

26
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,790
and also to ask you

27
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,260
if you want to join us as a firefighter.

28
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,630
What made you think

29
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,460
I could be a firefighter?

30
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,750
After the earthquake happened,

31
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,030
you were the first one to come out to save others.

32
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,220
So I'm sure

33
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,860
that you're the kind of person

34
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,070
who will step up in danger.

35
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,580
Am I right?

36
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,220
You love this feeling.

37
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,380
You can't deny it.

38
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,860
Your expertise

39
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,660
can be made the best use of in firefighting.

40
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,180
I hope you can fight alongside me.

41
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,790
Think about it.

Lin Luxiao.

62
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,100
You're a mature man.

63
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,870
Why can't you stay out of trouble?

64
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,900
I don't even know what to say.

65
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,100
The higher-ups keep emphasizing

66
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,460
the importance of building a good image.

67
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,430
We need to appear reliable in public.

68
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,910
Our every behavior represents all firefighters.

69
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,970
But what did you do?

70
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,880
You don't give a fig about anything!

71
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,040
Couldn't you just save the people and come back?

72
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,770
Just do your job and become an Honor Director.

73
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,800
Wouldn't that be great?

74
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,800
He doesn't get to decide my honor.

75
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,880
Lin Luxiao!

76
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,850
How could you say something like that?

77
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,460
Do you think

78
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,710
you can smooth this over?

79
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,560
Personal honor is collective honor.

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,190
Right?

81
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,120
Don't you feel guilty about the station

82
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,580
and every fireman here?

83
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,900
You're not worried,

84
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,300
but we are.

85
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,930
Understand?

86
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,540
Report!

87
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,810
Dagang, talk some sense into him.

88
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,260
Yes.

89
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,990
We should build a good image with the best service.

90
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,150
Director Lin.

91
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,430
I think

92
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,410
it's for honor.

93
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,160
Right?

94
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,810
Maybe there will be bonuses and subsidies.

95
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,270
Who told you that?

96
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,020
I mean maybe.

97
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,540
We can't miss out on that chance.

98
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,120
Maybe?

99
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,220
Liu,

100
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,950
will we get a bonus?

101
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,110
This is not about bonuses.

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,470
Instructor, let me tell you.

103
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,910
This is not Director Lin's fault.

104
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,270
Lou Mingye meant

105
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,560
to throw his weight around in front of us.

106
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,730
You didn't see his face.

107
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,250
When I think of it now,

108
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,490
I'm like…

109
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,470
He's such an annoyance.

110
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,540
I'll go do the cleaning.

111
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,770
Look at them.

112
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,730
They all understand the importance of this,

113
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,450
don't they?

114
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,390
And you knew

115
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,590
that Lou Mingye would come today.

116
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,030
Couldn't you just suck it up?

117
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,380
He's famous for being difficult.

118
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,900
Everyone in the station knows that.

119
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,690
Did you have to pit yourself against him?

120
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,520
A loner can't get far.

121
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,010
Do you know what I mean?

122
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,010
To be honest,

123
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,670
you're indeed at fault today.

124
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,100
You know what?

125
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,420
It's fine to make a mistake.

126
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,080
As long as you correct it,

127
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,980
you're still a good firefighter.

128
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,430
To be honest…

129
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,090
To be honest, you should go back.

130
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,050
Where do you want me to go?

131
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,130
Stop right there!

132
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,370
To be honest,

133
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:08,940
you should look at this.

134
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,120
Watch this video yourself.

141
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Everyone is talking about it now.

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,000
Captain Meng talked with me,

143
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
saying that we have an attitude problem

144
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and asking me to write a report to him.

145
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Tell me what I should write.

146
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
We worked all day

147
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,400
and were hungry after coming back so we ordered takeout. What the hell…

148
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,280
To be honest,

149
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,120
Instructor,

150
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,920
you found serious negligence

151
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,720
and misconduct in our work.

152
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,080
It must be seriously addressed.

153
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,880
Tell everyone not on duty

154
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,800
to come for a meeting in the activity room three minutes later.

155
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,320
Meeting?

156
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,730
Lately,

157
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,480
a video about us

158
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,880
has been widely spread online

159
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,780
and caused a lot of controversy.

160
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,280
We've left the public

161
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,900
with a bad impression.

162
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,710
I hope every one of us

163
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,350
can spend some time reflecting on it.

164
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,200
It can't happen again.

165
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,860
So,

166
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,030
I suggest

167
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,860
building a supply depot in our station.

168
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,860
When we come back from a mission

169
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,260
and feel hungry,

170
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,670
we can go there to eat.

171
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,420
There are no limits

172
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,110
on the food types.

173
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,030
You can have

174
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,820
bread and cookies,

175
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,540
chips and sausages,

176
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,270
or instant noodles.

177
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,180
If you want,

178
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,780
you can also roast chicken and cook steaks.

179
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,660
I'll prepare a fridge for you.

180
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,340
Of course, the instructor agrees with it.

181
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,620
He's very concerned about our health.

182
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,420
Let's give him a big hand.

183
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,030
Great!

184
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,060
Thank you, Instructor Yang.

185
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,180
Now speak your mind.

186
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,380
Any comment?

187

that skipping meals is a bad habit.

that to save others, we need to take good care of ourselves first.

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,380
You're actually so bad at it.

376
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,180
You're the Director.

377
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,260
You have to be a role model to everyone.

378
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,100
You get injured so often.

379
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,980
What do you want me to do?

380
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,020
Enough. Stop nagging.

381
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,630
You're always nagging.

382
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,460
What brought you to me?

383
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,020
I brought you good news.

384
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,900
What's it?

385
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,140
We'll soon have new blood in the station.

386
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,350
Two new guys.

387
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,900
What's so exciting about that?

388
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,500
They're not normal recruits.

389
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,820
Director Lin, do you remember us?

390
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,470
Yijiu, Shiquan, right?

391
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,950
[Shao Yijiu, Heping Road Special Division Station]
[Qin Shiquan, Heping Road Special Division Station]
Yijiu, Shiquan, right?

392
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,590
[Shao Yijiu, Heping Road Special Division Station]
[Qin Shiquan, Heping Road Special Division Station]

393
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,170
Yes, you have a good memory, big hero.
[Shao Yijiu, Heping Road Special Division Station]
[Qin Shiquan, Heping Road Special Division Station]

394
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,270
Yes, you have a good memory, big hero.

395
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,150
Hero?

396
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,500
Listen to me.

397
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,300
The Special Division Station is not a place for hero worship.

398
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,420
No one should be idolized here.

399
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,550
Don't think you two are special.

400
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,780
Recruits like you two arrive every year.

401
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,060
They were all saved by firefighters

402
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,700
and then

403
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,700
dreamed of becoming superheroes.

404
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,230
After they arrived,

405
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,620
they realized that things were so different.

406
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,380
So I advise you to carefully think

407
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,740
about what this job means to you,

408
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,100
why you came here,

409
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,460
and why you want to become a firefighter.

410
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,380
Enough.

411
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,220
Why are you so serious?

412
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,260
Report.

413
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,220
Instructor,

414
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,460
I've thought it through.

415
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,100
I want to be a great firefighter like Director Lin.

416
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,660
We became orphans in that earthquake.

417
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,100
We grew up with so many people's help.

418
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,380
We're who we are today

419
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,820
thanks to the help

420
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,100
of everyone in our village.

421
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,180
More importantly,

422
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,350
firefighters like you

423
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,060
saved us in the earthquake.

424
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,300
Report!

425
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,380
After that earthquake,

426
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,100
Shao Yijiu and I decided to

427
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,180
become qualified firefighters.

428
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,620
Not only that,

429
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,030
I want to become a great Director

430
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,380
like Director Lin

431
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,300
so that I can save more people.

432
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,220
Good.

433
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
You two are so aspiring.

434
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,460
But don't be so optimistic,

435
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,460
or you'll be very disappointed.

436
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,820
Let's see what you got.

437
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,220
We finally have two new recruits.

438
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,500
Why are you so harsh on them?

439
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,100
Since you've chosen this path,

440
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,300
you have to do your best.

441
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,220
Yes.

442
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,940
One more thing.

443
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,460
Well…

444
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:03,740
What...

445
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,140
What are you waiting for?

446
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,900
Firefighters.

447
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,430
Let's go!

448
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,540
Fire! Fire!

449
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,100
No. 117, Huaihai Road.

450
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,200
Wenhua Cultural Center.

[Learn principles. Pledge loyalty. Stay enthusiastic.]
Wenhua Cultural Center.

452
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,110
A fire broke out.
[Learn principles. Pledge loyalty. Stay enthusiastic.]

453
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,210
[Learn principles. Pledge loyalty. Stay enthusiastic.]

454
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,220
Dispatch Tender One, Two, and Four.

455
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,980
Fire! Fire!

456
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,380
No. 117, Huaihai Road.

457
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,660
Wenhua Cultural Center. A fire broke out.

458
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,750
Dispatch Tender One, Two, and Four.

459
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,420
Go!

460
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,620
-Director Lin.
-Director Lin.

461
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,980
You two follow me. Come.

462
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,260
You can only assist us.

463
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,350
Do what you're told.

464
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,100
-Yes.
-Yes.

465
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,740
Are you done resting?

466
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,660
Let's do it again.

467
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,420
Hurry.

468
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,060
Who's in charge?

469
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,820
We're firefighters from Heping Road Special Division Station.

470
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,900
Who reported a fire?

471
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,780
Fire?

472
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,740
No one called us?

473
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,540
What's going on?

474
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,260
Hello, sir.

475
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,980
What's wrong?

476
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,060
Did you report a fire?

477
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,660
No.

478
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,980
What's going on, sir?

479
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,710
An Weiren, An Weiming.

480
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,500
Go check around.

481
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:23,980
Yes.

482
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,780
What's going on?

483
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,910
Contact the Command Center.

484
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,700
Yes.

485
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,430
Command Center.

486
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,660
What's going on?

487
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,990
Why are firefighters here?

488
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,860
Ma'am.

489
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,180
What did you do?

490
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,900
Look what you've done to my house.

491
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,870
I passed by and came in to take a look.

492
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,940
Look what I ran into.

493
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,820
I shouldn't have

494
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,660
rented the house to you.

495
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,110
There must be some misunderstanding.

496
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,420
Everything has been fine here.

497
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:45,940
You sure?

498
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,820
Then why are firefighters here?

499
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,820
You're already six months late on the rent!

500
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,220
You have to move out today!

501
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,700
Please, madam.

502
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,980
It's been hard to keep the dance club afloat recently.

503
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,380
We've rented your house for years.

504
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,380
Please give us one more month.

505
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,460
Just one month.

506
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,190
It's not about the rent.

507
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,820
I don't want to rent it to you anymore.

508
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,660
It's written in the contract that

509
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,940
if any damage is done to the house,

510
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,070
the contract will be terminated immediately.

511
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,500
We didn't do anything.

512
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,230
Stop lying!

513
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:11,860
I don't care.

514
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,420
You gotta move!

515
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,060
Director Lin.

516
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,900
No fire has been found.

517
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,180
Just one more month.

518
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,060
Director Lin, I've checked upstairs.

519
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,060
No fire has been found.

520
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,420
Who made the call?

521
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:21,860
Director Lin.

522
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,580
They must have

523
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,060
Director Lin.

524
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,300
set my house on fire.

525
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:24,820
Look at this.

526
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,980
Some neighbor saw the smoke and called you.

527
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,580
You were waiting for us outside.

528
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,430
Sir…

529
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,860
Are you sure you didn't make the call?

530
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,340
Here.

531
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,020
I have enough reason to suspect you

532
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,700
of making a false report

533
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,660
and wasting public resources.

534
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,500
We will

535
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,260
get to the bottom of this matter.

536
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,620
You made the call

537
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,140
to kick us out.

538
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,620
I saw smoke outside just now.

539
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,420
Listen. It must be a neighbor.

540
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,060
Some neighbor was cooking.

541
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,220
Enough. Don't explain to us.

542
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,780
Whatever the situation was,

543
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,460
tell it to the police later.

544
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,020
Okay?

545
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,180
Call the police.

546
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,620
Okay.

547
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,380
Is that necessary?

548
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,300
I didn't make a false report.

549
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,900
I really saw smoke.

550
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,340
Get in the car. You can talk about it in the police station.

551
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,300
Director Lin, we're leaving.

552
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:23,980
Okay. Thank you.

553
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,750
Okay.

554
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,380
Although nothing was on fire,

555
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,580
I looked around

556
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,100
and saw many flammable things at the door.

557
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,860
Clean them up.

558
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,700
They may cause a fire.

559
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,020
We'll come back to check it in a few days.

560
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,620
Okay.

561
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,300
Okay. Thank you.

562
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,140
Thank you.

563
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,220
Let's go.

564
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,500
Let's go.

565
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,070
Let's go in.

566
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,180
Hey!

567
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,900
What's wrong?

568
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,340
Thank you.

569
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,260
For what?

570
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,740
Thank you for helping us.

571
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,580
It's just our job.

572
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,340
You're welcome.

573
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,540
Director Lin.

574
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,180
Are you done there?

575
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,500
We just wrapped it up.

576
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,420
What's going on?

577
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,620
We just received an urgent task.

578
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,940
Next to Hengtong Medicine Factory on Xinmin Road,

579
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,660
on sub-level one of a building,

580
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,380
someone got trapped.

581
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,700
We can't reach him on the phone.

582
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,020
Copy. We'll be right there.

583
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,940
Go to Xinmin Road.

584
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,580
Okay.

585
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:01,980

586
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,540
It's been tough for you recently.

587
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:03,610

[Cold Medicine]

588
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,780
Take good care of yourself.

589
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,420
Thank you.

590
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,030
How much do we need?

591
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,500
Actually, I can help.

592
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,350
I'm out of my depths.

593
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,980
What can you do?

594
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,620
There's a solution to every problem.

595
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,030
We'll figure something out.

596
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,420
Forget it.

597
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,860
We should part ways.

598
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:27,980
Dismiss the club.

599
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,100
Dream Dance has existed for so many years.

600
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,430
How can we part ways so easily?

601
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,180
Just hold on.

602
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,380
I can't.

603
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,620
We haven't made any money in the past few years.

604
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,740
So many members have left in the past few months.

605
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,980
But some stayed.

606
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
I can't

607
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,980
feed on passion,

608
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:44,900
can I?

609
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,340
How about this?

610
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,540
I'll find a way to get the money.

611
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,510
We'll talk about it later.

612
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,870
Check your kits.

613
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,510
Fix this.

614
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,540
How are things with you?

615
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,300
Is everything clear?

616
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,540
This is plugged in.

617
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,060
Yang.

618
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,740
What's going on?

619
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,260
A junkman called us.

620
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,070
He came here to collect building materials

621
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,420
and fell down.

622
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,660
He called us for help

623
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,980
but got disconnected before he finished his words.

624
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,180
We called back but he didn't answer.

625
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,420
Is he…

626
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:28,820
Come on.

627
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,980
Take the rescue equipment.

628
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:31,900
He seems

629
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,580
the one who saved us.

630
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,540
Let's split up and find him.

631
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,100
Lin.

632
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,300
Are they new?

633
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,980
I picked them up on the way.

634
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,700
Don't chat during work.

635
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,380
Yes.

636
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,180
Check the kits again.

637
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,990
-Okay.
-Is anyone there?

638
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,540
-Look carefully.
-Is anybody there?

639
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,100
-Is anyone there?
-Is anyone there?

640
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,140
Is anyone there?

641
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,310
Is anyone there?

642
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,990
Is anyone there?

643
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,820
Is anyone there?

644
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,540
Hello?

645
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,940
Is anyone there?

646
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,700
Help!

647
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,860
Help!

648
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,700
I heard something.

649
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,940
I'm here.

650
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,820
Help me.

651
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,860
I'm here.

652
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,540
Can you hear me?

653
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,540
I'm here.

654
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
Help me

655
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,580
He's here.

656
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,940
Yang.

657
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,670
I heard his voice.

658
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,510
He's on sub-level one.

659
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,180
Sub-level one.

660
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,740
Copy.

661
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,300
Where is he?

662
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,180
Where is he?

663
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,660
There's sound here.

664
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,340
Here.

665
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,060
He's down there.

666
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,100
Lin, how's he?

667
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,620
Can you hear me?

668
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,060
Help me!

669
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,180
Did you hear him?

670
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,180
-He's down there.
-Yeah.

671
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,780
Get me the rope.

672
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,820
Yang.

673
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,860
Let me go down first.

674
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,780
Can you do it?

675
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,620
Yes.

676
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:43,820
Be careful.

677
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,660
The rope.

678
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,340
He's going down there?

679
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,580
How deep is it?

680
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,740
He's directly going down.

681
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,140
Hold tight.

682
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,740
Put the rope down slowly. Slowly.

683
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,820
Slow down.

684
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,820
-Down, down.
-Down.

685
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,620
-Don't worry. I got you.
-Don't worry.

686
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,220
Be careful.

687
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,100
Have you found him?

688
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,860
Are you okay?

689
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,580
He's slightly injured.

690
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,190
I'm untying my safety rope.

691
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,260
Don't untie the rope.

692
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,860
I'll send you another rope.

693
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,420
No need.

694
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,020
The water is not deep. I can handle it.

695
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,260
Here.

696
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,500
Be careful.

697
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:27,910
Okay.

698
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:28,750
Pull.

699
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,940
Pull the rope.

700
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,340
-Slowly.
-Slowly.

701
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,500
Good.

702
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,060
Pull slowly.

703
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,740
Watch your head.

704
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,580
Be careful.

705
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,220
Slowly.

706
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,780
Pull up.

707
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,460
Pull.

708
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,430
Pull the rope.

709
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,700
Pull the rope.

710
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,260
-Pull!
-Pull! Pull!

711
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:41,860
Pull.

712
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,670
-Liu!
-Liu!

713
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,100
-Don't panic.
-Pull him up first.

714
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,900
Make room!

715
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,820
I'll go down to get Liu.

716
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,420
Liu.

717
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,420
Three, two, one.

718
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,180
Watch your hands.

719
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,620
It's okay.

720
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,700
Thank you.

721
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,060
It's our job.

722
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,070
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

723
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,820
Send him to the hospital.

724
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,340
Hurry.

725
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,180
Thank you.

726
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,780
I'll wrap this up for you.

727
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,060
Go to the infirmary later.

728
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,660
Don't tell them what happened.

729
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,500
It's embarrassing.

730
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,820
I told you not to untie the rope.

731
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,150
You wouldn't have fallen if you had listened to me.

732
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,580
I was just worried about that guy.

733
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,660
Besides, who'd have known there's another level?

734
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,140
Lin,

735
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,580
you're my best friend.

I'll change my will after going back.

737
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,540
I'll give you all my game accounts.

738
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,260
What a generous gift.

739
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,860
Wrap it up, boys.

740
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,300
Wrap it up.

741
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:04,550
Let's go.

742
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,300
Come on.

743
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,660
Here.

744
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,340
Careful.

Guess

748
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,300
how many legs I sawed today?

749
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,860
Six.

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,100
Stop it, Dagang.

753
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,740
You're scaring them.

754
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,460
Six kids got stuck in toy cars.

755
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,020
We sawed open six toy cars.

756
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,060
Yu,

757
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,420
toys nowadays are dangerous.

758
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,540
My son seems to have a similar toy car.

759
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,910
I need to call my wife and tell her to put it away.

760
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,750
It's too dangerous.

761
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,180
Dear,

762
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,750
have you had dinner?

763
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,180
Well,

764
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,860
does our son have a toy car?

765
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,260
Yu,

766
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,460
you know what?

767
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,260
We almost got into trouble today.

768
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,380
What happened?

769
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,750
What happened?

770
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,100
Ask Liu.

771
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:08,780
Liu.

772
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,420
Yu.

773
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,420
Give my will back to me.

774
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,700
What? You want to revise it again?

775
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,420
I almost kicked the bucket today.

776
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,430
What happened?

777
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,780
I won't tell you. It's embarrassing.

778
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,060
I'll go grab a bite in the supply depot.

779
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,660
Is the will in your drawer?

780
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,580
Yes.

781
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,030
I'll get it myself.

782
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,700
Shao Yijiu, Qin Shiquan.

783
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:39,980
Yes.

784
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,100
Yes.

785
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,180
You've grown up.

786
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,300
Are you the man

787
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,460
who saved us in the earthquake?

788
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
Yu Qilei.

789
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,620
We'll be roommates in the future.

790
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,980
Deputy Yu is our best technician.

791
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,500
After the earthquake,

792
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,380
we went to lots of trouble

793
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,580
to make him join us.

794
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,460
He can teach you

795
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,660
lots of things.

796
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,460
Nice to meet you, Deputy Yu.

797
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,780
Nice to meet you, Deputy Yu.

798
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,980
Nice to meet you too. I'll leave you to your work.

799
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,100
It was the first time you were on a mission.

800
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,500
How do you feel?

801
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,990
It's okay.

802
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,300
It's fine that you're not used to it.

803
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:24,990
Get back to work.

804
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,900
-Yes.
-Yes.

805
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,470
Come on in.

806
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,180
This room is your dorm room.

807
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,100
Technically speaking,

808
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,710
you should live

809
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,380
with the combat units.

810
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,870
But to let you learn more from the veterans,

811
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,420
you'll live with Deputy Yu

812
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,980
and Assistant Liu.

813
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,460
Assistant Liu is the leader of Combat Unit One.

814
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,220
Cherish this opportunity to learn from them.

815
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,420
-Yes.
-Yes.

816
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,100
I'm leaving. Have a good rest.

817
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,670
Good night, Instructor.

818
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,750
Good night, Instructor.

819
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,260
I'll sleep here.

820
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,420
It's so good.

821
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,460
What are you thinking?

822
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,260
I don't know.

823
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,220
My mind is empty.

824
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,020
A firefighter almost died on our first day here.

825
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,820
It's thrilling.

826
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,420
Yes.

827
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,900
What a rocky start.

828
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,820
It's too much for me.

829
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,020
[Dorm Room 2]

830
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,820
Yes.
[Dorm Room 2]

831
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,030
[Dorm Room 2]

832
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,980
Get up!
[Dorm Room 2]

833
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,300
[Dorm Room 2]

834
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,020
It's too early
[Dorm Room 2]

835
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,060
[Dorm Room 2]

836
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,940
to be lying on the bed.
[Dorm Room 2]

837
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,140
[Dorm Room 2]

838
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,620
Don't you know
[Dorm Room 2]

839
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:40,660
[Dorm Room 2]

840
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:40,760
the dorm rules?
[Dorm Room 2]

841
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,430
the dorm rules?

842
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,220
Assistant Liu.

843
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,580
Sorry, Assistant Liu.

844
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,620
It's our first day here.

845
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,220
My name is Qin Shiquan.

846
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,260
His name is Shao Yijiu.

847
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,580
[Liu Ruyi's will]

848
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,570
I know. You went to Jingde Secondary School.
[Liu Ruyi's will]

849
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:58,700
I know. You went to Jingde Secondary School.

850
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,710
I held you once.

851
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,140
Assistant Liu.

852
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,100
What are you writing?

853
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,900
My will.

854
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,260
You two will write it too.

855
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,500
Sooner or later.

856
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,500
Assistant Liu.

857
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,020
It was so dangerous today.

858
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,140
Why is no one taking it seriously?

859
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,060
It happens a lot.

860
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,340
What?

861
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,140
Are you scared?

862
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,100
No.

863
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,540
Assistant Liu, we're ready.

864
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,420
Ready for what?

865
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,020
Ready to sacrifice our lives at any time.

866
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,260
Don't look like two martyrs.

867
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,820
You're firefighters, not soldiers at the front line.

868
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,230
Don't talk like your days are numbered.

869
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,060
If you don't cherish your own lives,

870
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,940
how can you save others?

871
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,980
You just need

872
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,740
to follow the orders given to you.

873
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,140
Just fulfilling your duties is hard enough.

874
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,710
Don't try to be a hero.

875
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,660
Good firefighters don't rush into danger.

876
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,150
I have a question.

877
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,340
Assistant Liu.

878
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,350
What makes a good firefighter?

879
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,900
When you completely understand my words,

880
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,060
you'll be a good firefighter.

881
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,580
Has Miaomiao's fever gone down?

882
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,430
Not completely.

883
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,540
How come? How long has it lasted?

884
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,430
This is bad.

885
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,710
In my opinion,

886
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,700
she should go to the hospital.

887
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,380
Take her to the hospital when you come back.

888
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,860
It's not the first time she's got sick.

889
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,140
It takes time for her to recover.

890
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,020
Don't worry.

891
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,910
How is your day?

892
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,380
We went out on a mission today.

893
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,390
Many kids' legs

894
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,860
got stuck in toy cars.

895
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,180
It was so dangerous.

896
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:48,740
Miaomiao

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,380

Miaomiao

898
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:49,420
[Milan, Yu Qilei's wife]

899
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,460
needs to be careful
[Milan, Yu Qilei's wife]

900
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,380
when she plays with her toy car.
[Milan, Yu Qilei's wife]

901
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,100
[Milan, Yu Qilei's wife]

902
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,360
You'd better put it away.
[Milan, Yu Qilei's wife]

903
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,430
You'd better put it away.

904
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,780
I see.

905
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,740
Miaomiao said

906
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,140
that she wants you to take her to the amusement park.

907
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,140
I told her you'll do it when you come back

908
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,220
as long as she takes the pills and behaves well.

909
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,860
Will you come back this week?

910
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,260
I'm afraid I can't come back this month.

911
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,420
It's my turn to take a leave

912
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,660
but Dagang's mother-in-law is in hospital.

913
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,310
He needs to visit her.

914
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,060
We're short-handed.

915
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,620
So I'll take his place.

916
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,500
But don't worry.

917
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,740
As long as he comes back,

918
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,820
I'll go home

919
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,740
and take Miaomiao to the amusement park.

920
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,300
Have you thought about

921
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,340
what my dad said?

922
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,820
Well,

923
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,500
we'll talk about it later.

924
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,060
What do you mean?

925
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,990
Dad has talked with them.

926
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,420
They're very satisfied with your resume

927
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,300
and want to hire you as a structural engineer.

928
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,070
If you agree,

929
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,580
you'll be safer

930
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,860
and have more time for Miaomiao

931
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,820
and a higher salary

932
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,300
than working as a firefighter.

933
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,020
Say something.

934
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,420
What do you think?

935
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,620
I know.

936
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,100
I'll think about it.

937
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,740
Make up your mind as soon as possible.

938
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,500
They won't wait for you forever.

939
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,180
I hope you can think about it carefully.

940
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,780
This morning,

941
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,980
when I took Miaomiao to the hospital,

942
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,940
she said she wanted you to take her

943
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,940
instead of me.

944
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,380
She said her teacher asked them

945
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,990
to write about the things they did with their father.

946
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,820
But she couldn't think of anything she did with you.

947
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,340
I know.

948
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,590
You love your job.

949
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,020
But this is not for me.

950
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,220
It's for your daughter,

951
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Yu Miaomiao.

952
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,740
Tell me when Miaomiao's fever goes down.

953
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,460
Sorry for letting you take care of her all alone.

954
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,540
Have a good rest.

955
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,220
You too.

956
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,540
I took today off

957
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,580
and got lots of work to do.

958
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,100
By the way,

959
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,100
don't skip meals when you're busy.

960
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,260
I won't.

961
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,620
Well,

962
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,500
have you received the ointment I sent you?

963
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,020
Remember to use it.

964
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,220
They all say it works well.

965
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,420
I see.

966
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,510
Lastly,

967
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,580
take a look at your daughter and go to bed.

968
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,660
Bye.

969
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,340

970
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,300

971
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,540
Yeah.

972
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,860
I want

973
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,540
to ask you for a favor.

974
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,100
It's been weighing on me.

975
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,620
What's it?

976
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,540
It's my turn to take a leave this week,

977
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,980
but I don't know what to do with my time.

978
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,980
I want you to have two days off for me.

979
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,500
I'll take your leave next time.

980
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,540
What do you think?

981
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,740
Thank you.

982
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,950
Don't thank me. I'm asking you for a favor.

983
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,310

-Yeah.

[Tips for Fire Safety]

1098
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,180
The fire department

1099
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,340
doesn't charge for responding to emergency calls,

1100
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,580
but there are penalties

1101
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,940
for making unnecessary calls

1102
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,380

Hence,

1104
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,940
I call on everyone

1105
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,220
not to casually dial

1106
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,220

Falsely reporting a fire

1108
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,060

1109
