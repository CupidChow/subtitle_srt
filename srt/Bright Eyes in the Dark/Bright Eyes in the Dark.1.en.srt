They said you were at the epicenter.

174
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,860
They couldn't reach you.

175
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,220
I thought I'd never see you again.

177
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,620
Don't worry.

178
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,900
I’ve been evacuated to a safe place.

179
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,660
When I get back,

180
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,580
let's take the wedding photos.

181
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,780
Can you hear

182
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,580
a kid singing?

183
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,010
Captain Meng.

184
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,020
I keep hearing a kid singing.

185
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,740
Remember this voice.

186
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,820
But don't be distracted by it.

187
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,020
The next 48 hours are very important.

188
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,820
Let's save one first.

189
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,020
And then another.

190

We'll save them one by one.

191

One, two, three!

202

Slow down.

203
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,690
Slow down.

204
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,460
Don't worry about me!

205
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,890
Pull the child out first!

206
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,060
Hurry up.

207
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,420
Get out quickly.

208
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,130

A kid is singing.

He keeps singing.

230
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,660
He's still singing.

231
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,420
Someone must still be buried there,

We are their last hope.

I have to find him.

235
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,460
I must save him.

236
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,980
Do you hear it?

237
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,540
-Yes. -Yes.

238
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,740
This is it.

239
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,140
Get the equipment.

Keep singing!

247
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,180
The structure inside is unstable.

248
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,060
The entrance can only be this big.

249
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,380
The space is too small.

250
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,620
Only one person can go in.

251
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,260
I'll go in with the rope.

252
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,740
We'll do the support protection.

253
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,730
Clear the entrance.

254
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,820
Here, the rope.

255
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,900
Give me the stay bar.

256
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,860
Be careful.

257
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,580
Stabilize that side too.

258
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,340
Be careful.

259
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,900
Use bricks to protect that supporting joint.

260
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,580
Come, give me a hand.

261
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,820
Go!

262
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,020
Be careful.

263
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,740
Watch your head.

Be careful.

265
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,100
If the point of force loosens,

266
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,020

She's good.

I need to cut something off you.

285
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,450
It'll hurt a little. Hang in there.

286

If I didn't pull you out,

you would be buried inside.

If you had given me five more seconds,

330
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,970

who was also my mentor,

347
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,410
told me something.

He said, Jianfei,

349
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,680
you must be mentally prepared today.

350
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,530
You might have done nothing wrong.

351
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,010
But in the end,

352
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,050
you would still feel helpless.

353
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,410
But you can't stop to feel disappointed.

354
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,410
You have to stand up

355
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,530
and continue your work.

It's okay for ordinary people

to dwell on their emotions.

359
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,690
But it's too extravagant

360

for rescue personnel like us.

they entered the epicenter zone.

386

Seven aftershocks have occurred near the epicenter.

421
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,690
That day,

422
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,730
you were obviously out of control.

423
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,570
Today, in front of everyone,

424
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,090

I don’t need your apology.

Captain Meng,

430
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,850
I think this rescue mission

431
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,050
revealed a lot of problems.

432
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,690
The lack of training preparation,

433
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,530
lack of technical equipment,

434
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,130
and some members at the scene

435
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,690
obviously lacked self-protection awareness.

436
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,410
He ignored the objective environment,

437
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,930
was reckless,

438
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,090
and blindly conducted rescues.

439
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,530
He should reflect on himself.

440
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,570
What do you mean?

441
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,770
I mean it literally.

442
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,330
Rescue

443
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,680
is about teamwork.

444
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,490
If you had listened to me that day

445
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,010
and given me a few seconds, even if I died,

446
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,570
that kid would have been saved.

447
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,850
Let's not talk about whether you can do it or not.

448
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,890
What I want to say today is,

449
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,930
our duty is to conduct scientific and reasonable rescues,

450
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,170
not a life for a life.

451
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,890
Our duty is to protect the people

452
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,290
and prepare to sacrifice at any time.

453
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,080
If everyone shuns danger like you,

454
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,410
what do they have us for?

455
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,930
What can the people depend on you for?

456
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,850

with the idea of life for life every time,

461
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,450

462

what can we do to protect ourselves?

701

to shelter in place during the quake

703
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,340

If you're on high floors and can't get out of the building,

710
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,350
you should seek shelter in bathrooms,
