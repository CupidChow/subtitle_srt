182
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,200
You're still unwilling to say it to save face.

183
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,570
If you don't say it, I will.

184
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,690
My daughter used to be a good girl.

185
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,640
But she got a boyfriend in college.

186
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,440
That brat

187
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,810
turned my daughter into a disobedient girl.

188
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,570
She wouldn't tell us anything after that.

189
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,360
Okay, I got it.

190
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,250
Now.

191
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
You can come up with me,

192
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,520
but don't get emotional.

193
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,690
Also, don't say anything when you get up there.

194
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,680
We'll take care of this.

195
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,210
Okay?

196
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,210
All right.

197
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,760
I'm bringing her parents upstairs.

198
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,440
You two stay here.

199
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,010
-Don't go up.
-Director Lin.

200
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,680
Come up immediately.

201
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,450
Coming.

202
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,570
Ask the police about the situation,

203
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,210
and ask Liu to go up and have a try first.

204
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,000
He's experienced.

205
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:51,410
[Dangerous behavior. Please cherish your life.]

207
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,130
What happened exactly?

208
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,320
Tell me about it.

209
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,680
I'll listen carefully.

210
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,210
How about this?

211
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,890
Let's not talk about unhappy things.

212
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,210
Let's talk about something relaxing

213
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,880
and pleasant.

214
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,440
Look, the wind is quite strong now.

215
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,450
Are you thirsty?

216
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,680
Let me get you a bottle of water.

217
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,210
Okay?

218
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,490
Dagang.

219
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,400
Bring me a bottle of water.

220
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,090
Yes!

221

Hurry up. Bring me the water.

Hurry.

223
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,330
Don't come over.

224
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:32,800
Okay!

225
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,320
I won't come over!

Look.

230
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,090
I'm really trying to get you water.

231
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm worried about you.

232
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,800
Let me know if you're thirsty.

233
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,330
I'll pass it to you.

234
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,480
But don't worry.

235
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,850
I won't come near you.

236
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,690
I won't touch you.

Put the knife down first.

239
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,290
It's dangerous.

240
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,840
Wait here for a while.

241
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,400
Don't get emotional.

242
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,440
I'll go check.

243
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,200
Tell me which one you like.

244
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,810
I'll ask that person to call you.

245

-Go and replace Liu.

Tell me about it.

253
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,690
This is Dagang.

254
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,090
He's close to those celebrities.

255
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,480
Let him tell you some funny stories.

256
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,810
I need to go to the toilet.

[Sun Meng. She likes pink and sky blue. Good at math.]

262
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,490
And I've checked.

263
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,920
The building is too high and the wind is too strong.

264
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,320
The estimated landing area is too wide.

265
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,490
The air cushion is basically useless.

266
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
Besides, the windows are too far from the rooftop.

267
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,690
They can't get up here that way.

268
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,690
The only way

269
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,320
is to confront her head-on.

270
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,050
It won't work.

271
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,210
Do you see the knife in her hand?

272
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,090
When I approached her head-on,

273
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,960
she put the knife up near her aorta.

274
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,330
If we confront her head-on,

275
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,450
I'm afraid she'll hurt herself.

276
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
That would be troublesome.

277
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,440
There's no other way now.

278
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,320
That's the only way.

279

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,050
and care about you, right?

370
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,840
How about this?

371
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,680
Come down.

372
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,210
I'll take you to see him and

373
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,330
help you two make up.

374
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,970
How's that?

375
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,320
Besides,

376
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,960
we won't let your parents know about this.

377
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,730
It'll only be between the two of us.

378
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,690
Liar.

379
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,490
You'll leave after your mission is completed.

380
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,610
I would become a dog if I lied to you.

381
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,410
I'm Liu Ruyi, Assistant Director of Heping Road Special Division Station.

382
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,560
If I can't do it,

383
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,200
call 119 and make a complaint about me.

384
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,680
We'll do it the tough way if the soft approach doesn't work.

385
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,400
I'll tie him up, bring him to you,

386
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,970
-and force him to make up with you, okay?
-There's hope.

387
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,690
But Sun Meng,

388
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,080
you have to cooperate with us first.

389
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,810
How about this?

390
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,090
Cooperate with me and

391
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,200
come down first.

392
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,210
I'm stupid.

393
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,840
Tell me

394
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,970
what happened

395
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,850
between you and Tao,

396
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,600
and we'll discuss it together, okay?

397
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,840
Come down.

398
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,690
Liu is good.

399
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:21,610
Meng!

400
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:22,690
Meng!

401
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,320
Come down now!

402
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,810
-How can you do this to us?
-Go back!

403
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,170
What did I do to you?

404
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,280
Don't come over!

405
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,200
Leave!

406
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,680
I don't want to see you!

407
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Don't come over!

408
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,290
Leave!

409
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,810
I don't want to see you!

410
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,560
Okay!

411
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,690
We won't come over!

412
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,410
What a nuisance.

413
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,920
Sun Meng, Sun Meng, I'm sorry.

414
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,440
I didn't know they would come up.

415
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,080
Let's forget about them.

416
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,800
Tell me if you need anything.

417
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,480
I'll help you solve it, okay?

418
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,680
It can't be solved.

419
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,440
No, no.

420
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,680
It can be solved.

421
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,330
Sun Meng！

422
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,610
Sun Meng.

423
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,560
Sun Meng.

424
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,440
Sun Meng.

425
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,570
Look.

426
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,280
You know this, right?

427
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,090
Chi's BBQ.

428
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,320
You ate there, right?

429
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,480
Take it.

430
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,090
Okay.

431
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,440
Try some.

432
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,680
It smells really good.

433
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,090
I carried it all the way up here.

434
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,730
It smells so good. I'm craving it.

435
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,090
Have a kabob, too.

436
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:24,400
Here.

437
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Don't come over.

438
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:28,720
No.

439
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,440
I just want to give you a kabob.

440
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,320
Don't be so wary of us.

441
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,090
We're here to save you.

442
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,090
We have no other intentions.

443
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,160
Don't you want some?

444
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
If you don't want it,

445
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
I'll try it first.

446
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,400
The lamb is really good.

447
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:47,680
It's fat but not greasy.

448
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,450
Try one.

449
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,850
I'll pass.

450
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,730
What is this?

451
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,330
Gristle.

452
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,050
The gristle is really good.

453
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:58,730
You know what?

454
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,920
I dare say

455
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,200
this is the tastiest chicken gristle

456
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,080
in Beixun.

457
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,810
When I was in college,

458
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,800
I loved these too.

459
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,560
I'd ask a few classmates

460
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,800
and friends out

461
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,210
to have kabobs

462
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,290
with several beers

463
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,800
in BBQ restaurants.

464
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,570
It felt so great.

465
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,960
Drink it.

466
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,490
It's your turn.

467
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,930
You lost. Drink it.

468
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,080
You're cheating.

469
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,810
Sun Meng.

470
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,560
Chi's BBQ.

471
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,840
You, your classmates and boyfriend

472
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:30,960
went there a lot, right?

473
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,170
How do you know?

474
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,450
You wrote it on your suicide note.

475
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
I read your suicide note.

476
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,680
I searched it online

477
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,810
and found this restaurant.

478
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,290
I sent someone to buy some

479
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,200
for you to eat.

480
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,160
I don't know you at all.

481
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,320
Why did you do that?

482
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,090
I want to get to know you.

483
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,560
We all want to.

484
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,690
Yes.

485
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,770
We all want to get to know you.

486
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,130
Actually,

487
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,050
I can understand.

488
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,970
You college students

489
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,680
are quite tired.

490
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,970
You have classes in the day,

491
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,720
and you have to do your homework

492
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,640
back home at night.

493
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,690
Your boyfriend would say,

494
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,840
stop writing,

495
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,850
let's go out for a movie

496
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,050
and a walk.

497
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,520
You'd watch a movie happily.

498
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,290
After that, you got hungry.

499
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,050
You'd take a walk

500
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,530
to that familiar BBQ restaurant.

501
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,680
The boss knows you.

502
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,970
You'd sit down and have fun

503
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,450
eating barbecue.

504
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,600
How happy that would be.

505
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,450
There're lots of good memories, right?

506
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,530
Are you really willing to leave all that behind?

507
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,200
Sun Meng.

508
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,770
You're only 18.

509
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,640
Think about it.

510
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,440
Life is so long.

511
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,450
You've only got this far.

512
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,240
You're 18 years old.

513
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,370
Minus the few years

514
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,000
when you were an infant

515
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,170
and you couldn't remember anything.

516
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,360
And minus the nine years of compulsive education

517
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,600
in primary school and junior high.

518
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,290
You've just started your social life.

519
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,170
If you give up now,

520
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,680
it won't be worth it.

521
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,280
Life is beautiful.

522
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,050
The world is so vast.

523
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,040
Sometimes, we can't even explore all of it with our whole life.

524
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,960
Not to mention at such a young age,

525
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,090
right?

526
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,650
There are various things you'll experience

527
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,930
in life.

528
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,480
Good and bad,

529
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,290
sour and bitter.

530
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,030
You'll have to taste everything.

531
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,250
Because this is our life.

532
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,130
In the end, I'll finish my life step by step.

533
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,890
No one can interfere.

534
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,130
I don't need

535
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,210
to live according to anyone else's plan.

536
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,240
Right?

537
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:42,920
Of course.

538
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,920
You were too young before,

539
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,010
so your parents needed to take care of you.

540
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,760
But now you've grown up.

541
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,130
You're an adult.

542
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,920
You'll need

543
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,530
to measure this world

544
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,720
with your own feet step by step,

545
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,760
and observe it little by little,

546
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,040
to find the beauties of this world.

547
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:01,960
Sun Meng.

548
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,600
Do you remember my promise to you?

549
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,120
It's not only valid for now.

550
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:09,720
Forever.

551
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,730
It'll be valid forever.

552
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,490
No matter what difficulties you encounter in the future,

553
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,480
in love,

554
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:17,960
in life,

555
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,490
or in your studies.

556
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,520
Well, I may not be able to solve the difficulties in your studies.

557
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,770
Anyway, whenever you're in trouble,

She's already very upset.

620

Shouldn't you reflect on yourselves

621

Some parents gave birth to their children,

643
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,520
but they don't really love them.

644
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,540

It's not that Sun Meng doesn't want to listen to them.

She just wants her parents to understand her.

that she had depression,

00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,200
The game of life is too difficult.

743
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,480
I've decided to delete my account and quit.

744
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,040
If there's an afterlife,

745
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,270
let me be a dandelion.

746
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,580
Friends.

747
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,240
Good night.

748
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,780
I feel like

749
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,220
you're taking Sun Meng's incident

750
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,150
pretty hard.

751
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,490
Right?

752
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,260
Why is that?

753
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,790
Although our families' situation is different,

754
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,480
I'm way too familiar with that kind of feeling.

755
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,690
Your experience may be similar,

756
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,750
but your lives won't necessarily be.

757
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,810
The past can't be changed,

758
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,840
but the future can.

759
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,440
I trust you.

760
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,740
Come on.

761
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,200
Sun Meng.

762
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,600
Don't move.

763
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,530
Don't move. No matter what it is,

764
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,550
we can help you, okay?

765
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:22,510
Sun Meng.

766
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,810
Don't! Don't jump!

767
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,980
Don't pull me!

768
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,020
You didn't sleep well, did you?

769
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,780
I had dreams all night.

770
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,180
You dreamed of that little boy again?

771
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,090
It's been so many years,

772
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,330
and you still haven't let it go.

773
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,140
You never say it,

774
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,280
but you

775
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,920
take it harder than anyone else.

776
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,140
There are things that can be forgotten,

777
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,620
and there are things

778
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,970
that you simply can't let go.

779
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,620
What do you think about what happened yesterday?

780
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
What can I think?

781
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,270
Upsetting.

782
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,250
We couldn't do anything to help.

783
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,910
Now who I'm most worried about

784
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,500
is Yijiu and Shiquan.

785
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,780
They just started working here,

786
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,750
and this happened.

787
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,590
I think

788
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,820
we should talk to them.

789
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,010
Yes.

790
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,780
Go talk to them.

791
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,050
You are the instructor.

792
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,100
This is your job.

793
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,300
You should go get the overall situation first.

794
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,310
And then I'll provide guidance from the side,

795
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,280
right?

796
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,670
You have to put your effort

797
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,270
into educating the kids.

798
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,340
Let's go have dinner.

799
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,510
I'm not going.

800
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,120
Who are you texting?

801
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,230
I left a comment under Sun Meng's post yesterday, right?

802
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,250
Our identities were revealed early this morning.

803
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,420
And there are a bunch of comments criticizing us.

804
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,780
Why are they criticizing us?

805
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,530
Look.

806
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,930
They said we commented to ride the wave of her,

807
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,540
we were not professional,

808
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,220
and our tone was too tough.

809
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,530
He must be bored to death.

810
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,750
Isn't that just an afterthought?

811
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,540
Yes.

812
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,450
And you are replying to them one by one?

813
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,340
What else can I do?

814
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,900
Don't you always want to make short videos?

815
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,770
What do you mean?

816
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,460
Scooch over a bit.

817
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:00,670
Right.

818
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,980
Okay?

819
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,450
Yes.

820
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,090
Action.

821
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,330
Hello, everyone.

822
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,550
We are the firefighters who left comments under Sun Meng's posts.

823
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,740
We also participated in the rescue work.

824
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,580
As for the doubts online,

825
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,840
I have some explanations to make.

826
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:17,940
First,

827
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,530
I'm not an Internet celebrity.

828
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,540
So I don't need to ride the wave of her.

829
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,510
I'm just an ordinary firefighter.

830
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:23,810
Second,

831
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,910
as for your doubt about the professionalism of our rescue work,

832
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,430
I want to say

833
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,690
the whole process complies with regulations.

834
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,330
Third,

835
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,100
as for those who said Sun Meng was too dramatic,

836
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,820
I just want to ask you,

837
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,790
have you ever learned about depression?

838
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,970
Have you ever paid attention

839
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,610
to those who suffer from depression around you?

840
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,000
Depression is not about being dramatic.

841
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,140
It's an actual illness.

842
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,610
We want to say,

843
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,040
don't leave comments on things you don't understand.

844
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,180
We also hope that all the patients suffering from depression

845
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,020
can have the courage

846
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,690
and power

847
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,660
to overcome the illness.

848
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:53,840
That's all we want to say.

849
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:54,890
Thank you.

850
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,690
Thank you.

851
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:58,800
Hello, everyone.

852
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,030
We are the firefighters who left comments under Sun Meng's posts.

853
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,210
-We also participated in the rescue work.
-Post it?

854
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,060
As for the doubts online,

855
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,230
I have some explanations to make.

856
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,160
Post it.

857
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,180
Kid,

858
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,350
are you mistaken?

859
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
This is my piano room.

860
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,030
I'm not.

861
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,670
This is my piano room.

862
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,190
Lin Qi.

863
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,990
You're here too.

864
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:29,840
Look.

865
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,200
The kid who collaborated with you last time

866
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,890
has officially got signed by our company.

867
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,240
This will be his piano room.

868
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,850
Then where should I go for practice?

869
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,030
Find somewhere.

870
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,170
The place is huge.

871
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,850
Of course you can find somewhere to practice piano.

872
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,530
Film him.

873
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,540
From this angle...

874
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,380
They're coming.

875
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,020
Watch your mouth.

876
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,070
Don't get caught.

877
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,390
Fellas.

878
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,480
You reported a fire, right?

879
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,030
Yes.

880
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,200
We did.

881
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,040
Where's the fire?

882
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,050
It was in this field.

883
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:44,640
Right there.

884
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,700
But you came too late.

885
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,430
We've put it out ourselves.

886
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,180
Yes, we've put it all out.

887
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,190
Deputy Yu.

888
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,950
It's obvious that there has never been a fire.

889
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,680
How could you say that, young man?

890
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,600
What do you mean?

891
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,740
Are you saying that we made a fire report

892
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,170
for nothing?

893
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,930
We are firefighters.

894
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,610
We can tell

895
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,820
whether there has been a fire or not at a glance.

896
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,130
There has been no fire at all.

897
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,220
Enough.

898
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,230
Were your eyes refined in Lord Lao Zi's alchemy furnace

899
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,540
like Monkey King?

900
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,880
Is it up to you whether there was a fire or not?

901
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,060
I'm sorry.

902
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,060
He didn't mean that.

903
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,870
He was reporting to our Deputy Director that

904
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:14,920
there was no open flame detected.

905
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,050
It's not like what you said.

906
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:16,890
Yes.

907
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,120
So you won't take care of it since there's no open flame?

908
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,590
Of course we will, fellas.

909
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:21,720
I'm sorry.

910
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,150
These two young men

911
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,540
are new here, so they are immature.

912
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,130
It's good, right?

913
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,060
First, there's no fire.

914
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,020
Second, no one got hurt, right?

915
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,790
Look.

916
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,560
This firefighter is reasonable.

917
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,490
He must be a leader.

918
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,000
Leader.

919
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,340
You two kids.

920
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,050
Watch and learn.

921
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,690
Alright, fellas.

922
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,410
Since everything is settled,

923
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,420
we'll leave now.

924
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,140
You can't leave.

925
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,410
You've come all the way here

926
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,090
with all the water.

927
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,940
It'll be a waste of fuel if you just drive back like this.

928
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,440
Exactly.

929
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,540
Just water the fields for us.

930
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,430
Fellas.

931
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,360
We're firefighters.

932
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,420
Our duty is to put out the fire and save lives.

933
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,230
Irrigation

934
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,540
is not within our competence.

935
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,630
I'm really sorry.

936
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,180
I'm sorry.

937
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,060
It's no trouble at all.

938
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,650
Just water it for us.

939
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,080
Just get the pipe out

940
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,260
and water it for us. What harm can it do?

941
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,520
What are you doing?

942
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,950
Aren't you acting like rascals?

943
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,170
What did you say?

944
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,200
Why can't you water the fields for us? You've already brought the water here.

948
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,070
Director! Emergency!

949
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,160
The villagers are attacking us.

950
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,210
Come right now!

951
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,220
I'll be right there.

952
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,090
Calm down, okay?

953
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,430
Stop it.

954
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,320
The firefighters are hitting us.

955
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,020
Why do you two look so familiar?

956
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,680
Aren't you the two firefighters

957
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,200
that posted the video saying Sun Meng's death is a pity?

958
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,110
You have time to barge in others' business.

959
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,880
Why can't you water the fields for us?

960
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:55,740
Be careful!

961
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,120
Get up, uncle!

962
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,510
I can't stand it anymore.

963
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,610
Stop it!

964
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,390
No violence!

965
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:07,600
No violence!

966
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,360
Move!

967
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,410
No violence!

968
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,960
Stop it!

969
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,110
Enough!

970
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,490
Don't get physical, young man.

971
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,050
Don't frame him.

972
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,180
You hit us!

973
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,360
We have body-worn cameras.

974
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,530
There's real-time audio and video recording.

975
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,410
It was all recorded.

976
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,130
You have cameras, so what?

977
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,140
You started it.

978
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,520
Call the police.

979
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,160
Just call the police. So what?

980
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,080
We aren't afraid of the police.

981
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,010
They hit me first.

982
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,020
I got beaten first, okay?

983
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,320
Let me make it clear.

984
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,540
If you really need help,

985
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,690
firefighters will definitely help you at a call.

986
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,410
We're here to put out fires,

987
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,960
not to fight.

988
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,680
This is a false alarm.

989
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,950
It's illegal, you know?

990
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,050
It's occupying public resources.

991
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,650
If you really need help watering the fields,

992
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,040
call the Command Center and make it clear.

993
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,090
You can't make a false alarm.

994
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,400
So we just call 119, and people will come to water the fields for us?

995
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,890
But it depends.

996
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,320
You can't make a call every time you need to water the fields.

997
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,370
Comrade.

998
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,470
You are their leader, right?

999
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,040
You have nothing to lose.

1000
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,590
We've also gone through a lot of trouble.

1001
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:04,600
I think

1002
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,110
we should each take a step back

1003
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:07,410
and let it go.

1004
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,010
No, uncle.

1005
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,600
Let's not take a step back.

1006
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,490
We've already called the police.

1007
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,370
They will be here soon.

1008
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,220
Let's make it clear

1009
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,310
in front of the police, okay?

1010
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,110
You really called the police?

1011
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,320
Fine.

1012
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,500
We'll wait here.

1013
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,260
We'll wait.

1014
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,410
So what?

1015
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,180
The firefighters hit us.

1016
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,820
It's nothing.

1017
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,790
Does it hurt?

1018
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,720
-Be gentle.
-Does it hurt?

1027

and cooperate with our investigation.

1028
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,040
Okay.

1030
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,150
Cooperate with the director to put things straight.

1031
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,120
You can drive my truck later.

1032
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,260
Okay, don't worry.

1033
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,060
We'll go back now.

1034
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,070
-See you.
-Okay.

1035
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,050

As for the doubts online,

1041
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,160
I have some explanations to make.

1042
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:16,540
Delete it.

1043
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:17,800
Or it may cause trouble.

1044
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,570

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,660

How should we treat a burn?

1070
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,430
First,

1071
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,900
make sure the skin is intact,

1072
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,910
and check if there's any swelling.

1073
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,430
If not,

1074
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,690
you can hold the area

1075
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:17,990
under cool running water,

1076
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,580
or soak it in cool water

1077
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,590
until it doesn't hurt.

1078
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,570
If there're already large areas

1079
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,120
of burns on the patient's skin,

1080
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,800
first,

1081
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,440
the patient should lie down quickly.

1082
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,910
Lift the wound

1083
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,510
and check if there are any other hidden wounds.

1084
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,610
If the conditions are convenient,

1085
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,460
you can apply thick disinfectant dressings

1086
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,220
to the surface of the wounds

1087
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,480
for protection.

1088
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,420
Don't try to remove

1089
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,090
the clothes that got stuck to the wounds.

1090
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,980
Don't apply any ointment or pharmaceutical product

1091
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,710
to the wound without the doctor's advice.

1092
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,510
Don't pop any blisters.

1093
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,440
And don't blow on the abrasions

1094
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,700
to avoid contamination.

1095

In case of emergency,

1096
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,600
please send the patient to the hospital immediately.
