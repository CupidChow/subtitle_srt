you recognize me as your master,

107
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,420
the first thing

108
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,320
will be to test your adaptability.

You've only been here for a few years.

117
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,670
Do you think you can be his master?

118
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,220

So what?

121
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,550
Even though he was a director, he has to start from the very beginning after he came here, right?

122
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,310
I came here at least 5 years earlier than him.

123
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,910
Why can't I teach him?

124
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,660
Okay.

125
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,670
I can do those things.

126
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,220
I can also take care of the vegetable garden.

127
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,990

128
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:20,960
Well...

129
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,980

130
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,080

131
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,550
you are not even familiar with the routes.

132
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,180
Well,

133
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,890
how should I guide you?

134
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,520
How should I teach you?

135
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,660
Right?

136
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,460
Then I'll get familiar with the routes first.

137
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,320
Then get familiar with the routes first.

Thanks to my persistence,

157
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,200
my unit leader finally agreed to teach me how to recognize the routes.

158
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,720
The route in the south usually has many trees and grass.

159
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,780
It's easy to grow moss on the route in the north.

160
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,300
I can recognize the routes easily.

161
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,810
But that's far from enough.

162
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,870
The forest is too complicated.

163
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,470

192
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,740
Please tell me your specific location.

193
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:09,880
Hello?

194
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,770
Hello?

195
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,530
I don't know.

196
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,840
Is there any reference object near you?

197
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,770
There's a Guanyin portrait.

198
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,860
What?

199
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,870
A Guanyin portrait.

200
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,220
A Guanyin portrait, right?

201
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,430
Okay.

202
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,320
Anything else?

203
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,540
We are tourists. We don't know this place.

204
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,420
Anything.

205
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,640
Anything is okay.

206
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,410
Moss.

207
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,710
The rocks are covered with moss.

208
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,420
Moss.

209
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:31,680
A lot of rocks.

210
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,150
Okay.

211
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,830
Don't hang up.

212
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,170

Hello, Instructor.

220
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,660
What's wrong?

221
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,500
Captain Zhao,

222
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,890
several tourists are trapped in the mountain.

223
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,520
They need help.

224
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,620
Okay. Roger that.

225
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,270
Hello?

226
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,060

[Child Giving Guanyin Pool]

228
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,550
The Guanyin Pool.

229
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,720
Oh no.

230
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,270
It's gonna rain tonight.

231
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,660
If it rains heavily,

232
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,790
we won't be able to go into the mountain.

233
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,440
Let's go.

234
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,280
Let's go back to the camp.

235
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,370
Let's go.

236
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,300
Captain.

237
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,540
I can't find him.

238
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,420
The instructor

239
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,760
is so stupid.

240
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,900
How dare he go out alone?

241
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,510
He's afraid that the people trapped would be in danger.

242
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,660
So he left before he could wait for us to come back.

243
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:14,920
Well,

244
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,810
the problem is he doesn't even know the way.

245
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,150
Can he recognize the routes?

246
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,130
He must have lost his way.

247
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,140
Listen to me.

248
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,320
Wang Ben,

249
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,880
go up the mountain on foot from Huafeng Hill with Unit 1.

250
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:26,720
Take the route in the west.

251
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,890
See if you can find them.

252
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,480
Yes.

253
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,790
Everyone in Unit 2, drive up the mountain

254
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,300
and search for the people trapped with all your strength.

255
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,280
Baohua, stay here and wait for news.

256
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,080
Yes.

257
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,060
Go inside first. Go inside first.

258
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,400
Sir, thank you.

259
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,660
I'll give you a ticket

260
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,170
and take you down the mountain.

261
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:47,760
Thank you. Thank you.

262
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,400
You can't go into mountains on a rainy day.

263
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,280
It's too dangerous.

264
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,290
Thank you so much.

265
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,640
Are you going on a mission?

266
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,530
No.

267
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,500
We just came back.

268
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,290
We're waiting for you to have dinner.

269
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,680
Have dinner?

270
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,690
You eat first.

271
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,070
I'm taking them to keep a record.

272
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,120
Okay.

273
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,270
Thank you.

274
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,300
We'll wait for you to eat together.

275
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:28,830
Captain Zhao,

276
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,890
I'm sorry.

277
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,070
I should have waited for you

278
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,160
to go together.

279
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,260
But it was about to rain.

280
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,530
I was afraid it would rain heavily at night

281
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,240
and it would be too late.

282
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,420
So I went there first.

283
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:39,880
What?

284
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,400
Your judgment is very accurate.

285
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,250
How did you find that place?

286
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,770
The person who called the police said

287
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,200
there is a Guanyin portrait there.

288
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,170
And the surrounding rocks are covered with moss.

289
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,890
So I thought they must be in the north.

290
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,950
There's only one Guanyin Cave facing north

291
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,790
in Lushan.

292
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,130
So I went there directly.

293
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,310
Well,

294
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,160
have you really memorized the map?

295
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,380
No.

296
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,300
There is too much information.

297
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,520
I just tried my best to memorize it.

298
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,710
Look.

299
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,890
Look at him.

300
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,920
Good.

301
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,830
What happened to your foot?

302
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,520
I think it's blistered.

303
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:54,510
Come on.

304
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,190
Have a foot bath first

305
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,840
and then apply this.

306
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:05,770
Come on.

307
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,530
Stop looking.

308
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,170
You definitely have never seen this before.

309
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,140
An old hunter on the top of the mountain

310
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,400
made this.

311
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,790
Our feet are important

312
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,590
because we walk in the mountain frequently.

313
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,900
If there are blisters,

314
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,160
just apply it and you can heal.

315
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,500
Okay.

316
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:25,890
Thanks.

317
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,560
It's hot.

318
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,070
Hot?

319
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,240
It's okay.

320
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,290
It won't be so hot soon.

321
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,830
Instructor,

322
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,760
I'm sorry.

323
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,290
I shouldn't have said that to you.

324
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:46,550
I went too far.

325
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,940
Well,

326
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,180
you said you want to learn from us.

327
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,400
Were you serious?

328
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,280
Of course.

329
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,590
Do you want to teach me?

330
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,900
I can teach you.

331
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,530
Fine.

332
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,290
From today on,

333
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,550
you are my master.

334
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,390
No. No. No.

335
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,400
That's not what I meant.

336
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,070
What?

337
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,670
You don't think I'm qualified?

338
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,310
If you don't think I'm qualified,

339
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,660
I'll ask those men outside to be my master.

340
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,760
Today, I agree to be your master.

341
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,560
No one can talk me out of this.

342
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,770
From today on,

343
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,910
just tell me if you have any problems.

344
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,290
I'll handle them for you.

345
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,260
Okay.

346
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,650
Wait a minute.

347
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,410
I have a gift for you.

348
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,050
This is my treasure.

349
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,900
I'm giving it to you because you are special.

350
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,070
The ways of recognizing 1,000 common plants in the wild.

351
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,320
You've done a lot of notes.

352
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,160
Of course.

353
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,420
Everything is in it.

354
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,200
But I can't

355
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,920
read your handwriting.

356
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,420
It's okay.

357
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,560
I can translate them for you.

361
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,060
December 19, 1995.

362
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,270
It's cloudy.

363
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,370
It's the 258th day.

364
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,800
Sir,

365
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,280
I told you about the modified shovel before.

366
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,420
I don't know how many times I've failed.

367
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,780
But you know I won't give up.

368
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,180
I've drawn a new sketch.

369
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,150
I'm very confident this time.

370
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,000
Just wait and see.

371
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,120
When I saw the calendar today,

372
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,940
I realized that it's been so long since I came here.

373
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,540
It's always quiet in the forest.

374
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,770
I'm about to forget what it's like outside.

375
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,290
Our unit leader said

376
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,770
this is the life of forest firefighters.

377
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,290
After hearing what he said,

378
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,390
I had mixed feelings.

379
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:47,820
Sir,

380
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,760
do you still remember our team's habits?

381
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,080
If someone has a very important mission,

382
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,140
don't talk about it. Don't ask about it. Don't think about it.

383
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,780
When he puts out the fire,

384
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,550
he will come back naturally.

385
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,540
A few days ago, a friend in another fire brigade

386
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,720
went to put out a big fire.

387
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,240
I held back and didn't ask anyone else.

388
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,090
But today,

389
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,310
I saw on the newspaper

390
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,700
that he died a glorious death.

391
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,530
I'm also a real forest firefighter.

392
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,590
Maybe one day,

393
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,690
I'll be lost in the mountain

394
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,540
and I can never find my way back.

395
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,220
Sir,

396
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,690
to be honest,

397
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,460
when that day comes,

398
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,140
I will still run forward without hesitation.

399
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,870

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,980

00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:33,810
They are smart.

569
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,610
I like them.

570
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,920
So handsome.

571
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:37,840
Welcome.

572
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,980
Welcome.

573
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,950
Welcome.

574
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,310
Great. Great.

575
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,510
I heard that the instructor

576
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,850
is your master, right?

577
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,690
-Yes.
-Yes.

578
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,760
But we're about the same age.

579
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,240
What should they call me?

580
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,530
I'm your master's master.

581
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,020
You should call me Grandmaster, right?

582
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,980
What nonsense are you talking about?

583
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,160
Well.

584
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,260
Master,

585
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,720
we...

586
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,500
This is the unit leader of Unit 1,

587
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,340
Wang Ben.

588
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,360
Just call him Ben.

589
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,250
He is indeed my master.

590
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,250
That's it.

591
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,050
Get used to it.

592

[Be loyal to the Party and be disciplined.

593
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,350

594
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,250
Why are there so many?

595
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,930
Why are you still up?

596
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,770
Master.

597
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,330
I can't sleep.

598
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,340
There are too many mosquitoes.

599
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:46,760
Yes.

600
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,370
There are many mosquitoes here.

601
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,850
Take your time.

602
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,110
You'll get used to it.

603
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,390
Master,

604
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,200
how have you been here?

605
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,630
Pretty good.

606
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,040
Master, have you been discriminated here?

607
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,340
Discriminated?

608
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,090
Otherwise, why did you ask a stupid guy

609
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,560
to be our grandmaster?

610
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,580
Don't talk nonsense.

611
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,050
This is not the Heping Road Station.

612
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,610
Since you are here,

613
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,290
you should be down-to-earth

614
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,550
and learn from others.

615
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,230
Look.

616
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,040
Forests

617
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,310
are living things.

618
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,580
Every breath in forests

619
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,390
needs our protection.

620
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,120
People always say

621
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,260
forest firefighters live hard lives

622
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,360
because they have to endure loneliness.

623
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,220
But I think

624
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,110
I'm enjoying loneliness here.

625
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,070
I understand what you mean,

626
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,450
Master.

627
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,210
You want to tell us

628
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,300
that we should endure loneliness

629
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,310
and have a hard-working spirit.

630
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,780
Trust us.

631
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,790
We can keep holding on.

632
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,100
I killed it.

633
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,700
I killed it. I killed it.

634
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,220
Forget it.

635
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,520
Even if I tell you,

636
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,070
you won't understand.

637
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,090
You'll understand

638
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,140
after you stay here for a while.

639
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,020
How's everything in the station?

640
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,110
Report to me.

641
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,840
It's still the same.

642
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,490
Director Lou and Assistant Liu are still against each other every day.

643
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,010
Every day, they compete with each other

644
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,320
in terms or their speed or endurance.

645
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,580
I told them

646
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
that when Master comes back,

647
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,150
both of them will be outshone.

648
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,780
They got angry after hearing what I said.

649
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:40,920
Look at them.

650
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,380
Director Lou is a little strict.

651
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,020
But his temper

652
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,230
has changed a lot.

653
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,510
Tell Master about Instructor Yang.

654
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,310
Okay.

655
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,270
Master,

656
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,970
didn't Instructor Yang say he'll get married soon?

657
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,780
He's preparing for his wedding.

658
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,760
I thought no matter what, he would ask you

659
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,720
to be his best man.

660
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,160
But he probably knows you can't go back.

661
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,220
Guess who he asked to be his best man.

662
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,360
Liu?

663
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,220
Director Lou.

664
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,150
Assistant Liu was pissed off.

665
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,210
He asked Director Lou to be his best man?

666
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,940
Then Liu must be really mad, right?

667
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,520
Yes.

668
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,520
Right. Master.

669
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,530
One more thing.

670
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,290
I heard

671
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,520
an old friend of ours

672
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,370
took the firefighter exam.

673
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,500
Who?

674
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,110
I don't think Master can guess it right.

675
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,540
An old friend?

676
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,110
Who?

677
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,050
Jiang Ge.

678
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,160
Jiang Ge took the firefighter exam?

679
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,000
Yes.

680
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,350
He said it's because of Flaming Youth

681
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,700
and because we let him find the direction of his life.

682
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,050
Look at this.

683
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,070
Even Jiang Ge took the firefighter exam.

684
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,790
In my opinion,

685
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,810
he needs to persevere in it first.

686
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,310
How about Dagang?

687
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,540
Assistant Liu visited Unit Leader Lei.

688
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,060
I heard that he's a deliveryman now.

689
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,950
I think he's doing well.

690
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,540
Unit Leader Lei said

691
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,770
being a deliveryman is much easier than being a firefighter.

692
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,250
It's just that he misses everyone.

693
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,580
Everyone is doing well.

694
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,050
