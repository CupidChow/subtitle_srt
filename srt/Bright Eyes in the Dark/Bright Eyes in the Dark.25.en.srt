197
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,700

199
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,170
Guess what it is.

200
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,820
I'll know when I see it.

201
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,940
Come on.

202

Here you are.

203
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,500
Here.

204
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,180
Open it and see what it is.

206

It's you, Dad.

207
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,980
Thank you, Dad.

208
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,580
All right, put it away.

No.

211

I want to play with it now.

212
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,580
Come on, listen to Mom.

213

214

You can't only eat rice.

218

You have to eat the dishes.

The meat Mom made is very tasty.

223

See?

224

She's learned to resist passively.

225

Miaomiao.

226
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,980
Don't force yourself if you're not hungry.

227
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,220
When you are hungry,

228
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,100
I'll heat the dishes up for you.

229
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:15,940
Okay?

230
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,820
Really?

231
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,100
Yes.

232
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,580
I want to play now.

233
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,340
Go.

234
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,100
Look at you.

235
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,860
You either don't come back,

236
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,980
or you break all the rules I set before

237
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,740
when you come back.

238
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,690
Come on.

239
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,580
It's her birthday.

240
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,580
Let her play for a while.

Miaomiao.

251
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,930
You can't treat Mom like that again.

252
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Mom loves you very much.

253
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,700
What's wrong?

254
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,820
Did you forget what I told you?

255
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,940
When I'm not home,

256
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,860
you have to take care of Mom for me.

257

258
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,740
There's one more thing.

259
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,820
Mom told me that

260
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,820
you don't like to go to the interest class recently. Why is that?

261
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,220
Boring.

262
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,420
It's not fun.

263
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,820
Didn't you beg us to let you go?

264
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,220
They all treat me badly.

265
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,580
Who treated you badly?

Tell me.

Miaomiao.

268
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,700
What exactly happened?

269
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,220
Tell me.

270
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,570
I'll help you solve it.

271
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:07,980
It's useless.

272
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,220
They wouldn't believe me

273
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,180
when I told them my father is a firefighter.

274
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,220
So what did they say?

275
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,580
They said you're a bad guy,

276
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,700
and you got arrested,

277
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,860
so you never came to pick me up.

278
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,620
When I said that's not the case,

279
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,700
they scolded me.

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,820
I promise you.

Tomorrow,

284
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,460
I'll take you to the interest class,

285
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,100
and let them see

286
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,580
whether I'm a firefighter or not.

287
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,210
Great.

288
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,860
You'd better put on your firefighter uniform.

289
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,700
This one.

290
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,060

00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,940
but you can buy something else.

382
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,700
Okay.

383
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,460
I'll try.

384
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,700
How is it at home?

385
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,020
Is Miaomiao happy?

386
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,540
Not bad.

387
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,140
I just put her to sleep.

388
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,020
That's good.

389
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,260
Spend a few more days

390
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,460
with your family.

391
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,180
Okay.

392
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,220
Thank you, Director Lin.

393
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,700
No.

394
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,500
It should be Instructor Lin.

395
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:10,980
Alright.

396
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,660
I'm hanging up.

397
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,220
[Nan Chu]

398
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,220
Hello?

399
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,270
Coach Lin, I'm at the gate of the Special Division Station.

400
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:21,980
What?

401
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,940
Okay.

402
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,460
[Heping Road Fire and Rescue Special Division Station, Binxi District, Beixun City]

403
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,900
Why are you running so fast?
[Heping Road Fire and Rescue Special Division Station, Binxi District, Beixun City]

404
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,260
[Heping Road Fire and Rescue Special Division Station, Binxi District, Beixun City]

405
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,940
You scared me.

406
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,980
Why are you here at such a late hour?

407
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,700
What happened?

408
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,460
I have some good news for you.

409
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,740
What is it?

410
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,740
Mr. Han agreed to let me participate in the performance.

411
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,300
So as long as our dance gets approved,

412
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,890
I'll be able to get up on the stage for real.

413
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,540
Really?

414
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,180
I promise you.

415
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,020
I'll definitely go see it live this time.

416
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,020
There's another good news.

417
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,380
What is it?

418
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,700
I rented a house.

419
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,940
Why did you rent a house anyway?

420
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,260
Didn't I tell you that you could stay at my place?

421
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,500
Your place is too far.

422
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,780
Can you see the balcony with star-shaped lights?

423
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,380
You moved here?

424
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,140
So from now on, no matter how busy you are,

425
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,700
or how late you work,

426
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,020
I will wait for you here.

427
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
So from now on,

428
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,060
we can meet here every day.

429
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,300
Social assistance. Social assistance.

430
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,300
I have to go.

431
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,940
Go home first.

432
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,460
A drunk man is trying to jump off a bridge.

433
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,180
-Be careful.
-Dispatch Truck 2

434
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,700
Okay.

435
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,480
and 3.

436
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,980
You promised you'd take me here in a firefighter uniform.

437
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,370
You lied to me again.

438
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,250
Miaomiao.

439
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,060
I got it ready,

440
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,420
but it was too late yesterday.

441
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,140
How about this?

442
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
I'll go get it now.

443
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,980
When you get off school,

444
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,980
I'll come pick you up in a firefighter uniform.

445
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,900
Okay?

446
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,860
Don't lie to me this time.

447
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,540
Miaomiao.

448
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,300
We made a pinky swear.

449
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,220
Don't worry.

450
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,060
I will never lie to you.

451
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,050
Go ahead.

452
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,460
Ms. Zhang, see you.

453
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,140
How many students?

454
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,180
25 students in total.

455
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,220
And 4 teachers.

456
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,500
There are more here.

457
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,500
Ms. Zhang, how are the kids?

458
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,460
Where is Miaomiao?

459
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,500
I don't know where she is.

460
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,860
There are still many students and teachers trapped in there.

461
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,700
It's dangerous.

462
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,740
Parents and teachers have to wait outside.

463
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,620
I'm a firefighter in Beixun City.

464
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,260
I'm a structural engineer.

465
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,980
I can help.

466
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,300
Go get changed with me.

467
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:20,890
Come on.

468
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,860
Give it to me.

469
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,300
Miaomiao.

470
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,220
Do you hear me?

471
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,140
Miaomiao!

472
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,660
Miaomiao.

473
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,860
Mom!

474
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,500
It's dangerous. Step back.

475
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:15,900
Are you hurt?

476
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,740
I'm a parent.

477
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,060
Mom, I'm okay.

478
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,220
My child might be inside.

479
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,020
If you go in there now,

480
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,940
not only will you not be able to help,

481
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,700
you may also get in danger.

482
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,380
Don't worry.

483
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,500
Trust our firefighters.

484
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,700
Someone!

485
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,900
Yu!

486
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,530
Save Miaomiao!

487
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,860
Miaomiao is inside!

488
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,420
Miaomiao!

489
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,500
Dad!

490
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,380
I'm here to save you.

491
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,420
Where are you?

492
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,700
Dad!

493
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,700
Miaomiao!

494
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,300
Where are you?

495
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,620
Dad, I'm here!

496
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,700
Miaomiao!

497
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,060
Dad!

498
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,260
Help!

499
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,890
Miaomiao!

500
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,260
Miaomiao!

501
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,020
Dad!

502
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,980
Miaomiao!

503
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,390
-Don't be afraid. Daddy is here!
-Dad!

504
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,860
Miaomiao, don't move!

505
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,700
I'm coming to save you!

506
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,540
Help me!

507
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,700
Dad!

508
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,740
Uncle, help me!

509
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,060
Uncle, help me!

510
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,700
Dad, help me!

511
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,660
Where are you, Tiantian?

512
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,520
-Don't be scared. I'm outside.
-Tiantian.

513
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,620
Tiantian.

514
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,020
Miaomiao!

515
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,060
Don't move. Wait for me.

516
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,700
Dad!

517
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,700
Uncle, save me!

518
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,690
Dad!

519
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,700
Miaomiao!

520
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,380
Listen to me.

521
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,180
Stay there and don't move.

522
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,540
I'll be right there.

523
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,260
Dad!

524
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,940
Don't be afraid, kid.

525
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,900
I'll get you out in no time.

526
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,460
Okay?

527
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,420
Don't move.

528
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:14,980
Kid.

529
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,700
Dad!

530
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,540
Don't be afraid.

531
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,780
Come on.

532
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,460
Miaomiao!

533
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,220
Don't move.

534
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,700
Daddy will be there right away.

535
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,260
Don't be afraid, kid.

536
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,540
Lower your body.

537
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,020
Come on.

538
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:50,860
Watch your head.

539
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,300
Be careful.

540
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,860
Dad! Come and save me!

541
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,980
Come to me.

542
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,860
Dad! Come and save me!

543
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,700
Miaomiao.

544
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,220
Remember what I said.

545
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,260
Don't move.

546
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,860
Whose child is this?

547
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,060
She's mine!

548
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,500
Yu!

549
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,020
Save Miaomiao!

550
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,460
I'm begging you! Save Miaomiao!

551
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,140
Miaomiao!

552
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,980
Miaomiao!

553
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,590
Mom!

554
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,700
Miaomiao, are you hurt?

555
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,350
Mom, I'm okay.

556
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,220
I just checked.

557
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,060
She just got some scratches.

558
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,570
It's okay.

559
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,940
Don't be afraid, Miaomiao.

560
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,700
Mommy's here.

561
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,540
It's okay, Miaomiao.

562
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,780
Milan.

563
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,460
I'm sorry.

564
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,060
Because according to my judgment,

565
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,620
Miaomiao was safe for the moment.

566
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,220
I had to save the person closest to me.

567
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,260
If I saved her first,

568
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,700
those closer to me would be in danger.

569
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,780
I'm sorry, Milan.

570

No.

You told me that

610
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,460
it's not because of me.

611

It's because she misses you.

when you asked me to save Miaomiao first,

I heard you.

At that time,

according to my judgment, she was safe for the time being,

644
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,540
but others were in danger.

Although the fire wasn't strong today,

still, some problems were exposed.

00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:22,840
Instructor Lin.

759
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,220
I'll leave you to it.

760
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,230
I haven't unpacked yet.

761
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,070
I'm going to unpack.

762
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,490
Yu!

763
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:43,840
Yu!

764
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,390
Stop wiping.

765
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,780
Get changed and go out with us.

766
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,530
But I'm working.

767
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,290
What is it?

768
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,380
Six Familiarities.

769
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,270
Six Familiarities?

770
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,250
There's no such arrangement today.

771
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:53,830
Yu!

772
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,630
Liu!

773
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:55,680
Get changed.

774
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:56,270
Let's go.

775
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,360
Coming.

776
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,370
Stop discussing.

777
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,170
Let's go.

778
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,890
Where are we going?

779
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,650
Aren't we going out for Six Familiarities?

780
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,050
We've been busy with work.

781
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,810
We haven't got together for a long time.

782
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:18,490
Right?

783
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,380
I'll let you get familiar with

784
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,520
the dinner session.

785
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,480
Dinner?

786
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,340
Get familiar with the taste we're familiar with.

787
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,560
Let's have a drink later.

788
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,360
And drinking?

789
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,790
Did you report it?

790
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:31,760
Of course.

791
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,100
How can we drink without reporting?

792
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,400
I've arranged everything.

793
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,160
Don't worry.

794
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,670
Liu.

795
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,270
I'm making an exception today

796
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,440
to let you drink.

797
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,700
Only one request.

798
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:42,890
Get Yu drunk.

799
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,780
Don't worry.

800
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,910
Don't you know how much I can drink?

801
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,350
It's easy for me to take Yu down.

802
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,360
Liu.

803
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,160
What day is it today exactly?

804
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,050
Why did you suddenly want to have a drink?

805
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,860
It's a good day.

806
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,580
Considering our leaves and days off,

807
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,470
it's not easy for us to have a day off together.

808
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,310
Of course we should have a drink.

809
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,400
Fine.

810
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,380
Let's see who can drink more tonight.

811
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,300
Okay.

812
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,350
Play a song.

I just twisted my ankle.

837
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,050
Does it hurt, Nan Chu?

838
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:27,890
Is your foot okay?

839
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,400
I'm okay.

840
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,790
Take a break, everyone.

841
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,580
We'll stop recording for now.

842
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,720
Let me help you stand up.

843
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,230
Be careful.

844
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,720
Be careful.

845
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,320
So serious.

846
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,070
No, it's okay.

847
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,330
Sha.

848
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,340
Get the bandage.

849
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:48,760
Okay.

850
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,070
You're so badly injured.

851
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,370
How about we stop recording today?

852
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,300
Right.

853
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,230
It's nothing serious.

854
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,880
Take them to practice.

855
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,260
That take wasn't good enough.

856
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,110
But you are already like this.

857
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,950
It's nothing serious.

858
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:02,580
Go.

859
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,220
Is it okay for you to be alone?

860
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,020
It really doesn't hurt.

861
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,410
We'll go then.

862
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:07,870
Okay.

863
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:08,880

866
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,390
Can you give me your dance video today?

867
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,450
Others have all submitted theirs.

868
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,790
Yes.

869
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,390
I'll give it to you later.

870
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,700
Okay. Be quick.

00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,330

It's the responsibility of the whole society

to do a good job in school fire safety.

but many fire hazards.

The causes of fire mainly include

885
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,380
electronical malfunctions and inappropriate operations in experiments.

886

such as lack of attention and management.

888
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,680
There are many people in schools.

00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,780
If the evacuation passageways are blocked,
