00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,700
Show your real skills.

190
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:16,920
Don't worry.

191
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,850
I won't embarrass you.

192
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,700
If anything, I'll only embarrass myself.

193
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,500
Anything else?

194
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,460
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

195
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,200
You should have been the leader.

196
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,460
What are you talking about?

197
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,800
You are the station director.

198
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,060
Of course you should be the leader.

199
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,460
Thanks.

200
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,720
What are you thanking me for?

201
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,710
You just don't get it, do you?

202
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,310
When I was working with Yang,

203
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,740
he said that

204
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,540
the relationship between

205
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,310
a qualified director and his instructor

206
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,580
is like a close couple.

207
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,540
Understand?

208
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,840
That's enough.

209
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,150
We're leaving.

210
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,160
Get in.

211
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,560
Do your best

212
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,730
and get a good result.

213
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,320
Do you hear me?

214
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,290
Okay, don't worry.

215
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:19,830
Go.

216
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,840
Bye.

217
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,930
Come on.

218
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,920
[China Fire and Rescue]

219
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,090
Okay, stop.

220
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,440
Don't use your fake feelings

221
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,080
and tears to fool the audience

222
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,220
and us, okay?

223
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,150
I want true feelings.

224
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
Only true feelings

225
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,330
can move yourself

226
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,930
and the audience.

227
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,900
I want true feelings.

228
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,510
One more time.

229
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,400
Don't stop until we get a good shot.

230
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,790
Come here.

231
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,450
There was another girl who auditioned for Ya last time.

232
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,800
Call her

233
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,180
and ask her to come here.

234
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,530
Okay.

235
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,450
Hurry up.

236
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,110
Do you want to ask me

237
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,580
when I can come back?

238
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,570
When the jasmine flower you bought last year blooms,

239
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,800
I should be back.

240
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,630
Li Haoyu.

241
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,950
I water it every day.

242
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,890
Will you come back

243
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,490
when the flower blooms?

244
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,560
It's okay even if you're a little late.

245
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,800
I'll wait for you

246
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,320
until you return.

247
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,840
[China Fire and Rescue]

248
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,970
The ten comrades on the stage

249
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,390
represented the Beixun City Brigade

250
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,620
and won second place in the competition.

251
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,550
They have gained great honor

252
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,810
and set a good example.

253
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,120
I thank you

254
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,770
on behalf of Beixun City Brigade.

255
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,570
Applaud.

256
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,150
Nice!

[Certificate of Honor]

258
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,830
Have a seat.

259
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,710
These ten comrades

260
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,940
brought about honor and merit

261
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,990
to our brigade.

262
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,340
I have an idea.

263
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,860
Can I give them a day off?

264
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:17,950
However,

265
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,130
other comrades

266
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,640
have contributed a lot too.

267
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,660
As for the reward,

268
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,510
you decide.

269
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,600
How about treating us?

270
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,200
Yes! Treat us!

271
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,550
Treat us!

272
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,160
No problem.

273
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,970
Okay, everyone.

274
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,360
Well,

275
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,540
Instructor Lin and I discussed this on our way back.

276
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,390
The competition rewards from the brigade

277
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,770
are all at the Supply Depot of Blue Friends.

278
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,620
You can use that to buy any

279
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,500
food and drinks you want.

280
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
On top of that, today,

281
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,650
I'll treat everyone with my own money.

282
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,060
Nice!

283
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,460
Listen.

284
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,560
Cherish this opportunity.

285
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,320
This is not Director Lou's usual style.

286
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,300
I learned well from Instructor Lin.

287
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,350
Report.

288
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,780
I, Fang Xiangqian, have returned!

289
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,550
Captain Meng.

290
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,770
You're back.

291
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,200
How's your mother?

292
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,710
She's fine.

293
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,140
The surgery went well.

294
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,730
The test report is out.

295
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,570
It's positive.

296
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,130
The doctor said

297
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,270
she could be discharged after some rest.

298
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,980
Great.

299
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,160
It's great news.

300
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,630
This is double the joy.

301
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,980
Shouldn't we further celebrate?

302
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,610
Right?

303
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,580
Yes!

304
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,350
We'll celebrate.

305
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,240
And...

306
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,590
Thank you for helping my mom, Captain Meng.

307
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,980
You too, Director Lou

308
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,520
and Instructor Lin.

309
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,570
I'm just glad things are well, Fang.

310
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,930
You don't have to rush back to work.

311
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,310
Captain Meng just gave all the

312
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,450
participants of the competition a day off.

313
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,180
Lin and I plan to take everyone to camp.

314
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,440
Everyone, bring your family.

315
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,700
You can bring your wife too.

316
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,960
Spend some time together.

317
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,640
Yes.

318
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,230
As the old saying goes,

319
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,790
don't be arrogant or impatient.

320
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,890
Keep working hard.

321
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,280
Yes!

322
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,100
Did you say Supply Depot of Blue Friends?

323
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:06,770
Yes.

324
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,990
I want to take a look.

325
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,540
Can I?

326
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,560
This is also a feature of our station.

327
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,820
How about this, Captain Meng,

328
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,500
Qi Huo.

329
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:15,930
Yes.

330
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,940
Take Captain Meng to the supply depot

331
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,870
and give him a tour.

332
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,220
Take the chance to introduce our work

333
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,570
and life experience to Captain Meng.

334
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,250
Yes.

335
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,340
Okay.

336
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,230
I...

337
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,940
I'll go first.

338
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,030
Goodbye, Captain Meng.

339
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,750
Go.

340
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,840
Hurry up.

341
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,340
Hurry.

342
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,770
Go.

343
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,790
Look at his dainty steps.

344
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,220
This is it.

345
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,070
Not bad.

346
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,000
Good.

347
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,320
Aren't you going to introduce it to me?

348
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,380
This is a good venture.

349
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,310
The station can promote it.

350
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,160
What do you want?

351
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,970
Just say it.

352
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,030
Nothing.

353
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,080
I'm just looking around.

354
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,600
What do you think?

355
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,870
You must have gained a lot in this competition.

356
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,170
Didn't you announce it just now?

357
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,100
The second place.

358
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:30,810
Yes.

359
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,370
I mean,

360
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,880
you got second place.

361
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,390
There's still

362
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,070
room for improvement.

363
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,380
What's wrong?

364
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,350
Are you still not satisfied with second place?

365
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,040
Did I say that?

366
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,330
Didn't I give you all a day off?

367
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,840
Am I very annoying in your eyes?

368
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm your dad.

369
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,770
I can't even talk to you now?

370
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,200
Sure.

371
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,960
Go ahead.

372
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,630
I'm listening.

373
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,350
Look at you.

374
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,800
I...

375
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,820
I mean...

376
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,000
Well...

377
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,800
You did well this time.

378
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,880
You mustn't

379
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,560
be proud and impatient.

380
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,040
I said that already.

381
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,020
Anyway, work hard at everything you do.

382
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,120
I have a question.

383
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,220
Are you saying this as my leader

384
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,610
or as my father?

385
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,790
What's the difference?

386
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,150
If you said it as my leader,

387
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,090
I'm grateful for your recognition.

388
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,550
What if I said it as your father?

389
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,470
I want you to know that

390
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,070
everything I have

391
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,170
was earned by my own efforts.

392
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,550
Yes.

393
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,330
You got it yourself.

394
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,810
I'm not denying your efforts.

395
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,160
Back then, when you applied to be

396
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,050
a firefighter behind my back,

397
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,480
I made you change your name.

398
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,820
Why did I do that?

399
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,670
I did that to tell you

400
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,230
what firefighters rely on.

401
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,790
We rely on strength, persistence,

402
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,340
and real skills.

403
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,450
Am I

404
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,540
a qualified firefighter now?

405
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,560
Yes.

406
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,710
Have I always relied on myself

407
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,180
and not on anyone else?

408
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,730
Yes.

409
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,070
Have I ever embarrassed you?

410
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,010
No.

411
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,580
Then, can you praise me

412
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,570
as my father?

413
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,120
Son,

414
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,610
I'm proud of you.

415
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,300
Please say it again.

416
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,160
Say what?

417
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,750
What you said just now.

418
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,850
You weren't even looking at me when you said it.

419
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,730
Say it again.

420
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,030
I won't repeat the same praise twice.

421
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,920
Just say it again.

422
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,520
Look at me so I can feel it.

423
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,780
I have a lot of things to do.

424
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,670
Just say it once.

425
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,720
It won't take long.

426
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Just once.

427
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,580
Next time.

428
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,860
Say it again, just once.

429
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,570
Well...

430
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:14,670
[Supply Depot of Blue Friends]

431
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,630
If you're really embarrassed to say it,
[Supply Depot of Blue Friends]

432
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,150
you can post it on your Moments instead!

[Supply Depot of Blue Friends]

434
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,170
This is more like camping.

435
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,520
When the lights are on at night,

436
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,030
it will be even more atmospheric.

437
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,790
Let me tell you.

438
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,470
I saw Director Lou

439
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,200
at the garage just now.

440
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,460
He brought all the old tents we replaced last year.

441
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,140
At night,

442
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,940
others might think something happened.

443
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,030
Lou Mingye.

444
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,960
I'm not blaming you.

445
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,710
But it's been so many years.

446
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,020
Can you be more fun?

447
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,230
Lighten up!

448
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,240
You're more stingy than me.

449
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,510
Both of you are stingy.

450
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,320
Okay, good enough.

451
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,670
Aren't Milan and Miaomiao coming?

452
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,210
They are.

453
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,220
They'll be here later.

454
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,150
That's good.

455
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,540
Although Milan and I are divorced,

456
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,350
I’ve discussed it with Milan.

457
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,150
We'll still meet once in a while.

458
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,830
No matter what,

459
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,600
we can't let the child suffer.

460
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,770
That's right.

461
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,370
Although

462
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,720
I can't be a good husband now,

463
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,020
at least I still have a chance

464
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,620
to be a good dad.

465
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,750
Miaomiao is so cute.

466
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,180
You can't bear to upset her.

467
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,240
Are you busy?

468
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,840
You're here, Yang.

469
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,980
Who is this?

470
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,990
Let me ask you one question.

471
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,590
When are you two getting married?

472
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,020
When?

473
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,030
Soon.

474
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,750
Why don't I know that?

475
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,370
Wait, this is important.

476
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,880
Do you need a best man?

477
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,230
Best man?

478
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,240
We have enough best men.

479
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,460
We need one more bridesmaid.

480
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,260
Why don't you fill the spot?

481
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,930
What's the meaning of this?

482
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,030
I'm your best friend.

483
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,030
I want to be the best man.

484
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,290
Best man!

485
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,850
You guys talk. I'll go there and help.

486
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,390
Okay.

487
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:13,780
Let's go.

488
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,620
Have a seat.

489
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,120
Okay.

490
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,100
Where's Nan Chu?

491
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:17,980
She's not here?

492
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,950
Nan Chu

493
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,210
is filming with the crew.

494
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,100
She can't make it today.

495
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,700
I'll sit for a while.

496
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,580
Have a seat.

497
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,570
Sergeant Lin!

498
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,140
Why are you back?

499
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,440
I'm done filming.

500
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,400
So soon?

501
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,080
I miss you.

502
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,380
I miss you too.

503
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,070
Hurry, cover the kid's eyes.

504
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,840
Enjoy yourselves.

505
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,760
I'm leaving.

506
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,270
Play with us.

507
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,030
No thanks.

508
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,260
I have to deal with Shen Guangzong.

509
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,680
His occupational hazard is acting up again.

510
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,780
I took her out secretly, you know.

511
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,590
By the way,

512
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,110
It's cold at night.

513
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,710
Take this.

514
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,550
Just in case.

515
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,020
What treasure is it?

516
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,520
Okay.

517
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,610
Take care of Nan Chu.

518
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,410
Don't worry.

519
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:12,960
I'm leaving.

520
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,750
-Off you go.
-Bye.

521
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,510
Bye.

522
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,770
Let's go.

523
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,080
I have so much to tell you.

524
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,300
Me too.

525
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,970
What?

526
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,940
You go first.

527
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,730
You first.

528
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,880
Who is this?

529
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Long time no see.

530
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,560
Long time no see, superstar.

531
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,030
Let me ask you two a question.

532
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,710
When will you get married?

533
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,520
Why do you have so many questions?

534
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,280
Wait, this is important.

535
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,700
Do you need a best man?

536
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,120
What?

537
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,130
Is being the best man your side gig?

538
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:35,760
You want to be the best man all the time.

539
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,230
I like being the best man.

540
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,160
Dad!

541
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,170
Dad.

542
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,430
Who is this?

543
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,520
Miaomiao.

544
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,620
Sister-in-law.

545
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,250
Hello, Sister-in-law.

546
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,460
Say hello to your uncles.

547
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,980
Hello, uncles.

548
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,860
Hello.

549
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,330
All right, everyone is here.

550
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:49,790
Hurry.

551
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:50,710
Say hello.

552
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,550
Let's start.

553
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,310
Okay.

554
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,650
Sit here, sister-in-law.

555
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,870
I'll go there.

556
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,560
I'll take you there.

557
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,820
Honey.

558
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,540
Leader.

559
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,310
What would you like to drink?

560
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,900
Is it cooked?

561
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,750
Hungry?

562
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,130
Wait.

563
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,310
Coming.

564
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:14,700
Eggplants.

565
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,490
Put it here.

566
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,590
Slice the inside up.

567
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:18,940
Where is the knife?

568
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,160
Where is the knife? Use the knife.

569
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,080
It's okay.

570
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,630
Use...

571
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,660
[Xia Wan]
I'm busy today.

572
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,540
I can't make it.

00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,190
[Xia Wan]

574
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,760
Dagang's job

575
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,100
is tiring

576
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,320
and doesn't pay well.

577
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,010
His phone needs to be on standby 24 hours a day.

578
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,310
Every time I want to talk to him,

579
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,160
he's either in a meeting,

580
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,460
on a mission,

581
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,720
or training somewhere.

582
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,170
It's hard to ask him for help.

583
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,230
I still remember when I was pregnant,

584
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,650
I handled everything myself.

585
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,290
He was no help at all.

586
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:53,920
Exactly.

587
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,600
When I went on a date with Qi Huo,

588
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,240
he ran as soon as he heard the bell.

589
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,630
And then I had to yell at him that

590
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,310
it was the end of the school next door.

591
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,700
This is called conditional reflex.

592
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,540
Mine does that too.

593
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,550
From what you said,

594
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,980
we have two firefighters at home.

595
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,190
How will we live?

596
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,660
You two are actually fine.

597
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,390
You're in the same system.

598
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,600
You can understand each other.

599
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,960
Why don't we make a forum online?

600
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,720
The title is...

601
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,570
"Complaints of a firefighter's family."

602
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,550
The title is good.

603
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,890
Are they all sent by one of us?

604
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,840
What's wrong, Liu?

605
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,370
Are you unhappy because

606
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,290
because Dr. Xia isn't coming?

607
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,860
She's not coming.

608
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,020
Don't think too much.

609
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,490
Right?

610
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,930
She's just ambitious.

611
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,140
She's busy with work.

612
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,240
She still loves you.

613
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,080
Don't think too much.

614
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,740
Let's wait and see.

615
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,630
If she cares about me,

616
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,100
she will come sooner or later.

617
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,370
That's enough.

618
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,960
She's just busy with work

619
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,590
and couldn't make it.

620
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,020
Stop complicating it.

621
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,650
Okay?

622
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,250
Good for you.

623
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,090
Do you think you're the tragic male lead?

624
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,920
Why are you sitting here?

625
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,010
Prepare the skewers, Drama Queen.

626
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,560
Okay.

627
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,460
You keep creating drama for yourself.

628
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:18,800
Drama queen.

629
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,150
Yes, she doesn't love you.

630
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,040
Actually, living together as a couple

631
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,800
means holding and supporting each other.

632
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,570
If something happens,

633
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,750
we can only bear it together.

634
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,130
To be honest, regarding my mother-in-law's illness this time...

635
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,360
If not for the help of the team,

636
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,590
Fang and I wouldn't have known what to do.

637
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,580
You don't know

638
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,260
how bad Fang is with words.

639
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,450
He doesn't like talking about his problems,

640
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,620
so he keeps them to himself.

641
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,510
Once,

642
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,480
I saw him

643
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,160
hiding away, secretly wiping his tears

644
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,220
because he couldn't afford the hospital fees.

645
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,170
My mother-in-law even said,

646
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,730
if push comes to shove,

647
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,990
she would just not get treated.

648
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,540
I really...

649
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,530
It's all thanks to his team

650
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,340
and his team leaders.

651
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,780
They helped us get through this.

652
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,970
I used to joke with Fang

653
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:32,720
that

654
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,580
he is much happier with his team

655
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,150
than when he is with me.

656
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,130
He said these are his family.

657
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,060
I didn't understand it before.

658
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,530
But now I understand.

659
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,470
Yeah.

660
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,030
We are already sitting here.

661
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,800
We can't change our options now.

662
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,750
Dagang also said

663
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,970
the special nature of their industry

664
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,070
is to hand over their backs.

665
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,550
As family members,

666
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,810
we should be more considerate.

667
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,330
As firefighters, they should take time

668
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,090
to take care of the family.

669
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,400
Isn't that enough?

670
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,550
In my opinion,

671
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,720
we should get together more often.

672
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,600
They are a family.

673
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,780
Then we're family too.

674
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,170
-Yes.
-You're right.

675
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,310
Nan.

676
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,000
If Lin Luxiao makes you unhappy,

677
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,090
just tell us.

678
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,890
We'll hold a meeting with him for you.

679
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,730
Of course.

680
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,030
Yes.

681
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,460
If you want to know his whereabouts,

682
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,840
you can ask me anytime.

683
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,230
I'm counting on all of you.

684
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,950
No problem.

685
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,130
Here are the skewers.

686
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,020
Here you go.

687
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,520
It's done.

688
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,400
It's all done?

689
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,960
Why is it burnt?

690
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,300
Is it still edible?

691
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,350
Of course it is.

692
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,190
We made so many.

693
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,530
They're only good for putting out fires.

694
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,920
You can't eat this.

695
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,010
Did you barbecue this?

696
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,070
Did you take it from someone else?

697
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,870
Don't eat it.

698
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,090
It looks like it.

699
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,060
It's salty.

700
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,870
How did you barbecue it?

701
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,180
We had a great chat.

702
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,070
Look at Dagang.

703
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,050
He must get beaten by his wife often at home.

704
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,640
And Unit Leader Fang

705
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,240
probably can't beat his wife in a quarrel.

706
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,510
Miaomiao.

707
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,470
Miaomiao!

708
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,190
Daddy is going to chase you.

709
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,780
Miaomiao, I'm going to catch up with you.

710
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,250
Slow down, Miaomiao.

711
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,090
Miaomiao.

712
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,740
Sister Milan.

713
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,260
Have you ever regretted it?

714
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,630
Back then, they all advised me not to divorce him.

715
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,900
They said I would regret it.

716
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,870
They said I had to be considerate.

717
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,070
Firefighters

718
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,170
sacrifice their families for everyone else.

719
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,260
It's really sacred.

720
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,750
But

721
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,910
I can't be that great.

722
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,370
I tried many ways

723
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,180
and tried to tolerate them.

724
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,160
But after a while,

725
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,640
it became hard to persist.

726
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,340
I don't want

727
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,150
to face everything

728
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,000
all by myself.

729
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,370
I'm just one person.

730
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,220
A woman.

731
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,700
An ordinary woman.

732
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,920
But you,

733
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,700
you're a superstar now.

734
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,290
And Luxiao is so busy.

735
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,430
Do you even have time to meet?

736
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,130
Also,

737
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,610
What have you done for the future?

738
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,050
I don't know.

739
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,150
But I don't think I can figure it out.

740
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,430
No matter what,

741
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,280
I will protect Lin Luxiao.

742
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,540
Protect?

743
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,080
Nan Chu.

744
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,140
You're so brave.

745
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,260
Actually,

746
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,820
Yu and I divorced

747
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,220
not just because he's a firefighter.

748
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,110
More importantly,

749
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,550
I don't think we suit each other.

750
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,960
Nan Chu.

751
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,610
I wish you and Luxiao all the best.

752
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,600
You must be well.

753
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,140
Everyone is so enthusiastic.

754
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,110
The lights

755
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,750
make it so atmospheric.

756
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,940
You used the emergency rescue tents.

757
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,610
How did you come up

758
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,960
with the idea of camping in the emergency rescue tents?

759
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,350
What, you have a problem with it?

760
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,030
Are you upset?

761
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,200
I'll punish you.

762
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,040
Bottoms up.

763
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,130
Hurry up.

764
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,460
Since everyone is here,

765
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,060
let's take a group photo.

766
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,530
-Okay.
-Come on.

767
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,660
Wait.

768
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,350
Today is a special day.

769
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,370
I need to use the toilet.

770
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,380
Don't you remember?

771
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,850
Today?

772
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,940
I don't know.

773
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,080
What festival is it today?

774
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,920
What milestone?

775
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,840
What anniversary?

776
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,100
I don't know.

777
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,440
Never heard of it.

778
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,520
Today is Sergeant Lin’s birthday.

779
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:21,070
Happy birthday to you.

780
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,750
Thank you.

781
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,890
I forgot about it.

782
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,320
Then you can't forget it from now on.

783
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,950
This is your first birthday celebration

784
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,830
since we got together.

785
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,430
I won't forget it again.

786
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,770
We'll celebrate every birthday together from now on.

787
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,060
There are kids here!

788
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,450
There are kids here!

789
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:38,960
Don't let them see.

790
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,340
What are the kids afraid of?

791
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,830
Make a wish.

792
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,010
-Make a wish.
-Wait.

793
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,650
I have a question.

794
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,370
Did you prepare all these by yourself?

795
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,050
No, I was afraid I couldn't make it in time.

796
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,280
Instructor Yang and Assistant Liu helped me.

797
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,920
The cake!

798
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,840
Director Lou picked it!

799
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,550
Right?

800
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,490
I knew only he could choose

801
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,830
such a small cake.

802
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,640
Who swore

803
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,990
to never celebrate my birthday?

804
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,080
Screw you!

805
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,000
Am I that petty?

806
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,390
Shut up and make a wish.

807
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:10,960
Make a wish.

808
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,660
Stop.

809
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,100
What did you wish for?

810
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,570
I can't tell you.

811
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,460
I'll take it as becoming a father soon.

812
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,270
Let's wish Instructor Lin

813
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,130
happy birthday again!

814
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,360
Cheers.

815
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,280
Let me position everyone.

816
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,510
Family members sit in the front.

817
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:35,400
The rest of you stand behind your partners.

Yes, wait.

Enough.

You've taken so many.

838
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,000
Come on, take one for him.

839
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,460
Coming.

840
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:08,960
Okay.

-Let me see.
-Next.

Nice.

Why am I so handsome

844
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,970
in this new outfit?

845

I'm going to send it to Xia Wan.

852

You look so proper.

853

Aren't you a born firefighter?

854
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,410
He smiles like a chihuahua.

855
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,650
Not bad.

856
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,530
Okay, I'll take this one.

857
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,290

862
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,800
Didn't he come back with us just now?

863
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,640
He asked for leave as soon as he came back.

864
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,320
A leave?

865
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,820
What?
