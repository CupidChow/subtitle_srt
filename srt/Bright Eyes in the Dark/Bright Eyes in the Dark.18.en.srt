Hey.

Hey, Nan Chu.

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,970
Instructor Yang.

27
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,700
I came to see you.

28
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,700
How do you feel?

29
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Not bad.

30
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,380
It hurts a bit.

31
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,130
I'm fine.

32
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,380
I won't die.

33
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,380
You just got out of surgery.

34
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,820
The anesthesia may have worn off.

35
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,210
You'll be fine in a few days.

the anesthesia

hasn't worn off.

My foot…

40
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,300
I still can't feel my foot.

41
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,500
 Some veterans told me

42
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,580
that when it rained,

their old injuries

44
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,980
hurt a lot.

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,820
I guess

46
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,850
I'll experience that too.

47
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,730
But now,

48
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,980
medical science is so advanced.

49
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,700
There should be a way to cure it.

Don't look so sad.

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,850
I'm not dead.

58
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,500
I just lost one leg.

59
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,380
It's okay.

60
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,860
It's no big deal.

61
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,060
In the past,

62
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,060
I always wondered

63
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,850
when

64
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,500
I could have a long vacation

65
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,620

66
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,180

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,140
It was all my fault.

72
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,130
It had nothing to do with you.

73
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,860
If I hadn't been suspended,

74
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,540
you wouldn't have needed to go up there.

Do you think

76

you could've done better than me?

77
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,170
Don't take all the blame on yourself.

78
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,490
Let me tell you.

79
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,700
This

80
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,380
was an accident.

81

96
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,060
tell them to prepare it for you.

97
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,420
Tell me if you have any requests.

98
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,850
I don't.

99
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,050
Even if you don't,

100
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,820
we'll look after you all the same.

101
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,940
I'm your superior,

102
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,500
and also your brother-in-arms.

103
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,490
Do you remember this?

104
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,220
On the day you were recruited,

105
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,290
I told you

106
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,810
that once we were brothers-in-arms,

107
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,260
we'd always be brothers-in-arms.

If there's anything on my mind,

110
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,330
it's

111
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,490
our station.

112
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,610
Now that I'm disabled,

113
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,500
I'm afraid

114
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,490
I can't go back to work.

115
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,970
And Luxiao has been suspended.

116
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,620

117
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,500

As a firefighter,

121
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,860
you're worth your salt.

122
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,620
I'm proud of you.

123
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,650
Thank you, Captain Meng.

124
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:17,980
Come.

125
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,740
You know this, don't you?

126
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,620
You've been asking me for it.

127
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,220
I can't believe it.

128
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,070
I can't believe it.

129
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,290
You're actually willing

130
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,100
to give it to me.

131
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,140
Come on.

132
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,900
I'm not that stingy.

133
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,620
Zhengang.

134
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,460
I think your station

135
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,370
deserves to have it.

136
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,980
Thank you, Captain Meng.

137
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,890

138
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,730
Lin.

139
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,740
Well,

140
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,620
put it

141
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,620
in our trophy room.

142
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:15,860
Okay.

143
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,140
Well,

144
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,580
I'd like to add something.

145
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,980
Sure.

146

Go ahead.

Well,

148
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,250
come to think of it,

149
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,220
for our fire station,

150
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,890
this object

151
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,980
is an honor

152
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,260
and also a legacy.

153
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,860
Captain Meng passed it to us today.

154
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,980
We'll go on to pass it down.

155
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,860
Yijiu.

156
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,060
Shiquan.

157
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,860
Yes.

158
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,260
The baton

159
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,370
is in your hands now.

160
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,850
Yes!

161
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,140
Captain Meng.

162
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,620
Are you okay?

163
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,460
Yes.

164
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,380
Go back, all of you.

165
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,340
You can't leave the station for long.

166
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,850
I've taken a leave.

167
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,900
I'll look after him today.

168
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,250
Okay.

169
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,080
The explosion at the port

170
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,490
is under investigation now.

171
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,890
You'll be on loan to the Fire Investigation Department.

172
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,260
Pull yourself together.

173
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,900
Report for duty today.

174
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,010
Captain Meng.

175
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,500
Can I report tomorrow?

176
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,500
I need to go back to the station for the handover

177
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,860
and hold a meeting with the boys.

178
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,850
They'll take breaks in turns

179
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,380
to take care of Yang.

180
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,610
He can't even

181
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,570
get off the bed himself.

182
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,860
Leaving him alone…

183
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,250
Okay.

184
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,460
Do it as you say.

185
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:32,860
Okay.

186
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
I'd like a moment alone.

187
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,500
Okay.

188
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,740
Assistant Liu.

189
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,730
Are you okay?

190
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,220
I've heard about

191
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,100
what happened to Instructor Yang.

192
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,940
If you need any help,

193
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,850
let me know.

194
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,780
What's up?

195
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,010
Okay. I'll be right there.

196
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,130
Are you alright?

197
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,610
Is the mission done?

198
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,260
Yes.

199
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,740
I'm fine.

200
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,500
But

201
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,980
Yang got injured.

202
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,780
Is it serious?

203
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,170
Qilei got injured?

204
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:35,980
Mom.

205
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,860
I'm fine.

206
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,610
Why are you there?

207
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,820
Something so big happened.

208
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,460
We have to come.

209

We've watched the news.

210
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,460
It was so scary.

211
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,020
Has the fire been put out?

212
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,570
You don't have to go there again, do you?

213
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,700
No.

214
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,860
Son.

215
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,370
You must be careful

216
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,380
when you go on missions.

217
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,620
I know, Mom.

218
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,480
Take good care of yourself and Dad.

219
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,380
Lei.

220
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,620
Don't worry

221
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,980
about us.

222
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,570
Focus on your work.

223
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,340
Your mom and I

224
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,500
are both fine.

225
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,820

226
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,130
You're a hero.

227
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,460
We've watched the news on TV.

228
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,980
When will you come back?

229
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,370
Miaomiao.

230
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,580
I'll go back as soon as my work is done, okay?

231
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,900
Listen to your mom at home.

232
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,860
Be good.

233
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,780
Okay?

234
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,300
Will you keep your word?

235
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,140
Of course.

236
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,140
Miaomiao misses you very much.

237
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,380
How about I take her to see you?

238
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,380
Not now.

239
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,250
Yang is injured.

240
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,740
I'm quite busy these days.

241
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:39,820
Even if you come,

242
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,260
I can't spend time with you.

243
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,620
Wait for a few days.

244
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,500
Okay?

245
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,860
Okay.

246

249
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,740
Take the boys back.

Lin.

251
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,260
Can you talk to Captain Meng

252
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,500
to transfer you back?

253
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,740
Yeah.

254
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,180
You've been transferred

255
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,730
and Yang is in hospital.

256
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,610
We can't do without a backbone.

257
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,720
If you're too embarrassed to bring it up,

258
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,740
we can

259
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,220
apply to Captain Meng together.

260
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,220
Yes, Director.

261
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,220
Come back.

262
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,260
Yes, Master.

263
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,100
We should

264
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,370
obey the orders

265
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,380
and do what we're told.

266
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,980
Without Yang and me,

267
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,580
you can still

268
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,860
do your jobs well at the station.

269
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,380
Besides,

270
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:51,700
Yang and I

271
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,660
are not the backbone of the station.

272
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,850
All of you guys

273
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,330

274
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,940
are the backbone of the station.

275
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,020
I think

276
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,620
Yang is gonna need money.

277
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,440
So I suggest

278
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,450
we all chip in.

279
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,260
Okay.

280
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,900
Okay. No problem.

281
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,980
I'll transfer it to you later.

282
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,450
Don't put up too much.

283
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,060
I'll ask Captain Meng

284
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,410
if the fire department

285
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,340
can give him some money

286
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,580
as compensation.

287
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,380
Honey.

288
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,650
I have something to discuss with you.

289
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,460
Can I use the money

290
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,450
we've saved

291
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,140
to buy our son a piano?

292
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,180
What?

293
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,720
Are you crazy?

294
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,540
That money is set aside for our son.

295
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,540
Don't yell.

296
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,380
I'm in the hospital.

297
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,940
Are you injured?

298
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,900
Not me.

299
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,610
Our instructor

300
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,940
is injured.

301
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,580
I want to help him.

302
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,140
Okay. I'll transfer the money to you now.

303
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,650
Thank you, honey.

304
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,220
Instructor Yang looked very calm.

305
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,380
He even joked with us.

306
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,610
He was just pretending.

307
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,140
I've known him for so many years.

308
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,540
I know him well.

309
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,460
On the surface,

310
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,210
he's fine.

311
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,530
But how can he possibly be fine?

312
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,820
He's been a firefighter for so many years.

313
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,420
Suddenly, he woke up and found himself injured,

314
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,100
his leg gone,

315
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,060
and that he had to leave his post.

316
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,140
He must be devastated.

317
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,340
You mean he was acting.

318
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,330
I wish

319
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,290
he had yelled

320
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,100
or cried just now.

321
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,460
No matter how he felt,

322
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,060
as long as he had let it out,

323
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,140
I wouldn't be so worried.

324
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,420
But he kept comforting us.

325
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,210
He kept all the pain

326
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,060

to himself.

328
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,530
Maybe as Instructor Yang said,

329
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,780
he'd been prepared for it.

330
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,930

A bit.

00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,620
It should be phantom pain.

How about I prescribe some medicine for you?

343
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,420

00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,330
Zhengang.

390
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,900
Take a look at this.

391
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,580
Instructor.

392
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,140
Coach Lin and I

393
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,020
chose this latest electric wheelchair for you.

394
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,770
Everyone at the station chipped in.

395
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,690
I didn't do much.

396
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,190
You should thank Nan Chu.

397
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,220
She searched online and did tests.

398
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,940
This one suits you the best.

399
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,940
You…

400
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,530
You shouldn't have bothered Nan Chu with it.

401
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,220
Why did you buy it?

402
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,180
It's a waste of money.

403
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,100
You said you wanted to travel around.

404
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,810
It's convenient to go out in it.

405
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,780
Right?

406
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:16,860
Try it.

407
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,770
Help him get on it.

408
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,640
Try it.

409
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,060
Yang.

410
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,370
Alright. I can get on it myself.

411
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,180
Okay. I got it.

412
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,930
I can do it myself.

413
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,660
Be careful.

414
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,700
It's okay.

415
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,020
Are you okay?

416
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,460
I'm fine.

417
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,050
Good.

418
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:40,860
Good.

419
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,420
Slow down.

420
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,540
How do you like it?

421
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,660
It works well.

422
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,540
Not bad.

423
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,700
It looks great.

424
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,460
Not bad.

425
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,650
You're good at it.

426
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,770
Careful.

427
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,530
Thank you.

428
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,540
It's okay.

429
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,820
Alright.

430
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,780
Have fun with it.

431
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,920
You guys, pack up for him.

432
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,900
I'll get him discharged.

433
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,460
Yes.

434
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,300
Yang, where are your clothes?

435
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,140
Are all the toiletries in there?

436
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,220
Yes. They're all in the cabinet.

437
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,820
Okay.

438
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,200
The clothes are over there.

439
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,380
Look. You can switch gears here.

440
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,010
The fire department

441
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,780
has paid the bill.

442
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,460
He can be discharged

443
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,180
after the paperwork is done.

444
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,100
Doctor.

445
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:22,380
[Prescription]

446
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,430
What are these medicines?
[Prescription]

447
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,620
What are these medicines?

448
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:24,900
Painkillers.

449
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,860
Painkillers?

450
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,930
Has his wound not healed yet?

451
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,430
Instructor Yang

452
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,940
is experiencing phantom pain.

453
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,620
Phantom pain?

454
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,380
Yes.

455
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,900
Many patients experience phantom pain

456
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,130
after amputations.

457
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,690
They feel acute pain in the limbs

458
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,280
that have been amputated.

459
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,500
Normally,

460
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,960
the pain lasts for one to three months.

461
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,540
However,

462
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,300
some may suffer it for a lifetime.

463
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,940
He never mentioned it.

464
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,460
We haven't known it for long.

465
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,440
He's only told us recently

466
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,490
because it hurts so much

467
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,220
that he can't sleep.

468
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,220
Is there any treatment

469
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,860
for it?

470
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,980
There's no effective treatment

471
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,890
for phantom pain in the world.

472
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,780
Painkillers only have the placebo effect.

473
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:08,820
I see.

474
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,780
Thank you.

475
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,700
You're welcome.

476
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,020
Coming.

477
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,660
The last dish.

478
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,850
Here comes the eggplant.

479
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,740
Braised pork.

480
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,900
Here is the eggplant.

481
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,820
Hold on.

482
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,420
So sumptuous.

483
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,260
Of course.

484
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:30,980
Let me tell you.

485
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,260
I'm the best cook

486
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,860
at the Special Division Station.

487
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,700
How about me?

488
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,660
You?

489
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,450
Your cooking is not as great as mine

490
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,020
but is definitely better than Lin's.

491
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,050
Hand out the chopsticks.

492
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,260
It's because Instructor Yang got discharged today

493
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,890
that we can enjoy such a great meal.

494
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:47,380
Really?

495
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,100
Yes.

496
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,140
Come on.

497
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,620
Let's have a toast

498
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,580
to Yang.

499
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,460
No, no.

500
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,300
Wait.

501
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,860
Instructor Yang got out of the hospital today.

502
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,020
We should let him

503
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,140
make a speech.

504
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,540
Yes.

505
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,460
I have nothing to say.

506
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,380
Let's eat.

507
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,650
Yang.

508
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,130
You have to say something today.

509
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,680
Yang.

510
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,690
You love to add something

511
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,450
when we have meetings.

512
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,380
It's been long since the last time you nagged us.

513
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,060
You must say something today.

514
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,180
We're all looking forward to it.

515
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,450
No one is allowed to interrupt him.

516
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,580
Including Lin.

517
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,700
Yes.

518
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,300
Say something.

519
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,060
Yes.

520
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,090
Speech.

521
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,860
Speech.

522
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,500
Alright.

523
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,450
Speech.

524
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,580
Don't push him.

525
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,540
He has nothing to say.

526
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,890
You're here for dinner, not for his speech.

527
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,060
You're the worst.

528
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,380
You don't have anything to say?

529
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,330
Fine.

530
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,180
Here is to Yang.

531
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,220
Cheers.

532
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,860
Cheers.

533
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,340
Cheers.

534
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,300
Sit down.

535
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,700
Don't be so formal.

536
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,620
You've never shown me so much respect.

537
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,540
We…

538
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,960
Okay. Sit down.

539
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,740
You should ask yourself

540
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,060
why we don't respect you.

541
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,620
Right?

542
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,460
I can drink you under the table with coke.

543
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,460
Bring it on.

544
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,700
Don't throw your weight around.

545
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,130
It doesn't work for me.

546
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,140
Shut up.

547
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,980
We live in the station together

548
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,660
but

549
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,380
barely have a chance to sit together like this.

550
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,890
Everyone is here today.

551
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,700
Let's drink to Yang.

552
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,460
Cheers.

553
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,290
Congratulations on your discharge.

554
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,180
Thank you.

555
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,780
Get well soon.

556
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,100
Cheers! Get well soon!

557
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,940
Cheers.

558
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,460
Well, let's…

559
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,930
Shut up.

560
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,610
That's Instructor Yang's line.

561
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,460
Let's dig in.

562
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,220
Dig in.

563
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:29,940
Let's drink.

564
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,930
Dig in.

565
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,490
Look at the eggplant.

566
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,140
Assistant Liu made the braised pork.

567
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,020
It smells so good.

568
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,810
Delicious.

569
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,460
Try the eggplant I made.

570
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,460
See which one you like more.

571
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,860
It's delicious, Nan Chu.

572
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,500
Is it?

573
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,620
Yes.

574
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,780
Take off your coat.

575
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:54,620
Okay.

576
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,020
Lie down.

577
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,060
I'll move the pillow for you.

578
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,180
Okay.

579
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,300
Alright.

580
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,420
Stop hanging around me.

581
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,180
Leave.

582
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,450
Are you shy?

583
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,660
The carer the station hired for you

584
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,280
will be here tomorrow morning.

585
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,180
See if you like them.

586
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,460
Call me

587
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,340
if you feel uncomfortable.

588
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,820
I know.

589
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,940
The painkillers are all here.

590
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,860
There are several boxes of them.

591
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,470
Take one pill or two

592
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,290
if it hurts a lot at night.

593
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,140
Okay. I got it.

594
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,860
Is one cup of water enough?

595
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,530
Okay.

596
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,380
If there's nothing else…

597
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,170
I'll get the wheelchair over.

598
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,620
In case you want to go to the toilet

599
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,850
at night.

600
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,890
Is it okay to put it here?

601
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,950
Yeah.

602
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,700
Leave now.

603
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,810
You've done a lot today.

604
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:07,940
Nan Chu.

605
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,140
Have a good rest.

606
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,610
Call me if you need anything.

607
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,780
I'll turn off the light.

608
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,890
Okay.

609
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,050
Nan Chu.

610
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,570
Thank you.

611
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,820
For what?

612
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,820
Thank you for staying by my side.

613
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,820
Ms. Cai said I'm lucky.

614
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,140
Do you think you are?

615
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,740
Of course I am.

616
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,180
Nan Chu.

617
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,010
Have you ever thought about this?

618
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,700
Perhaps,

619
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,620
the man you like

620
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,570
is the perfect guy

621
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,210
whom you spent five years imagining,

622
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,290
not me.

623
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,660
Xi Gu once asked me

624
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,140
the same question.

625
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,490
I was confused then,

626
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,900
so I didn't answer her.

627
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,140
Are you still confused now?

628
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,140
I admit,

629
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,660
for five years,

630
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,820
I kept thinking about a man.

631
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,220
But it was not in a romantic way.

632
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,340
I just admired and respected him.

633
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,690
When I found out that he was you,

634
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,620
I was blissed out.

635
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,420
I can tell you this for sure.

636
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,940
Before I knew the truth,

637
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,170
I'd fallen in love with you.

638
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,130
I love you,

639
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,820
the real you

640
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,460
who's standing right in front of me.

641
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,340
But my job

642
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,580
is really dangerous.

643
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,500
Look at Zhengang.

644
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,650
What do you want to say?

645
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,500
I want to say

646
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,570
that you'll live in fear if you stay with me.

647
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,620
Yeah.

648
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,940
I've been there.

649
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,980
I was terrified.

650
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,620
So what?

651
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,130
Will you break up with me just because of that?

652
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,500
Every year, there are dancers

653
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,940
getting paralyzed from the neck down

654
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,340
in accidents.

655
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,610
But we all stick it out.

656
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,530
There are traffic accidents every day.

657
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,250
Are we going to stay at home forever?

658
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,940
We can never know

659
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,220
what tomorrow will bring.

660
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,300
So why should we be bothered

661
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,340
by something that hasn't happened?

662
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,010
I just want you

663
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,130
to consider it carefully

664
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,540
before you choose me.

665
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,330
How about you?

666
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,010
Have you made up your mind?

667
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,780
Are you free tomorrow morning?

668
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,740
I want to take you somewhere.

669
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,450
Go back now.

670
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,460
Today,

671
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,540
we gather here

672
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,610
to mourn with heavy hearts

673
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,620
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

674
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,740
the valiant firefighters
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

675
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,180
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

676
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,810
who heroically sacrificed their lives
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

677
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,580
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

678
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,060
in the major explosion
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

679
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,660
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

680
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,030
at the South Bay Harbor.
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

681
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,100
at the South Bay Harbor.

682
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,420
They gave

683
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,690
their young and illustrious lives

684
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,580
for the greater good of our people.

685
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,820
Their valor remains eternally undiminished.

686
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,300
[R.I.P.]

687
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,820
Their unwavering spirit endures.
[R.I.P.]

688
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,700
[R.I.P.]

689
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,340
We shall forever hold in remembrance

690
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,450
every radiant smile now gone,

691
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,340
 as we carry forward

692
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,420
the mantle of duty and responsibility.

693
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:11,780
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

694
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,700
It was the commitment
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

695
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,460
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

696
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,300
etched in their minds
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

697
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,630
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

698
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,940
and will stand as an enduring monument

699
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,980
that future generations shall never forget.

700
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,770
They

701
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,620
sacrificed their lives

702
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,900
so that we can live.

703
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,530
They shall forever reside

704
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,740
within the hearts of each and every one of us.

705
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Salute!

706
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:51,070
[The martyrs' loyalty and heroic spirit endure forever.]

707
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,620
Nan Chu.

708
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,500
In times of peace,

709
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,810
being a firefighter is one of the most dangerous jobs.

710
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,060
On the day the explosion happened,

711
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,330
we had a brush with death too.

712
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,140
We survived

713
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,100
not because

714
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,700
we were abler than them,

715
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,700
but because we arrived later than them.

716
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,260
But even so,

717
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,620
Zhengang lost a leg.

718
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,060
Behind every martyr,

719
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,340
there is a broken family.

720
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,540
When Captain Meng was the commander,

721
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,980
he kept saying

722
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,060
that if we sweated more during the training,

723
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,890
we could bleed less in emergencies.

724
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,610
After I became the director,

725
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,130
I said that a lot too.

726
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,900
I believe

727
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,220
that when my students become mentors,

728
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,180
they'll say that as well.

729
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,940
But actually, we all know

730
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,460
that no matter how long we train

731
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,010
and how hard we train,

732
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,530
when faced with disasters,

733
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,420
we're just flesh and blood.

734
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,260
No one can avoid death.

735
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,170
Nan Chu.

736
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,460
I said so much to you

737
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,460
because I want you to think it over.

738
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,700
I've made up my mind.

739
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,140
If you choose me,

740
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,460
we'll definitely spend more time apart than together.

741
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,340
Then I should cherish

742
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,060
every moment when I'm with you.

743
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,020
You also have to brace yourself

744
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,300
for losing me.

745
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,210
Don't worry about me.

746
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,580
If you really died,

747
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,410
I could take good care of myself.

748
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,930
I've been living alone since I was young.

749
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,140
I'm used to it.

750
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,140
Sometimes,

751
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,010
death is not the scariest thing.

752
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,580
I understand.

753
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,100
I really do.

754
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,170
I don't want you to be everyone's hero.

755
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,460
You protect the world.

756
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,660
I protect you.

757
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:39,980
Nan Chu.

758
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,580
The last time

759
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,820
I made an oath under the national flag

760
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,780
was when I joined the fire department.

761
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,260
I volunteer to join

762
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,940
the national fire and rescue team.

763
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,260
I pledge unwavering loyalty to the Party,

764
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,500
strict adherence to discipline,

765
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,260
and willingness to face any challenge

766
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,220
in the service of our society.

767
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,140
I'm committed

768
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,690
to obeying orders,

769
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,300
following commands,

770
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,700
fulfilling my duties diligently,

771

00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,700
spread your fingers,

796
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,530

covers your hair.

805
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,860

tie them

00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,340
