Why are you eating this?

8
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,180
It's stinky.

9
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,780
It's fragrant.

10

What do you think

93

Let me tell you.

96
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,260
I think Nan Chu is a good kid.

97
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,820
She must be a good girl.

98
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,540
Yes.

99
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,770
Besides,

100
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,540
since she was little,

101
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,220
she's experienced more than others indeed.

102
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,220
That's right.

103
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,820
But the point is if Nan Chu

104
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,260
treats you

105
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,660
any differently.

106
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,780
I don't think so.

What?

I feel very relieved.

118
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,220
I remember

119
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,780
when I first met her,

120
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,540
she was in a dance club.

121
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,900
She was almost kicked out by the landlord then.

122
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,460
I thought it wasn't easy

123
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,100
for a young lady to deal with that.

124
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,820
I remember when we first met,

125
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,010
he helped us get rid of the landlord who made a false fire report.

126
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,900
I thought

127
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,260
he was very passionate.

128
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,020
He has an energy

129
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,660

and the matter with Sun Meng,

134
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,340
I thought that she

135
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,980
is very kind

136
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,140
and soft inside.

137
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,220
So I hope to be

138
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,460
as brave, strong,

139
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,060
and full of love like him.

141
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,020
you like him?

142
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,220
No.

I’m a trainee

144
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,340
and he is a coach.

145
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,340
I just want to learn from him.

146
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,780
Really?

147
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,580
Yes.

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,020
I was happy for nothing.

Now, I think

153
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,780
I should just forget it.

154
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,260
Just send it to me and let me take a look.

155
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,340
Hurry up.

156
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,220
Let me take a look.

157
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,140
Oh dear.

159
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,900
and you still don't admit that you like her?

160
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,580

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,780
Why are we back to that topic?

162
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,780
I didn't know you were so gossipy.

163

If I'm asking for your opinion,

164
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,780
then of course I'm hoping there will be a follow-up.

Look.

174
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,140
You're so narrow-minded.

175
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,220
Of course I care about Liu.

176
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,460

before I can think about myself.

193
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,900
After all, I’m an instructor

194
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,900
and the leader of our cadre.

195
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,020
Shouldn't an instructor

196
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,700
be a role model

197
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,340
and set an example

198
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,780
and take the lead?

199
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,340
You

200
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,340
are really boring.

201
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,460
Such a grouch.

202
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,220
I'm not talking to you anymore.

203
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:53,900
Go to sleep.

204
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,210
Come back.

205
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,890
We've been talking for a long time.

206
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,140
Let me interrogate you too.

207
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,900
Do you have a love interest?

208
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,620
I...

209
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,700
I don't have any.

210
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,460
Do you have anyone?

211
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,220
I really don't.

212
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,460
I can tell you have someone from your reaction.

213
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,660
I really don't.

214
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,900
Do you have someone?

215
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,100
No.

216
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,540
Do you have someone?

217
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,140
No.

218
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,780
Stop.

219
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,580
I'll tell you.

220
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,020
It hurts.

221
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:12,900
Tell me.

222
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,340
I...

223
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,500
Do you have someone or not?

224
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,460
Tell me quickly.

225
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,740
I think

226
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,180
it can be considered that I have someone.

227
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,300
You should know about it.

228
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,340
I do?

229
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,700
You can hear it every time before we're dispatched.

230
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,340
I can?

231
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,100
Who is it?

232
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,700
Is your brain CPU faulty?

233
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,820
Don't you remember?

234
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,050
Every time.

235
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,340
Heping Road. Heping Road.

236
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,100
A car accident happened on Dongsan Road.

237
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Two cars have collided.

238
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,220
One person is trapped in the car.

239
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,300
Command Center.

240
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,940
Command Center.

241
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,220
Roger that.

242
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,460
Dispatching three trucks and 16 people.

243
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,100
Yang Zhengang will be leading the cadre.

244
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,340
Roger that.

245
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,340
Please be careful

246
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,500
and return safely.

247
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,340
You like her voice?

248
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,100
Keep a low profile.

249
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,460
You're really progressive.

250
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,740
Instructor Yang.

251
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,580
Do you know her name?

252
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,060
No.

253
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,700
I just know that her surname is Li

254
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,490
and that she's female.

255
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
I don't know anything else.

256
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,220
I think you're not using your energy

257
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,940
in the right places.

258
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,220
If you asked around

259
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,980
and tried to get to know her,

260
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,580
how would you not even know her name?

261
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,180
What for?

262
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,460
It's pointless to ask.

263
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,180
Things have not even begun to take shape.

264
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,460
I haven't even met her before.

265
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,460
How can I get to know her?

266
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
But you

267
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,700
have a great opportunity right in front of you.

268
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,420
You meet her every day.

269
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,300
You have to seize the chance

270
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,100
and take the initiative.

271
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,180
If you keep up this good-for-nothing attitude,

272
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,300
let me tell you,

273
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,980
you'll never

274
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,500
make anything happen.

275
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,700
You...

276
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,340
just stay soft.

277
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,580
You're nothing.

278
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,220
You like her voice?

279
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,100
You're really something.

280
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,100
Heping Road. Heping Road.

281
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,220

[China Fire and Rescue]

309

Don't push your luck.

310
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,700
What do you mean?

311
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,620
What did you see?

312
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,980
Don't fight.

313
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,700
Nan Chu.

314
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,060
What are you doing?

315
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,220
Our show

316
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,100
just started,

317
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,980
and something like this already happened.

318
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,220
It won't be easy to deal with in the future.

319
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,420
This matter is indeed a bit troublesome.

320
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,620
Although

321
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,700
we just suppressed this matter,

322
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,340
the artists still have to get along in the show.

323
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,100
But now that their relationship has become like this,

324
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,460
the resentment won't be dissolved for a while.

325
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,930
I'm thinking

326
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,100
if we can

327
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,860
find a famous figure,

328
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,300
a big shot,

329
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
to appear in the show now

330
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,930
and attract more attention,

331
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,940
I believe

332
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,580
this negative news

333
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,970
will fade soon.

334
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,480
I agree.

335
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,100
I planned to

336
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,940
boost the show's popularity

337
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,290
by having a big shot show up in the third episode anyway.

338
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,290
After hearing what you've just said,

339
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,870
I suppose you already have a suitable candidate.

340
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,820
Do you know Ran Dongyang?

341
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,250
Of course.

342
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,060
It would be great if Mr. Ran could make an appearance.

343
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,700
I have connections with him.

344
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,100
You used to be called Tony.

345
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,420
Now I've to call you Brother Yang.

346
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,740
Please have a seat.

347
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,700
Chairman Han.

348
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,460
We’ve been in this industry

349
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,420
for a long time, right?

350
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,450
I know the rules.

351
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,700
I won't ask if you won't tell me.

352
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,340
But you spent so much time

353
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,180
and energy to support Nan Chu.

354
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,820
You must have your own reasons.

355
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,210
Don't worry.

356
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,820
I'll help you with this.

357
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,220
Great.

358
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,220
From now on,

359
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,580
Nan Chu is my sister.

360
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,060
I'll support Nan Chu

361
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,100
however you support my sister.

362
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,180
After hearing you say that,

363
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,220
I'm relieved.

364
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,700
It's a deal.

365
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,740
I'm

366
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,700
a sentimental person.

367
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,220
This time, as long as we solidify

368
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,980
the tough firefighter image,

369
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,690
with your reputation

370
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
and my resources,

371
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,820
I believe

372
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,700
we'll have many opportunities to work together in the future.

373
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,820
Chairman Han.

374
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,610
I’m not in it

375
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,180
for the money.

376
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,820
-I'm being paid below my usual rate.
-Of course.

377
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,580
You know that.

378
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,100
Secondly,

379
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,420
as an actor,

380
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,100
I don't like this kind of shows.

381
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,580
I'm an actor.

382
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,700
But do you know why I'm here?

383
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,740
Because of your character.

384
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,340
Great.

385
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,100
As for...

386
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,940
As for whether we'll have further cooperative opportunities,

387
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,580
we can talk about them later.

388
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,180
I don't care about that.

389
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,290
I believe in fate.

390
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,300
So let's go along with fate.

391
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,110
Okay.

392
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,300
Then

393
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,600
I look forward to working with you.

394
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,770
Chairman Han.

395
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,240
I look forward to working with you.

396
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,650
[Zong]

397
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,780
Hey, Zong.

398
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,040
Didn't I tell you

399
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,180
to call me Guangzong when no one is around?

400
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,530
I'll pick you up after the show tomorrow.

401
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,170
I...

402
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,640
When did you two become so close?

403
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,650
Is Nan Chu there too?

404
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,780
Let her talk to me.

405
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,660
Okay.

406
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,030
Hello, Zong.

407
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,500
The crew hired a big shot.

408
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,480
You have to control your temper this time.

409
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,990
Be nice, okay?

410
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,250
Who is it?

411
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,720
Ran Dongyang.

412
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,690
Even Yan Dai has to address him

413
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,160
as Senior in front of him.

414
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,720
Most importantly,

415
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,060
Mr. Ran has a good reputation

416
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,280
in the industry.

417
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,830
If you leave a good impression,

418
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,970
you'll even have a chance to work together in the future.

419
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,320
Okay, got it.

420
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,340
Don't make me and Xi Gu worry about you.

421
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,470
I'm hanging up.

422
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,440
Okay.

423
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,090
You and Xi Gu...

424
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,910
Let's pack up.

425
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,100
By the way, Nan Chu,

426
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,200
I suddenly recalled that I have something to do tomorrow.

427
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,080
No.

428
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,090
I have something to do now.

429
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,850
Sorry, I have to go now.

430
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,200
See you tomorrow.

431
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,750
Mr. Ran.

432
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,440
Thank you for coming to see me despite your busy schedule.

433
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,450
All right.

434
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,680
You went through so many people to find me.

435
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,990
Just tell me what you need help with.

436
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,470
I still have to discuss the script

437
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,180
with the screenwriter and director later.

438
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,320
Sir.

439
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,170
Actually, I've liked you since I was a kid.

440
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,310
When I heard that you were joining Flaming Youth,

441
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,960
I was so excited that I almost fainted.

442
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,720
So I thought

443
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,080
that I must meet you no matter what.

444
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,590
You don't have to flatter me.

445
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,440
Just tell me your request.

446
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,960
I don't have any request.

447
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,560
I just hope that in the show,

448
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,700
I could assist you by your side

449
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,460
and be of help to you.

450
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,520
I see.

451
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,460
You're not very valued in the show.

452
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,040
You found out.

453
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,830
You're right.

454
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,190
But it's normal for a little known actor like me

455
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,490
to not be valued in the show.

456
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,360
But you're different.

457
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,470
Can you accept being a supporting character?

458
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,160
Actually,

459
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,180
I wanted to tell you that from the beginning.

460
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,440
But because

461
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,370
I was so excited to see such a big shot

462
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,500
like you,

463
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,060
my mind went blank.

464
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,520
Tell me the truth.

465
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,390
After the conversation just now,

466
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,740
are you still nervous when you see me?

467
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,240
After spending some time with me, you'll realize

468
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,630
that I'm actually quite easy-going.

469
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:31,920
Then, sir,

470
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,050
I'll just tell you.

471
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,360
Only the two of us can know about this.

472
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Actually,

473
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,360
only after I came to this show did I realize

474
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,450
that this show

475
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,130
was entirely just to promote a newcomer.

476
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,310
Her name is Nan Chu.

477
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,860
Don't mention me.

478
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,190
Even Yan Dai is just a foil for her.

479
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,080
I know about that.

480
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,390
You do?

481
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,210
Then why did you still come?

482
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,270
Girl.

483
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,290
Who am I?

484
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,690
I was at my peak when I debuted.

485
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,950
Why do you think I've managed to dominate the industry

486
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,110
throughout all these years?

487
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,940
It's because of my acting skills.

488
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,620
For a scene,

489
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,350
even if I have no lines,

490
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,780
I can garner all of the audience's attention

491
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,040
onto me.

492
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,560
What is this called?

493
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,750
This is called acting.

494
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,220
What is an actor?

495
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,790
This is a real actor.

496
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,020
In a scene,

497
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,740
the one who can act

498
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,800
is the lead.

499
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:31,980
Sir.

500
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,530
You're amazing.

501
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,740
When can I get to your level?

502
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,760
I can give you the chance,

503
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,530
but whether you can get the scene

504
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,370
will depend on your capabilities.

505
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,480
I don't need any scenes.

506
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,620
I just want you to be popular like you.

507
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,630
I'll be a supporting character by your side

508
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:52,810
and just share some of your limelight.

509
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,040
Can you drink?

510
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,070
I have a dinner tonight.

511
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,210
I'll take you with me

512
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,800
and introduce you to some resources

513
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,400
that will be good for your development.

514
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,000
I think your qualities and image

515
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:08,720
are decent.

516
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,120
But sir,

517
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,100
didn't you say you have a meeting

518
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,370
with the director about the script tonight?

519
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,510
Tell the director and the screenwriter

520
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,230
to change our meeting to tomorrow.

521
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:43,580
Mr. Jiang.

522
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,630
Mr. Ran.

523
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,560
Welcome.

524
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,940
Last night, I came here

525
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,330
as soon as the shooting ended.

526
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,510
Thank you.

527
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,530
Mr. Jiang.

528
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,010
You didn't have to welcome me so elaborately.

529
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,480
This is the firefighters' show.

530
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,570
They are the stars.

531
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,040
I'm a supporting character.

532
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,800
Mr. Ran, you're right.

533
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,550
Hello, everyone.

534
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,100
Hello, everyone.

535
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,600
Hello, everyone.

536
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,270
I'm Ran Dongyang.

537
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,570
I'm Ran Dongyang.

538
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,160
Nice to meet you.

539
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,830
Nice to meet you.

540
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,130
It's hot.

541
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,560
I bought milk tea for everyone

542
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,230
to cool down.

543
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,070
Let me help you.

544
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,530
Don't bother.

545
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,080
There's more.

546
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,000
Thank you, Mr. Ran.

547
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,510
You're welcome.

548
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:10,970
You're welcome.

549
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:11,560
Thank you, Mr. Ran.

550
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,530
You're so handsome.

551
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,140
You're young and promising.

552
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:17,600
Here.

553
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,360
Ran, you're a veteran

554
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,620
but you still take such good care of us.

555
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,080
Work hard.

556
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,750
Let's work hard together.

557
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,340
Thank you, Ran.

558
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,320
Dai.

559
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,990
Long time no see.

560
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,420
Give me a hug.

561
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,600
Long time no see.

562
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:28,900
Here.

563
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,720
I always see you on TV.

564
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,030
Your performance has improved a lot.

565
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,710
Thank you.

566
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,880
Mr. Ran.

567
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,770
Hello.

568
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,200
I'm Yi, Xu Zhiyi.

569
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,750
Yi, Xu Zhiyi, right?

570
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,930
Nice to meet you.

571
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,470
Nice to meet you.

572
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,240
I look forward to working with you.

573
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,830
Let's work hard together.

574
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,010
Here, have some milk tea.

575
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,190
Who is this girl?

576
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:50,950
Hello, Mr. Ran.

577
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,660
I'm Nan Chu.

578
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,470
Nan Chu.

579
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,370
Here.

580
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:56,700
Have some milk tea.

581
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,170
Thank you.

582
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,720
Thank you for everyone's hard work.

583
00:20:59,010 --> 00:20:59,480
I look forward to your guidance.

584
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,020
I look forward to your guidance.

585
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,740
I look forward to your guidance.

586
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,410
Here.

587
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:01,950
Have some milk tea.

588
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Take it.

589
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,060
I think Ran Dongyang is weird.

590
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,150
Anyway, I don't like him.

591
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,250
Mr. Jiang.

592
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,550
Our show

593
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,480
wants to reflect the real firefighting life, right?

594
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,870
I have a small suggestion.

595
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,310
We can add some interactive live streaming sessions

596
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,620
so that we can communicate

597
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,380
with our audiences in real time.

598
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,030
I can be a temporary host

599
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,170
and introduce it to the audience.

600
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,300
For free.

601
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:36,980
Yes.

602
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,750
Mr. Ran made such a good point.

603
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,040
Yes.

604
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,850
Actually before I came here,

605
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,200
I did a lot of research.

606
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,460
Many netizens

607
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,760
even raised some doubts

608
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,850
about our program.

609
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,410
They said that it's impossible for firefighters

610
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,440
to have so many dramatic missions.

611
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,240
They're suspicious that they're made up.

612
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,130
I think that's too unfair.

613
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,720
So adding

614
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,400
some interactive live streaming sessions

615
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,290
can honestly reflect

616
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,430
the life of a firefighter

617
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,950
and also let the audience know and feel

618
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,630
how tough it is

619
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:07,730
to be a firefighter.

620
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,860
Mr. Ran.

621
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,040
Here's the thing.

622
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,600
I didn't consider live streaming before

623
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,450
because I'm afraid it might conflict

624
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,040
with our current format.

625
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,600
And if any unexpected situations come up

626
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,980
during the live stream,

627
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,490
it'll be hard to handle them.

628
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,260
Mr. Ran.

629
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,850
This is still not appropriate.

630
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,530
A firefighter's hard work

631
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,300
has never been for show.

632
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,450
They don't do it to get applause and rewards.

633
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,680
And suddenly adding the live streaming segment

634
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,070
will cause unnecessary trouble

635
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,370
to the station's operation.

636
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,470
How is it trouble?

637
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,860
You make it sound so severe.

638
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,470
Are you worried that your image will be affected?

639
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
What image?

640
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:45,990
All right.

641
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,830
Why do I smell gunpowder?

642
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,510
Why did we come

643
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,400
all the way here for?

644
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,240
To learn about the spirit of a firefighter,

645
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,680
especially about teamwork.

646
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,280
But what Nan Chu said just now

647
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,410
has a point too.

648
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,470
It's not enough that we understand it.

649
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,940
We have to let the audience understand too.

650
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,690
Right?

651
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,670
What Mr. Ran said makes sense too.

652
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,050
But for this matter,

653
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,310
we still have to discuss it with Director Lin

654
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,410
before making a decision.

655
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,550
I heard

656
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,060
everything Mr. Ran just said.

657
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,450
There's one thing that's true.

658
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,210
In the firefighting team,

659
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,690
teamwork is indeed the most important.

660
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,710
But the live streaming you were talking about

661
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,440
is an additional program format.

662
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,460
We also need to report to the superiors

663
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,210
and get approval.

664
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,520
So we won't consider it for today.

665
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,400
Okay?

666
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,710
Today, we're mainly practicing

667
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,460
the climbing training,

668
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,440
which is also a standard training for firefighters.

669
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,410
Later, I'll get Yijiu and Shiquan

670
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,210
to guide you through the experience,

671
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:35,970
okay?

672
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,470
Okay.

673
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,020
No problems, right?

674
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,070
Yijiu. Shiquan.

675
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:38,990
Yes!

676
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,700
Take the artist group

677
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,710
to prepare for climbing training.

678
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,220
Yes.

679
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,600
Everyone.

680
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,110
Turn and look right.

681
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,510
Look forward.

682
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:47,770
At ease.

683
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,070
Attention!

684
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,540
Let’s start the training.

685
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,050
Boys in one group

686
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:52,980
and girls in another.

687
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,770
Train separately.

688
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,170
Sir.

689
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,450
I think we should practice in random groups.

690
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,480
Before coming here, I read a lot of public opinions online.

691
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,790
They were wondering why there are many female firefighters in other countries

692
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,940
but not many in our country.

693
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,040
In fact, a woman's physique

694
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,670
is just as good as a man's.

695
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:13,470
This kind of thinking

696
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,780
that treats men and women differently

697
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,540
should be changed.

698
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,200
Mr. Ran, what do you mean?

699
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,980
I'm just making an immature suggestion.

700
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,990
A little idea.

701
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,850
I suggest everyone choose their own groups.

702
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,520
Choose your own group.

703
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,160
What Mr. Ran said

704
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,970
will bring more highlights to the show indeed.

705
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,890
But I don't know

706
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,360
if it will violate the rules.

707
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,130
Mr. Jiang.

708
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,400
There are no clear stipulations in this station.

709
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,070
But...

710
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,040
Mr. Ran.

711
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,630
I want to team up with you.

712
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,980
And...

713
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,740
Yan Dai.

714
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,670
Mr. Jiang, can we team up like this?

715
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,980
How about this?

716
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,700
Nan Chu,

717
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,710
Zheng Ping, Liu Xiahan and I will be in a group.

718
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,710
The rest of you will be in a group.

719
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,210
Don't give in to me

720
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,380
just because I'm an old veteran.

721
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,230
I'll say the same thing.

722
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,130
I just suggested a little idea.

723
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,890
An immature suggestion.

724
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,530
You're free to refute it.

725
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,380
Feel free to say anything.

726
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,600
Mr. Ran.

727
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,030
What you said makes so much sense.

728
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,710
We sincerely want to team up with you.

729
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,390
Mr. Ran is right.

730
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,400
I have nothing to say.

731
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,980
You can follow me and get familiar with it.

732
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,370
So fast.

733
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,550
Cool.

734
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,490
Do you understand?

735
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,660
Yes.

736
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,760
The artist group, get ready.

737
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,700
Is there a camera up there?

738
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,540
Do you have a camera?

739
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,170
Yes.

740
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:42,970
Makeup artist.

741
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,190
Give me the water spray.

742
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,250
Is it obvious in the camera?

743
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,140
Come on. Here?

744
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,150
From here.

745
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,710
Once I make my first step,

746
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,430
come towards me

747
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,730
and zoom in.

748
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,150
Okay.

749
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,530
Make it look powerful.

750
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,150
Sir, come on!

751
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:06,990
Come on!

752
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,460
Is this enough footage?

753
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:08,880
Yes.

754
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,470
Do I look cool?

755
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:09,890
Yes.

756
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,310
Okay.

757
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,150
That's it for me.

758
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,540
Come on, Zhiyi. It's your turn.

759
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,440
Cut out his entire part.

760
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,230
Okay.

761
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,610
Sorry.

762
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,620
Mr. Ran is resting.

763
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,750
He doesn't want to be filmed.

764
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,760
Thank you. I'm sorry.

765
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,120
Why did they shoot that just now?

766
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,970
It's not entertaining at all.

767
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,360
-Shouldn't we add some singing and dancing?
-What?

768
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,500
You're so dramatic.

769
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,680
Yan Dai.

770
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,390
Do you want to sit?

771
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,360
No thanks, you can sit alone.

772
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,430
You're so serious.

773
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,710
She's trying to do more to show off

774
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,470
and stand out.

775
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,860
So annoying.

776
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,370
She is so competitive.

777
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,220
Then give her an arc where she loves to compete

778
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,660
and gets into conflicts with others

779
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,430
and then eventually becomes cannon fodder.

780
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,960
We don't have a script for this show.

781
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,220
Dai.

782
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,700
I thought you're a veteran.

783
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,550
I didn't expect you to be so naive.

784
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,150
Anyway,

785
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,670
you have the right to choose.

786
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:13,980
Think carefully

787
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,710
about what you should do.

788
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,200
Have you all rested well?

789
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,760
Let’s continue with the training.

790
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,680
Coach.

791
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,120
Coach.

792
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,780
I think such simple training

793
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,920
doesn't quite serve the purpose of forming groups.

794
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,190
Why don't we have a direct competition?

795
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,790
Among the losing group,

796
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,630
one member will be eliminated on the spot.

797
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,900
When you have the desire to win, you'll be more enthusiastic.

798
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,740
Right?

799
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,710
That makes sense.

800
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:53,970
That's just right.

801
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,600
We have the live interactive live streaming segment.

802
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,030
We don't need internal judges.

803
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,050
Let the audience decide the winner.

804
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,430
That's the fairest way.

805
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,150
Right?

806
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,840
What do you think, Dai?

807
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:06,610
Yes.

808
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,740
Let's live the choice up to the audience.

809
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,170
Listen up.

810
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,430
I'm not doing a talent show.

811
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,690
I want to highlight

812
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,200
the feeling and effect of our teamwork.

813
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,970
And the competition goes against the original intention of the rescue.

814
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,230
If you have any new ideas,

815
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,000
please raise them when Director Lin is here.

816
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,680
For now, we must train according to the original plan.

817
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:22,990
Is there any problem?

818
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:24,920
Director Lin.

819
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,060
Mr. Ran said that he wants to include an elimination system.

820
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,120
Coach.

821
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,630
You misunderstood me.

822
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,240
I proposed this competition with good intentions.

823
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,760
I saw that everyone was practicing so hard

824
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,980
but we still lack the fighting spirit.

825
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,120
For our show,

826
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,220
we should also express this spirit of tenacity.

827
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:41,890
Besides,

828
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,120
Mr. Jiang also proposed the competition system before.

829
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,310
I did.

830
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,200
But I hope to attract the competition system

831
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,880
would create more highlights and emphasize cohesion,

832
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,900
instead of eliminating people.

833
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,550
I...

834
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,440
I just proposed

835
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,710
a little immature suggestion.

836
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:03,850
Do you know anything about firefighting?

837
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,160
If you don't,

838
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,540
then stop making reckless suggestions

839
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,930
and just follow the coach.

840
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:09,860
Start the training.

841
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,450
Yes.

842
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,930

You haven't eaten?

848
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,640
It's still hot.

849
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,390
I don't want it.

850
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,690
Put it there.

851
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,280
Okay.

852
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,620
How's the matter about your son's school enrolment?

853
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,210
It can't be settled so soon.

854
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,300
Dalong said he'll ask around for me.

855
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,400
The matter of a kid's school enrolment is really troublesome.

856
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,830
Well,

857
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,270
about Dalong's food processing plant,

858
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,030
isn't it about to be open for business soon?

859
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,970
He needs to check the firefighting system in two days.

860
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,650
He asked me to ask around

861
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,290
if we can go there in advance

862
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,890
to help him check it out.

863
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,510
Back then, I told him

864
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,230
that it won't do.

865
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,200
It's violating the rules.

866
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,790
If word gets out,

867
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,630
It'll affect you.

868
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,910
But he kept pestering me.

869
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,000
He's been pestering me several times,

870
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,720
saying that on account of our friendship,

871
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,860
I should

872
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,540
help him check it out privately.

873
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,380
So did you promise him?

874
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,270
Of course not.

875
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,750
I wanted to reject him directly.

876
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,470
But then I thought,

877
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,060
don't we have

878
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,460
the Six Familiarities tradition?

879
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,770
Coincidentally, his factory is still within our jurisdiction.

880
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,790
Why don't we go and take a look?

881
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,300
What if there is a fire hazard?

882
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,280
We can ask him to correct it in advance, right?

883
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,230
Okay.

884
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,420
The Six Familiarities...

885
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:53,640
Okay.

886
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,240
Let's not go as his friend.

887
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,220
The crew

888
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,650
wants to film a scene the Six Familiarities anyway.

889
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,220
Let's officially lead the team over.

890
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,400
Okay.

891
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,040
Enjoy your meal.

892
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,210
I'll call him and let him know.

893
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,070
Hello, Mr. Ran.

894
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,160
Let's skip the formalities.

895
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,510
Don't call me Mr. Ran.

896
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,910
Just call me Ran.

897
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:34,970
Are you studying?

898
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,490
What are you reading?

899
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,390
Nan Chu.

900
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,870
I think

901
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,980
you have no desire to perform well.

902
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,230
Mental Training Guide for Firefighters.

903
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,200
Why?

904
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,980
Do you have any prejudice

905
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,160
against me?

906
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,360
I know I'm a rookie so I shouldn't say too much,

907
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,290
but a simulated rescue is also a form of rescue.

908
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,850
If you violate its rules

909
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,150
for the sake of fun,

910
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,070
I don't think it's appropriate.

911
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,710
This is my honest thought.

912
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,950
Nan Chu.

913
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,470
I don't want to nag,

914
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,480
but you

915
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,210
are still young indeed.

916
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,470
You don't know how to talk nicely.

917
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,500
And you talk too much.

918
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,380
Let me ask you.

919
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,310
What is fun?

920
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,440
What is entertaining?

921
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,000
Being compelling to watch

922
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,130
is the most basic and necessary quality

923
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,190
of a show.

924
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,780
Understand?

925
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,370
This is called switching concepts.

926
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,220
If the competition is the highlight,

927
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,360
then everyone would be preoccupied

928
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,410
with how to not get eliminated.

929
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,880
They'll change the way they act,

930
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,010
and the nature of the show will be altered.

931
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,270
Come on.

932
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,150
Get off your high horse.

933
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,030
And why are you blaming me?

934
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,170
Let me ask you.

935
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,740
Are there cameras everywhere

936
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,170
in this room?

937
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,140
Then they'll edit a cut for you

938
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,950
to create a studious image of you?

939
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,390
And then when you go into the scene of fire,

940
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,480
you'll save someone?

941
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,450
Nan Chu.

942
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,670
You sure are the pinnacle of perfection.

943
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,220
You can go up...

944
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:15,890
Stop there!

945
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:16,730
Stop there!

946
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,440
Nan Chu.

947
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,850
Nan Chu, let me tell you.

948
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,950
I, the great Ran Dongyang, am here to support you.

949
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,760
Show some respect.

950
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,600
Understand?

951
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,520
Understand?

952
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,780
Why are you so angry?

953
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,750
What is it?

954
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,450
Director Lin, well...

955
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,130
It's late. You're still not asleep?

956
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,180
You know it's so late too.

957
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,700
What time is it?

958
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,460
Why are you yelling here?

959
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,980
There are rules in the station, you know?

960
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,240
Yes.

961
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,180
Director Lin, I...

962
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,780
I don't know much, so I talk a lot of nonsense.

963
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,980
If your script's nature is ruined,

964
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,620
let me know in advance.

965
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,470
I'll cooperate with you completely.

966
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,190
Complete cooperation. Don't worry.

967
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,700
Two things.

968
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,300
Firstly,

969
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,740
don't talk about things you don't understand.

970
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,300
Secondly, if you want to put on a show here,

971
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,390
leave now.

972
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,200
Don't wait for me to get angry at you.

973
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:10,830
No.

974
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:11,960
Captain Lin, no I mean...

975
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,350
Director Lin, I didn’t mean that.

976
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,130
I'm old.

977
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,320
I can't remember things well.

978
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,750
Our show is

979
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,650
is a semi-documentary without a script, right?

980
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:26,790
Got it.

981
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,340
A semi-documentary without a script.

982
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,080
Nan Chu.

983
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,550
Little girl.

984
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,900
We're all doing this for the sake of the show

985
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,910
and for high ratings.

986
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,250
Don't take it to heart.

987
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,530
Director Lin, you guys can continue talking.

988
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,960
I'm leaving.

989
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,430
Bye. Bye.

990
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,590
Don't take it to heart.

991
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,450
What's wrong with him?

992
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,510
Who knows?

993
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,570
Was he bullying you?

994
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,250
No.

995
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,050
Thank you.

996
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,090
Tell me if he bothers you again.

997
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:13,030
Stay in the dorm when you have nothing to attend to at night.

998
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,240
Don't wander around.

999
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:15,970
Okay.

1000
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,270
How does something new crop up every day?

1001
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,530
[Infirmary]

1002
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,830
[Infirmary]

1003
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,950
Hello, babies.

1004
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,120
You didn't recognize me, did you?

1005
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,810
I'm Ran Dongyang.

1006
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,250
Let me tell you.

1007
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,440
Today is my first day as a firefighter.

1008
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,570
Here, take a look.

1009
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,990
I think you all can see

1010
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,970
that I hurt my forehead, right?

1011
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,270
Yes.

1012
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,960
I wasn't careful during the training...

1013
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,550
No.

1014
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,940
Babies, let me tell you.

1015
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,460
I'm not trying to gain sympathy

1016
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,310
from you all.

1017
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,190
It's not like that.

1018
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,990
What do I mean?

1019
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,380
I just want to remind you...

1020
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,240
Everyone, hurry up.

1021
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,470
When we have to prepare for real dispatches,

1022
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,860
we don't have a lot of time

1023
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,120
to waste on adjusting your clothes.

1024
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,360
Xu Zhiyi, hurry up.

1025
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,840
Director Lin.

1026
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,560
I’m done.

1027
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,400
Me too.

1028
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,770
It can be better.

1029
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,130
No matter what the mission is,

1030
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,490
you must check the equipment before you leave.

1031
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,120
Understand?

1032
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,960
Yes.

1033
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,060
I'm sorry.

1034
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,410
I...

1035
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,090
I still feel a little dizzy,

1036
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:06,800
so I'm late.

1037
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,860
I'm sorry.

1038
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,490
Make your report.

1039
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,160
Report!

1040
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:10,920
Fall in.

1041
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,460
Yes.

1042
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,420
This is...

1043
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,770
Are we preparing for a mission?

1044
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,650
Ran.

1045
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,890
Today, Director Lin will lead us in the Six Familiarities

1046
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,190
at a food processing plant.

1047
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,160
Six...

1048
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,180
Six Familiarities?

1049
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,150
Six Familiarities refer to

1050
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,410
being familiar with the roads within our jurisdiction,

1051
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,880
the water source and building distribution,

1052
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,820
and within the key units,

1053
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,530
the firefighting facilities,

1054
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,920
the firefighting organizational situation,

1055
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,050
and accident handling procedures.

1056
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,640
Six Familiarities.

1057
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,070
Okay.

1058
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:40,530
Good.

1059
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,120
Nice.

1060
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,010
As trainees,

1061
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,830
we should be familiar with what we should know, right?

1062
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,430
We aren't usually in charge of fire safety inspection.

1063
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,830
But this time, through the show,

1064
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,840
we must showcase it to the audience,

1065
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,020
and also check

1066
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,530
how much you've learnt during this period.

1067
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,130
Coach.

1068
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,020
There's something I don’t understand.

1069
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,820
Well...

1070
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,000
Didn't you say there won't be any eliminations?

1071
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,310
Why is there an assessment?

1072
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,910
An assessment doesn't mean elimination.

1073
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,840
An assessment is to find out the problems

1074
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,190
and to solve them.

1075
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,410
I always emphasize

1076
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,330
that firefighting

1077
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,470
is a cooperative job.

1078
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,150
Every part is essential.

1079
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,240
Understand?

1080
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,000
Yes.

1081
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,970
Director Lin.

1082
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,120
Director Lin.

1083
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,960
I'm sorry.

1084
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,170
Sorry for not welcoming you properly.

1085
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,560
Dagang.

1086
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,840
This time,

1087
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,310
since you're Dagang's friend

1088
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,500
and you also happen to be in our jurisdiction,

1089
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,970
we came here to help you take a look.

1090
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,070
But in the end, you'll still have to follow

1091
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,830
the requirements of the Fire Safety Inspection Department.

1092
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,460
Okay?

1093
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,050
Got it.

1094
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,140
I totally understand.

1095
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,860
You personally checking it for us

1096
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,460
is already doing us a huge favor.

1097
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,260
Can you show me

1098
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:47,850
a blueprint of your factory?

1099
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:48,310
Yes.

1100
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,450
Give me the blueprint.

1101
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,550
Here.

1102
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,310
-This is it.
-Yes.

1103
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,970
[Factory] [Entrance guards] [Reserved land] [Employee dormitory]

1104
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,400
What's wrong with this area?
[Factory] [Entrance guards] [Reserved land] [Employee dormitory]

1105
00:38:59,400 --> 00:38:59,610
What's wrong with this area?

1106
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,470
W-We had plans

1107
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,430
for this area.

1108
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,400
But later we...

1109
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,240
we couldn't do it.

1110
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,370
And I...

1111
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,930
the map was not updated.

1112
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:08,520
So I

1113
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,860
just scrapped it.

1114
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,670
I see.

1115
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,060
Dagang, take a team to inspect the canteen

1116
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,860
and the employee dormitory.

1117
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,360
Okay.

1118
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,670
I'll inspect the office building and the factory.

1119
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,150
And Zheng Yang.

1120
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:20,610
Yes.

1121
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,670
Take them to inspect park area.

1122
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,550
Yes.

1123
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,060
All right.

1124
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,900
Okay.

1125
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,790
Come on.

1126
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,580
Come in.

1127
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,260
Please come with me.

1128
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:28,760
Here.

1129
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,350
This way.

1130
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,310
This way, please.

1131
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,280
Here's the thing.

1132
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,990
Our factory

1133
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,180
is about seven to eight years old.

1134
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:34,980
Yes.

1135
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,290
What's with these construction waste?

1136
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,810
They piled them up here temporarily.

1137
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:22,440
They'll clear them soon.

1138
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,870
It shouldn't be here even temporarily.

1139
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,900
You must get rid of it.

1140
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:25,690
Yes.

1141
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,240
Do you see that the fire hydrant is covered up?

1142
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,430
Listen.

1143
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,360
This is a violation of Article 28 of the Fire Safety Act.

1144
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,080
It's not a joke.

1145
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,840
Yes, sir.

1146
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,810
It's my fault.

1147
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,650
It's a negligence of my management. I'll handle it right away.

1148
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,000
Get rid of it immediately.

1149
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,960
Yes.

1150
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,550
Emphasize it.

1151
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,060
Take photos.

1152
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,520
Note it down.

1153
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,110
No.

1154
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,990
Sir.

1155
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,000
What's wrong with you guys?

1156
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:47,890
Sir.

Come here.

1164
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,600
What's going on?

1165
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,110
What's wrong?

1166
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,670
Ran thinks Chen Yilong

1167
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,430
is being sneaky,

1168
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,400
so there must be something wrong.

1169
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:16,990
What's the problem?

1170
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,830
I don't know.

1171
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,810
But as long as we find the problem

1172
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,980
and expose it,

1173
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,420
we'll become the highlight of the show.

1174
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,350
Nonsense.

1175
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,610
Director Lin said

1176
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,250
that we can't act on our own without permission.

1177
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,150
Director Lin.

1178
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,990
The way you address him makes you sound so intimate.

1179
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,250
What's your relationship with him?

1180
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,770
You keep mentioning Director Lin.

1181
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,990
Let me ask you.

1182
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,300
How many cuts were you in

1183
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,440
over the past few episodes?

1184
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,170
Yes, Yan Dai.

1185
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,890
Look at Director Lin.

1186
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,490
It always seems like he's reprimanding Nan Chu.

1187
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,470
But he always stands up for her.

1188
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:51,810
Yan Dai.

1189
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,990
Think about what happened

1190
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,300
the last time.

1191
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,810
Are you satisfied?

1192
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,870
To be honest,

1193
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,760
for me,

1194
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,530
one more or one less show

1195
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,000
doesn't make a difference.

1196
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,130
It really doesn't matter to me.

1197
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,640
But for you,

1198
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:08,900
it's different.

1199
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:11,510
You are in the developing stage.

1200
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,770
If you just go on like this,

1201
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:14,990
if it were me,

1202
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,870
I would quit.

1203
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,010
Really, I would quit.

1204
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,170
Well,

1205
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,850
I plan to record more content

1206
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,950
and post it online.

1207
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,970
It'll definitely create a trending topic.

1208
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:28,770
Right?

1209
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,530
Yan Dai.

1210
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,460
Let's go.

1211
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,520
I don't think it's a good idea.

1212
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,400
Enough.

1213
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,500
Stop dawdling.

1214
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,880
I'm here.

1215
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,850
Don't worry.

1216
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,320
It's up to you

1217
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,630
to seize your own opportunities.

1218
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,580
Yan Dai.

1219
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,420
Let's go.

[Tips for Fire Safety]

1221
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,460
I'll give everyone

1222
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,850
a daily fire safety tip.

1223
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:55,560
The hair dryer

1224
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,500
is an electrical appliance that we often use.

1225
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,850
If the ventilation of the hair dryer

1226
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,400
is blocked in any way,

1227
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,380
the electric wire will overheat.

1228
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,110
With the high temperature, it may cause a fire.

1229
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,080
A friendly reminder.

1230
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,640
Please purchase legitimate products.

1231
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,040
Don't leave it running without supervision

1232
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,550
and don't use it for too long.

1233
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,160
Don't block or cover the vents.

1234
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,060
Try not to blow it backwards with the vent facing your hair.

1235
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,990
It's easy for your hair to get stuck into it.
