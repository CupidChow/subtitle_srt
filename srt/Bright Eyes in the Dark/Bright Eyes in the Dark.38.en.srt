are you tired?

It's too hot.

I was bitten by a snake.

40
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,380
Is your leg wounded?

41
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,060
Let me take a look.

42
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,060
It hurts.

00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,700

Is it a poisonous snake?

Is it a poisonous snake?

46
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,100
It's really a poisonous snake.

47
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,980
What should we do?

48
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,700
Send him to the hospital.

49
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,500
What are we waiting for?

50
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,500
Oh no.

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,820
I don't think I can feel my leg.

52
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
It's too late to send him to the hospital.

53
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,220
It takes more than an hour to go down the mountain.

54
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:10,770
Then what should we do?

55
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,340
Just wait for him to die?

56
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:11,820
Oh no.

57
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,660
I can't feel my leg now.

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,140
Oh no.

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,980

What are you doing?

66
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,980
I'm gonna suck out the poison.

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,660

Du,

72
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,820
if I got bitten by a snake,

73
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,980
would you suck out the poison for me?

74
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,580
You are still not sick of my fart, huh?

75
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,980
You even want me to suck out the poison for you.

76
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,260
Alright.

77
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,940
Stop.

78
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,490
They lied to you.

79
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,660
This is not a poisonous snake.

80
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,980
It's a grass snake.

81
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,940
We got fooled

82
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,370
because we are ill-educated.

83
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,780
How long has it been since you took a shower?

84
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,820
Take it back and keep it.

85
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,330
Shiquan,

86
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,660
that's enough.

87
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,540

89
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,260

92

What's up?

103
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,780
Did you do that to my yard?

104
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:32,780
Yard?

105
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,780
What?

106
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,380
What... What happened?

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,220
Did you do that to my yard?

Who did it?

110
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,900
Who did it?

111
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,540
Who? Who?

112
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,900
Come here. Come here.

Who?

115
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,780
Turn around.

116
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,980
I only see their backs.

117
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,580
Hurry up.

118
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,700
Turn around.

119
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,900
Sir, what happened?

120
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:03,750
Yes.

121
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
It's them.

122
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,140
Uncle, are you mistaken?

123
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,140
What's wrong, bro?

124
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,340
They are just kids.

126
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,700
Why should I tell you?

127
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,220
I'm here to thank them.

thank you

130
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,600
for today.

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,580
Otherwise, my old house

132
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,380
would have been destroyed if the fire spread.

133
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,260
I was wondering

134
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,870
who cleaned the yard for us.

135
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,220
It turns out that it was you guys who have helped us these days.

136
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,890
It's not a big deal.

137
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,690
Keep the chicken.

138
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,270
Zhao,

139
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,700
make something delicious for them.

140
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,700
No need.

141
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,460
Take it. Take it.

142
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,260
Uncle, no need.

143
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,100
You...

144
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,900
Go on with your things.

145
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,580
I'm leaving.

146
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,100
Go ahead.

147
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,780
See him off.

148
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,700
Okay.

149
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,460
Uncle. Uncle.

150
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,130

153
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,100
I was worried.

154
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,140
Me too.

155
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,660

We have something delicious to eat tonight.

158
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,460

159
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,380
Why should we?

160
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,340
It's a rooster.

161
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,140
It can't lay eggs.

162
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,240
Eat it.

163
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,580
Remove the feathers.

164
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,240

170
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,140
for earning this delicious chicken for us.

Guys,

173
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,820
bottoms up.

174
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,820
Bottoms up.

175

Can we eat now?

176
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,540
Let's eat.

177
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,900
It's so delicious.

178
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,780
Let me ask you.

179
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,820
How did you come up with this idea?

180
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,440
Master,

181
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,090
you told us

182
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,400
what matters in forest fire prevention is prevention, not rescue, right?

183
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,200
So we stayed alert

184
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,840
in order to eliminate every potential safety hazard.

185
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,650
Master,

186
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,010
what's wrong?

187
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,320
Nothing.

188
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,280
Eat.

189
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,640
You've grown up.

190
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,930
Yijiu, Shiquan,

191
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,610
hurry up and eat.

192
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,760
Go out with me to take a walk after you finish eating.

193
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,300
Okay.

194
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,520
Instructor,

195
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,610
you too.

196
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,500
Okay.

197
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,850
Hurry up and eat.

198
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,280
This chicken must be a free-range chicken.

199
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,630
It tastes so good.

200
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,560
Stay close.

201
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,750
Where are we going?

202
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:28,980
It's a secret.

203
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,360
[Keep original aspiration and mission in mind]

204
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,760
You'll know when we get there.
[Keep original aspiration and mission in mind]

205
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,530
[Keep original aspiration and mission in mind]

206
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,850
I didn't bring you here

207
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,410
because you were not qualified.

208
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,310
Now I think it's almost time.

209
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,360
So I brought you here to take a look.

210
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,880
Take a look.

211
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,290
Lushan

212
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,180
is a place that no one wants to go to

213
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,950
and that no one wants to leave.

214
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,300
March 7, 2004.

215
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,270
Lushan is very beautiful.

216
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,620
But what's the most beautiful

217
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,380
is us who are protecting this place silently.

218
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,690
It's an honor to be a member here.

219
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,040
July 4, 1996.

220
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,940
I visited firehouses in the city.

221
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,870
Each firehouse

222
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,510
has its own honor room.

223
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,830
Lushan's honor room

224
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,300
is here.

225
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,460
Captain Zhao,

226
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,350
who wrote these?

227
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,900
I don't know who started it first.

228
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,250
When I first came here,

229
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,730
I was brought here by my captain.

230
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,880
He said this is a tradition of the Lushan Fire Brigade.

231
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,490
In the past decades,

232
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,000
some people sacrificed.

233
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,390
Some people retired.

234
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,730
Some people

235
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,750
were transferred to another place.

236
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,230
But everyone

237
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,910
left their words here.

238
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,850
For those who sacrificed,

239
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,280
the words they left

240
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,630
have become their epitaphs.

241
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,910
One day,

242
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,400
I will leave my words here.

243
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,460
I've already figured out what to write.

244
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:13,850
What will you write?

245
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,570
What?

246
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,330
Tell us.

247
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,850
Okay.

248
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,840
Each of us is a flower in the mountain.

249
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,990
With or without people enjoying,

250
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,790
it always blooms in the mountain.

251
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,780
What do you think?

252
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,790
That's all?

253
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,590
To be honest,

254
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,890
it's a bit tacky.

255
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,400
Tacky?

256
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,000
It's just that it's not your style, Zhao.

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,800
What's my style?

258
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,610
It's really a little bit tacky, Captain Zhao.

259
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,360
You kids know nothing.

260
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,980
You don't have much life experience.

261
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,250
What Captain Zhao said is good.

262
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,010
Look at him.

263
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,360
Good.

264
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,490
You know nothing.

265
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,510
Instructor,

266
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,480
you can also think about

267
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,030
what you will write.

268
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,890
Me?

269
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:12,980
Currently, I'm not qualified

270
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,210
to leave words here.

271
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,520
You will be.

272
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,220
[Don't forget me and don't miss me.]

273
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,720
Captain Zhao,
[Don't forget me and don't miss me.]

274
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:37,760
Captain Zhao,

275
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,030
who wrote this?

276
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,770
He was my comrade many years ago.

277
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,840
Just like you,

278
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,860
he was transferred here from the city.

279
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,920
Look at you.

280
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,150
You left alone without telling me.

281
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,660
Who should be responsible if anything happens?

282
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,380
If you do this again,

283
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,390
I won't save you.

284
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,320
I will never get lost again.

285
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,740
You...

286
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,590
You want to do it again?

287
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,610
He's an amazing guy.

288
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,040
He knew nothing when he first came here.

289
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,310
He insisted on going into the forest.

290
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,700
I had to find him when he got lost.

291
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,160
But he would still get lost next time.

292
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,890
Aren't you capable?

293
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,520
Come back on your own if you are capable.

294
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,410
Unit Leader, I...

295
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,920
Don't. Don't call me Unit Leader.

296
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,510
Go find someone else to be your unit leader.

297
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,700
Go find someone else to be your unit leader.

298
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,060
He was the biggest troublemaker in the team.

299
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,070
And he was

300
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,880
a fool.

301
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,480
I don't know why he was so confident and optimistic.

302
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,790
He kept pestering me

303
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,940
and begging me to be his master.

Stop.

What trouble are you making again?

314
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,840
Do you want to

315
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,060
burn down entire Lushan?

316
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,570
Don't worry.

317
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,170
I'll operate it according to the standards.

318
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:27,930
I promise it's safe.

319
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,160
What is this?

320
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,710
You mean this?

321
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,910
This is a gift for everyone.

322
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,240
Fine.

323
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,910
Come on.

324
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,800
Please tell me

325
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
what kind of gift this is.

326
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,160
Well,

327
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,790
when we go into the mountain,

328
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,560
we need to carry a lot of tools,

329
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,650
such as saws, axes, choppers,

330
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,700
and shovels, right?

331
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,600
There are too many situations we can't predict.

332
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,780
At the same time, the purpose of these tools

333
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,590
is not to put out a fire in the forest.

334
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,070
And it doesn't fit the actual situation of the forest.

335
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,910
Tell me.

336
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,260
If I can create a modified shovel

337
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,710
to specially deal with a forest fire,

338
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,840
it will be helpful to everyone, right?

339
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,400
Don't do useless things like this.

340
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,490
Is this what you should do?

341
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,260
Stop dreaming.

342
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,900
You can't succeed no matter how hard you try.

343
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,250
But someone has to do it.

344
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,640
What if I succeed?

345
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,530
I will keep doing it.

346
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,370
Unit Leader,

347
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,030
come here.

348
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:21,690
That day,

349
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,700
he talked to me all night

350
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,300
about something I didn't understand.

351
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,440
I didn't know why.

352
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,130
Maybe I wasn't clear-minded because of what he said,

353
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,640
so I agreed

354
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,940
to be his master

355
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,500
and guide him seriously.

356
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,650
Days passed.

357
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,070
Later,

358
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,420
he became

359
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,520
a competent forest firefighter.

360
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:45,790
Report!

361
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,890
Everyone is here.

362
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,560
Go back to your position.

363
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,280
Be careful

364
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,290
when you do rescue and relief work.

365
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,550
Are you confident?

366
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,300
Yes.

367
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,060
Let's go.

368
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,560
Hurry.

369
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,510
That day,

370
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,530
it should have been him to be on duty

371
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,800
and guarantee unimpeded communication.

372
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,880
I fell and got hurt when I went up the mountain.

373
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,160
So he replaced me to go up the mountain to put out the fire.

374
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,520
I could only know their situations

375
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,280
through the walkie-talkie.

376
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,550
Our captain was very experienced.

377
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,060
He quickly realized

378
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,200
that a simple firebreak

379
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,510
could no longer stop the fire that was getting bigger and bigger.

380
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,540
So he decided to light a fire

381
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,800
against the fire

382
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,530
to prevent it from spreading towards the village.

383
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,170
We all knew there was no other way.

384
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,950
The purpose was to ignite the inflammable goods in advance

385
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,420
on the route of the fire,

386
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,640
so that there would be nothing to burn.

387
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,890

388
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,950
Run!

389
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,190
Stop!

390
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,590
Dig a hole here.

391
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,570
Use the fire shelter! Hurry!

392
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,790
Are you still there?

393
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,270
Yes.

394
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,370

395
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,690
was finally put out after 7 days and 7 nights.

396

397
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,320
Can you hear me?

398
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,130
When I got there with my team members,

399
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,900
everything had been burnt to ashes.

400
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,320
In the end,

401
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,010
he left me two sentences.

402
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,780
One is

403
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,050
"the wind direction has changed,

404
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,780
and the village is safe."

405
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,970
The other is

406
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,540
"I really want to go home."

407
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,730
Is this person's name

408
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,470
Li Xuejun?

409
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,240
How do you know?

410
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,820
Before he was transferred to Lushan,

411
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,960
my dad was his unit leader.

412
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,270
I know. I know.

413
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,450
I heard a lot about it from him.

414
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,610
Do you still have

415
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,500
the modified shovel you just mentioned?

416
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,780
Come with me.

417
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,860
This is it.

418
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,550
This shovel

419
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,060
has removed the functions

420
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,860
that are not suitable for forest firefighting.

421
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,560
And it has a scissor.

422
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,300
This is a shovel

423
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,450
specially made for forest firefighting.

424
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,340
If it's mass-produced,

425
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,520
it will definitely help many forest firefighters.

426
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,700
Well,

427
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,140
I'll leave Xuejun's shovel

428
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,070
to you.

429
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,300
Don't worry.

430
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,290
I will give full play to this shovel.

A few days ago, Yijiu and Shiquan

439
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,860
found a piece of ramie land,

440
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:00,870
right?

441
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,060
That means there must be ramie

442
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,360
at many surrounding places.

443
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,540

444
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,270
there will be huge potential safety hazards.

446
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,040
we already knew how dangerous this is

447
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,230
before you came.

448
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,500
The point is

449
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,550
we don't know where it is.

450
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,980
What should we do?

451
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,630
Back then, I told you

452
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,010
that we can't be well considered in every aspect.

453
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,080
Lushan is too big.

454
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,300
Today, you can remove ramie.

455
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,860
But what about eucalyptus trees

456
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,330

457
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,130
There are a lot of them.

458
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,070
We can only strengthen our patrols.

460
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,570
Today, what I want to say is

461
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,750

462
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,310

463
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,780

464
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,830
or if we will have good luck again

in the future.

Right?

467
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,740

468
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,920

469
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,720

00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,720
It's all covered with snow.

571
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,070
It's really...

572
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,040
I've never seen so much snow before.

573
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,050
It's your first time?

574
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,980
It's much more real than what I saw in pictures.

575
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,290
Why haven't we arrived yet?

576
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,080
Why?

577
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:39,920
You are anxious now, huh?

578
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,810
I asked you not to come, but you insisted on coming.

579
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,800
You should have stayed there to take care of the vegetable garden for me.

580
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
No way.

581
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,350
I don't want to take care of the vegetable garden.

582
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,530
We've been in the mountain for so long. It's almost smothered us.

583
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,200
Seriously, Master.

584
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,340
And I...

585
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,390
I also heard

586
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,860
that we can ski in this mountain.

587
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,450
Really?

588
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:53,950
Yes.

589
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,620
We can ski here?

590
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,550
Master, I've never skied before.

591
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,470
-Let us go.
-Yes.

592
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,490
I take you here to work,

593
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,920
not to have fun.

594
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,760
-Master.
-Master.

595
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,220
How about this?

596
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,360
We promise

597
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,000
we will manage time properly.

598
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,590
We will alternate work with rest properly

599
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,270
while working hard.

600
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:08,730
Yes.

601
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,700
-Is it okay, Master?
-Yes.

602
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,920
Alternate work with rest.

603
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,140
You're so eloquent.

604
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,530
Look at that.

605
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,080
After we get there,

606
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,090
I will make a snowman

607
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,760
that looks just like you.

608
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,310
Instructor Lin, thank you for your sharing.

609
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,080
Actually, our infrared thermal imaging monitoring alarm system

610
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,470
for forest firefighting

611
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,700
is the same as Lushan's

612
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,760
in terms of the direction.

613
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,350
However,

614
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,840
we also have an all-weather intelligent monitoring system.

615
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,690
If anything happens,

616
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,280
it will sound the alarm automatically immediately.

617
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,710
Director Peng,

618
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,780
you mentioned "sound the alarm automatically".

619
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,040
Does it mean

620
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:53,550
it doesn't require any human intervention?

621
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,050
Yes.

622
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,520
We've installed

623
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,460
infrared thermal imaging monitoring watchtowers in the forest.

624
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,780
Both invisible fire and underground fire

625
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,040
can be monitored.

626
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,220
We just need to check on them

627
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,530
regularly.

628
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,630
I believe in the near future,

629
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,010
this technology

630
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,700
will be popularized

631
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,620
in the forest fire stations across the country.

632
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,300
Director Peng,

633
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,570
where

634
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,000
are your watchtowers?

635
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,940
I knew you would be interested.

636
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,070
After the meeting,

637
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,540
I'll ask Deputy Director Wang

638
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,510
to show you around.

639
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,270
Okay.

640
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,000
Yang.

641
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,020
Hello?

642
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,090
Yang.

643
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,690
Speak.

644
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,060
Lin.

645
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,280
What happened?

646
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,490
Dagang...

647
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,100
is gone.

648
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,250
What do you mean?

649
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,610
Dagang...

650
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,020
died.

651
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,320
After he was dismissed,

652
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,630
he became a deliveryman.

654
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,770
His life was okay.

[FTO Express]

656
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,220
Later,

657
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,320
there was a fire.

658
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,050
He rushed in

659
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,060
without hesitation.

660
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,110
There's someone inside.

661
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,750
There's someone inside.

662
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,630
Because he knew

663
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,280
when the optimal time for rescue was.

664
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,740
Although he saved several people,

665
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:02,630
he...

666
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,270
he...

667
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,000
Lin,

668
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,320
Dagang had never forgotten his duty.

669
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,520
He was great.

671
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,780
Dagang,

672
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,510
we're here to see you.

673
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,680
[Firefighting Hero]

[Condolence]

675
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:07,930
What?

676
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,400
Are you leaving?

677
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,050
Zong helped me contact Director He for his new film.

678
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,530
It's not just

679
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,420
about work, right?

680
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,710
Don't make me laugh at you again.

681
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,540
You just like to laugh at me, right?

682
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:33,670
Mom,

683
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,660
you've been busy since I came.

684
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,090
We didn't even have a chance to have a meal together.

685
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,360
Why don't you cook for me today?

686
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,080
Consider it a farewell.

687
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,890
Mom,

688
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,820
I've read the diary.

689
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,060
Thank you for letting me read it.

690
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,670
I finally know what kind of person he was.

691
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,530
I'm no longer a child without a father.

692
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,020
My father was a hero.

693
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,400
I didn't show you these

694
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,600
to let you eulogize him.

695
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,570
Mom,

696
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,010
you didn't fall in love with a wrong man.

697
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,020
No?

698
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,490
No.

699
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,490
I saw

700
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,040
your wonderful memories.

701
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,070
I saw you truly loved each other

702
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,120
and protected each other.

703
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,530
I also saw your toughness.

704
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,420
Your husband died.

705
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,320
You lived alone with your child.

706
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,840
You had to take care of your career

707
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,240
and put up with other people's judgments.

708
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,810
You are a strong woman.

709
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,000
You chose a relationship that others didn't support.

710
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,430
You were worried about him,

711
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,650
cared about him,

712
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,250
and were proud of him.

713
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,430
But you don't understand

714
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,900
that kind of pain

715
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,540
and suffering.

716
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,550
I understand.

717
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,950
Although I'm not as tough as you,

718
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,220
I can understand that kind of feeling.

719
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,950
Every time Lin Luxiao went on a mission,

720
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,840
I was very scared.

721
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,070
But I knew that was his mission.

722
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,040
You should have told me earlier.

723
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,990
Xi Gu, a good friend of mine, told me

724
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,880
if we share our happiness,

725
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,720
happiness will be doubled.

726
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,080
If we share our sadness,

727
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,180
sadness will be reduced by half.

728
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,610
Mom,

729
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,420
you're just stubborn.

730
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:16,630
It seems

731
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,860
you've made up your mind.

732
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,590
Actually, I have one thing in common with you.

733
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,620
We won't regret after making a decision.

734
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,020
You...

735
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,050
have grown up.

736
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,820
Eat.

737
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,340
Okay.

738
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,140
Come on.

739
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,390
Have you read the new script?

740
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,440
Yes.

741
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,860
But there will be some changes.

742
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,460
I want to hear your opinion.

743
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:25,680
Mom,

744
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,110
I'm leaving.

745
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:39,870
Let's go.

746
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,390
Let me walk you downstairs.

747
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,380
Zhao.

748
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,160
Forget the cabbages.

749
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,960
Forget the cabbages.

750
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,840
It's a festival today.

751
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:32,980
We're not gonna eat cabbages.

752
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,150
Let me cook something delicious for you.

753
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,470
I'll make you braised pork with sweet potatoes.

754
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,120
I don't think

755
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,600
there are enough sweet potatoes in the kitchen.

756
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,440
I won't use those in the kitchen.

757
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,120
There are sweet potatoes here, right?

758
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,730
I'm gonna dig some out first.

759
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,370
The sweet potatoes you planted?

760
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,550
Are they good?

761
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,470
Of course.

762
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,320
I've taken good care of them.

763
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,800
Let me take a look.

764
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,390
What you planted are not sweet potatoes.

765
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,110
They are raisins.

766
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,140
Maybe this one didn't grow well.

767
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,820
Let me check the one next to it.

768
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,390
It's a waste of my land in the vegetable garden.

769
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,530
It's okay.

770
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,670
Keep growing these.

771
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,060
I'm sure we can eat them before next year.

772
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,160
Next year?

773
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,380
I won't have a chance to eat them next year.

774
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,530
I've received a notice.

775
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,870
I'll take a back seat.

776
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,560
When did it happen?

777
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,000
Why didn't you tell me?

778
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,680
What?

779
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,200
Do I need your permission to take a back seat?

780
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:52,820
Zhao,

781
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,550
this is too sudden.

782
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,140
I've been working here for more than 20 years.

783
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,550
I have to walk 25 kilometers to patrol the forest every day.

784
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,060
My body couldn't take it long ago.

785
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,530
What do you want?

786
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,180
Do you want to bury me in this vegetable garden

787
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,610
to nourish your sweet potatoes?

788
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,680
Several years ago,

789
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,450
I felt my body couldn't take it.

790
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,600
I wanted to take a back seat long ago.

791
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,660
But I was worried about everyone.

792
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:26,920
But fortunately,

793
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:27,890
you came here.

794
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,530
You're very talented.

795
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,180
In the future,

796
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,030
I'll leave this place to you.

797
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,380
Do your best.

798
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:38,510
Do you hear me?

799
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,250
Don't worry.

800
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,070
All right.

801
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,460
We can't

802
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:48,640
eat sweet potatoes.

803
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,360
Tonight,

804
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,830
eat stewed meat with cabbages made by me.

805
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,360
Can it still grow if I plant it again?

806
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,000
I'm afraid

807
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,590
it can't.

more than 95% of forest fires in our country

814
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,750
are due to human factors.

815
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,430

816
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,620

Fourth,

824
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,160
don't make a fire to get warmer.

825
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,000
Fifth,

826
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,220
don't have a picnic or barbecue.

827
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:25,890
Sixth,

828
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,540
don't offer sacrifices, sweep graves, or set off fireworks in forest zones.

829

836
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,480
don't let the old, the weak, the sick, the disabled, and the young participate in fire rescues.

837
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,750
Here, I remind you

838
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,060
once you cause a forest fire,

839
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,370
whether intentionally or not,

840
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,560
you'll have to take legal responsibility.
