It started off small.

191
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:00,800
Then it grew bigger and bigger.

192
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,170
Where are they now?

193
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,850
Who called the police?

194
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,350
Probably...

195
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:02,940
This way.

196
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,320
I called the police.

197
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,290
What happened?

198
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,970
The couple went to purchase goods

199
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,440
and the fire started suddenly.

200
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,110
Is there anyone in the room?

201
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,200
I don't think so.

202
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:10,750
Okay.

203
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,980
Discharge water, put out the fire.

204
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:33,980
Liu.

205
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,190
Call overhead, get the ladder.

206
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,200
There's someone there.

207
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,580
Hurry!

208
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,230
Yijiu, you're light. Go up and do the rescue.

209
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,470
Here, little girl.

210
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,110
Put this over your face.

211
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,460
Take care of the gas tank.

212
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,720
Hurry up.

213
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,230
Hurry.

214
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,500
Follow.

215
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,580
Go!

216
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,180
Tang.

217
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,100
Mom.

218
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,980
Are you okay?

219
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,330
Let me see.

220
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,590
Where did you go?

221
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,450
Why did you leave me behind?

222
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,680
It's all my fault.

223
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,570
I shouldn't have left you behind.

224
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,420
It's all my fault.

225
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,730
Who did this?

226
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,710
It's over.

227
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,200
My steamed bun shop. My home.

228
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,990
Who did this?

229
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,630
Is this your shop?

230
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,400
Sir.

231
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,280
Yes.

232
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,430
How did it catch on fire for no reason?

233
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,480
From the preliminary survey at the scene,

234
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,960
the fire could have been caused by this power strip.

235
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,820
How did my shop burn down

236
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,800
just because of a power strip?

237
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,500
How can I be so unlucky?

238
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,300
Sir,

239
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,820
it's not about your luck.

240
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,040
How can you put tape over

241
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,850
your broken power strip and keep using it?

242
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,450
We talk about

243
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,090
fire safety every single day.

244
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,860
Why didn't you take it seriously?

245
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,830
Everyone does this.

246
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,680
It keeps breaking.

247
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,480
Who has the money for that?

248
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,630
You didn't want to spend a couple of dollars,

249
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,610
but now, it's not just your shop that got burned down.

250
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,960
I think the shop next door also caught on fire.

251
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,020
They might ask you for compensation.

252
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,370
It's all your fault.

253
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,670
If you had come earlier...

254
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,640
Take care of the child for me.

255
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,390
My shop wouldn't be like this.

256
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,630
My life is over!

257
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,720
What are you talking about?

258
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,860
If it weren't for the firefighters,

259
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,710
we would truly have nothing now.

260
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,690
I'm sorry, sir.

261
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,500
My husband is uncultured.

262
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,300
He's not good with words.

263
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,510
Please don't be offended.

264
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,610
He doesn't mean that.

265
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,450
Why are you apologizing to him?

266
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,300
What did I say wrong?

267
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,900
Don't you see this?

268
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,460
How can we pay back the money now that we lost our home?

269
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,970
How will we survive now?

270
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,000
Is this only my home?

271
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,310
How dare you lose your temper?

272
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,990
I don't even know what you're doing.

273
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,040
Stop arguing. Let's calm down.

274
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,000
Don't bully my dad.

275
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,770
Don't bully my mom!

276
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,650
Tang.

277
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,170
Tang.

278
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,980
Dad

279
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,800
I'm useless.

280
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,470
Didn't you say that the child

281
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,350
has acute leukemia?

282
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,780
We don't have the instruments now

283
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:57,710
to check.

284
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:58,970
To be sure,

285
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,690
it's best to take her to the hospital for a check-up.

286
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:01,990
Yes,

287
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,910
get a check-up.

288
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,640
She breathed in a lot of smoke in there today.

289
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,670
Honey,

290
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,190
your parents need to talk to the firefighter.

291
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,660
Let's go over to that side.

292
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:13,960
Come on.

293
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,980
We won't go to the hospital today.

294
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,500
Our child has leukemia.

295
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,690
She's been on the waitlist for a bone marrow transplant.

296
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,620
She goes to the hospital

297
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,970
every week for a check-up.

298
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,990
Besides,

299
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,880
we've used up our savings.

300
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,990
We've borrowed from all our relatives and friends.

301
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,970
We can't afford it anymore.

302
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,230
We don't dare to go to the hospital

303
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,420
for minor issues.

304
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,430
It's all my fault for being useless.

305
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,400
Stop hitting yourself!

306
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,700
I'm useless!

307
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,770
Everything will be fine.

308
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,460
Let's go and see

309
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,730
what else we can take out the house.

310
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,760
-Unit 1, hurry with the wrap up.
-Come on.

311
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,050
-Everyone else, rest in place.
-You...

312
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,180
Come with me.

313
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,770
-One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
-Hurry up.

314
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:14,990
And a little bird.

315
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,360
One, two, three, four, five, six. Eat it up.

316
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,990
What's wrong?

317
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,880
I just bought groceries and have to cook later.

318
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,230
I have to go to the company tonight.

319
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,080
You're on duty today?

320
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,300
A steamed bun shop caught on fire.

321
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,910
A little girl was trapped inside.

322
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,250
Luckily, we saved her.

323
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,400
The kid is about the same age as Miaomiao.

324
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,630
She has a beautiful smile.

325
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,430
When I saw her,

326
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,290
I thought of Miaomiao.

327
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,650
Milan.

328
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,130
Today,

329
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,030
after I saved the little girl,

330
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,830
I thought of you and Miaomiao immediately.

331
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,240
I feel that I owe you two

332
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,410
too much all these years.

333
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,230
I really want to be by your side

334
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,280
every second of the day

335
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,160
and take care of you.

336
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,590
But today,

337
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,220
when I saw this girl

338
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,780
reuniting

339
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,670
with her family

340
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,700
because of our help,

341
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,690
I feel like my job is very meaningful.

342
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,420
Yu Qilei,

343
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,270
what do you want to say?

344
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,440
I thought about it for a long time.

345
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,510
I still want to be a firefighter.

346
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:02,920
Milan,

347
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,940
do you remember?

348
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,250
Back then, you asked me

349
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,310
why I wanted to become a firefighter,

350
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,460
but I didn't know what to say.

351
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,440
But now...

352
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,010
But now, I found the answer.

353
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,200
It's not about why I want to become a firefighter.

354
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,220
Instead, it needs me.

355
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,440
Many people need me,

356
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,470
just like how you and Miaomiao need me.

357
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,200
By the way, Milan,

358
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,980
please help me apologize to Dad.

359
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,990
I've let him down.

360
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,880
Okay.

361
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,280
I'll talk to Dad myself.

362
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,190
Mom, I'm back.

363
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,410
Change your shoes.

364
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,460
Mom.

365
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,160
Mom, why are you here?

366
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,710
Milan is busy these days.

367
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,050
I picked Miaomiao up.

368
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,990
Dad.

369
00:21:59,410 --> 00:21:59,960
Miaomiao.

370
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,980
Dad, what are you doing?

371
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,490
Did you save someone again?

372
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,120
Yes,

373
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,680
Dad saved someone again today.

374
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,160
Dad, when will you take me to the amusement park again?

375
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,050
Wait for when I get a holiday.

376
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,680
I'll come home when I get a holiday

377
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,030
and take you to the amusement park, okay?

378
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,970
Dad, you must save many people.

379
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,030
I'll do what you say.

380
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,710
Okay, wash up and do your homework.

381
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,010
Hurry.

382
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,230
Listen to Mom.

383
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:23,690
Go.

384
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,200
Okay.

385
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,220
Wash well.

386
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,780
Be careful.

387
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,960
Don't worry.

388
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,620
We won't go to the hospital today.

389
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,970
Our child has leukemia.

390
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,190
She's been on the waitlist for a bone marrow transplant.

391
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,870
She goes to the hospital

392
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,650
every week for a check-up.

393
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,380
We used up our savings.

394
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,710
[China Fire and Rescue]

395
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,720
For today's review meeting,
[China Fire and Rescue]

396
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:20,890
[China Fire and Rescue]

397
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,310
[Binxi Fire Department]

398
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,710
I mainly want to discuss with everyone
[Binxi Fire Department]

399
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,420
[Binxi Fire Department]

400
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,760
about today's mission.
[Binxi Fire Department]

401
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,900
[Binxi Fire Department]

402
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,990
What thoughts do you have?
[Binxi Fire Department]

403
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,370
[Binxi Fire Department]

404
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,770
Report.

405
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,650
Speak.

406
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,040
Director,

407
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,050
how will the steamed bun shop family

408
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,440
survive from now on?

409
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,410
Is there anything we can do to help,

410
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,970
such as donating money or something?

411
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,640
Sit down first, alright?

412
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,230
I'm sure everyone has considered

413
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,750
what you're thinking too.

414
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,470
But, as firefighters,

415
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,690
we might not be able to...

416
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,900
Any help counts.

417
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,210
Jiu,

418
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,680
it's good that you have the intention,

419
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,240
but

420
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,560
these things have to be voluntary.

421
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,070
Sit down.

422
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,600
Whenever I think of that kid,

423
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,740
I feel horrible.

424
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:12,930
Inspector Yang,

425
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:13,850
I'll donate some money.

426
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,910
I'll transfer it to you later.

427
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,460
Okay.

428
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,470
We see cases every day.

429
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,070
We see trouble every day.

430
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,550
We can help once,

431
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,770
but we can't help every time.

432
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,490
We can put out fires,

433
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,050
but for difficulties in life,

434
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,730
our meager salaries aren't enough.

435
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,840
If only we were a charity institution.

436
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,480
How about this, Dagang?

437
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,120
Tell me how much you'll donate.

438
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,510
I'll donate the same amount as you.

439
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,060
Count me in.

440
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,190
I want to donate too.

441
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,950
Count me in.

442
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,470
Count me in.

443
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,460
Everyone, don't be impulsive.

444
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,780
Liu Ruyi is right.

445
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,160
After all,

446
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,600
we are not a charity institution.

447
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,990
We can put out fires,

448
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,230
but we can't put out their urgent needs.

449
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,620
Then,

450
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,390
how can we help them?

451
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,140
Help them?

452
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:07,740
Of course, we'll help,

453
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,900
but we must think of how.

454
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,650
We must first do our job well

455
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,500
and educate people about fire safety.

456
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,140
Why

457
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,450
am I emphasizing on reviewing today?

458
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,470
This is actually what I want to talk about this.

459
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,410
The situation in our jurisdiction

460
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,850
is quite complicated.

461
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,680
There are many venues with production, storage, and operation in one place.

462
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,780
It's basically impossible

463
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,710
for the firefighters to remove the risks

464
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,680
one by one.

465
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,280
So, on our way back,

466
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,470
Inspector Yang and I have reflected on

467
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,240
the fire safety education we've done before.

468
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,660
Our work is still

469
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,390
too passive.

470
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,230
Yes.

471
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,750
Although

472
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,730
we started a lot of fire safety education work

473
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,160
in the station,

474
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,890
we've overlooked

475
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,200
that most civilians

476
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,460
are burdened by work

477
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,980
and daily necessities.

478
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,920
They don't have the time or energy to come to our station.

479
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,440
So, I've discussed it with Director Lin.

480
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,640
From now on, not only will we do the education work in the station,

481
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,990
we'll also promote fire safety knowledge

482
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,260
by going to the people.

483
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,070
Right, Director Lin?

484
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,990
Yes.

485
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,890
In the future,

486
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,880
our fire safety education should be everywhere,

487
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,690
so that the public

488
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,370
can be aware of the safety issues at all times.

489
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,680
Also, Yijiu,

490
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,950
I talked to the team's Fire Investigation Department.

491
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,140
Go with them

492
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,860
when they do the fire investigation

493
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,630
and educate the family on safety.

494
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,230
Since you want to help them,

495
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,740
let's help them to the end.

496
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,260
-Okay.
-Director, I want to go too.

497
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,430
Sure.

498
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,530
From now on,

499
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,680
other than our daily activities and training,

500
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,400
the focus of our work

501
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,790
should also be on promoting fire safety.

502
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,980
However,

503
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,780
I've discussed this with Inspector Yang.

504
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,380
We need

505
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,230
an experienced leader.

506
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,620
Today,

507
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,390
I hope we can elect one together.

508
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,370
Anyone want to volunteer?

509
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,690
Yu?

510
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,250
Let me take care of

511
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,680
the fire safety education.

512
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,010
I know

513
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,690
that recently,

514
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,470
you all have a lot of thoughts

515
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,730
about my request to quit,

516
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,420
but I've made up my mind today.

517
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,530
I want to stay.

518
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,440
I want to stay and fight with you all.

519
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,960
I don't want to leave you all.

520
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,240
Yu, what about your family?

521
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,630
Don't worry.

522
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,140
I've told Milan.

523
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,360
She will understand.

524
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,530
Great.

525
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,200
Yu, listen.

526
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,390
I bought you a special pen

527
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,230
as a farewell gift.

528
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,610
It's such a waste now.

529
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,960
I was thinking of buying you a good one.

530
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,260
Luckily, I saved my money.

531
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,740
You are really stingy.

532
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,170
Do you want to wait and gift it to me when I leave?

533
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,390
I'll definitely leave before you.

534
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,870
Sorry for the trouble.

535
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,900
I'm sorry.

536
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,270
Don't be sorry.

537
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,000
Just buy us some water tomorrow.

538
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:34,710
Treat us to water.

539
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:40,630
Treat us to water.

540
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,780
Treat us to water.

541
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,950
Alright.

542
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,680
Yu, take a seat.

543
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,980
This is good news for today.

544
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,450
I don't have anything else to say.

545
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,180
Let's end here for today.

546
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,770
Inspector Yang, do you have anything to add?

547
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,670
I...

548
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,640
I have nothing more to add.

549
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,820
Go back and sleep early.

550
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,910
The meeting is dismissed.

551
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,810
Let's go back and take a look at my pen.

552
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,690
It's really nice.

553
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,780
Yu.

554
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,900
No need to look at the pen.

555
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,330
Go sleep. It's none of your business.

556
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,630
I'll wait for you in your room.

557
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,070
Director Lin.

558
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,330
Yu,

559
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,800
I just discussed with Director Lin.

560
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,860
Your previous schedule

561
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,120
was indeed problematic.

562
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,550
Don't worry.

563
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,120
Since you chose to stay,

564
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,600
we will arrange your schedule,

565
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,910
so you can go home at least once per month.

566
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
Thank you, Inspector Yang.

567
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,350
Yu,

568
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,380
to be honest,

569
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,270
I'm very happy

570
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,580
that you chose to stay.

571
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:58,920
Really.

572
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,280
I know your personality.

573
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,790
When you run into problems,

574
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,050
you're not willing to express it

575
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,440
or trouble the others,

576
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,710
but we've worked together for so many years.

577
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,890
I only have one request.

578
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,450
Don't keep things to yourself.

579
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,850
Tell us if you have problems.

580
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,060
Leave it to us.

581
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,370
Yes.

582
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,310
Thank you.

583
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,350
About yesterday,

584
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,070
it was the fault of our film crew.

585
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,460
I apologize.

586
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,980
Previously,

587
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,080
we kept looking for ways to make our show a hit,

588
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,390
but the fire in the steamed buns shop during the day

589
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,810
made me think a lot.

590
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,120
Director Lin,

591
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,510
I want to join the show as a guest.

592
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,890
You?

593
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,910
You think I can't do it, right?

594
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,670
Director Lin,

595
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,230
I played extreme sports abroad.

596
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,610
Nothing is too hard for me.

597
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,630
Surfing, diving, rock climbing...

598
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,890
You name it, I've done it.

599
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,360
I even got the High Altitude Rescue Certification.

600
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,330
You'll know how challenging it is if you search it up.

601
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,640
I'm better than you in this.

602
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,110
And then?

603
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,200
And...

604
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:17,790
Then...

605
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,220
Young man,

606
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,570
let me tell you.

607
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,980
Being a firefighter isn't for everyone.

608
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,860
Yes,

609
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,050
the things I can do

610
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,430
are nothing compared to your daily missions.

611
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,830
I don't know anything about firefighters.

612
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,130
I'm not knowledgeable,

613
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,600
but I just want to take on this challenge.

614
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,830
If I say I can do it, then I can.

615
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,130
Director Lin, please give me a chance.

616
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,930
Catch up to me first.

617
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,150
From now on,

618
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,970
Jiang Ge will also join our training.

619
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,150
Let’s welcome our new team member.

620
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,700
After what happened,

621
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:22,050
we've also made corresponding adjustments.

622
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,320
We've decided to teach you

623
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,300
some basic firefighting knowledge starting today.

624
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,690
As you can see,

625
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,380
I'm going to teach you how to wear the uniform today.

626
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,130
Report!

627
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:32,600
Go ahead.

628
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,820
So, can we also enter the fire scene?

629
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,090
When I took you

630
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,810
to the fire at the steamed buns shop,

631
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,320
it was to show you

632
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,710
how firefighters work.

633
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:42,670
Report!

634
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,770
Then, when can we enter the fire scene?

635
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,030
When?

636
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,460
Whether you can or not

637
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,560
depends on your future training results.

638
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,400
But

639
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,800
from the moment you put on your uniform,

640
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,590
I hope

641
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,430
you can hold yourself

642
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,320
to the standard of firefighters.

643
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:56,870
Understand?

644
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,630
Yes.

645
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,940
Okay. Next, I will explain to everyone

646
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,290
how to quickly put on your uniform.

647
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,630
Take off your sneakers.

648
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,910
Put your feet directly into the protective boots.

649
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,800
Pull up the belt.

650
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,320
There will be a lot of smoke

651
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,960
at the fire scene,

652
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,060
which will block our view.

653
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,400
In order to prevent

654
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,660
anyone from getting lost,

655
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,330
we choose to tie a rope around our waist

656
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,780
and connect everyone together.

657
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,040
In special situations,

658
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,060
we would hold onto

659
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,030
a teammate's belt or shoulder strap.

660
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,050
Nan Chu, hold on to my shoulder strap

661
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,190
Hold my shoulder strap.

662
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,800
[Nanbin Special Division]

663
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,980
Nan Chu, hold my shoulder strap.

664
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,830
Nan Chu.

665
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,310
Pay attention. This is important.

666
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,570
Director Lin,

667
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,000
as a frontline firefighter,

668
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,470
if I grab your shoulder strap

669
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,070
while you're rescuing me from a fire,

670
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,790
should you hug me next-

671
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,050
When we're at the scene

672
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,450
and rescuing those who are conscious,

673
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,420
we'll choose to tie everyone together

674
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,740
and walk forward like this

675
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,910
to avoid being separated.

676
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,670
Understand?

677
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,830
Try with each other.

678
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:53,380
Did you want to form a ship with Director Lin?

679
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,270
But it seems

680
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,080
that you're not that lucky.

681
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,870
I didn't.

682
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,400
[Practice]

683
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:15,680
Not bad.

684
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,290
As you can see,

685
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,680
rope climbing

686
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,660
is one of the necessary skills for firefighters.

687
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,720
This skill is important

688
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,400
in many rescues and self-rescues.

689
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,210
Did you see

690
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,300
Assistant Liu's demonstration clearly?

691
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,690
Yes.

692
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,280
Okay.

693
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,010
Today, I'll teach you how to tie the knot.

694
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,060
Assistant Liu.

695
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:38,780
Yes.

696
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,210
Go down and guide them.

697
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:40,670
Yes.

698
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,590
Everyone must remember the steps.

699
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,060
Don't underestimate the basic training.

700
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,080
This knot looks simple,

701
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,010
but this is the most important part

702
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,520
in high altitude rescues.

703
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,080
It's known as the knot of life.

704
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,910
Report!

705
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,330
Tall guy,

706
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,710
you made the wrong knot.

707
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,520
I know the kind that you taught,

708
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,870
but mine is what veterans use overseas.

709
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,170
It's more convenient

710
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:23,970
and saves more time than yours.

711
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,900
Lin,

712
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,950
is it like this?

713
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,470
His knot is fine,

714
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,320
but it's not what we taught.

715
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,870
I guess you know a lot.

716
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:33,920
It's fine.

717
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,270
See?

718
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,850
Director Lin said it's good.

719
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,040
By the way,

720
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,510
I heard you have

721
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,640
an unwritten rule here

722
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,250
that if a new team member successfully challenges an old team member,

723
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,930
you can add your own rule

724
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:45,850
to the Special Division's Nine Rules.

725
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,070
Is that true?

726
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,220
Judging from your tone,

727
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,110
do you want to challenge Director Lin?

728
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,160
Lin,

729
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,960
someone wants to challenge you.

730
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,060
It's just a friendly competition.

731
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,360
I'm interested in everything,

732
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,370
so I've learned a bit of everything.

733
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,390
Show us what you got.

734
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,780
Put your stuff here.

735
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,370
Come on.

736
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:04,920
Okay.

737
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:05,760
Get ready.

738
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,350
Why is Jiang Ge giving himself more screen time?

739
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,490
Mr. Jiang, you can do it!

740
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,530
Mr. Jiang, you're amazing.

741
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,930
Not bad, I didn't forget everything.

742
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,900
You're not bad.

743
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,830
During the training this afternoon,

744
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,890
you can help check

745
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,950
if everyone's knots are correct.

746
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,540
Sure.

747
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,220
Not bad.

748
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,670
It's a pity that you're not a firefighter.

749
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,680
If I win you all,

750
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,150
do I get to put my name

751
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,330
in your Special Division's Nine Rules?

752
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,760
You're overthinking.

753
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,400
This is just single-task training.

754
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,870
The firefighter test is a comprehensive test.

755

He's drunk and has no brain.

866
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,690
Do you not have a brain either?

867
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,540
Do you not have a mouth to ask with?

873
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,480
and see whose problem it is.

874
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,480
You can't post this.

875
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,660
Enough. Stop talking.

886
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:21,850

[Tips for Fire Safety]

905
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,110
Alcohol is commonly seen in life,

906
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,790
but it often causes fires and casualties

907
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,640
due to inappropriate use.

908
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,280
Please remember

909
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,710
these following facts.

910
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:57,760
First,

911
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,310
alcohol is volatile.

912
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,070
It can easily cause a fire when it's exposed to open flames.

913
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,790
Second,

914
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,970
don't add alcohol

915
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,100
directly into a container with alcohol.

916
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,370
When a container with alcohol is on fire

917
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,840
and the fire is relatively small,

918
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,650
you can put it out with wet towels.

919
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,240
If the fire is relatively large,

920
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,090
you can use a fire extinguisher to put it out.

921
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:15,940
If the fire is out of control,

922
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,490
please call 119 immediately.
