those rules

21
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,620

What are those rules?

Special Division's Nine Rules are a cherished tradition of our station.

who surpass the old team members in training

27
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,900
can add their own rules.

28
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,580
So,

29
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,580
we can do it too?

00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,740
You still have a long way to go.

31
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,540
So many years have passed

32
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,220
but only nine rules were made.

33
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,300
Only nine.

Those nine people are the best of the best.

35
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,180
So, those nine rules

36
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,100
are both rules and honors.

We can't use the bathroom for more than 5 minutes?

45

That's too strict.

54
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,340
is that I hope one day,

00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,340
Bring your buddies with you.

190
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,610
-Okay.
-Bring them with you.

191
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,820
-Okay.
-Bye.

192
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,020
Look.

193
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,460
How many cylinders does that car have?

194
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,540
When can I go for a ride in it?

195
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,370
Stop daydreaming.

196
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,380
Just take a good look at it.

197
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,300
That car is cool

198
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,420
but our tender is four times its worth.

199
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,340
Yeah.

200
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,580
Attention, everyone.

201
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,740
The instructor said we'll have a meeting later.

202
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,900
After getting changed, go to the meeting room.

203
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,420
What are you doing? Stop dawdling.

204
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,980
Dagang, did you poop yourself?

205
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,130
Fine. Take it off.

206
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:30,620
I'll wash it for you.

207
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,420
Hurry.

208
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,420
Go take a shower

209
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,660
before you go to the meeting.

210
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,340
Come with me.

211
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,460
I'll hose you down.

212
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,220
Hurry.

213
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,580
Today,

214
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,660
there's something I need to tell you.

215
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,860
The producer of a show about firefighting

216
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,820
reached out to me

217
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,460
and wants to cooperate with us.

218
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,610
This is its basic information.

219
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,740
Pass it around

220
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,740
and tell me what you think.

221
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,220
Report.

222
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,660
Instructor.

223
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,900
Can we go on TV?

224
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,690
Yes. Of course.

225
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,020
Go on TV?

226
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,940
It's good to be on TV.

227
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,260
It's a good chance to show our charisma.

228
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,780
I'm into it.

229
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,980
So are we.

230
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,060
I think this is a great opportunity

231
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,980
to show our firefighting skills

232
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,900
and training results.

233
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,740
Don't you agree, Yijiu?

234
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,660
I'm not interested.

235
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,940
They'll just send

236
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,340
a few celebrities to work with us.

237
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,380
We're busy enough. We don't need more trouble.

238
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,620
Let me clarify.

239
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,780
This show aims at spreading knowledge of firefighting.

240
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,100
It can help the public

241
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,900
know more about fire safety.

242
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:33,740
Understand?

243
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,250
It's a good thing.

244
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,620
Instructor Yang.

245
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,580
I have a question.

246
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,340
If we get on the show,

247
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,420
will we get perks?

248
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
Well…

249
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,180
Lei, don't be so superficial.

250
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,050
It's an honor.

251
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,740
Forget about money.

252
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,100
You don't want money?

253
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,500
I do.

254
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,980
Instructor, I…

255
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,740
Sir.

256
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,740
I have something to say.

257
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,580
I think

258
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,180
as long as it doesn't affect our training,

259
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,570
we should try

260
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,740
accepting new things.

261
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,380
After all, after the reformation,

262
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,500
we're now the main force of emergency rescue.

263
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,540
That means more responsibility

264
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,980
and a heavier workload,

265
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,020
which brings about new demands

266
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,580
for our work.

267
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,300
So I think

268
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,500
embracing changes

269
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,540
is a good way to improve ourselves.

270
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,500
Am I right?

271
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,780
I agree.

272
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,660
-Well said.
-Well said.

273
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,900
Yu.

274
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,220
What's your opinion?

275
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,460
I…

276
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
I have no opinion on this.

277
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,050
Whatever you decide.

278
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,060
No.

279
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,460
Say something.

280
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,060
Yu, say something.

281
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,980
I'll let you guys decide.

282
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,980
Okay?

283
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,460
In that case,

284
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,060
do you all agree to it?

285
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,580
Yes.

286
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,020
Okay.

287
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,660
Lin, look.

288
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,300
Did you hear that?

289
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,380
This is what the whole team wants.

290
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,730
Give it a thought.

291
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,060
Is the training not intense enough?

292
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,780
We

293
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,420
should focus on training.

294
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,460
Anything irrelevant to training

295
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,460
should be put aside.

296
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,780
Dismissed.

297
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,140
Why is he angry?

298
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,660
Don't worry.

299
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,490
I'll go talk to him.

300
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,540
I can see you're all excited about it.

301
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,620
Qi Huo,

302
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,220
ask if anyone's got more to say.

303
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,290
I have nothing to add.

304
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,420

Why did you leave so fast?

308
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,740
What do you mean, Yang?

309
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,060
I…

310
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,290
Close the door.

311
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,940
I told you.

312
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,060
We can't do it.

313
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,940
I just want everyone's voice to be heard

314
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,780
so that we can decide this together.

315
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,700
You can't decide everything

316
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,580
on your own.

317
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,370
In other words,

318
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,020
if the team is against it,

319
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,100
we'll forget about it.

320

is so excited about it.

00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,460
Don't you think you should respect their opinions?

324
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,060
We've got enough on our plate.

325
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,740
Getting on the show?

326
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,780
Forget about it.

327
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,060
I don't understand.

328
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,460
What do you mean?

329
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,490
No matter what,

330
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,620
we still have Deputy Director Song and Yu.

331
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,980
Don't mention Yu.

332
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,370
He's leaving.

333
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,180
Leaving?

334
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,820
Where can he go?

335
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,220
He's going home. He's quitting.

336
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,740
Where are you going?

337
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,340
I'm going to talk to him.

338
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,260
I need to know why.

339
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,490
What are you going to say?

340
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,810
Who are you to ask him to stay?

341
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,700
Then what should we do?

342
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,900
Will we just sit here

343
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,620
and do nothing?

344
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,300
Will we just let him go?

345
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,300
Milan called him

346
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,380
and urged him to go home.

347
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,020
It's been hard for Milan to raise the child alone.

348
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,900
Yu has been working here for so many years.

349
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,740
How many times has he gone home?

350
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,500
How many times?

351
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,060
He didn't go back when Miaomiao was born.

352
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,740
I heard that she got sick a few days ago.

353
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,300
His house is far away.

354
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,900
A round trip takes two whole days.

355
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,660
To meet his wife and child,

356
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,220
he needs to get at least three days off.

357
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,260
As the director,

358
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,620
I'm busy trying to figure out how to help my team member

359
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,500
and don't have time for some dumb show.

360
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,260
You're really not helping.

361
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,500
You can't blame it all on me.

362
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,980
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

363
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,500
Can't believe you kept it to yourself.

364
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,780
No. I have to talk to him.

365
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,620
Okay. Go ahead.

366
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,540
Go ahead.

367
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,260
I doubt you know how to put it.

368
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,340

00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:57,660
By the way,

380
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,220
I…

381
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,700
I just checked the weather forecast.

382
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,980
It says it'll be very hot tomorrow.

383
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,900
Be careful not to get heatstroke when you're out tomorrow.

384
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,780
Thank you.

385
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,140
Yu.

386
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,100
You…

387
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,540
Anything else?

388
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,660
Nothing. Good night.

389
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,180
Don't stay up too late.

390
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,700
I know.

391
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,500
[Resignation]

392
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,780
Since my company signed me,

393
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,340
they haven't arranged for me to participate in any big events.

394
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,580
I just keep doing small gigs.

395
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,540
I don't even have time to practice violin.

396
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,740
Have you talked to your company about it?

397
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,220
The market is small. It's hard to get a foothold.

398
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,500
Besides, no one here knows

399
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,100
about the prizes I won abroad.

400
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,410
The company arranges all my work for me.

401
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,020
What can I say to them?

402
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,500
How about your brother?

403
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,540
Does he know about it?

404
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
I dare not tell him.

405
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,420
He's done enough for me.

406
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,700
He provided for me when I studied abroad.

407
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,700
I thought I could make him proud after coming back

408
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,140
but can't even support myself.

409
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,780
I'm too embarrassed to tell him.

410
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,660
You're right.

411
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,820
But at least you have sponsors.

412
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,940
Look at me.

413
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,130
I signed a ten-year contract and owe my company 300,000 yuan.

414
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,580
When I was young, I thought

415
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,730
dancing well was the hardest thing.

416
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,260
Now I think it's the easiest thing.

417
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,140
By the way,

418
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,660
there's another reason

419
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,890
why I cooperate with my company.

420
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,700
What's it?

421
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,500
They're going to hold a recital for me.

422
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,580
Really?

423
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,180
Yes.

424
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,580
And I'm thinking

425
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,340
that maybe you can dance

426
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,740
at my recital.

427
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,540
Are you interested?

428
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,420
Of course I am.

429
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,700
But will your company agree?

430
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,100
I think they will.

431
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,180
My boss appreciates me.

432
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,220
And I think he knows art.

433
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,940
Then I'll wait to ride on your coattails.

434
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,050
Don't forget to treat me to dinner.

435
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,220
Lin Qi, what's wrong with you?

436
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,620
You were brought to the police station for fighting.

437
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,180
Don't you know the situation?

438
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,780
Do you still want to hold the recital?

439
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Don't be angry, Mr. Ma.

440
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,340
It was all a misunderstanding.

441
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,540
And it's been resolved.

442
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,180
Listen.

443
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,900
Lin Qi, you have to know the score.

444
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,620
We've put a lot of effort

445
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,060
into preparing for your recital.

446
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,140
The venue cost a lot.

447
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,380
The promotion cost a lot too!

448
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,820
I understand.

449
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,820
From now on, I'll play ball

450
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,770
and focus on preparing for the recital.

451
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,540
Enough.

452
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,380
Don't give me that.

453
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,500
What you need to do now

454
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,220
is behave yourself

455
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,370
and do whatever the company says.

456
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,620
Go out.

457
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,180
Think about it yourself.

458
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,300
Mr. Ma.

459
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,900
I have an idea about my recital.

460
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,140
What's it?

461
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,300
I know a dance club

462
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,260
made up of a group of talented dancers.

463
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,580
They're in a difficult situation now.

464
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,900
I wonder

465
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,690
if I can let them perform at my recital.

466
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,660
Who will pay them?

467
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,420
They don't want money. They just need a chance.

468
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,300
Who will pay for their meals?

469
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,260
Who will pay for their costumes?

470
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,300
Who will pay for their travel expenses?

471
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,460
Alright.

472
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,020
We both need to calm down.

473
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,860
Go out now, okay?

474
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,700
Reflect on yourself.

475
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,570
Go to dinner with me tonight.

476
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,260
Mr. Ma, why is it that kind of work again?

477
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,020
That kind of work?

478
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,260
Do you think it's something enjoyable for me?

479
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,060
That kind of job?

480
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,820
That kind of job

481
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,580
can pave the way for your recital.

482
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,260
Go out and get prepared.

483
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,580
Lin Qi.

484
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,420
Lin Qi.

485
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,570
Stop playing.

486
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,300
Put the violin down.

487
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,930
Go have a drink with Ms. Chen.

488
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,610
Wait, Mr. Ma.

489
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,420
I don't drink.

490
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,620
It's okay.

491
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,780
Drinking is your work now.

492
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,220
Ms. Chen.

493
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,940
This is Lin Qi I told you about.

494
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,020
He won many awards in Europe.

495
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,820
He's a rare talent.

496
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,940
Lin, right?

497
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,540
Good. You're young and talented.

498
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,780
Come on.

499
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,140
Drink to Ms. Chen.

500
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,700
Hurry.

501
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,660
Ms. Chen.

502
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,140
Bottoms up.

503
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,100
Bottoms up.

504
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,020
Drink it all.

505
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,020
Drink it all.

506
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,660
Well, sit down.

507
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,060
Sit here.

508
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,340
Sit here.

509
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,660
Sit down.

510
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,700
Ms. Chen asked you to sit down.

511
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,490
Lin, how long have you played the violin?

512
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,140
16 years.

513
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,100
No wonder Mr. Ma keeps telling me

514
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,940
that he's found a genius violinist.

515
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,260
So it's you.

516
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,500
He insisted on me coming to this bar.

517
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,140
It's okay.

518
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,420
She's just taking photos.

519
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,700
Mr. Ma, my violin can't be touched…

520
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,860
Just a few photos.

521
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,890
Please continue.

522
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,700
In the future, I'll come to

523
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,020
all the concerts

524
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,020
where he performs.

525
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,260
Thank you for your appreciation, Ms. Chen.

526
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,140
Come on.

527
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,900
Drink to Ms. Chen again.

528
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,980
I can't drink any more, Mr. Ma.

529
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,340
Drink. Drink.

530
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,740
Ms. Chen, just take a sip if you want.

531
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,700
Cheers.

532
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,460
Bottoms up.

533
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,180
Bottoms up.

534
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,220
You can hold your liquor.

535
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,300
Yeah.

536
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,050
By the way,

537
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,980
the proposal you mentioned the other day,

538
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,220
send it to me as soon as possible.

539
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,820
My goodness, Ms. Chen.

540
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,780
I'm so excited.

541
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,580
I can't drink any more, Mr. Ma.

542
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,420
You can't refuse.

543
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,650
You need to thank Ms. Chen.

544
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,380
She's so nice to you.

545
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,460
I'll be drunk if I drink more, Mr. Ma.

546
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,010
You won't.

547
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,220
Just one more drink.

548
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,420
Ms. Chen, just take a sip.

549
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,420
Lin Qi, finish it all.

550
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,300
Okay.

551
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,700
Can I take a photo with this handsome guy?

552
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,890
Of course.

553
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,290
Thank you.

554
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,220
Let me take the photo for you.

555
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,780
Lin Qi.

556
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,020
Ms. Wang wants to take a photo with you.

557
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,060
Come on. Stand up.

558
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,620
-Thank you.
-Good.

559
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,980
Look here.

560
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,180
One, two, three.

561
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,860
What's up?

562
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,260
Brother.

563
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,380
I lost my key.

564
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,060
Are you drunk?

565
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,100
Wait for me at home.

566
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,020
You're drunk.

567
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,940
Don't hit your head.

568
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,020
Why did you drink so much?

569
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,460
It's work.

570
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
Work?

571
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,860
You're a violinist. How is drinking your work?

572
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,260
How is your recital going?

573
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,130
Don't worry.

574
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,340
It's going well.

575
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,700
My boss drank with some clients tonight

576
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,380
and brought me with him.

577
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,260
He introduced several seniors to me.

578
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,820
He said they can help me.

579
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,820
He brought you to drink with clients?

580
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,860
It's okay. Don't worry.

581
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,250
Here is your key.

582
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,100
I'll go back to the station if there's nothing else.

583
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,020
Stay safe.

584
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:00,900
What's wrong?

585
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,020
Are you having a stomachache?

586
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,180
Stay here. I'll make noodles for you.

587
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,060
Get up. The noodles are ready.

588
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,140
He's totally wasted.

589
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,780
No matter what,

590
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,260
your health comes first.

591
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:52,700
[Xu Zhiyi]

592
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,700
Boss, this is the artist information you asked for.
[Xu Zhiyi]

593
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,390
[Xu Zhiyi]

594
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,690
Do you know Zhige Entertainment?

595
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,730
Yes.

596
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,940
It's owned by the Fude Group.

597
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,340
Its head, Mr. Jiang,

598
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,980
called me

599
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,740
and said he's going to make a show about firefighting

600
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,660
and wants Xu Zhiyi on it.

601
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,620
But…

602
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,420
Although Zhige Entertainment is affiliated with the Fude Group,

603
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,540
I heard that Mr. Jiang

604
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,090
doesn't have much production experience.

605
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,140
Besides,

606
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,140
our Xu Zhiyi is quite popular now.

607
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,300
You mean

608
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,460
I shouldn't take the risk

609
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,380
to test the waters with an inexperienced young man?

610
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,330
No.

611
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,140
You've been working with me for so many years

612
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,820
but are still short-sighted.

613
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,660
Are you planning

614
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,620
to let other newcomers come on the show with Xu Zhiyi

615
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,620
to make more people know them?

616
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,180
Do you have any recommendations?

617
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,770
I recommend this one.

618
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:49,650
This.

619
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:49,940
[Nan Chu]
This.

620
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,460
[Nan Chu]

621
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,220
Nan Chu?
[Nan Chu]

622
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,260
[Nan Chu]

623
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,570
Yes.
[Nan Chu]

624
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:52,750
[Nan Chu]

625
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,300
She's a new face.

626
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,500
Compared to acting,

627
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,410
reality shows have a lower bar

628
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,580
and can easily grab people's attention.

629
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:00,860
Besides,

630
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,940
we

631
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,130
just spent a large amount of money on her.

632
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,220
I want her to start working immediately

633
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,490
and make money for the company.

634
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,540
But…

635
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,900
But I heard

636
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,780
that there's a misunderstanding

637
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,290
between Nan Chu and Mr. Jiang.

638
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,220
A misunderstanding?

639
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:23,580
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

640
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,060
Hello, Mr. Shen.

641
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,900
Come to the company now.

642
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,820
There's a show about firefighting.

643
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,100
We want you to get on it.

644
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,820
But its producer

645
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,700
is Mr. Jiang from Zhige Entertainment.

646
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,620
Mr. Jiang?

647
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,820
You know what I mean, right?

648
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,700
Jiang Ge?

649
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,860
He won't agree to it.

650
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,100
Nan Chu?

651
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,180
No.

652
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,820
But we can meet in the middle.

653
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,540
Xu Zhiyi can get on the show with another newcomer.

654
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,940
I don't mind who it is

655
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,220
as long as it's not Nan Chu.

656
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,100
Mr. Jiang.

657
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,370
I know that Nan Chu

658
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,500
has a history with you.

659
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,090
I've already criticized her.

660
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,020
But given that she's young…

661
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,220
I'm young too.

662
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,420
And I hold grudges.

663
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,490
To seek cooperation,

664
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,900
we should agree to disagree.

665
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,700
As long as both parties can benefit from it,

666
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,180
personal grudges

667
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,700
can be put aside, right?

668
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:31,700
Wrong.

669
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,380
Mr. Han.

670
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,260
I've stated my terms.

671
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,220
If you still want Nan Chu on the show,

672
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,540
I need to reconsider working with you.

673
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,330
Okay.

674
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,140
I'll have Guangzong

675
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,460
send you the list of suitable artists as soon as possible.

676
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,460
Okay, Mr. Han.

677
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,620
I'll wait for your call.

678
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,420
Okay.

679
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,660
Look at you.

680
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,620
Have you forgotten what I said to you?

681
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,660
What's the most important thing in the showbiz?

682
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,140
Keep your head down but don't lose your edge.

683
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,740
What did you do?

684
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,660
You're not famous yet

685
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,180
but made an enemy of that different guy.

686
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,380
How are you going to survive in this industry?

687
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,500
Nan Chu, come with me.

688
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,300
There are things I can't say out there.

689
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,090
After all, you're our artist.

690
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
The fact that you're refused

691
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,300
is not something I want everyone to know.

692
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,380
Sorry, Mr. Han.

693
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,460
I caused trouble to the company because of personal reasons.

694
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,900
You don't have to apologize.

695
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,620
It's not entirely your fault.

696
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,700
But besides the show,

697
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,300
you can give me other work.

698
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,140
Let me remind you.

699
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,980
To sign you,

700
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,740
we paid a large amount of signing bonus.

701
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,980
Given your situation,

702
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,540
it's already quite generous.

703
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,580
As for the reason,

704
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,100
I believe you know.

705
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,860
I do.

706
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,580
Your starting point

707
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,380
is higher than others.

708
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,940
But you won't always be so lucky.

709
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,820
You need to work hard yourself.

710
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,300
Mr. Han.

711
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:10,940
Mr. Han.

712
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,730
How about this?

713
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,490
Let me talk to Mr. Jiang again.

714
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,140
I can ask him out for a drink

715
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,980
to cheer him up.

716
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,180
You know,

717
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,260
there are always more solutions than problems.

718
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,420
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

719
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,780
But this is my problem.

720
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,540
I'll solve it myself.

721
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,220
Wait.

722
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,980
How can you solve it?

723
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,340
Mr. Han.

724
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,420
Should I contact the Fude Group

725
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,140
to exchange resources with them?

726
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:38,810
No need.

727
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,780
Select an alternative instantly.

728
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,610
If Nan Chu can't do it,

729
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,660
we'll use someone else.

730
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,220
But…

731
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,140
It must be our artist.

732
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,060
Okay. I got it.

733
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,660
Mr. Jiang.

734
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,620
Mr. Jiang.

735
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,820
Mr. Jiang.

736
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,980
She just won't go away.

737
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,820
What do you want?

738
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,380
I want to talk to you.

739
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,620
You don't need to apologize to me.

740
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,220
You're only here

741
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,810
because I'm making a show.

742
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,580
Weren't

743
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,740
you very proud back then?

744
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,820
What made you so humble now?

745
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,100
Are you bending over for capital?

746
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,090
I'm not here to apologize.

747
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,940
I don't think I did anything wrong back then.

748
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,020
Let's go.

749
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,140
Wait.

750
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,660
After that matter made its way to China,

751
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,060
stories were made up

752
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,540
and had a negative impact on you and your family.

753
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,100
I'm sorry about that.

754
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,900
If you think it's necessary,

755
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,340
I can make a statement

756
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,220
to reveal the truth…

757
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,180
No need for that.

758
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:37,940
It's water under the bridge.

759
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,140
As I said,

760
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,940
anyone can be on Flaming Youth but you.

761
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,460
Whether it's personal or not,

762
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,100
I really need this job.

763
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,500
For Dream Dance, I need this chance.

764
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,620
What is Dream Dance?

765
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,820
It's my dance club.

766
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,180
No wonder the name is so tacky.

767
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,580
Don't waste your time here.

768
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,260
Leave now.

769
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:57,940
Mr. Jiang.

770
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,660
You can give me this chance

771
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,900
and take it as a test for me.

772
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,540
If you really want to make a great show,

773
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,980
I think I'm your best choice.

774
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,140
Why is that?

775
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,900
What is your advantage?

776
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,700
Xu Zhiyi is very popular now.

777
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,780
She has a lot of fans.

778
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,020
What have you got?

779
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,540
You can only dance.

780
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,770
This show is about firefighting, not dancing.

781
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,580
Indeed, I can only dance,

782
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,540
but I had a special experience with firemen.

783
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,700
I was in a fire five years ago.

784
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,980
A firefighter saved me.

785
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,740
If it weren't for him, I would've died.

786
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,690
He saved my life.

787
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,180
So what?

788
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,060
So I have special feelings

789
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,940
towards firefighting and firefighters.

790
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,360
I have a different understanding of fire and rescue.

791
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,420
Mr. Jiang.

792
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,140
You said you want a show that has no scripts

793
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,860
and is not for entertainment.

794
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,020
You want it to be like a documentary.

795
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,060
I have a real experience of being saved from a fire.

796
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,260
Isn't that great?

797
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,500
I hope you can give it a second thought.

798
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,580
I'll keep trying until the last second.

799
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,860
Even if I can't be on the show,

800
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,900
I hope it can be a success,

801
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,620
because those heroes deserve to be known.

802
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,620
Thank you, Mr. Jiang, for hearing me out.

803
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,300
That's all I want to say.

804
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,620
Goodbye.

805
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:33,980
Mr. Jiang.

806
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,060
Why did you let her lecture you?

807
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,540
You talk too much. Drive.

808
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,220
Okay.

809
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,180
Who should we choose

810
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,660
to replace her?

811
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,580
These are all not good enough.

812
00:33:59,260 --> 00:33:59,860
Hello.

813
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,340
Mr. Jiang.

814
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,260
How can I help you?

815
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,210
Hello, Mr. Han.

816
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,140
How did you

817
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,900
sign Nan Chu?

818
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,100
She's my friend's daughter.

819
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,980
I think she has potential,

820
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,060
so I signed her.

821
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,220
What do you think?

822
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,610
Can you have her

823
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,860
on your show?

824
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,540
If

825
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,020
all the artists on the show are from your company,

826
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,540
can you give me more support

827
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,940
in terms of related resources?

828
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,970
If you agree,

829
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,180
I can consider using her.

830
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,220
Of course.

831
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,780
If you refuse,

832
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,210
I'll insist on using someone else.

833
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,220
No problem.

834
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,300
No problem.

835
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,540
It's a deal then.

836
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,180
Okay.

837
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,820
What did he say?

838
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,100
He agreed.

839
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,050

Deputy Yu.

846
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,620
Assistant Liu, do you want to go to the supply depot?

847
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,300
No!

848
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,620
Something's wrong.

849
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,620
Yeah. Assistant Liu seems to be in a bad mood.

850
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,540
Recently, the director and instructor

851
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,020
have been weird too.

852
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,340
Let's just keep quiet.

Let's go.

What's wrong with you these days?

861
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,780
I don't eat with deserters.

862
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,460
You don't know, do you?

863
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,660
Deputy Yu

864
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,700
is about to leave.

865
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,820
He's written his resignation.

866
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,700
He's been keeping it from us.

867
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,660
We've been colleagues for so many years

868
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,820
yet he's going to leave without telling us.

869
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:21,900
Liu.

870
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,140
Don't talk to me.

871
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,260
I admit,

872
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,740
I wanted to resign,

873
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,780
but I don't want to be a deserter.

874
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,020
I just miss my child.

875
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,780
I wasn't there when Miaomiao was born.

876
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,500
Every time she got sick,

877
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,060
I couldn't be there for her.

878
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,140
Every time she called me Dad

879
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,380
on the phone,

880
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,100
I felt very sad.

881
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,740
I know.

882
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,940
Although my wife complains a lot about it,

883
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,820
it's because of her support

884
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,300
that I can work here

885
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,930
with you guys.

886
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,580
I owe them too much.

887
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,820
Maybe I'm too greedy.

Stop playing.

What does this mean?

923
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,900
Nothing.

Make it clear,

-Stop.

Don't take bribes.

938
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,020
I didn't.

Then pay him for it.

945
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,300
N-No.

946
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,220
No need for that.

947
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,700
He's an old friend.

948
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,090
It's about the principal.

949
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:43,740
Okay.

950
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,300
I've transferred the money to you.

951
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,700
Keep the extra.

952
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,020
You…

953
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,100
Okay. I'll pay him later.

954
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:51,820
Go.

955
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,300
By the way,

956
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,660
I've heard that Yu may leave.

957
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,010
Is it true?

958
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,780
We've worked together for so many years.

959
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,250
I'm gonna miss him.

960
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,100
But I can understand him.

961
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,620
Yu is competent.

962
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,930
He can earn money anywhere.

963
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,820
I'm different.

964
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,010
Dagang.

965
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,050
How is your family?

966
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,060
Are your wife and child all right?

967
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,050
Yeah.

968
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,100
We're just fretting over choosing a school for our son.

969
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,020
Everything else is fine.

970
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,100
Tell us if you need any help.

971
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:32,900
Okay.

972
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:34,980
I'll send it over now.
